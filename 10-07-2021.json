According to Private University Act 2010, clause 17(e), the government is supposed to nominate an educator or a philomath for the syndicate. The response, however, was beyond our expectation, and quite telling of a silent \"move\" of bureaucratisation that is going to have a lasting impact, not only on academia, but also on our society.\nProf Shamsuzzaman Khan, the former President and Chairman of Bangla Academy, was on our Board of Syndicate at the time of his death on April 14, 2021. But a circular of the Ministry of Education dated January 7, 2021, showed that he had been already replaced by a certain Joint Secretary of the College Division. The Ministry was evidently waiting for his tenure to be over before breaking the news to us. The circular shows a long list of education ministry officials who will, from now on, represent the government in the category of renowned academics or philomaths in the syndicate boards of all private universities. Each joint secretary and additional secretary of the ministry has been assigned to five to seven universities.\nAs someone who has been teaching for over 28 years, I have seen how the presence of a noted academic in the apex body allows a university to shape its academic policies and leadership. The wisdom and experience of senior faculty members is now being replaced by the paper chains of some professionals who are legendary for slowing things down. Besides, these officers already have a lot on their plates: they are responsible for millions of students in the secondary and the higher secondary system. How much time can these officers spare for the five to seven universities to which they have been assigned? How much orientation they have on the tertiary system is soon to be seen. Isn't there a government sanctioned grants commission to look after universities? I am sure all the designated syndicate members are brilliant officers with immaculate career records\u2014but do they all qualify as \"academicians or philomaths\", as mentioned in the particular clause of the 2010 Act? Even from the government's perspective, if the intention is to have eyes and ears on the ground, this could have been better served by members of civil society who seem to have an affinity towards them. I am just curious what rationale there could be behind such a decision.\nAlready, with the introduction of quality assurance in the universities funded by the World Bank, we are noting the implementation of a bureaucratic system that suffocates academic freedom in favour of a greater centralised and hierarchical organisational structure that puts emphasis on top-down management, with decreased local autonomy for departments. Some cumbersome and intrusive procedures are introduced to monitor the paper trails of teaching and learning. University teachers are now required to fill out 14 forms for every course: Lesson Plan, Class Monitor Form (CR selection form), Class Attendance Sheet, Midterm Question Paper, Final Question Paper, Midterm Exam Scripts of low, average and highest score (checked, commented and marked), Final Exam Scripts of low, average and highest score (checked, commented and marked), Midterm Exam Attendance Sheet, Final Exam Attendance Sheet, Semester Course Report, Course Session Report, Make Up Class, Student Excused Absence Form and Course Closing Checklist.\nI give you the long list to give you an understanding of the international bureaucracy that has crept into the local system. Bureaucratisation of academic institutions is a contentious issue. Somehow, we have been colonised with the idea of big data that can be converted into parameters needed for university accreditation and ranking. Unless we comply, we are told that our degrees won't be recognised.\nThe growing status of bureaucracy led me to a government project, titled, \"Strengthening Government through Capacity Development of the BCS Cadre Officials (3rd Revised)\". According to this project, between 2009 and 2019, the government spent a total of Taka 33,853.69 lakh on sending BCS officers for foreign Master's degrees in fields that would help the government attain its Millennium Development Goals. The allocation was initially Tk 60 lakh for an officer who would like to pursue higher studies. The third revised budget revised the ceiling to Tk 383.82 lakh per officer per degree. Seventy percent of the fund has been earmarked for BCS officers, and 30 percent for project-related officials.\nAn MA here in a public university is virtually free or heavily subsidised. At a topmost private university, such a degree for 12-18 months should not cost more than two to three lakh Taka. Of course, I am not going to say that a North American or UK degree of the world's top 300 universities is equivalent to ours. However, in most prestigious postgraduate programmes, there are adequate research and teaching funds for which MA students can apply. If an officer has academic interest and the competency for higher studies, they can apply for a fund at any university of their choice. Why pay over three crore Taka of taxpayers' money for the degree of an individual? With what projected outcome? To increase their negotiation skills and bargaining skills as laid out by the project proposal? To make them better policy makers? Needless to say, the policy paper too came from international consultants who have made sure that our money is spent abroad.\nWe frequently scoff our students for paying negligible fees at a public university, for having their tea and snacks at a subsidised rate. If we really want to make a difference, we need to invest in our rickety higher education system. Follow the Bhutan model where they give merit-based scholarships to university students for studying abroad, making sure that they return to the home country as human capital. If the government really wants to attain the Millennium Development Goals, spend on research and development. Invest that three crore Taka to create laboratories or libraries in each university. Invest in creating better teachers. Instead of one student, you will have many students applying for the public service examinations. Water the roots, not the shoots. By the time these officers are doing their degrees, they are already mid-level in their career paths. With 10 to 15 years left in their services, the overseas degrees will simply enrich the portfolios of these officers and assist their post-retirement plans. The nation is unlikely to get any real benefit out of it. Whereas with such amounts of money, the government could have easily asked local universities to bring in contractual adjunct professors from top universities to run workshops, summer courses, master classes or degree programmes which will benefit not one, but many.\nI give the example of the self-catering project of bureaucracy to map its emerging tentacles. There is a syndicate out there that is creeping into our syndicates.\n\u00a0\nShamsad Mortuza is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), and a professor of English at Dhaka University (on leave).\n",

        "full_article": "A couple of months ago, while I was sitting at a station for the bus service in Queensland Australia, I received a phone call. The caller told me, \"I am calling from Harvard University. Do you want to register for the online programme on Cybersecurity you were interested in?\" and proceeded to give me more details. I was a bit surprised to receive that call. Similarly, I was interested in the Master of Science in Data Analytics online from the University of New South Wales, Australia and their educational adviser reached out to me several times a month. Later, I started my second Masters in Data Analytics online from the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA while residing in Australia.\nOnce, people went to universities for education, but now the motive has shifted partially, and the universities are approaching people with a diverse set of education programmes. This is referred to as Online Digital Education. Bangladesh has made remarkable progress digitally in different sectors, but not as much in online digital education as expected. The country is yet to mark its presence in the global online education industry, which is estimated to be worth USD 375 billion by 2026. It could easily be the third biggest source of earning revenues after remittance and the garments industry if this sector is given due importance and carefully visioned policies. Now is the right time for our policymakers to rethink online digital education policy and facilitate prominent institutions to excel in today's transnational education system as a Brand of Education Bangladesh.\nLet's start by understanding digital learning, which can be defined as any type of learning that is accompanied by ICTs or by instructional practice that makes effective use of it. From this perspective, blended or online learning can also be referred to as digital learning, as this type of learning is not possible without ICTs. However, shifting from traditional face-to-face education to online is not an easy journey for many institutions across the world during the pandemic\u2014a bunch of challenges in terms of digital competencies, pedagogical knowledge, psycho-social counselling, varied levels of interaction, engagement and assessment strategies, support structures, etc. are required to be integrated into institutional policies and practices. Unfortunately, many of our educational institutions failed to adapt to these challenges to some extent but often attributed this failure to online digital education. What are the key reasons behind it?\nThe first is opposition to the idea of \"learning how to unlearn\". Professor Chris Dede from Harvard University attended a summit at Daffodil University in March 2021 and advised the audience that learning how to unlearn is the biggest challenge worldwide for transforming education digitally. Human beings always oppose those cultures they are not habituated to. Since the beginning of civilisation, teachers are accustomed to traditional face-to-face education. It is not easy to shift away from it overnight and learn new modes of teaching-learning.\nThe second obstacle is poor speed of the Internet. This is the issue largely affecting the wide acceptance and implementation of digital education in the developing and least developed countries. Bangladesh ranked 134th in the world for mobile speeds and 96th for fixed broadband speeds in May 2021. The country's broadband Internet density is quite low, though narrowband mobile Internet has penetrated most parts of the country. However, the Internet speed is moderately poor and not at all satisfactory for operating education digitally. Minimum 3G stable Internet needs to be ensured across the country.\nThen there is a negative perception of the community\u2014people often perceive that online digital education is useless and it is possible to get certificates without any study. While pursuing my second masters online, I found it more challenging to perform well. Admittedly, the issue is not with online digital education but rather on the provider's trustworthiness. Online degrees provided by Stanford University won't be the same as Stamford University.\nSocioeconomic conditions also play a role here. Studies reveal that only 10-15 percent of university students have laptops or PCs in Bangladesh. Due to the pandemic, many parents have been laid off, students lost their part-time work, and female students have been forced to encounter the plague of early marriage. This situation is further aggravated by the high cost of fairly poor Internet. Government support is urgently required to overcome this situation.\nThe absence of an authentic examination system in online education is another big challenge, resulting in poor community perception. Reputed universities focus largely on formative assessment instead of summative exams and consider only a few courses (two to three out of 12) of a programme for formal exams. Research indicates that more than 90 percent of students have at least an Android device in Bangladesh. So, mobile-based online exam proctoring could be a viable solution.\nAnother challenge is the absence of suitable software solution and relevant human resources. We have grown up using pirated software and are often reluctant to invest money for suitable software. The country's two leading universities provided institutional emails to their students only last year. The situation deteriorates further due to a lack of qualified manpower for maintenance and support 24/7.\nThen there is the issue of lack of commitment to accountability. Online digital education creates evidence of work digitally. So, if we can ensure teachers' accountability to submit a monthly report through Smart Education, like software comprising a rubric of eight to ten aspects including student feedback, research work, professional training, students' engagement, overall presentation, etc., it can result in better quality education than what we do in traditional face-to-face learning.\nHowever, there is a pressing need for support structure. As we have not progressed much in digital education, certain things have not yet been introduced, such as learning designers and technologists. Learning designers sit with the course teacher and design the course keeping in mind outcome-based education, presentation, interactive videos and assessment, while learning technologists organise the course at the learning management system and provide necessary training to teachers and students. In the absence of them, teachers consider conducting online classes a relatively difficult task.\nUnwillingness regarding continuous professional development is another fact. There is no alternative to continuous professional development to reduce the gap of industry and academic practices, as well as to develop professional ethics. Unfortunately, our teachers are highly reluctant in this regard, and it should be included in the provisions of annual increment and/or promotion.\nFinally, the lack of executable policies and visible practices hinders the development of online education in Bangladesh. The University Grants Commission has recently initiated the National Framework for Blended Learning to help continue our education digitally. Monitoring compliance requirements of universities with transparency, particularly for online digital learning, is the key to ensure quality education.\nNow that all walks of people in Bangladesh are understanding the importance of online digital learning, we should capitalise on it. If online education is comprehended appropriately, we won't have to discontinue education, teachers won't have to search odd jobs for their survival, and students won't feel dejected. The world is becoming increasingly digital, and the educational institutions that can't embrace digitalisation will be gradually excluded. The sooner we realise that, the better.\n\u00a0\nDr Md Aktaruzzaman is digital education expert and director at the Blended Learning Center in Daffodil International University, Dhaka, and founding head of ICT and Education dept(s) at Bangabandhu Digital University.

        "full_article": "Politics, particularly electoral politics, in India is as much about public perception as about the quality of governance. This comes out quite clearly in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's major expansion of his council of ministers and reshuffle of portfolios on Wednesday night.\nThe exercise\u2014the first since Modi returned to power for a second successive tenure as PM in May 2019\u2014saw 36 new ministers coming in, four high-profile senior ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders getting the axe, seven junior ministers being elevated to the cabinet rank, and seven women rewarded with ministerial berths. However, the big four portfolios and the people helming them remain unaffected by the reshuffle\u2014the Ministers of Home (Amit Shah), Defence (Rajnath Singh), Foreign Affairs (S Jaishankar) and Finance (Nirmala Sitharaman).\nIn the hugely diverse mosaic of Indian society where national elections and state-level polls follow each other in quick succession, the poll politics of a national party like the BJP is always at the back of its mind. The party needs to get its caste, age, gender and regional calculus right in its organisational structure and shape the ministerial council, whether at the central or state level. Equally significant is the need to deliver in terms of governance. Modi tried to strike a balance between all these factors in his mega cabinet reboot to deal with severe criticism, both at home and abroad, as the country emerges from a devastating second wave of Covid-19 ahead of key elections in five states in the next couple of years, followed by the most crucial parliamentary poll in 2024.\nIn the run up to Modi's anointment as PM in 2014, he had repeatedly and passionately talked about \"minimum government and maximum governance\". Whatever way one interprets that, the fact is that numerically, the strength of his council of ministers today is 77\u2014nearly half of whom are new. As India emerges from the battering of the pandemic's second wave and economic slide, which started much before that, it is the quality rather than the numerical factor that will matter. Modi clearly has a challenge at hand.\u00a0\nThree main features of the revamp of the council of ministers stand out: Modi has gone for a much younger look, with the average age of ministers coming down to 57 from 61 years; he has junked seniority in the party as the sole yardstick by dropping a number of senior ministers who are also BJP veterans like Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar, and brought in that of educational qualifications in choosing his refurbished team of ministerial colleagues; and he has done caste arithmetic ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Gujarat, Tripura and Karnataka next year. Though going for a more youthful look, Modi has also kept in mind the need for experienced administrators. That is why he also brought in his cabinet former chief ministers Sarbananda Sonowal of Assam and Narayan Rane of Maharashtra, and former central minister under the Congress government Jyotiraditya Scindia.\u00a0\nThe fact that 20 percent of the ministers in the council had been dropped before Wednesday's expansion sent out the message that it was performance-linked. The departure of Harsh Vardhan as health minister was on the back of a huge public outcry against the Modi government's handling of the oxygen crisis during the second wave of Covid-19, in the run up to which the pace of setting up oxygen plants slowed down and ventilators bought through the PM CARES fund could not be used in many hospitals due to the shortage of trained manpower. What came as a little surprising is the exit of Prasad, who was seen as the main force behind the government's new rules for multinational social media platforms like Twitter, which opposed the rules, and Facebook.\nThat caste equations were also a major consideration for Modi, keeping in view electoral needs in UP and Gujarat, is underlined by the fact that he inducted 27 people belonging to the Other Backward Class (OBC) on Wednesday into the 78-strong ministerial council, with the idea of involving smaller communities in a bid to counter the BJP's main rivals like the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in UP, and Congress in Gujarat. The inclusion of 27 OBC ministers shrinks the caste bias in favour of the representation of forward castes in the government. It is the politically powerful and populous OBC, to which Modi himself belongs, that the BJP is hoping to rely on to retain its support base.\nThe BJP is keen to woo non-Yadav castes like Kurmis in UP, and it is reflected by the induction of Anupriya Patel of ally Apna Dal and RCP Singh of Janata Dal (United). That it is also trying to reach out to the numerically powerful Yadav caste is demonstrated by the accommodation of senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav from UP, Annapurna Yadav from Jharkhand, and Dalit Virender Kumar from Madhya Pradesh in the ministerial council, in which the presence of people from Scheduled Tribes has also gone up by eight.\nThe caste equation was also very much in play in the elevation of Mansukh Mandaviya and Parshotam Rupala from minister of state to cabinet status. Both belong to the electorally decisive Patidar community of Modi's home state of Gujarat where assembly polls are due next year. The BJP is mindful of how it got a hard-fought victory in the previous polls in Gujarat in 2017.\nThe cabinet reboot has also seen some people with professional backgrounds and PhDs and MBA degrees getting in. The most prominent in the technocrat-bureaucrat category is the presence of former Indian Administrative Service officer from Odisha Ashini Vaishnaw, who had quit government service to join the corporate sector before venturing into politics. Holding M.Tech and MBA degrees, Vaishnaw has been brought in as a cabinet minister and given charge of two key portfolios\u2014Railway, and Telecom and IT. Another MBA-holding new inductee in the ministerial council is Anupriya Patel, the Lok Sabha MP from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh who before plunging into politics, had worked as a professor at a private university.\nKeeping in mind the large number of the women electorate, seven women were inducted in the ministerial council this time, pushing up the total number of women to 11, one of the highest ever. When the Modi cabinet took oath in 2019, it was criticised for low representation of women, with only three cabinet ministers and three ministers of state. There were nine women in the first Modi government from 2014-2019, including six in the cabinet.\nLastly, the drafting in of four BJP lawmakers from West Bengal\u2014two of them from the northern part of the state where the saffron party has so far successfully resisted the efforts of Trinamool Congress\u2014also shows the Modi-led party's intention to stick to its elusive state dream. Only the politically-na\u00efve had expected the BJP to win the recent assembly poll in Bengal, the party top leadership's hype in the run up to the election notwithstanding.\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent of The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "It bears repeating that vaccines are essential for protection against the deadly coronavirus. We've seen how the virus spares no one and targets the most vulnerable people, including those who have pre-existing health conditions or comorbidities. Unfortunately, the vaccines for Covid-19 that came out last year have remained out of reach for another group of \"vulnerable\" population\u2014i.e. the billions of inhabitants living in developing countries. It has been over seven months since the coronavirus vaccine was first administered in the UK, and while more than 3 billion people have received at least one shot since then, a meagre percentage of them are in low-income countries. The haunting prospect of \"vaccine apartheid\" has raised its ugly head now. The question is, how do we prevent this from festering?\nAmartya Sen, the Nobel-prize winning economist, had warned more than three decades ago that famines don't happen because of shortages of food, rather due to institutional and structural weaknesses. If we were to apply his Entitlement theory in case of vaccine inequities, we can see some parallels. The sole responsibility for vaccine apartheid cannot be placed on the rich countries and drug manufacturers; some of the blame also lies with the governments of poorer countries. To use Sen's logic, an abundance of supply does not guarantee access, or what is known as \"effective demand\". If the goal of vaccination is to reach the arms that need them, we must find a pathway to get doses of vaccines from point A to point B. In this instance, point A is the production facility, and B is the outstretched arm of the recipient.\u00a0\nIn my preliminary research on the topic of vaccine apartheid, I discovered three facts.\nFirst: The term \"apartheid\" has been used very loosely since its origin in South Africa. If one goes back to the first use of this label in the context of the practice of discrimination against non-whites in that country, one cannot ignore the fact that apartheid implies some degree of intentional segregation. In South Africa, the word \"apartheid\" means \"apartness\" in Afrikaans, and was used to describe the unique oppression and wrongdoing inflicted on its own people. According to some activists, weaponising this word for political purposes ought to be avoided.\u00a0 The main reasons for maldistribution of vaccines are cost, lack of infrastructure, and absence of planning.\nSecond: There is sufficient data to show that there is indeed vaccine inequality. Higher and upper-middle income countries have secured 6 billion out of the 8.2 billion doses available as of March 2021. In an analysis from the Global Health Innovation Center at Duke University in Durham, the researchers aggregated publicly announced forecasts from vaccine makers, which add up to around 12 billion doses by the end of the year. Once again, more than 80 percent of these are destined for wealthier nations.\nThird: African countries have had the worse of the deal. They are poor, have a rickety healthcare system, and suffer from bad governance. The third wave of the pandemic comes at a perilous time. \"Medical supplies have been depleted, doctors are physically and mentally exhausted, and in some cases, unpaid, and hospitals are turning patients away for lack of beds and oxygen,\" according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Delta variant has been identified in at least 13 of the continent's 54 countries.\nThus, it is abundantly clear that the distribution of Covid vaccines is unequal and African countries are getting the short end of the stick, but the use of the term \"apartheid\" does not enhance the cause of the \"vaccine have-nots\". What is needed is a global effort to strengthen the vaccine distribution network to launch a glitch-free operation to deliver the jabs where they are most needed, in Africa, Latin America and South Asia.\nVaccine roadblocks\nGlobal vaccine distribution has already hit several roadblocks. COVAX announced on June 24 that it now projects it can supply less than 1.9 billion doses this year, down from the original target of 2 billion. The shortfall comes because the Serum Institute of India has redirected its production to domestic customers. So far, COVAX has only contributed about 90 million doses, far short of its original plans.\nPreviously, Gavi officials were optimistic that in the midst of global shortage, there was excess supply in a few countries, and they announced that \"rich countries like the USA are expected to help fill the gap\". Unfortunately, all this is easier said than done. The richer countries have kept the surplus for emergency purposes, including a new wave of infections, the Delta Plus variant, booster shots, etc.\nHealth experts point out that campaigns that have been most successful in delivering doses are in countries\u2014such as Angola\u2014that have been best prepared by mapping vulnerable populations, screening people and scheduling appointments in advance. This is lacking in most developing countries.\nThese are bad omens for other poor countries, from Africa to Latin America, Asia and the Caribbean, where the same issues have been replicated. On top of not finding enough doses, there have been logistical difficulties with delivery, problems involving healthcare infrastructure and, in some countries, public hesitancy towards vaccines. Andrea Taylor, who led a research team at Duke University, adds, \"Supply chains could break down and countries could threaten to block vaccine exports.\" And all this is already happening, with India and the European Union having announced restrictions on vaccine exports.\nIt was well-known from the onset of the Covid vaccine rollout programme that distribution would be iniquitous. Since the government of the USA and a few other rich countries funded the research and deployment of the vaccine, there was an understanding that once vaccines were ready, a handful of countries would initially be the beneficiary of the campaign. Poorer countries would get the leftovers.\nHowever, as the vaccination programme rolled out, the scenario has turned rather grim. Once the Delta variant spread from India across the globe, the developing countries who were waiting for the generosity of richer countries, or the altruistic instincts of pharmaceutical companies, now found that \"their economy would remain stuck in the muck for at least another two years if not more, and the vaccine diplomacy would turn into another version of the new cold war\".\nA plan for the future: global and local actions\nThe WHO chief noted that vaccine inequity could be resolved by sharing financial resources to fully fund the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, sharing doses with COVAX, and sharing technology to scale up the manufacturing of vaccines. The advantages of putting vaccine manufacturing in the hands of the Global South would save lives, prevent vaccine-resistant, more lethal variants, and give people control over their own destiny rather than making them beg multinational corporations and elite philanthropists for their very lives. A case in point: US officials said that while the US-produced doses are ready, deliveries have been delayed due to US and the recipient countries' legal, logistical and regulatory requirements. \"What we've found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply\u2014we have plenty of doses to share with the world\u2014but this is a Herculean logistical challenge,'' said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.\nThe British PM Boris Johnson recently promised to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022. But here's the rub. The total requirement of vaccines is 11 billion doses, which also means USD 16 billion more is needed this year, and upward of USD 30 billion in 2022.\nTo reach the goal set by the British PM requires a ramping up of manufacturing, allocation, and distribution of vaccines. Apart from the scale and complexity of the task, another risk is corruption. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has identified several weak points in the distribution chain in developing countries and sent out an alarm to the governments to take necessary actions.\nIn addition, to prevent major hiccups during the vaccination process as experienced by India, governments could take the following initiatives: 1) Create a specialised committee to oversee emergency funds and vaccine deployment; 2) Have a transparent and accountable public emergency procurement process during the pandemic, which can be fostered through open contracting and e-procurement; 3) Maintain storage and distribution systems to mitigate corruption risks; 4) Develop transparent criteria for priority vaccine recipients and provide public information about vaccine programmes; 5) Conduct corruption risk assessments; and 6) Strengthen civil society participation and protect journalists and whistleblowers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDr Abdullah Shibli is an economist, currently serving as a Senior Research Fellow at the International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI), a think-tank based in Boston, USA.\n",

        "full_article": "Large social and economic crises are usually followed by increases in human trafficking and exploitation. There is no reason to believe that the Covid-19 pandemic will be any different in Bangladesh. There are already clear signs of growing vulnerability in communities. Taking informed action now could disrupt trafficking patterns before borders and movement return to normal later in 2021.\nBefore the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Bangladesh and West Bengal were already growing hubs for human trafficking. West Bengal accounted for some 55 percent of reported cases of trafficking in India in 2016, and over 50,000 Bangladeshi children and women are trafficked to India every year, largely into West Bengal, primarily for sexual exploitation. In addition, the Bangladesh-India border is 4,000-km long and often unfenced. This situation is likely to be worsened by the pandemic.\nThe Ebola epidemic of 2013-2016 in West Africa saw a correlation between families broken up by the impacts of the virus and an uptick in the exploitation of women and girls. In Bangladesh, the impact of Covid-19 has led to a significant rise in vulnerability in poor communities through 2020. In 2018-19, the poverty rate was 20.5 percent; this increased to 29.5 percent by June 2020. Those who were already vulnerable before the pandemic are now being joined by the \"newly vulnerable\", people whose livelihoods and income have been damaged by the pandemic. An increase in vulnerability will lead to an increase in risk taking. As a recent BRAC research paper reminds us, \"if the need and poverty are great enough, and not addressed, people will ... migrate no matter the risks, known or unknown.\" For the poorest, severe economic shocks lead to scarcity of jobs, food, and money, and push people into irregular migration and related forms of exploitation.\nBRAC is undertaking a pilot project in Jashore (on the western Bangladesh border with India) to test interventions focused on reducing the trafficking of children especially girls and women aged 12-30 in vulnerable communities. There have been a number of key findings about the damaging impacts of Covid-19 on communities.\nDuring the lockdown, there were significant job losses, particularly for those in the informal sector (day labourers, rickshaw pullers, small business owners). As the economy reopens, there has been growing competition for available work; many migrant workers who were previously working overseas have now returned to Bangladesh\u2014The Daily Star reported that over 500,000 migrants had returned by March 2021. There has also been a trend of internal migration from urban to rural areas as people return to their villages after losing their jobs. BRAC said they have observed a significant rise in gender-based violence, particularly during the lockdown. It also draws links between lockdown, frustration, anxiety, and a wider increase in violence in the country. At the local level, a number of important services have been disrupted.\nThe closure of courts from March to September in 2020 has increased the backlog of cases (a backlog that already stood at 3.5 million pending cases). There is also less oversight at the local level, and important local bodies such as Counter-Trafficking Committees (CTCs) are not necessarily carrying out their duties due to the lockdown.\nThese issues are all likely to increase the chances of people being trafficked; adults without income or support or experiencing violence are more likely to pursue dangerous or unreliable job offers themselves or to send their children into risky and unsafe work. Equally, children with fewer supports are more vulnerable to traffickers, especially when many schools have been closed, particularly girls aged 14-16 who are ordinarily vulnerable to school dropout and trafficking.\nEvidence points to ongoing trafficking activities, possibly preparatory work to identify victims for a later date when cross-border movement becomes easier. Middlemen have reportedly been very active lately in communities. Since the border is closed between Bangladesh and India to all but international trade, it is very hard to secure visas for crossings into West Bengal (a common way to \"legally\" transport trafficking victims into India). Much trafficking activity will likely have been driven out to the unfenced border or online. Recent reports point to a growth in the use of social media platforms like TikTok in the recruitment and grooming of victims.\nMost experts think that we are in a moment of uncertainty. There is limited data, and the impacts of the pandemic on trafficking patterns are yet to be observed. But they all agree that a surge in vulnerability will lead to a large growth in trafficking in the coming months.\nThere are also new and emerging patterns of trafficking. An official from Stop the Traffik, a campaign coalition fighting to prevent human trafficking worldwide, sees a growth of trafficking of Bangladeshis and the Rohingya into Malaysia, and BRAC warns of growing internal trafficking in Bangladesh. BRAC's findings in Jashore are representative of wider growth, evolution and change in trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable and minority groups across South Asia. While responsible organisations will continue to remain vigilant and respond to the changing context, communities, law enforcement and the government in Bangladesh and India, as well as the international community, will all need to cooperate if they are to disrupt new trafficking patterns and minimise the adverse effects of Covid-19 on cross-border trafficking in South Asia.\n\u00a0\nPatrick Mostyn is the Programmes Partnerships Manager for Asia, BRAC UK.\n",
