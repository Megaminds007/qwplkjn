The Court had also, a few months ago, extended the working tenure of the Justice Gita Mittal-led Committee supervising the investigations related to the violence and also humanitarian assistance and relief in the State. Ideally, these steps should not have been under the aegis of the Court and, instead, under the remit of the executive governments \u2014 in this case, the State and the Union Home Ministry. But the violent imagery of sexual violence, the wanton destruction of property, including places of worship, and the continuing hostility between the State\u2019s two ethnic groups had forced the Court\u2019s hand into foraying into a supervisory role through the Justice Mittal Committee. It has also become an imperative for the higher judiciary, first, because of the remarkable reticence of the Union government in answering questions from civil society and the political Opposition related to the situation in the State, and second, due to the lack of accountability by the misfiring State government that has been ineffective in bridging the ethnic gap. Even political representatives from the same parties have been split on ethnic lines and there seems little convergence in the political demands being made by the opposite camps.There is also the rise of non-state actors, armed with sophisticated weapons \u2014 many of which are looted from the State armouries \u2014 exercising their illegal writ on the political process. They have also been engaged in violent acts in places such as Jiribam, which did not see any ethnic conflagrations earlier. Manipur\u2019s tragic descent into ethnic hostilities receives national attention only when the scale of the violence is horrifying and reaches unconscionable levels. Despite the government averring that it is taking steps to restore the rule of law and addressing the political differences, a return to the status quo ante before May 2023 seems far away. The Court\u2019s renewed attention is, therefore, welcome, but shorn of meaningful steps to reverse the spiral of hostilities, this exercise would remain incomplete. The government\u2019s attorneys have also sought to retain a veil of secrecy over the committee\u2019s functioning and findings using the tired rhetoric of \u201cnational security\u201d. The Court should not pay heed to this ploy which seems more a case of seeking to divert attention than helping to find meaningful solutions to the conflict. Across the world, conflict resolution has focused on mechanisms such as \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d exercises which have privileged accountability and normative actions, something that remains absent in Manipur. The Committee\u2019s findings may provide the necessary push in the right direction.

        "full_article": "The Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat, has enforced punishment for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, and colleagues for the alleged mistakes they committed when they were in power from 2007 to 2017. The punishment has been both religious and political in nature, which is a disturbing collapse of the essential wall between the two spheres. Mr. Badal survived an assassination attempt while performing penance at the Golden Temple, the central place of worship for Sikhs, on December 4. The Akal Takht\u2019s punishments for religious misconduct are the accepted norm for practising Sikhs and, as such, are within the realm of faith and custom. However, Mr. Badal\u2019s actions that drew the scrutiny of the Akal Takht were not strictly about his faith, and at the very least, overlapped with his political role as Deputy Chief Minister and beyond. The religious authority also pushed for his ouster as SAD president, and issued directions to the party to set up a committee to initiate a membership drive and hold elections for office-bearers within six months. The SAD is a registered political party regulated by the law of the country and the Election Commission of India. That it bends to religious writs is disconcerting for the polity.India\u2019s legal framework and constitutional principles emphasise secularism, which is reflected in how political parties are regulated. The direct intervention of any religious body in political decisions and affairs of political parties could send the wrong signals on adherence to the Constitution\u2019s secular principles. The SAD has been going through a challenging phase following its poor electoral run in the 2022 Assembly and 2024 general elections. It has lost its traditional support base and needs to reimagine its politics to stay relevant in Punjab. The SAD\u2019s strategy to revive its fortunes is a return to its pre-1996 \u2018panthic\u2019 (Sikh) agenda. But this is a tricky route. There are disturbing signs of a potential revival of extremism among Sikhs, which will do no good to the community or the country. There are global actors that want to reignite the embers of the long-dead \u2018Khalistan\u2019 movement. The assassination bid on Mr. Badal yet again revealed the existence of radical elements willing to resort to violence. The SAD has had a moderating effect on the Sikh community, offering its members a platform for their religious and secular concerns. An effective takeover of the party by the Akal Takht is harmful for both, and the larger polity.

        "full_article": "Because the world-girdling system is inherently fragile\nWhen Covid first struck in China, the supply chain buckled \u2013 the links connecting farms, factories and distribution centres to households and businesses. How the World Ran Out of Everything: Inside the Global Supply Chain by Peter S Goodman examines the global supply chain, threatened by natural risks, geopolitics, and the inherent instability of the set-up.\nAfter China joined WTO, industrial capacity shifted wholesale to it. With ready labour, raw materials, components, manufacturing knowhow, ports and logistics, it\u2019s where most physical things are made. And it changed both capital and labour. American executives could avoid paying middle-class wages to their workers, and hoard the savings, benefitting investors.\nThen came Toyota\u2019s idea of lean manufacturing and \u2018just in time\u2019 production. Companies cut warehouse costs to the bone, made the workforce flexible, making their return on assets look good on the books. So rock-bottom prices at Walmart meant lost domestic jobs, Chinese labour was exploited, and the Walmart family became the wealthiest on earth.\nThe container business is hugely cartelised, and can arbitrarily hold businesses to ransom. Across transport and logistics too, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from workers to oligopolies and international investors.\nThis short-term shareholder-pleasing logic has been unmoved by the risks in the global supply chain, despite natural disasters and other jolts. When a ship broke down in Suez Canal, it held up $10bn a day of seaborne trade. In 2023, drought struck Panama Canal, through which 40% of the world\u2019s cargo passes \u2013 scores of vessels were left bobbing in the water.\nBut risks have multiplied. Tariffs, wars and changing alliances and trade pacts. In Dec that year, rebels from Yemen in solidarity with Palestine unleashed missiles on ships in Red Sea.\nBy late 2022, some 24% of American companies were mulling plans to move elsewhere, or scatter their business across many countries. Vietnam mostly, also India, Indonesia and Japan. But they depend on China for parts and materials. It\u2019s hard to break up with China. It has insinuated itself into international commerce to the extent that it determines the collective value placed on anything, whether it\u2019s an electronic component, a coil of steel, or an hour of labour.\nWhile globalisation has not ended, it is being renegotiated. Biden\u2019s talk of reshoring may be distant and unrealistic, but there is greater localisation. Regional supply networks are getting stronger. Southeast and South Asia serve as suppliers to Chinese markets, western Europe relies on factories in eastern Europe, Turkey and Africa, US depends on manufacturers closer home in Mexico. Nearshoring has the potential to stabilise \u2018Just in Time\u2019.\nBut a system that rests on exploited labour is permanently fragile, and the next shock is only a matter of time, says the book. It makes a case for regulation that preserves competition, and allows workers to bargain for their share of the proceeds. The current supply chain set-up works for big-box retailers like Walmart, e-commerce giants like Amazon, sprawling ocean carriers, railroad monopolists and agribusiness Goliaths. While consumers may have enjoyed low prices for decades, the true costs of this system are only being revealed now.\n\n",

PM Starmer, true to Labour roots, sticks to sandwiches, which add \u00a38bn to British GDP.\nIt\u2019s ironic that advocates of a stoic work ethic see value in water-cooler breaks but not lunch that refuels and decompresses. In tedious roles \u2013 which most jobs are \u2013 lunch is an island mid-stream that workers swim towards till noon. Remove it and their day starts with a sinking feeling.

        "full_article": "Police case against Allu Arjun a worrying trend\nFor Telangana police to charge Telugu superstar Allu Arjun with culpable homicide was ridiculous. For a trial court to send him to judicial custody for 14 days was miscarriage of justice. Thankfully better sense prevailed as HC granted the actor interim bail. The case as it stands is that a woman died and a child was critically hurt in a stampede that occurred when Allu Arjun attended the opening of his blockbuster Pushpa 2. The theatre and the actor\u2019s team say they informed police ahead of his visit. Police say they denied him permission but that he even held a \u2018roadshow\u2019. The woman\u2019s spouse filed a complaint basis which police shot off the FIR. Whatever the case\u2019s merits, and however it gets decided, police neglected their obligation to manage crowds. The high-profile arrest ensured the case takes a life of its own and police can escape accountability. Film audiences in most of southern India are known to break into a frenzy at star-studded movie openings, even without the presence of their idols. Even if Allu Arjun were not present, the opening of Pushpa 2 was a hugely anticipated event and large crowds were expected at the busy Hyderabad location where Sandhya theatre is.\nCrowd control is police work. Period. Had there been no casualty, this would have been just another \u2018stampede-like situation\u2019, tucked away and forgotten in police records. As is seen repeatedly in several such situations countrywide where expert crowd control is required, police fail hopelessly to control the situation \u2013 ill-equipped, ill-trained, and in several cases, it\u2019s simply dereliction of duty. Police have dangerously become trigger-happy with FIRs on serious charges in their need to protect their own shortcomings. India-wide, ordinary people, especially women, the poor and marginalised struggle to file cases against harms done to them. But simultaneously, police forces find it all too easy to harass citizens, high-profile and ordinary, via weak cases but stringent provisions, sometimes to please political masters and otherwise to deflect attention and accountability.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), a specialised unit of Bangladesh Police, has finally admitted that much of the allegations against it\u2014of enforced disappearances and murders in the guise of crossfires\u2014are true. Historically, the force has constantly denied that it is involved in such activities. We welcome this rather surprising announcement, but acknowledgement is only the first step towards justice.\nAt a views exchange meeting on Thursday, the Rab director-general apologised to families who lost their loved ones to enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, acknowledging the existence of secret prisons. This comes 20 years after the formation of Rab, which was aimed at curbing organised crime and terrorism, but turned into a \"government death squad,\" as per statements of many activists and critics. Over the period, the unit garnered a reputation associated with extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture of opposition political figures and critics of the government. As per data compiled by Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 1,200 people were killed in the so-called crossfires involving Rab from the force's inception in April 2004 till June this year.\nBut now, the opportunity for redress has arisen. The inquiry commission on enforced disappearances, formed on August 27 this year, is investigating around 1,600 complaints, 172 linked to Rab, and the International Crimes Tribunal has initiated relevant proceedings. The US sanction of Rab drastically brought down extrajudicial killings. Therefore, what transformed the force into a weapon of suppression, as the data implies, is the complete lack of accountability. Fortunately, Rab itself is aware of this fact, and is accordingly drafting a new law to regulate its operations, while mulling to introduce a new name, logo and uniform. We hope such actions will bear fruit and not just be for optics.\nThe apology should be followed by genuine attempts at reform, and the DG's pledge to never partake in such crimes is hopeful. But much remains to be done. As Mayer Daak, a platform of the families of enforced disappearance victims, has made it clear, every person forcibly disappeared must be returned to their loved ones, and families have to be informed about incidents of disappearances and deaths. While many are advocating for the disbandment of this force, if it does remain, we demand a proper legal framework for Rab to operate, one that would take the rights of citizens, including freedom of expression, into consideration. Additionally, there has to be consequences for the unit's past crimes, for which an independent body to investigate the cases is paramount. And based on the findings of the investigations, those who have been involved in these crimes must be brought to justice. If genuine changes are achieved, we are optimistic that Rab will emerge as a pro-people force.\n",

        "full_article": "People of the Indian subcontinent, especially those in Bengal, never accepted European colonial rule. They launched many waves of anticolonial resistance since the arrival of the coloniser in the early 16th century. The most decisive\u2014and of tragic consequences\u2014was the Great Rebellion of 1857-58 (Mahabidroh) which the British mischaracterised as \"Sepoy Mutiny.\" It was begun by the\u00a0sipahis\u00a0of the Bengal army.\nThe epicentre of the war that followed was Delhi where the\u00a0sipahis\u00a0and other freedom fighters flocked. By that time, Mughal rule under its last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar shrunk to Delhi and its surrounding areas. The freedom fighters declared him\u00a0Badshah-e-Hind\u00a0(the emperor of India) and the symbolic leader of the revolt. Mainly due to the treachery of local sell-outs, informants and opportunists, the uprising failed.\nAfter quelling the revolt, the British perpetrated mass murder, rape, lawfare, confiscation of property, and similar human rights violations, whose primary victims were the Muslim community. Tens of thousands of people were slaughtered. At one point, with revolver shots from a point-blank range, British cavalry officer William Hodson killed members of the Mughal royal family, including Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khizr Sultan. Their severed heads were then presented to their father, Bahadur Shah Zafar.\nIn a 2011 Routledge essay titled \"The Backlash in Delhi,\" historian Arshad Islam says, \"The British soldiers started looting, plundering, and demanding money. However, after gorging money they put to the sword Hindus and Muslims indiscriminately, but later they only fell upon the Muslims,\" women being the worst sufferers.\nDelhi and other cities affected by the rebellion were littered with \"heaps of dead bodies\" and presented \"an awful spectacle.\" Fearing death and dishonour at the hands of colonial forces, \"men, women, and children were roaming barefooted \u2026 Mothers who could not bear the miseries of their [hungry] children threw themselves into wells\" and innumerable women committed suicide to guard their chastity. Many surviving Muslim women of respectable families\u2014including descendants of Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2014later lived as beggars and domestic helpers.\nThis landmark event had massive impacts on the subsequent relations between the coloniser and the colonised in the region. The following discussion sheds some light on the self-censorship practices of native writers in its aftermath.\nMany anticolonial rebels suffered penal servitude and died in the dreaded island prison of the Andamans. One of them was great writer and jurist Fazl-e-Haq (also spelt Fadl-i-Haqq) Khairabadi (1796-1861)\u2014honourably known as\u00a0Allamah\u00a0(a great scholar)\u2014on whom poet Intizamullah Shahabi wrote an essay titled \"Allamah Fadl-i-Haqq.\" In 1953, introducing the essay in the\u00a0Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, its editor commented on the cultural context of the aftermath of the rebellion, \"[Writers of the subcontinent] were overcautious in their statements because they could not afford to be listed among 'political suspects.'\"\nIn his essay, Shahabi states, \"In the period that followed the catastrophe of 1857 it was not possible to say or write anything against the British rule \u2026 For several decades after the War it was impossible to talk of liberation or independence \u2026 [E]ven those who wrote in the earlier decades of the twentieth [century], could not carry us far.\"\nRoquiah Sakhawat Hossein (1880-1932), more popularly known as Rokeya, was born about two decades after the Great Rebellion and wrote in the first few decades of the 20th century. In her work, the Great Rebellion is conspicuous by its absence. Given the lethality of the British response to the uprising, Rokeya had to be sensitive to the political-cultural context in which she operated. This explains the omission of any prominent mention of the uprising in her oeuvre. However, a thematic analysis of her work shows that the spectre of the event was always there at the back of her mind.\nRokeya's writings are rife with laments on the deplorable condition of Muslims in British India. She sought to lift them from the abyss of wretchedness and from the ills and adversity brought on them by colonial rule. The strategy through which she wanted to materialise this project of ameliorating the condition of Muslims was women's emancipation. She established a link between the liberation of Muslim women and the overall development of Muslim society. For example, in a 1926 speech delivered at Bengal Women's Education Conference, Rokeya said,\n\"As the British Government does not recognise the demands of Indian peoples \u2026 [and] our non-Muslim neighbours do not tolerate the interests of Muslims \u2026 in the same way Muslim men refuse to recognise women's desire for progress \u2026 Unless and until our Muslim brothers give proper attention to our [women's] sufferings, the 220 million people of India will not give any heed to their demands; and unless and until those 220 millions ignore the 80 million Muslims, their petition will not reach the ears of the British government.\"\nThus, she pointed to the embedded connection between the public and the private long before latter-day feminist scholars theorised these inherent underpinnings. In her short stories such as \"Gyanphal,\" \"Muktiphal\" and \"Bhrata O Bhogni\" and essays like \"Asha-Jwuti,\" Rokeya sent the same stark message\u2014to those who wanted to decolonise their country\u2014that without making women equal partners in every sphere of life, it would be impossible to achieve liberation, especially from colonial rule.\nMy decades-long research on the life and work of Rokeya shows that she didn't seek to improve the condition of women alone. She wanted to break the imperial shackles and to liberate the people of the subcontinent from colonial subjugation, and the key to that liberation, according to her, was the emancipation of women.\nIt is true that Rokeya refers to Muslim women and Muslim society again and again in her work. This repeated mention should be understood in the broader context of the double colonisation of Muslim men (as Muslims and Indians) and the triple colonisation of Muslim women (as women, Muslims and Indians)\u2014all were exacerbated after the failed 1857-58 uprising. She sought to alleviate the plight of the victimised and the marginalised. Therefore, when discussing Rokeya, we cannot keep the here and the now at a distance.\nFor example, people in Bangladesh suffered many human rights violations, from enforced disappearances to mass killings in the streets, during Sheikh Hasina's rule from early 2009 to August 5, 2024. We saw our banks plundered and our money syphoned off to foreign shores through capital flight. Opposition political parties were suppressed (and \"managed\") and couldn't do much to rescue the nation from what is now widely regarded as Hasina's fascism. Finally, our students and other young people\u2014both male and female\u2014braved the risk of street death by shooting (in the head) by government forces. In July 2024, they sparked a formidable movement and gave their lives for the love and liberation of their country. The selflessness, courage and heroism of tens of thousands of surviving young people eventually defeated the greed and cruelty of Hasina and her lickspittles.\nRecently, while studying the 1857-58 rebellion and its aftermath, I shuddered with horror thinking of the dreadful consequences had the July uprising failed and Sheikh Hasina remained in power. This also tells me about the heavy burden of the post-1857-58 collective trauma among the Muslim community that Rokeya had to process while she was writing. It is important to consider this aspect of Rokeya's literary career while reading her work. Equally, in order to make our struggle for gender justice relevant and efficacious, we can't turn a blind eye to the larger political context that affects the lives of both men and women.\nDr Md Mahmudul Hasan\u00a0is professor in the Department of English Language and Literature at the International Islamic University Malaysia.

        "full_article": "Every month, Bangladesh witnesses a tragic procession of lives lost and irreparably altered due to road crashes. According to the latest report from the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, in October alone, 475 people were killed and 815 injured in 452 crashes across the country. These statistics are alarming, but they barely scratch the surface of a systemic issue that has plagued Bangladesh for decades.\nRoad safety in Bangladesh is undermined by several interconnected issues, including unlicensed drivers, unfit vehicles, and inadequate enforcement of traffic laws. Over 10 lakh registered vehicles in the country are driven by unlicensed drivers because of a lack of institutional arrangement for proper training. Most drivers transition from helpers to drivers under the guidance of senior drivers, without formal certification.\nIn addition, more than five lakh registered vehicles lack fitness clearance, yet they continue to ply the roads unchecked. While significant investments have been made in road infrastructure, the capacity of the regulatory authorities like the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) remains woefully inadequate. According to Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), the BRTA is one of the most corrupt institutions in the country, with widespread bribery facilitating the operation of unfit vehicles and unqualified drivers.\nThe situation is exacerbated by reckless driving, which often stems from the daily contract system for bus drivers. Under this system, drivers are incentivised to maximise passenger numbers, leading to dangerous competition and accidents. Similarly, the absence of separate lanes for slow-moving vehicles such as easy bikes and battery-powered rickshaws on highways contributes significantly to road crashes.\nThe popularity of motorcycles, driven by an inadequate public transport system and favourable government policies for production and sales, adds another layer of complexity. While motorcycles account for a significant number of road crashes, the enforcement of safety measures, such as use of helmets, remains lax. A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that proper helmet use can reduce the risk of death in a crash by six times. Yet, such measures are poorly implemented in Bangladesh, contributing to the country's high motorcycle-related fatality rate.\nThe term \"structural killings\" better describes the situation in Bangladesh\u2014a failure of governance and systemic neglect that allows dangerous practices to persist. The vested interests of vehicle owners, transport associations, and regulatory bodies have created a tangled web of corruption and mismanagement that perpetuates this cycle of death. From 2014 to September 2024, there were 60,980 road accidents in the country, resulting in 105,338 deaths and 149,847 injuries. Despite a historic student-led movement in 2018 demanding safer roads, little has changed. The promises made by the authorities remain unfulfilled, and the death toll continues to rise.\nThe impact of road crashes extends far beyond the immediate loss of life. Families are left to grapple with emotional trauma, financial burdens, and the loss of breadwinners. Injured individuals often face long-term disabilities, resulting in reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs. The ripple effects of these tragedies are felt across society, undermining the nation's progress and prosperity. Addressing road safety in Bangladesh requires a multifaceted approach. These include enhancing BRTA's capacity to ensure strict enforcement of licensing and vehicle fitness requirements, as well as making the processes transparent, and taking anti-corruption measures to restore public trust.\nAlso, institutional arrangements for comprehensive driver training should be established, with mandatory certification for all drivers by replacing informal training practices with standardised, government-regulated programmes. Separate lanes for slow-moving vehicles on highways should be prioritised, along with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure including proper signage, lighting, and routine road maintenance. Campaigns can be run to educate citizens about traffic rules and the importance of safety measures, such as helmet and seat belts use. Traffic management systems should be modernised through technology, such as surveillance cameras and automated fines for violations to deter reckless driving. Owners of buses and other commercial vehicles must be held accountable for the actions of their drivers. The daily contract system should be abolished in favour of fair and regulated employment terms. Lastly, the interim government must place road safety high on its reform agenda.\nMd Kawsar Uddin\u00a0is associate professor in the Department of English and Modern Languages at the International University of Business Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT).\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
