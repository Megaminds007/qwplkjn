With the economy still in search of durable momentum that could help entrench the recovery from the last fiscal year\u2019s record contraction, Ms. Sitharaman has missed an opportunity to address the flagging consumer spending in the wake of erosion in real incomes and savings through a combination of tax breaks for the middle class and cash handouts for the poor. And even as the Minister acknowledges the role public capital expenditure could play in crowding-in private investment at a time when \u201cprivate investments seem to require that support\u201d and help to \u2018pump-prime\u2019 demand in the economy, the Budget outlay of \u20b97.50 lakh-crore for the capital account marks just a 24.4% increase from the revised estimate of \u20b96.03 lakh-crore for the current fiscal. To be sure, Ms. Sitharaman\u2019s speech highlights the PM GatiShakti, a \u201ctransformative approach for economic growth and sustainable development\u201d that is to be powered by the \u2018seven engines\u2019 of roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistics infrastructure. While the broad sweep of the public infrastructure envisioned by the programme could potentially be truly transformative if it were to be executed as imagined, the Budget is largely short on details where it concerns the specifics and pencils in some figures only for the roads and railways components. The Budget lists a \u2018Master Plan for Expressways\u2019 that will be formulated in 2022-23 under the scheme and projects the addition of 25,000 kilometres of roads to the National Highways network. The talk of enabling seamless multimodal movement of goods and people and providing multimodal connectivity between mass urban transit systems and railway stations, however, all sound a familiar refrain from past speeches.Spending outlays on several other key sectors including health care, rural development and the vital jobs and income providing national rural employment guarantee scheme have all shrunk as a percentage of overall expenditure in the Budget estimates for fiscal 2023 from the revised estimates for the current year, even if in some cases only marginally. That these sectors have been forced to bear the impact of the Government\u2019s keenness to broadly stick to a fiscal consolidation road map \u2014 with the Budget projecting a narrowing of the fiscal deficit to 6.4% of GDP in 2022-23, from a revised estimate for 6.9% \u2014 reflects on its priorities. Government spending on health care ought to have instead been significantly increased, with the lessons from the ongoing pandemic\u2019s first two waves serving to illuminate the need for a sizeable enlargement of the public health infrastructure. A source of some solace, though, is the announcement of a \u2018National Tele Mental Health Programme\u2019 to address mental health problems that have been exacerbated by the claustrophobic lockdowns and plethora of anxieties triggered by the pandemic.In a nod to the ruling party\u2019s nationalist moorings and in line with the Government\u2019s push to increase self reliance or AtmaNirbharta, the Finance Minister has proposed a series of tariff and policy steps that could help bolster domestic manufacturing in the long run. A key policy element is a commitment to reduce import dependence in procurement for the country\u2019s defence forces. To that end the Minister has proposed earmarking 68% of the armed forces\u2019 capital procurement budget to domestic industry in 2022-23, a not insignificant increase from the current fiscal\u2019s 58% target. The tariff rationalisations, which cover a broad swathe of items ranging from electronics, gems and jewellery, chemicals, inputs used by MSME units and project and capital goods, could, however, have varying short-term impacts. Specifically, the move to phase out the concessional rates in capital goods and project imports gradually and apply a moderate tariff of 7.5% could in the short term hurt infrastructure projects and the setting up of new manufacturing capacity, some proposed exemptions for advanced machinery notwithstanding. The Minister has tried to address the raging debate over how to deal with virtual currencies by adopting a twin-track approach. On the one hand Ms. Sitharaman proposes to introduce in the coming fiscal year a Central Bank Digital Currency that she posits will impart a big boost to the digital economy and \u201clead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system\u201d. The RBI-issued Digital Rupee would leverage blockchain and other related technologies. In parallel, she intends to tax income from the transfer of any virtual digital asset at the rate of 30%, with deduction allowed only for the cost of acquisition. It remains to be seen if the Government\u2019s efforts at bringing the mushrooming trade and investment in a multiplicity of virtual digital assets including cryptocurrencies under the tax net would have a salutary impact besides adding a revenue stream to the exchequer. The Minister\u2019s latest budget also skirts mention of the asset monetisation plan mentioned in the last Budget and shows a sharp decline in capital receipts from disinvestment. With just \u20b965,000 crore budgeted from asset sale for fiscal 2023, as opposed to \u20b978,000 crore as per the revised estimates for the current fiscal, the Minister has had to increase gross borrowings to \u20b914.95 lakh-crore, a 24% increase from the current fiscal\u2019s budget estimate but a far sharper 43% jump from the revised estimate of \u20b910.46 lakh-crore. The resource crunch manifest in the proposed higher debt issuance is ultimately bound to get more acute in the days ahead, given the Budget\u2019s lack of growth-invigorating proposals.",

The Tatas\u2019 enthusiasm for winning back what was once the country\u2019s iconic airline brand notwithstanding, the skies in which the industry operates have changed considerably. A look at the market share data from the domestic air passenger segment clearly shows that budget or low-cost flights now hold a dominant position, commanding about four-fifths of the market. The Tata group\u2019s full-service venture, Vistara, with no less a partner than Singapore Airlines on board, has struggled to establish a foothold and with Air India\u2019s addition, the Tatas find themselves saddled with a bulk of their combined domestic market share of 23% (as of November) being in the less-in-demand full-service segment. Nor is the group\u2019s newly combined share from the low-cost segment, comprising Air Asia India\u2019s 5.9% and the fractional share that Air India\u2019s Air India Express has, significant enough at the moment to give it scale in the high-volume business. That the group is said to be considering consolidating Air India\u2019s domestic low-cost services along with Air Asia India\u2019s operations is a clear indication that the Tata bosses realise the need to optimise the varied aviation resources that are now in the group\u2019s fold so as to enhance viability.On the international front too, Air India faces multiple challenges, not the least of which is the Government\u2019s current pandemic-related curbs on commercial international flights. With foreign carriers restricted to limited capacity under the \u2018Air Transport Bubbles\u2019 arrangement, Air India too has found itself constrained in the number of overseas flights it can operate under the bilateral arrangements with counterpart countries. The Tatas, though, could use the current curtailment of overseas services as an opportunity to undertake a long overdue overhaul of Air India\u2019s inflight experience. Also, with Vistara now operating to a few select overseas destinations, the Tatas will need to decide if they would want a younger in-house competitor to Air India once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and normalcy restored as regards international flights. For the Tata group, the choices going forward will need to be strategic. With the domestic market set to see more churn with at least one new budget airline set to enter and other rivals struggling for capital, the group needs to decide whether it wants to add capacity to budget offerings or stay a predominantly full-service carrier at a time when the more lucrative business class travel has been hit. And with aviation fuel costs set to soar further, Air India will need to tap into all of the Tata group\u2019s vaunted managerial expertise if it is to turn into a successful buy.",

        "full_article": "Recent talks in Geneva between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken regarding the crisis over Ukraine achieved little. Russia asked for a written response to its demands, which include a halt to NATO enlargement. For now, Russian President Vladimir Putin might be as relieved at the current standstill as the US and its NATO allies are.\nThat is because Putin is playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship vis-a-vis Ukraine. True, he has succeeded in calling into question the strength of NATO's commitment to the country, highlighted its internal divisions, and forced the world to pay greater attention to Russian power. And he may yet manage to wring concessions from the US and NATO. But Putin also risks putting himself in the position of having to launch a materially and politically costly invasion of Ukraine.\nStopping NATO expansion has been one of the Kremlin's main foreign policy objectives for a decade, but Putin's approach has yielded few results. Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014 has succeeded only in making NATO membership more appealing in Ukraine and Georgia. Moreover, Russia's actions failed to prevent smaller candidate countries from acceding to the Alliance, with Montenegro and North Macedonia joining in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Worse yet, Putin's bellicose foreign policy led to NATO membership being seriously considered by mainstream politicians in neutral countries like Sweden and Finland.\nThe escalation of tensions over Ukraine also carries enormous domestic risks for Putin. The Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region required little sacrifice and massively increased Putin's political support at home. Invading eastern Ukraine now is unlikely to yield a similar political dividend, as opinion polls in Russia have long shown low public support for such a move; just a quarter of Russians currently support the incorporation of Donbas into Russia.\nGiven the risks, what could Putin hope to gain by seemingly backing himself into a corner?\nDespite his repeated claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, Putin may regard the current standoff as a way to demonstrate to Ukraine and other Eastern European states that the NATO and US commitments to them are actually quite weak. US President Joe Biden arguably reinforced this impression at his press conference on January 19, 2022, when he appeared to suggest that a \"minor incursion\" by Russia into Ukraine would elicit a milder Western response. (Biden and other administration officials subsequently scrambled to walk back the comment.)\nRussia benefits from such gaffes, because the Kremlin obviously wants to sow discord and highlight fissures among NATO members. While the US and several Eastern European countries have supported Ukraine's accession, the Alliance has long been divided over the issue, owing to its members' differing economic, security, and energy relations with Russia.\nIn the days leading up to the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Ukraine presented Germany and France with a letter requesting their support for its entry into NATO. But France's then prime minister, Francois Fillon, emphasised his country's opposition to Ukraine (and Georgia) joining the alliance. \"We think it is not the right response to the balance of power in Europe and between Europe and Russia, and we want to have a dialogue on this subject with Russia,\" Fillon said. The then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed a similar view.\nBut publicly, at least, the US and NATO officials have reaffirmed the Alliance's continuing unity. While Biden suggested at his news conference that America's European allies were not united on how to respond to a small Russian incursion into Ukraine, there have been no bilateral negotiations between other Western powers and Russia regarding Ukraine.\nOn the surface, Putin seems to have unnecessarily boxed himself in by making unacceptable demands on an issue\u2014Ukraine's NATO accession\u2014that was unlikely to materialise anyway. But Putin has, in fact, made real gains by exposing the West's disarray and the weakness of its commitment to Ukraine.\nIf the US and European negotiators make even symbolic concessions, Putin can use them to burnish his image. Even if he de-escalates tensions without the written guarantees he wanted, the stationing of Russian troops in Belarus, and the recent deployment of a Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization \"peacekeeping\" mission in Kazakhstan, demonstrate Russia's continued leadership role among former Soviet states.\nBut Putin's brinkmanship over Ukraine remains dangerous. One can only hope that when the US and Russian officials return to the negotiating table, they will find a way to prevent a manufactured crisis from turning into a hot war.\n\u00a0\nHilary Appel is a professor and director of the Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies at Claremont McKenna College.

        "full_article": "Often as children, my female peers and I would lament over the myriad privileges our male counterparts enjoyed in society, from being allowed to play for hours in the sun (a tan would not diminish their value as human beings) to going out any hour of the day (with their prime fear being that they might be mugged, not that they might be raped and killed). The \"best\" way our parents and elders discovered of appeasing our (those born after 1980, thereabouts) budding feminist selves was to reprimand us for even wanting to be like boys, when we were allegedly so far ahead and above them. It did work on many of us, but sadly I believe a lot of us were unable to see past the rosiness of such a sentiment.\nThis brand of feminism-but-not-really-feminism tends to hyper-humanise women\u2014meaning that, far from being \"equal\" to men, we are told we are so much stronger, smarter, and more valuable than them. Why? Usually for our ability to birth life within our bodies, and then to work tirelessly and without a whisper of complaint to raise that life while having to put ours on hold, because the father caring for the child in the same way would be emasculating in our cultural context, but the same done by mothers proves them to be superhumanly strong.\nWhile the words used to describe such traditionally maternal characteristics may seem like compliments of the highest degree\u2014\"sacrificing,\" \"selfless,\" \"unconditionally loving\"\u2014they are often just a way of making women continue to perform physical and emotional labour, so others (and not always men only) don't have to. And when a girl child grows up seeing her mother's woes being remedied by empty praises alone, she learns to expect and accept the same wherever she goes. This is why corporations, for instance, can get away with discriminating against women in terms of wages, positions, participation, etc (while a single Women's Day bouquet and a few candy bars work to establish them as being a \"feminist\" organisation).\nBut how can we expect our local businesses to be genuinely feminist, when we always succumb to the same issue of hyper-humanising women in our homes? One social media post I recently came across was by a father who essayed on about how his daughter gave up her packet of chips because her little brother was not satisfied with only his own, and how she silently cried in a corner, not letting her father see her sorrow and not boasting about her sacrifice. I was expecting to read that the father had, by the end, taught his children that his daughter should not have to make sacrifices to cater to her brother's needs, and that she did not need to appear strong by hiding her tears. Instead, it was all praise about how daughters are even better than men because of their sacrificial nature.\nDo we ever stop to wonder if this sacrificial nature of women is truly inherent, or a trait that they are trained to adopt? Probably not, given how that would mean we would need to acknowledge that women, like everyone else, are just human. They get tired, frustrated, and are not always beautiful and \"presentable.\" Nor should they have to be.\nThen there is this notion that has become default: \"Men just aren't as good at doing stuff around the house.\" While there is no logical explanation behind why men would not be able to perform household tasks \"as well as women do,\" this is something that most men and women in our society have internalised and practise extensively. This further hyper-humanises women in the sense that now, in the modern world, women are expected to not only have full-time jobs, but also maintain the household and rear children, all at once. For that, she gets a cursory bouquet and a dessert or two in the name of Women's Day or celebratory Facebook posts about the all-sacrificial mother on Mother's Day.\nWe need to realise that we are doing the opposite of helping the cause of feminism when we term women as superhumans and only reward them when they adhere to that narrative. We must teach young boys that home is as much theirs to care for as it is of their female counterparts'. We need to break away from the traditional definition of femininity, so that young girls, at home and everywhere else, don't grow up thinking they are somehow less of a woman if they don't cater to every need of everyone around them. We need to stop thinking of flowers and chocolates as compensation for forcing women to try and live up to others' image of them as demi-goddesses, instead of what they are\u2014simple and complete human beings.\n\u00a0\nAfia Jahin is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Like many countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of Bangladesh's healthcare system. But it has also given us the opportunity to reconsider our approach to healthcare. What we have achieved in terms of socioeconomic development over the last 50 years as an independent nation is the envy of many. While we celebrate it, we should not let it extrapolate into a sense of complacency. Our neighbour Sri Lanka, for example, is way ahead of us when it comes to most development indicators; their maternal mortality ratio, for instance, is 36, while ours is still 173, as per the latest World Bank data.\nOur goal as a nation is the all-encompassing \"Vision 2041.\" As we work towards it, we should not lose sight of keeping the different moving parts in our system in a healthy and functional state\u2014this will allow us to realise that vision in a sustainable way. The healthcare system is one of those critical moving parts. I believe the pandemic has given us the opportunity to ponder and do something significantly different. Never in the past has the health sector received so much national and international focus. And this is precisely the reason that I think our prime minister should take advantage of this opportunity and do something big and meaningful, which will make her legacy indelible.\nI am talking about universal health coverage (UHC). Our prime minister, on a number of occasions, has made a commitment for UHC\u2014most recently at a high-level UN meeting in New York in September 2019. This is also reflected in several policy documents of the government, including the Health Care Financing Strategy 2012-2032, and the 8th Five-Year Plan. Unfortunately, little is seen to have happened on the agenda to make UHC a reality.\nUHC is achieved when every citizen receives the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. The key to achieving UHC is by reforming the healthcare financing system. In particular, it requires switching from a system of private financing (mostly people paying for services out of pocket) to a compulsory public system. This has happened in every high-income country of the world\u2014the US is an exception. Many countries in Bangladesh's income level have made tremendous progress towards UHC, including Sri Lanka, Vietnam, the Philippines, Egypt and Morocco. Interestingly, Sri Lanka's universal healthcare system originated from a national crisis caused by a malaria epidemic in the 1930s, similar to the threat posed by Covid-19 today. Thailand achieved UHC in 2002 after the Asian financial crisis, when its GDP per capita was about the same as Bangladesh's today.\nUHC, therefore, is perfectly affordable in Bangladesh, even in the midst of a global pandemic and economic challenges, if there is political will to do so. Experiences from other countries indicate that kick-starting successful national UHC reforms typically requires around an additional one percent of GDP in public financing. All this funding would not be needed immediately, but could be done using a phase-in approach over a period of two to three years.\nUHC has an important poverty reducing effect as well, as this will save two to three million Bangladeshis from falling into poverty annually due to catastrophic health-related expenditures. As Bangladesh experiences an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), evidence shows that long-term treatment of such conditions can be nearly as financially debilitating as short-term catastrophic health incidences.\nEvidence from around the world shows that the best UHC strategies focus on achieving full population coverage of a modest package of services, focusing on primary healthcare, but also including selected hospital services. These should and can be provided totally free to everyone.\nBecause UHC reforms always require significant increases in public financing, they tend to be led by leaders who have the power to reallocate public budgets. Progressive leaders often take this initiative because UHC reforms are extremely popular. Across the world, politicians who have delivered UHC to their people have become national heroes. This was the case in Germany, the UK, France, Australia, Japan, Canada, Korea, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia.\nIn the virtual \"International Conference on Covid-19 and the Future Health Systems,\" organised last month jointly by Brac James P Grant School of Public Health and Bangladesh Health Watch, top health experts from across the world called for implementing UHC as the basis for future healthcare systems. Some of the experts even mentioned our prime minister and strongly urged her to make UHC her top agenda for the next five years. This will make her, as they predicted, the hero for UHC.\nWe do expect to see her in this role.\n\u00a0\nAhmed Mushtaque Raza Chowdhury, PhD, is the convenor of Bangladesh Health Watch and former vice-chair of Brac.\n",

        "full_article": "Can anyone remember such degradation of a constitutional body like what our Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) KM Nurul Huda has done? His defence of the indefensible failure in fulfilling his constitutional duties was not only filled with untruths and misrepresentation of facts, but was also, to some extent, distasteful. His attempt to discredit and humiliate fellow commissioner Mahbub Talukdar by describing him as \"a person infected with disease\" is quite shocking (Business Insider, January 27, 2022). Someone's medical expenses cannot be an issue of contention, unless there is specific proof of fraud. Besides, simple decency requires seeking permission from the person concerned before revealing their personal information, including ailment.\nThe CEC's responses to the main allegation against the Election Commission about ballot-box stuffing the night before the 11th parliamentary elections on December 30, 2018 after four years clearly manifest an attempt to rewrite history. His explanation that he didn't see it, and therefore \"cannot say anything conclusive based on the allegations,\" appeared to be contradicting himself, because it was none other than the CEC who told election officials within 10 weeks of that infamous \"polling in the night\" that \"the EC was planning to use electronic voting machines (EVMs) to make sure that ballot boxes could not be stuffed on the night before an election.\" His arguments in justifying the introduction of EVMs in upazila elections were based on the fact that he did realise what had happened and how he had failed us all.\nWhen he told the media that \"You didn't even see it [ballot stuffing the night before voting],\" perhaps he forgot that it was the media\u2014BBC, in particular\u2014that showed the world the footage of stuffed boxes well before the voting began on December 30, 2018. His attempt to apportion blame on political parties for not taking the issue to the court is a childish argument to cover his failure. Seeking legal redress from a court is a retroactive move. But what about the prevention of irregularities and violations, especially when the Representation of the People Order, 1972 clearly empowers the commission to stop vote-casting at any polling station or an entire constituency at any stage of the election if it finds the process compromised?\nIt has been over four years since that night, so the CEC might have forgotten that while he kept his eyes shut, the rest of the world witnessed the mass disenfranchising of hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis. Perhaps, he needs a little reminder about how the world reacted to such a farcical exercise. His refusal to allow foreign observers to monitor the polling now gives credence to such suspicion that his intention all along was to hide his partisan behaviour and inability to conduct an acceptable election. Can he deny that most of the Western nations condemned the violence and widespread irregularities in the 2018 elections, and called for a transparent investigation into all allegations of impropriety? The European Union termed the electoral campaign and the vote as \"tainted.\" The US, expressing concern about \"credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period,\" noted that \"election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process.\"\nThe United Nations and a good number of international organisations also made similar observations, but their calls for independent and transparent investigations into the alleged irregularities were blatantly ignored. The Human Rights Watch and the Transparency International have documented many of these irregularities. A survey by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) found that stamping of ballots took place on the night before the 2018 election at more than one centre in 33 constituencies out of the 50 surveyed.\nThe CEC also cast some unwarranted aspersions on the Shamsul Huda Commission when he said, \"There is a difference between holding elections under a partisan government and a military-backed government. There will be criticism of any election held under a political environment.\" Here again, he was wrong as every military force is supposed to support the government of the day. Besides, we had at least four elections that have won recognition at home and abroad. The differences now, however, are the absence of a political consensus and a lack of sincerity and integrity on the part of the commission led by CEC Nurul Huda.\nHis partisan acts started well before his taking of oath of office on February 15, 2017, when several newspapers published photographs showing him as CEC-designate taking floral wreaths from the local leaders of the ruling Awami League and distributing sweets. That explains why he surrendered his authority during the parliamentary elections to a partisan administration, instead of making them work for him. The harm he has caused to our electoral institution is unlikely to be recovered anytime soon.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist and writes from the UK.

For years, the media, civil society and rights bodies have cried out about the country's human rights violations, but nothing happened. Are we to believe that the government is now prioritising it of its own volition?\nThe UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has been requesting the Bangladesh government since 2013 to invite it for a visit for an impartial investigation into such cases, but to no avail, as per the group's 2021 report. And while it has transmitted cases of enforced disappearance to the government since 1996\u2014and is currently waiting for information about 76 such cases\u2014the working group has only ever received clarification regarding one case in the last 25 years. Violations of human rights in the forms of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings are not uncommon in Bangladesh, and certainly must be investigated thoroughly in order to be eradicated completely.\nTo reduce the number of extrajudicial killings at the hands of security agencies, there must be a system of internal accountability preventing the members of police, Rab, CID, etc from committing such deeds. If the January 31 verdict on the Sinha murder case is anything to go by, the government must also investigate how many of the tens, or even hundreds, of annual \"crossfire\" incidents truly result from law enforcers being \"provoked to retaliate.\" Most importantly, our own Human Rights Commission must be strengthened before we attempt to present a positive picture of our human rights scenario to the international community.

After over a year of speculation over the fate of the case, the verdict not just confirms what happened to the ill-fated retired major, but also marks the first time that law enforcement officers in the country have been brought to book for staging a \"shootout.\" The court also sentenced six others, including three cops, to life while acquitting seven other police personnel. This is truly a momentous occasion for the victim's family as well as the defenders of human rights.\u00a0\nWhile we await the release of the full verdict, our reading of the judgment leaves no room for doubt about the July 31, 2020 incident: that it was not a shootout, as the police had claimed, but a premeditated murder planned in cold blood. We get a rare minute-by-minute glimpse into\u2014and indeed a judicial acknowledgment of\u2014how a shootout/crossfire story is cooked up. We have heard several variations of this story in the past. But what all of them have in common is how the law enforcers encounter a \"threat\" from a \"criminal\" or his associates, and how they are \"forced\" to respond (read: fatally shoot) in self-defence. Now that the court has laid bare the truth behind the Sinha shootout drama, is it possible that some of the many such incidents reported over the past years were staged too? Should those accused law enforcers be put on trial to check if there were vested interests at play?\nUnfortunately, when it comes to a shootout or crossfire incident, a case is hardly ever filed by the victim's family. Police don't want to record such cases. Even when they do, they hastily file the final report with the court, saying they had found nothing. Meanwhile, bodies of the victims keep piling up. In 2020, the year Sinha died, 195 people were killed in \"shootouts\" across the country, according to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK).\u00a0\nInterestingly, during Pradeep Kumar Das' two-year tenure as OC of Teknaf police station, over 80 people were killed in 48 \"gunfights\" (another code for extrajudicial killing) involving Teknaf police alone. After Pradeep's conviction, it is only logical that those incidents are investigated to check if there was also any foul play. We urge the appropriate authorities to take steps in this regard.\u00a0\nThe Sinha verdict has opened the gate to a world that was shrouded in official secrecy until now. There is no turning back now. It is more urgent than ever to unearth the underlying truths, and we urge the government\u2014particularly the home ministry\u2014to launch internal investigations into all such cases of extrajudicial killings committed either by police or other security forces. The judiciary may also follow suit with its own investigations. The victims' families should also be empowered and assisted to pursue justice.\u00a0\n",
