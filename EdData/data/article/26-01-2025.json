The BJP, which was critical of the ruling AAP\u2019s unrestrained populism as \u201crevdi\u201d, or a freebie culture, has not only promised that the schemes that are already in place in Delhi will continue but has also promised more. The sum of \u20b92,100 that AAP has promised to women every month has seen the BJP and the Congress offering \u20b92,500 instead. In the speeches of Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, there is an attempt to instil fear in the electorate that if they vote for the BJP, the free electricity, water, health care and education available to the poor would stop. He is also promising to extend the gravy train to the middle class; more specifically to sections of society such as dhobis, pujaris, residents\u2019 welfare associations and autorickshaw drivers. But he has also made a public admission that three guarantees, namely, cleaning the Yamuna river, ensuring that Delhi\u2019s roads meet European standards and providing 24X7 clean drinking water to all, have not been fulfilled, and that if reelected, will have the AAP government focus on the issue of unemployment.The BJP\u2019s campaign has centred around the promise of a double-engine government if it is elected to govern the National Capital Territory. It is also making an all-out effort to tarnish AAP\u2019s claim of incorruptibility. Allegations of corruption in the allotment of liquor licences and the exorbitant amount of public money that was spent on the official residence of Mr. Kejriwal are the BJP\u2019s talking points. The AAP government has not tabled 14 reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Delhi Assembly that the BJP and the Congress say highlight proof of AAP\u2019s corruption. The BJP has promised to put out these reports in the public domain and constitute a probe. The central pitch of the Congress, which has seen its Chief Ministers, current and former, from other States campaigning for it, is that Congress governments have been more efficient and prompt in delivering welfare schemes. The Congress is also trying to invoke the past, highlighting the infrastructure development in Delhi that was carried out under former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. The party has sensed that the late leader still evokes some nostalgia in the Delhi electorate. The party has criticised Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s silence on the demand for a caste census. The BJP is fielding Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as his appeal may influence migrant voters from U.P. and Bihar, now the fastest growing voters\u2019 segment in Delhi.

        "full_article": "The Iron Age in India has been a subject of fascination and discussion. In the rest of the world, the Iron Age succeeded the Copper-Bronze Age or bridged the gap between the Bronze Age and the Early Historic period. But the situation in India is different: when the region north of the Vindhyas belonged to the pre-iron Chalcolithic or Copper Age, the south, with over 3,000 sites, was associated with iron. Many archaeologists have, generally and conservatively, placed the Iron Age to be in the second millennium BCE. Given this backdrop, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin\u2019s recent statement, that the origin of iron in the State could be traced to the first quarter of the fourth millennium BCE, is significant as this pushes the antiquity of iron further. After excavations in the mid-Ganga Valley of Uttar Pradesh about 25 years ago, early evidence of iron technology was dated to 1800 BCE. But now, the work in Sivagalai in Tamil Nadu, which was carried out between 2019 and 2022, has made authorities attribute the introduction of iron in the country to the early part of the fourth millennium BCE, even though the period of 2500 BCE-3000 BCE is taken as a mid-range value. This forms the highlight of a study by the State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA), titled \u201cAntiquity of Iron: Recent radiometric dates from Tamil Nadu\u201d. The TNSDA had the scientific dating results of its study validated by renowned institutions such as the Beta Analytic laboratory in the U.S. Mr. Stalin\u2019s observation was made keeping the findings in mind. Early this month, he announced a $1-million prize scheme for deciphering the script of the Indus Valley Civilisation.The work by the TNSDA should spur new thinking with regard to the strategies to be adopted by archaeologists who are working on the Iron Age of India. They may have to look for more iron-specific sites than copper-cum-iron sites, which will save time, energy and resources. Even though the Tamil Nadu government supports research projects on a wide range of themes in other States, the TNSDA has its constraints with regard to territorial jurisdiction. This underscores the need for complementing Tamil Nadu\u2019s efforts with those of other southern States. The Archaeological Survey of India should take the initiative of bringing the entire southern region under a common fold and enabling well-designed and coordinated work. After all, the idea is to share available resources and expertise in the country to arrive at more reliable findings. At a time when certain forces are increasingly using history and culture as powerful instruments to pursue their political agenda, credible and concrete evidence on the antiquity of the country will naturally put to rest any claim based on baseless assumptions.

        "full_article": "By Swami Swaroopananda\nThe word \u2018bharat\u2019 indicates a place where light prevails over darkness, where spirituality predominates materialism. It is not just a geographical area but a nation of people living a lifestyle moulded around a holistic culture. Certain versions of the Ramayan state that after entering Lanka and slaying Ravan, Ram told Lakshman: \u201cEven this golden Lanka does not appeal to me.\u201d Persian scholars and Sufi poets, too, eulogised this beautiful land: If there is paradise on Earth, it is this, it is this, it is this, they said.\nBy understanding the country\u2019s cultural wealth and philosophical wisdom, citizens can inspire the world. This pride isn\u2019t just about reminiscing the glorious past but also about understanding and revitalising the essence of Indian culture.\nOur sanskrit lies in keeping foundations of truth and right knowledge firm. The secret of its tenacity is in its adaptability over the ages. In the middle of the Kurukshetra War, we saw Krishn doing exactly that. He imparted timeless wisdom of the Vedas, adapting it to fit the social structure of that era \u2013 by masterfully repackaging this knowledge and delivering it to Arjun. Our scriptures are not merely religious texts prescribing dos and don\u2019ts but offer instructions for living a meaningful life.\n\nNow, it is our turn to shape the present so that future generations can learn from our magnificent heritage. We need an education system that not only builds strong character but also instils a deep sense of respect for our legacy. Indian sciences were neither isolated nor exclusive; they were profoundly interconnected. For instance, a fascinating link exists between mathematical formulas, geometry, and biology. Today, managing multiple aspects is essential in any profession. Drawing inspiration from our integrated approach to knowledge, we can address modern challenges with wisdom and innovation.\nOn this 76th Republic Day, let us pledge to learn and understand Indic philosophical heritage that places sacrifice, renunciation, and spirituality as its highest ideals which are visible in our flag, symbolised by orange colour at the top. White represents purity \u2013 not a passive stillness but an active and dynamic sattva. The movement of the blue chakra signifies this vibrancy, reflecting the courage to bring positive changes in society.\nGreen signifies productivity, and today, it also emphasises environmental protection. Embrace green by pledging not to pollute the Earth, which we revere as Mother Nature, Bhumi Devi. Thus, the three colours embody all our nation stands for and should aspire to \u2013spirituality, sacrifice, sattva, and sustainability.\nWe carry our motherland in our hearts when we embody values that reflect rich Indic philosophical heritage. The service of our country is the service of the Lord of lords and devotion to its people is devotion to the supreme Self. Together, let us strive to elevate it to its true glory.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Elites are suspicious of crowds, which are often forces of reform\nCrowds have a bad reputation. Watching the crowds at Bastille, French thinker Gustave Le Bon cast their behaviour as madness, a loss of individual good sense \u2013 and this idea remains seductive to those in power. Multitudes: How Crowds Made the Modern World by Dan Hancox tries to tell a more balanced story of how crowds function, how susceptible we are to being swept along by those around us, and why we may be better together.\nA carnival or concert, a political protest or melee, religious congregation, different crowds have different dynamics. The joy and celebration of a carnival is the crowd at play. Singing and dancing together is a vital, ancient part of who we are as social animals. Chanting in unison at a sports match is a release of collective adrenaline, a halo of energy.\nThe modern age is the age of the crowd. Crowds often show up as a surprise at special moments of world historic intensity \u2013 because the suffering experienced alone by its members had not been visible to those meting it out.\nWhen we gather in a crowd, we are changed by it, and we change our history. Crowd membership gives us a freedom and strength we could not possess as individuals. Think of the French Revolution, a popular insurrection born of exhaustion and misery. It was a joyful collective catharsis, though it was misinterpreted by thinkers like Le Bon, who saw in it disorder and nihilistic violence.\nThese theories about crowd savagery have proven to be durable even today, among elites and thinkers. But hostility to the mob is often hostility to democracy, the book says. The 19th century was haunted by the spectre of a hostile mob: this paranoia showed up in militarised colonial policing, whether in Derry, Ireland or Amritsar, India.\nOf course, not all crowds are seeking a better future, says the book, pointing to 2021 Capitol riots in US, or Brazilian demonstrations in 2023 egged on by Bolsonaro or the history of fascist and authoritarian crowds, including Mussolini\u2019s march on Rome or Hitler\u2019s beer hall putsch. These reactionary vanguards are usually a violent counterweight to a rising mass progressive movement. They are often facilitated by those in uniform, tacitly supported by corners of the establishment and punished lightly, if at all, by the right-wing judiciary. Meanwhile the vast totalitarian crowd does not look sideways at each other, but upwards at the leader.\nCrowd scenes represent the density of urban life, whether Times Square in New York or Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing, or in any of our own metropolises. The idea of cities full of people, of strangers, carries a sense of menace for some, just as others appreciate the safety in numbers, the sensory bombardment of cities.\nCities spooked by uprisings like Tahrir Square have gone out of their way to scotch public conviviality and loitering, with urban design directing citizens directly to shops and homes and offices. Privately owned public spaces are replacing squares and streets, replacing civic mingling with transactional activities or profit making events. The surveillance revolution, police drones and cameras are another constraint on free assembly and social spontaneity. The fear of the crowd lives on in contemporary culture, with screeds about \u2018mobs\u2019.\nWe\u2019re all in it together, the book reminds us. To defend the self-assembled crowd is to defend democracy and freedom, it says.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are shocked to note that supporters of a Chhatra Dal leader not only obstructed the police from performing their duty but attacked them on Friday morning, injuring five officers. The incident took place in front of the capital's New Market Police Station, where at least 30 people gathered to forcibly take away Mohammad Hossain, alias Mithun, joint general secretary of Chhatra Dal's central committee, from police custody.\nAccording to a report in this daily, law enforcers arrested Mithun in connection with the stabbing of two computer traders in Elephant Road on January 10. According to a\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0report, Mithun allegedly works for top criminal Sanjidul Haque Emon, the main accused in the stabbing case, and had ordered another arrestee of the January 10 case to be at the scene of the stabbing incident. Referring to some video footage, the report also mentions that Mithun's supporters, at one point in their squabble with police on Friday night, questioned the police's authority, asked if they knew about \"Mithun's contribution to the uprising,\" and boasted about their own participation in the movement.\nSince August 5, the alleged involvement of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) activists in crimes including extortion and rape have come up a number of times. Although party leaders, including the acting chairman, warned party activists to refrain from unlawful activities, and Chhatra Dal suspended Mithun and another leader Riyazul Hasan Rasel after Friday's incident, such actions do not seem to have had much impact. Some of the party's activists appear to be following the same path as the Awami League's fallen goons, who exploited political power to get their way and even commit heinous crimes. Instead of building an image that aligns with the expectations of the July uprising for a corruption-free Bangladesh, where the rule of law is respected, activists of BNP and its student wing seem to be doing the opposite. But they must remember that a person's affiliation with any party or apparent participation in the movement does not entitle them to special favours or immunity from legal consequences.\nAs one of the major political parties, the BNP must go the extra mile if it seeks to gain the public's trust. Merely issuing statements or suspending one or two bad apples is not enough. The party must strongly distance itself from individuals with criminal records and take punitive action against anyone committing crimes under its banner. Meanwhile, law enforcers must intensify their efforts to arrest top criminals, many of whom were released on bail after August 5 and have resumed their criminal activities. They must regain their confidence to carry out their duties without political interference. Ensuring citizens' safety should remain their highest priority.\n",

        "full_article": "Over the last decade, Bangladesh has seen a massive shift in how its people communicate, interact, and make decisions. Social media has become a crucial part of this transformation, influencing everything from politics to social movements. With nearly 200 million mobile phone users and over 100 million internet subscribers, it is clear that the digital revolution in Bangladesh is well underway. As the world becomes more interconnected, social media has risen to the forefront, playing a critical role in shaping public opinion, politics, and social change.\nSocial media: A game-changer for communication\nIn recent years, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have exploded in popularity in Bangladesh. The younger generation, often referred to as \"digital natives,\" has turned social media into more than just a way to stay in touch; it is now a space for entertainment, influence, and activism. Affordable mobile internet has made social media more accessible, especially to the youth, who make up a significant portion of the country's population.\nAmong these platforms, Facebook stands out as the most popular in Bangladesh, with millions logging in daily. For many people, social media is the first place they go for news and updates, giving them quick access to both local and global events.\nPolitics in the digital age\nSocial media has changed politics in Bangladesh by giving ordinary people an easy way to share their opinions, question the government, and support important issues. It has brought politicians and the public closer together, making it easier for them to communicate directly. Now, politicians use social media to connect with voters more easily, instead of relying on traditional media.\nThe 2018 national elections in Bangladesh were a turning point in how social media influences politics. Political parties used Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to connect with voters, share their manifestos, and promote their candidates. Ads targeted specific groups using data analytics, helping parties tailor their messages to different demographics.\nHowever, this new digital space has also brought challenges, such as the spread of misinformation, fake news, and hate speech, particularly during elections. The ease with which anyone can share content has led to the rapid spread of propaganda, and the lack of regulation has made it difficult to hold people accountable for what they say online.\nDespite these challenges, social media remains a powerful tool in Bangladesh. It has raised political awareness, especially among the youth, and sparked movements and protests that gained momentum through viral hashtags and posts. Social media has even been used to challenge authoritarianism, with people demanding government accountability and social justice.\nSocial media as a catalyst\nBeyond politics, social media has become a vehicle for social change in Bangladesh. Topics such as women's rights, climate change, and education are being widely discussed on digital platforms, giving grassroots movements a chance to be heard. The #MeToo movement, for example, has found a strong voice among Bangladeshi women, with many using social media to share their stories of sexual harassment and demand safer environments.\nSocial media has also been key in raising awareness about marginalised communities. Issues such as the rights of the Rohingya refugees and the fight for greater representation of ethnic minorities have gained visibility thanks to the power of digital platforms, which give these often-silent voices the chance to be heard far and wide.\nOne of the most powerful examples of social media's role in driving social change occurred during the 2018 student protests in Dhaka. After a tragic road accident that killed two students, thousands of young people took to the streets, demanding safer roads. The protests were organised and amplified on social media, gaining widespread attention and eventually forcing the government to take action. This movement, led by the youth, showed how digital activism could spark change.\nChallenges of inclusivity and access\nWhile social media has brought about significant progress, it also highlights the digital divide in Bangladesh. While internet access is growing, large parts of the population\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014still have limited access to the digital world. Challenges such as the cost of smartphones, slow internet speeds, and low literacy rates make it hard for many to participate in the digital conversation.\nThis divide is also clear in the skills needed to use technology. For example, older generations often struggle with social media, making it hard for them to join digital conversations. This creates a gap between those who can engage online and those who cannot.\nAdditionally, the government's attempts to regulate social media have raised concerns about freedom of expression. In recent years, Bangladesh has seen increased censorship of online content, with authorities blocking websites and arresting people for allegedly posting content that is deemed defamatory or politically sensitive. The Digital Security Act of 2018 has been criticised for stifling free speech, as it allows the government to prosecute people for online posts that are seen as harmful to the state.\nThe future of Bangladesh's digital transformation\nAs Bangladesh continues to move towards a more digital future, social media will remain a key player in shaping its political and social landscape. The growing influence of social media among the youth promises to reshape politics and activism, offering opportunities for greater transparency, engagement, and accountability. However, challenges such as misinformation, censorship, and the digital divide must be addressed to ensure that social media remains a force for good.\nAs the country continues its digital journey, the potential for social media to drive change is immense. From transforming political communication to empowering social movements, Bangladesh's digital transformation will undoubtedly play a major role in shaping the future of its society.\nIn conclusion, while social media offers new opportunities for public engagement, it also presents challenges that need to be addressed. By embracing the benefits of digital platforms and working to mitigate the risks, Bangladesh can continue its progress towards becoming a more connected, informed, and progressive nation in the digital age.\nFarzana Hoque is social media executive at The Daily Star.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The sheer uncertainty and chaos that followed the closure of 16 Beximco factories in mid-December is but a reflection of a deeper crisis brought to light by the fall of the Awami League government. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, these factories are among the 68 that have shut down\u2014mostly permanently\u2014in Gazipur, Savar, Ashulia, and Dhamrai over the past five and a half months. Six more are in the process of closing, while the number of job losses recorded so far has surpassed 50,000. These closures and the subsequent protests by workers, often resulting in public disorder, highlight not only the urgency of the crisis, but also the need for long-overdue reforms in the industrial sector.\n\nFurther details from the report help illustrate the point. For example, Gazipur has 2,176 registered factories, including 1,154 RMG factories, while Savar, Ashulia, and Dhamrai have 1,863 factories, of which 745 are RMG factories. It then makes sense that the RMG sector has been disproportionately hit by the post-uprising turmoil, which is alarming given its crucial role in Bangladesh's export earnings. The crisis may spread to other factories where grievances over unpaid dues and annual wage increments threaten to destabilise their environment. The question is, why are factories failing to operate properly?\n\nAccording to factory owners and labour leaders, several factors are at play here: lack of export orders, inadequate support from banks, and the inability to cope with rising production costs. Many owners, especially those linked to the ousted regime, took on loans far beyond their capacity, often through duplicitous means. Enforcement of stricter measures on these loans now has exacerbated the problem. Some owners have also gone into hiding, leaving their businesses in disarray.\n\nIt is not enough to simply arrange for the payment of workers' unpaid dues. These people need jobs, which are hard to come by in the current situation, especially for women and those with disabilities. Finding employment for them and helping the struggling factories to stay afloat are equally important. We, therefore, believe the government should urgently introduce a structured financial support mechanism for them while also facilitating targeted loan restructuring programmes in collaboration with banks.\nThe Beximco crisis perfectly captures this situation: the group's total debt, according to the labour adviser, exceeds Tk 40,000 crore, including Tk 29,925 crore borrowed against 32 factories in Beximco Industrial Park. However, 16 of these factories exist only on paper and were used as collateral for loans. Given the sheer volume of its debt, the government has reportedly opted against reopening the closed factories.\n\nWhere does it leave Beximco's laid-off workers? What about the workers of other closed or soon-to-be-closed factories? It is not enough to simply arrange for the payment of their unpaid dues. These people need jobs, which are hard to come by in the current situation, especially for women and those with disabilities. Finding employment for them and helping the struggling factories to stay afloat are equally important. We, therefore, believe the government should urgently introduce a structured financial support mechanism for them while also facilitating targeted loan restructuring programmes in collaboration with banks.\n\nThat said, it is equally important to think about the future and undertake proper reforms to prevent the recurrence of such crises again. We hope the Labour Reform Commission, which is supposed to submit its recommendations to the government by February 18, will address the systemic issues that have long plagued the industrial sector. Building an environment that supports uninterrupted growth and livelihood, free from undue business and political influences, is crucial.\n",
