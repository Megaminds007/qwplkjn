Thursday\u2019s talks, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Defence Ministers Meeting in New Delhi, saw both sides reiterate their respective stands on the border issue but no meeting of minds. The Defence Minister underlined India\u2019s position that the development of ties is premised on peace on the borders. While India has continued to convey a sense of urgency to resolve the Line of Actual Control (LAC) crisis, the Chinese Defence Minister, on the other hand, called on India to \u201ctake a long-term view\u201d and \u201cplace the border issue in an appropriate position in bilateral relations\u201d, a divergence from India\u2019s stand that the rest of relations is predicated on peace along the LAC. Rajnath Singh conveyed to Beijing that if normalcy is to be restored in ties, disengagement in the two remaining friction points will need to be followed by de-escalation. This includes the eventual de-induction of the estimated one lakh troops from both sides that have remained deployed in forward areas for close to three years \u2014 a situation not seen along the India-China border in more than three decades.The disengagement process has itself been long and tortuous. Over the past three years, buffer zones have been established in some of the five friction areas where the two sides disengaged. In two other areas, Demchok and Depsang, Beijing has dragged its feet, slowing down the initial momentum of the Corps Commander meetings. The 18th round, held days before the Chinese Defence Minister\u2019s arrival and after an unexplained four month-delay following the previous round, did not yield a joint statement, suggesting stark divergences remain on how to move forward. De-escalation, meanwhile, remains a far-off prospect. This new normal along the LAC, with large deployments in close proximity as well as an on-going race to build more forward infrastructure, appears here to stay, leaving the borders in what the Indian Army Chief has described as a \u201cstable but unpredictable\u201d state. Regardless of Beijing\u2019s wishes to downplay the seriousness of the border situation and relegate it to an \u201cappropriate\u201d position, managing the LAC should certainly remain the priority for both sides to prevent the recurrence of the clashes of 2020. India and China cannot restore normalcy in relations under the shadow of lingering unpredictability on the borders.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia-China\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\ndefence",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s leading wrestlers, especially women supported by their male counterparts, have again taken to the streets in Delhi. If the first protest was during the winter in January, the latest is happening in peak summer at Jantar Mantar. That both the biting cold and the searing heat did not diminish these athletes\u2019 determination to air their sexual-harassment grievances against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) office-bearers, especially its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, is a reflection of their trauma. It also reveals their sheer despondency as even the Oversight Committee led by Olympian Mary Kom set to clean up the system, has not yielded any results. That three inconclusive months have lapsed since the first public complaint is another pointer to the inhumane reaction that often trails sexual-harassment allegations. First there is silence from people in authority, then there are furious denials, and third, insinuations are allowed to seep in about the victim\u2019s morality. Brij Bhushan may have stepped aside from the day-to-day functioning of the WFI but this sports administrator, essentially a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, has enough clout to stymie efforts to prise him out from the federation.Wrestling harks back to India\u2019s rural heartland, especially North India, and is seen by sportspersons as an opportunity to escape the suffocating feudal atmosphere. The trust in a coach or official borders on blind devotion and this trait gets exploited. To not accept gender-violence as a sordid reality and to sweep it under the political-rivalry carpet does no good to Indian sport. This is not about the central government pitted against the opposition; it is about fairness in dealing with athletes. The Indian Olympic Association president, P.T. Usha, an icon for many, made it worse by stating that the athletes are tarnishing the country\u2019s image. Be it Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik or Bajrang Punia, who have led the protests, their quest for justice and desire for a complete overhaul of the WFI structure are genuine endeavours. The Supreme Court\u2019s directive that forced the Delhi Police to lodge a first information report against Brij Bhushan is a step in the right direction. More was expected from the larger sporting fraternity but with the exception of Olympic gold medallists Abhinav Bindra and Neeraj Chopra, the rest, especially the much-feted cricketers, have responded feebly. Kapil Dev and a few other players besides Sania Mirza voiced their concern through social media. But these remain the few volleys of resistance. India\u2019s medal-winning wrestlers deserve better.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nsport\n\n/\n\nsexual assault & rape\n\n/\n\nathletics\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nOlympics\n\n/\n\npolice",

        "full_article": "Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) joined other civil society organisations in suing a US state that had banned abortion clinics. In the recent past, the ACLU has sued various US governments on issues ranging from the use of helicopters to monitor protests to social media surveillance of immigrants. ACLU uses over half of its substantial $200 million annual budget to fund litigation related to civil liberties.\nMany Americans find organisations like the ACLU unnecessarily anti-establishment. But their very presence enriches the democratic process, leading to robust discussions about the country\u2019s policies \u2014 in courts, in the media, and on the streets. They ask difficult questions, compel governments to provide answers, and \u2014in the process \u2014 improve the quality of governance in the country.\n\nWhile India has many noteworthy organisations on both the left and right that fight these battles, they do not have the supportive ecosystem that similar American non-profits have. To the contrary, they often face aggressive questions about their purpose, motivations and efficiency. This scepticism prevents them from raising adequate funding which, in turn, keeps them trapped in a low-level equilibrium.\nTo be clear, Indians are not stingy donors. A study estimates that individuals contributed over Rs 33,000 crore to philanthropy in FY22, with high-net-worth individuals contributing another Rs 29,000 crore. In addition, Indian companies spent over Rs 25,000 crore as corporate social responsibility grants. However, Indian philanthropy focusses on a narrow set of issues. Almost all individual donations go to either religious institutions or to beggars, whereas over 60% of corporate donations go to education, healthcare and rural development.\nIt is worth asking whether Indian philanthropy should focus this heavily on areas where governments are the primary service providers? In doing so, are we inadvertently condoning poor service by government departments? Instead, should private wealth fund those who are working on issues that are unlikely to see government funding? Asking such questions might help us broaden the scope of philanthropy in our country. For example, nearly 10% of all philanthropy in the US goes to research and civil rights organisations, with it being one of the fastest-growing sub-segments within philanthropy.\nIn contrast, Indian NGOs that work on these issues remain under-funded. India\u2019s leading digital rights non-profit, for example, has a budget that is a measly 0.05% of ACLU\u2019s. The primary reason for this is the extent of deprivation in basic healthcare, education, and incomes in India. It is difficult to convince donors to give money for civil liberties when they can instead educate a poor child or feed our homeless co-citizens. Understandably, all of India\u2019s largest NGOs \u2014 some of which have budgets in the hundreds of crores per year \u2014 focus on these needs.\nMoreover, many surveys have shown that Indians trust NGOs less than they trust governments or businesses. Consequently, we prefer to donate to causes whose impact is immediate, visible and verifiable. In comparison, research and advocacy organisations\u2019 impact is long-term, not measurable, and often subjective. Critics accuse them of funding a \u2018five-star lifestyle\u2019 for their management. Hence, even the little funding they get is often tied to specific projects, rather than as unrestricted funds that they can invest in their long-term growth. While a US think-tank typically receives 40%-60% of its funds unrestricted, the corresponding number for India is usually 10%-30%.\nThere are also more structural reasons for the narrow focus in Indian philanthropy. For example, the government\u2019s own Economic Survey in 2021 noted that our economy is over-regulated. The stroke of a bureaucratic pen can make or break commercial destinies. When government action is so central to their financial interests, India\u2019s business elites are reluctant to risk antagonising governments, irrespective of the party in office. Why incur the wrath of regulatory gods when you can donate to religious institutions and earn divine blessings instead?\nTheir caution stands in stark contrast with the US, where large donors such as the Koch brothers on the right and George Soros on the left are able to freely fund research and advocacy organisations without fear of economic reprisal from governments of a different political shade.\nAs the early gains from our economic reforms start petering out, the urgency with which India needs to explore new ideas has never been higher. We are also entering a few decades of tectonic societal changes, with technology and AI poised to transform our society irreversibly. It will throw up many complex questions to which we have no answers today. Only a broader vision of philanthropy \u2014 which supports those at the forefront of these debates, irrespective of their political leaning \u2014 will equip us to answer the big questions of nation-building.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The government's ambitious energy policy over the past decade increasingly appears to have been built on irregularities, inefficiencies, and a lack of accountability of various stakeholders. A recent study conducted by the Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network (CLEAN) explains why, despite generating 58 percent more than what we need, there are still power shortages in the country. It notes that of the 150-157 active power plants currently in operation, only 39.8 percent are running properly. A whopping one-third of the fossil-fuel-based power plants were found to be faulty, with 18 percent suffering some form of mechanical problems. Out of the 43 state-owned power plants, as many as 22 were found sitting idle for more than half the time, while nine out of 23 publicly owned independent plants suffered fuel crises for approximately 40 percent of the time.\nSince the current government came to power, it has increased the country's electricity generation fivefold, reducing load-shedding dramatically (till it reappeared in our lives last year). To do so, it built fossil-fuel-fired power plants \u2013 often ignoring protests from activists about their harmful impacts on the surrounding communities and environment \u2013 and gave permission to set up quick rental power plants across the country. A decade later, it appears we never really needed all of these power plants. In fact, we have been paying an incomprehensible amount of money as capacity charges for many of these plants to essentially sit idle every year. The CLEAN study found that the 12 worst performing plants, which stayed out of operation or faced technical difficulties for the longest time, were actually paid Tk 2,336 crore in capacity charges in the past year alone.\nThe study also found that the solar power plants ran without problems for 97.8 percent of the time, and that if we replaced the liquid fuel-based power plants during the day with solar, we could have saved $322.15 million every year. The question is: why are we still operating and investing in fossil-fuel-based power plants when cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient alternatives are available?\nIt is horrifying that the government invested so much money in establishing these power plants, without proper planning to begin with, and then did not even bother to ensure their smooth operation. At a time when the country is suffering from the worst economic crisis in over a decade, what possible justification can there be for such wastage of public funds? Instead of focusing on reducing the many inefficiencies in the energy sector, the authorities, unfortunately, seem bent on rewarding poor performers and passing down the ever-escalating costs of power generation to the consumers. Over the past year, we have not seen any indication that the government will move away from this course of action.\nWe urge the government to rethink its current policy, take urgent steps to phase out non-performing power plants, and address the inefficiencies that are driving electricity prices upwards for consumers. We would like to ask them to open their eyes \u2013 the statistics quoted above speak for themselves.\n",

From the struggle for independence from British colonial rule to the fight for workers' rights and better working conditions, the labour movement has played a critical role in shaping the country's political and economic landscape.\nHere is a comprehensive timeline of the labour movement in Bangladesh, highlighting key events and milestones that have shaped the movement's trajectory. From the early days of colonial rule to the present day, the timeline documents the challenges and successes faced by workers in their quest for justice and dignity. By examining the historical context of the labour movement, we hope to shed light on the ongoing struggles faced by workers in Bangladesh and inspire further action towards a more equitable future.\n\u2013Priyam Paul & Shamsuddoza Sajen, The Daily Star\nApril 16, 1853\n\nThe beginning of the modern industrial worker in the Indian Subcontinent is marked by the inauguration of the railway line from Mumbai to Thane.\nApril-May, 1862\n\nIndian railway men of Howrah Railway Station joined the first ever strike demanding an 8-hours-a-day working hour.\n1870\nSashipada Banerjee established the Working Men's Club which is considered to be the first labour organization in Bengal. In the same year, he started publishing Bharat Sramajibi (Indian Laborers), a journal exclusively devoted to the labourers, from Kolkata.\n1881\nWith the aim of improving the working conditions of laborers, the Indian Factories Act was enacted. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 7 and set a limit of nine hours for their daily work. It was enforced on July 1, 1881.\n1891\n\nThe Indian Factories Act of 1881 underwent an amendment that included a provision for a weekly holiday. The revised Act also restricted the employment of women and children to the period between 5 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening, with a maximum daily working period of eleven hours for women. The minimum age for child labor was raised from 7 to 9 years, and the maximum daily working hours for children were capped at seven.\n1905\nThe Swadesi movement, which arose in protest of the Partition of Bengal, provided a significant boost to the development of local industries in the region. Swadesi workers urged people to refrain from using cloth made in Lancashire or Manchester Cotton Mills. This period also saw the emergence of labour activism, with some leaders championing the cause of industrial workers to advance political agitation. In 1905, the Printers' Union was established in Calcutta. A series of strikes erupted in various mills and railways, particularly in the Eastern Bengal State Railways.\nNov-Dec, 1907\n\nRailway Strike in Bengal demanding wage increase. They succeeded to get a famine allowance.\n1908\nThe Mohini Cotton Mill was established in Kushtia, East Bengal, with the Swadeshi spirit.\n1911\nThe Indian Factories Act underwent an amendment that introduced the first legislative restrictions on men's working hours, fixing a 12-hour workday. Additionally, the amended act emphasized the significance of ensuring the health and safety of workers. It is worth noting that these positive changes were a direct result of the workers' long struggle.\n1919\nILO adopted its first convention on limited hours of work and adequate rest periods for workers.\nOctober 17, 1920\n\nIndian Communist Party was established in Tashkent.\nOctober 31, 1920\nAll India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was established. It provided an early backbone to trade unions in East Bengal.\nMay- August, 1921\n\nMulluk Cholo Movement. On May 20, 1921, colonial troops brutally attacked tea workers who were stranded at Chandpur railway station, reminiscent of the Jallianwala Bag massacre. The workers, seeking to escape serfdom, abandoned the tea estates in Chargola and Longlai valleys in Sylhet and marched en masse towards their hometowns. This mass exodus caused political upheaval for nearly three months, from May 3 to August 3, 1921. The tea workers' widespread strike was soon followed by equally significant strikes by workers of the Assam Bengal Railways and Inland Steamer Navigation.\nDecember, 1922\nMN Roy presented a programme of action which included the following demands: (1) Establishment of minimum wages in all industries through legislation;\u00a0 (2) Implementation of an eight-hour workday, limited to five and a half days a week, for male adults. Special regulations would be put in place for women and child labour; (3) Employers would be legally required to provide workers with a certain standard of comfort in regards to housing, working conditions, and medical aid; (4) Protective legislation would be enacted to provide old age, sickness, and unemployment insurance for all industries; (5) Recognition of labour organisations as legal entities, with workers' right to strike in order to enforce their demands; (6) Establishment of workers' councils in all major industries to defend labour rights, with the state providing protection for their function; and (7) Introduction of profit-sharing schemes in all large industries.\n1923\n\nThe Workmen's Compensation Act was enacted, which required businesses to provide compensation to employees who suffer work-related injuries resulting in disability or death.\n1926\nThe Trade Unions Act was passed, which made provisions for the registration of trade unions and defined the law related to registered trade unions in certain respects.\n1936\n\nThe Payment of Wages Act was enacted to regulate the payment of wages to certain classes of persons employed in industry.\n1939\nThe Maternity Benefit Act was passed, which prohibits the employment of a female worker for six weeks before and six weeks after delivery.\n1945\nSreehatta Zilla Cha Sramik Union (Tea Estates) was established as a member union of AITUC.\nMay, 1946\nFaridpur District Cycle Rickshaw Drivers Union was formed. September 28, 1947 the Eastern Pakistan Trade Union Federation (EPTUF) was formed with Dr. AM Malik as president and Faiz Ahmad as secretary. The EPTUF was created based on a resolution adopted by the AITUC General Council in Mumbai on September 5, 1947, which stated that the partition of India into two states would not affect the class unity and solidarity of workers fighting against capitalism under the AITUC banner. The EPTUF became the most prominent representative organization for workers in industrial and commercial establishments in East Pakistan.\nMarch 3, 1949\n\nAfter unsuccessful discussions with the university administration regarding their demands, the fourth-class employers of Dhaka University began a strike that lasted for one month.\n1950\nEstablished in Narayanganj, Adamjee Jute Mill was once among the largest jute mills in the world. However, it ceased operations in 2002.\n1953\nAdamjee Jute Mills Union was formed.\nMay, 1954\n\nRiots broke out between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in Adamjee Jute Mills, resulting in hundreds of deaths. This was followed by similar riots in Karnaphuli Paper Mills and Ispahani Match Works.\nAugust, 1955\nPakistan government announced its first Labour Policy.\n1956\nThe Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 was amended to incorporate Section 33-A, which aimed to provide a speedy remedy to employees in dispute and protect them from any victimization for raising such issues.\nOctober 8, 1958\nThe imposition of Martial Law dealt a major setback to all forms of trade union activities, with strikes being effectively banned during Ayub's regime.\n1964\nPurba Pakistan Chatkal Workers Federation was established in Dhaka and called for a strike that lasted 22 days and was observed in five industries, including Adamjee. The strike proved to be successful, but when the authorities failed to fulfill the workers' demands despite initial commitments, the workers went on a 45-day-long strike. In the end, the workers were able to achieve their demands, demonstrating the strength of the trade union movement.\n1965\nThe Pakistan government ratified an ILO convention that guaranteed the formation of trade unions and the right of workers to engage in collective bargaining.\nJune 7, 1966\nThe Awami League's Six-Point Programme was widely supported in the industrial areas of Narayanganj, Tejgaon, Tongi, and Chittagong, leading to widespread protests and strikes. Police resorted to firing in these areas, resulting in the deaths of several workers. In defiance of the imposition of Section 144, workers from the Narayanganj industrial area organized a procession towards Dhaka.\n1969\nThe workers in East Pakistan played a significant role in the Gherao Movement and the mass uprising that resulted in the downfall of Ayub Khan's dictatorship.\n1970\nNur Khan labour policy introduced.\n1971\nWorkers played a pivotal role in the Liberation War. The ILO/SIDA Mission Report (1973) observed: The bulk of the labour force had joined the war of liberation as the working class had come to realise that the key to their true emancipation was the liberation of their motherland from the monopoly rule of the \"22 families\" and they fought the enemy successfully. The success in their struggle for liberation was accompanied with a high sense of expectation.\nMarch, 1972\nBangladesh Government nationalised all the major industries in the country.\nJune 1, 1973\nThe government established wage commission.\nJanuary, 1975\nThe government imposed a ban on all strikes and lockouts.\nMay, 1976\nWorkers' agitation in Dhaka and Comilla region.

This alliance played a crucial role in the Anti-Ershad movement and exerted pressure on the military government to lift the embargo on trade union activities. As a result of SKOP's efforts, the Ershad regime was compelled to permit trade union activities once again.\nMarch 1, 1984\nThe government agents killed Tajul Islam, the trade union leader of Adamjee Jute Mill. In response to this murder, a complete strike was observed in Adamjee Jute Mill.\nDecember 6, 1990\nFall of the dictatorial rule of Ershad. Workers play a crucial role in the anti-Ershad movement.\nJanuary 7, 1995\nSKOP issues 8-point demands that urges the government to respect and implement the agreement signed on July 6,1992 and later with the labour organisation of different industries.\nJune 20, 2000\nSKOP called 24-hour strike demanding national minimum wage structure which is yet to be formed.\n2006\nEnactment of Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006\nNovember 24, 2012\nAt least 117 killed in a fire in Tazreen Fashion factory.\nApril 24, 2013\nThe collapse of Rana Plaza resulted in the deaths of 1,132 people and injuries to over 2,500 others.

        "full_article": "After months of speculation and anticipation, Bangladesh has unveiled its \"Indo-Pacific Outlook (IPO),\" which \"envisions a free, open, peaceful, secure, and inclusive Indo-Pacific for the shared prosperity for all.' The United States, which originally conceived and floated the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS), has been urging Bangladesh for the last few years to join them in implementing the IPS. Though Bangladesh doesn't use the term strategy or IPS, the vision it lays out is remarkably similar to the IPS.\nIf we review the joint statement made on June 2, 2022 after the second Bangladesh-US High-Level Economic Consultation held in Washington, it would be difficult to differentiate the language. The joint statement under the subhead Infrastructure/Trade reads, \"Both countries share a common vision of a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and secure Indo-Pacific region with shared prosperity for all.\"\nThese words have been repeated innumerable times by the US officials to define both the IPS and Quad, another smaller alliance among the US, Australia, Japan and India. On July 28, 2021, after the US-India Strategic partnership dialogue held in Delhi, US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken said, \"We share a vision \u2013 India and the United States \u2013 of a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We'll work together to make that vision a reality.\"\nSecretary Blinken amplified this vision again in his recent Asia tour that included the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in Tokyo. Before going to Tokyo, he visited Hanoi and on April 15, he said, \"Our countries can advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is at peace and grounded in respect for the rules-based international order. When we talk about 'free and open,' we mean countries being free to choose their own path and their own partners and that problems will be dealt with openly; rules will be reached transparently and applied fairly; and goods, ideas, and people will flow freely across land, the seas, the skies, and cyberspace.\"\nRules-based international order, free flow of goods, capital, services and people, across the seas, the skies and cyberspace are all included in the objectives set by Bangladesh in its outlook. The Bangladesh-Japan Joint Statement on Strategic Partnership issued after the formal talks between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio on April 26 also provides some idea as to why our foreign ministry chose to publish its IPO prior to her three-nation tour \u2013 to Japan, the US and the UK. All these three nations have significant roles in pursuing the policy of open and free Indo-Pacific with a shared goal of countering China's growing political, economic, and military power.\nIt's worth noting that the Bangladesh-Japan joint statement begins with the two prime ministers' reaffirmation of \"their commitment to realising a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law, where the rights, freedoms and sovereignty of all countries, regardless of size or power, are protected by international law, rules and norms.\" They particularly affirmed that \"maritime order based on common values such as freedom of navigation is a cornerstone for stability and prosperity of the international community and that the use of the sea as global commons will contribute to the development of (the) blue economy.\"\nSimilar objectives had been expressed earlier in the joint statement issued at the Second Bangladesh-US High-Level Economic Consultation. The statement added that the US briefed Bangladesh on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), and Bangladesh welcomed additional information on the supply chain resilience and decarbonisation pillars of the IPEF. Bangladesh also sought US technical assistance to sustainably explore its ocean resources and further develop its blue economy, it noted.\n\nThe unveiling of the Indo-Pacific Outlook has been broadly welcomed by many Bangladeshi analysts and diplomats, who have pointed out that it is based on the dictum \"Friendship towards all, malice towards none.\" Whether this dictum would be enough to address the Chinese concern about committing to the objectives of rules-based order and a free and open Indo-Pacific has to be seen in the coming days.\nAll these interactions took place well after China's warning of \"substantial damage\" to ties if Bangladesh joined the US-led Quad alliance. On May 10, 2021, the then Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming said Bangladesh should not join Quad, and if it did, then Dhaka's relations with Beijing would \"substantially get damaged.\" Terming Quad a military alliance aimed against China's resurgence and its relationship with neighbours, he claimed Bangladesh would not derive any benefits from the initiative.\nAll these statements and documents clearly show that keeping trade routes between Asia and the rest of the world free, open, and secure is at the core of the Indo-Pacific strategy or outlook. How China appears on the opposite side of the new strategic convergence of other nations is perhaps being better portrayed in the recent cat-and-mouse sea chase in the South China Sea. A BBC journalist, who witnessed and recorded the encounter on April 23, said a Chinese Coast Guard ship blocked a Philippine patrol vessel, causing a near collision in the waters near Second Thomas Shoal in the remote Spratly archipelago. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands, which is also claimed in part by the Philippines.\nChina still maintains its claim defying the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in favour of the Philippines. There are also competing claims by Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, and Taiwan. The sea encounter took place just a day after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr met Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Manila, and expressed hope for open communication lines on the South China Sea dispute. Similar territorial disputes exist between China and Japan in the East China Sea.\nThe unveiling of the Indo-Pacific Outlook has been broadly welcomed by many Bangladeshi analysts and diplomats, who have pointed out that it is based on the dictum \"Friendship towards all, malice towards none.\" Whether this dictum would be enough to address the Chinese concern about committing to the objectives of rules-based order and a free and open Indo-Pacific has to be seen in the coming days.\nThere are also suggestions that this policy is aimed at making up with the US as the latter's insistence on making the next parliamentary elections free and fair and criticisms over human rights abuses and press freedom in Bangladesh have caused some strain in the bilateral relations. But the question is even if there was such an intent, whether that would have enough soothing effect.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist. His Twitter handle is @ahmedka1\n\n",

        "full_article": "The government's ambitious energy policy over the past decade increasingly appears to have been built on irregularities, inefficiencies, and a lack of accountability of various stakeholders. A recent study conducted by the Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network (CLEAN) explains why, despite generating 58 percent more than what we need, there are still power shortages in the country. It notes that of the 150-157 active power plants currently in operation, only 39.8 percent are running properly. A whopping one-third of the fossil-fuel-based power plants were found to be faulty, with 18 percent suffering some form of mechanical problems. Out of the 43 state-owned power plants, as many as 22 were found sitting idle for more than half the time, while nine out of 23 publicly owned independent plants suffered fuel crises for approximately 40 percent of the time.\nSince the current government came to power, it has increased the country's electricity generation fivefold, reducing load-shedding dramatically (till it reappeared in our lives last year). To do so, it built fossil-fuel-fired power plants \u2013 often ignoring protests from activists about their harmful impacts on the surrounding communities and environment \u2013 and gave permission to set up quick rental power plants across the country. A decade later, it appears we never really needed all of these power plants. In fact, we have been paying an incomprehensible amount of money as capacity charges for many of these plants to essentially sit idle every year. The CLEAN study found that the 12 worst performing plants, which stayed out of operation or faced technical difficulties for the longest time, were actually paid Tk 2,336 crore in capacity charges in the past year alone.\nThe study also found that the solar power plants ran without problems for 97.8 percent of the time, and that if we replaced the liquid fuel-based power plants during the day with solar, we could have saved $322.15 million every year. The question is: why are we still operating and investing in fossil-fuel-based power plants when cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient alternatives are available?\nIt is horrifying that the government invested so much money in establishing these power plants, without proper planning to begin with, and then did not even bother to ensure their smooth operation. At a time when the country is suffering from the worst economic crisis in over a decade, what possible justification can there be for such wastage of public funds? Instead of focusing on reducing the many inefficiencies in the energy sector, the authorities, unfortunately, seem bent on rewarding poor performers and passing down the ever-escalating costs of power generation to the consumers. Over the past year, we have not seen any indication that the government will move away from this course of action.\nWe urge the government to rethink its current policy, take urgent steps to phase out non-performing power plants, and address the inefficiencies that are driving electricity prices upwards for consumers. We would like to ask them to open their eyes \u2013 the statistics quoted above speak for themselves.\n",

        "full_article": "We are quite concerned about how ill-equipped the Fire Service and Civil Defence (FSCD) is to deal with the growing threat of fire in our cities, especially the capital. While the number of fire incidents doubled in the last 14 years thanks to unplanned urbanisation \u2013 it was 12,182 in 2009, which swelled to 24,102 by 2022 \u2013 the capacity of the fire service hasn't grown concomitantly. This is quite frustrating.\nThere is no doubt that firefighting has become much more difficult these days. Firefighters have to deal with traffic on their way to a scene, often navigating through narrow streets ill-fitted for large vehicles. Then there is the challenge of finding water in a city with few ponds and lakes. Once on location, they also have to deal with curious onlookers crowding round the scene, and the increasingly tricky fire situations putting their life at greater risk, as seen in some recent incidents. Against such a backdrop, it is unacceptable that the firefighters would also be hamstrung by institutional challenges such as lack of training and proper equipment, manpower crisis, budget constraints, etc.\nIt is partly because of these problems that 14 firemen were killed and 225 injured while on duty over the last five years, according to an estimate. These challenges have been highlighted in a recent report by this daily which shows how the fire service is being overwhelmed by the triple whammy of increased fire incidents, increased external challenges, as well as internal issues. One of the issues that has been flagged is the lack of training and specialisation. Firefighters need both advanced and specialised training. As a former fire chief has said, there should be specialised teams within the fire department to tackle different kinds of fire situations. \"Police or Rab have their specialised units like the bomb disposal unit or cybercrime unit, but for firefighters, there are no specialised units,\" he said.\nGiven the current situation, there is a dire need for increasing budgetary support to the FSCD as well as recruiting and training more firefighters. In the current fiscal year, the FSCD got a budget of around Tk 733.57 crore, which translates to around Tk 44 per capita. For context, this is far less than what the Delhi state government spends (around Tk 332) or West Bengal spends (around Tk 65) per capita. Also, in any modern city, the ratio of police and firemen should be 2:1, meaning one firefighter against two policemen. In Bangladesh, however, there are less than 14,000 firefighters against 2.13 lakh cops. These people \u2013 as first responders to any fire, explosion, road crash, landslide, launch capsize or any other calamity \u2013 have to endure physical and mental trauma on a regular basis.\nThey need more, not less, support, and not just financial. Before expecting them to save citizens from every calamity imaginable, we need to create a conducive environment for them to function well, both for their sake and that of the wider society. We, therefore, urge the higher authorities to properly fund, equip and train the fire service so that it can serve us better going forward.\n",

        "full_article": "May Day or the International Workers' Day stands for the workers' victory over exploitation and injustice. It began as a day to express solidarity with workers in 1889 by the International Federation of Socialist Groups and trade unions. It is the commemoration of the violent Hay Market workers' uprising in 1886 in Chicago, USA. On May 4, the police attack on industrial workers demanding 8-hour working day led to violent demonstrations and clashes in which 10 workers were killed in police firing.The May Day has by now lost much of its appeal because of a relentless march of free market economy and unrestrained consumerism. Though celebrated as a day of achievements in the labour rights sector of this country, it is also one of overview of the failures and disillusionments that came by in the course of various movements. However, the nature of labour movements has gone through changes over time. In its long course, the bellicosity has largely been dropped to make way for dialogue and deliberations. The earlier intransigence has been replaced by careful negotiations between the unions and employers. The days of jute and cotton mills have long been over. The country's industrial sector is presently dominated by the readymade garments (RMG) and the allied industries. After decades of agitations over and demand for the minimum wages by the RMG workers, a semblance of calm prevails in the sector now. However, sporadic eruptions of grievances and protest demonstrations still continue over a number of unresolved issues.Clearly, in the context of market volatility, the minimum wages should be raised. Since the workplace environment is yet to be conducive to workers' welfare, more needs to be done to improve the standard of factories. The survivors of the Rana Plaza tragedy with or without grievous injuries have yet to get back their jobs or avail other sources of income. The devastated relatives of the dead still desperately await compensations. The trade unions and the labour rights activists had put in the best of their efforts in seeking justice for the survivors. But those proved futile.Creating the right environment for the workers to have their basic demands met comprises the core of the May Day message. In the developed parts of the world, strongly united workers' movements hardly fail to compel the authorities to bow down to the legitimate demands. In most of the developing countries, it is the authorities' inflexible stance not to yield to the workers' demands that gets the better of workers' rights. Workers are exploited in more ways than one. The factory owners fail to understand that aggrieved workers are unlikely to put in their best. Thus productivity fails to reach the desired level. Bangladesh is no exception. Then there are many other workers' groups in the informal sector, which are not even considered a working class to deserve their rights and privileges. They are not covered by trade unions. The labour law should cover such workers in order to dispense justice for such socially vulnerable working groups.",

        "full_article": "That the government has at last taken necessary steps to rescue Bangladeshis trapped in the war-torn Sudan is definitely a commendable move. But it should have come earlier. Of some 1,500 Bangladeshis in that country, about 700 have, it is learnt, expressed their willingness to return home. Bangladesh's diplomatic office in Sudan is doing its job well as it has arranged buses to move Bangladeshis stranded there first to port Sudan, about 850 kilometres away from Khartoum. From there they will be taken to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia before they would be flown home. In fact, Sudan is one of the world's poorest countries situated in northeast Africa. It is not exactly a destination of migrant workers from Bangladesh or any other country. Even so, it is used as a conduit by international gangs for trafficking overseas jobseekers illegally through neighboring Libya to other countries including Europe. It is a dangerous journey using ramshackle vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the European coast.The present situation in Sudan is not safe either for the local people or foreigners. Both local civilian population and non-locals are fleeing the country. Meanwhile, caught in the crossfire, more than 400 people have died, while thousands have been injured. Worse yet, essential services including water supply, power and health service have been severely disrupted. Hundreds of thousands of people as a result have been fleeing Sudan and seeking refuge in the neighbouring countries. Such a situation has arisen because of the ongoing battle for supremacy in Sudan between the country's army chief Abdel Fattah Burhan, the de facto ruler of the country and his deputy, General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, the chief of the country's paramilitary force,the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The battle has taken such a nasty turn that the army has resorted to airstrikes against the RSF fighters, who have taken positions in populated areas of the country's capital, Khartoum and nearby cities including Bahri and Ombdurman. On the face of it, the disagreement between the two generals seems to be over the process of the country's transition to a civilian rule and incorporation of 100,000-strong RSF into the army. But basically, it is yet another spell of bloody face-off involving power-hungry generals that began since the country got its freedom from colonial rule in 1956. The transitional government that was formed following the overthrow of the three decades long military rule of Omar al-Bashir in 2019 was again toppled in a military coup in 2021 by the present army chief, Burhan. The RSF head, Hemedti, had been his close associate in running the affairs of the country since. General Burhan took power from the long-time military ruler Omar Bashir when the people of Sudan were engaged in street battles against the dictator. Obviously, General Burhan justified his takeover with a promise of ultimately handing over power to an elected civilian government. But to all intents and purposes that is not going to happen. It is said that the military acted when the RSF deployed its men at different points in the country in its (RSF's) bid to take control of the country's economic assets including gold mines. This clearly points to the fact that Sudan has remained a poor country because its people could never exercise their right over the nation's resources. Why should a country be poor when it has gold mines? Apart from gold, it has also other mineral resources like zinc, nickel, aluminum, lead, cobalt, gypsum, chromite, phosphates and more. Unfortunately, no African country rich in mineral resources could ever see political stability since they got their political freedom from their erstwhile colonial rulers. Sudan is no exception. The post-colonial indigenous rulers, be they army men or politicians have in most cases been self-serving, power-hungry and corrupt people. In collusion with strong business lobbies of the countries that once ruled them, these post-colonial rulers never allowed the common people to have their say in the affairs of their own country. So, they remained poor. Many of these post-colonial rulers were great nationalists and revolutionaries during the time of anti-colonial struggles. But once in power, they forgot the promise they earlier made to their people. Perhaps with the exception of Nelson Mandela of South Africa, most other liberation heroes of Africa failed their people. Consider the state of post-Mandela South Africa, or Zimbabwe or the Democratic Republic of Congo where fifty per cent of the world's gold reserves lie. Not only gold, Africa is also home to most other precious minerals including platinum, uranium, diamond, copper, cobalt, and, not to mention oil. The continent also has large tracts of agricultural land and sources of freshwater. But extreme poverty, social strife and military coups seem to be synonymous with Africa. At the moment, Sudan is perhaps going through its worst moment in history. In the words of its former prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, the present clash in Sudan is not just between the army and a rebel group. On the contrary, it is more like between two armies, well-trained and well-armed. The country risks degenerating into a condition now prevailing in Syria, Libya, Ethiopia and Somalia.So, before Sudan turns into another Ethiopia or, worse, Somalia, the world must act and act fast. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The heated up market volatility of Ramadan usually cools down a little bit in the post-Eid period. But this time there is no relief for the consumers. Market has become exceptionally jittery particularly for two commodities in high demand in the month of siam (self-abnegation) along with yet another unlikely one. These two items are onion and sugar. A kilogram of onion before the Eid-ul-Fitr was priced at Tk35-40 but it is now dearer by at least Tk 20. The price has suddenly shot up to Tk55-60 depending on quality. Sugar is supposed to be sold at the retailed shops at the government-fixed price of Tk 104 a kilogram but a consumer has to buy it at Tk 130. What is even more surprising is the sudden leap in price of potato from its pre-Eid price tag of Tk 25-30 to Tk40-50 a kilo. Market intervention prior to and during Ramadan helped arrest the prices of the more common items from going irrationally high. A classic example was the price of broiler chicken. But post-Eid price hike of onion and potato is a shocker. Potato which can be used both as an alternative to staples and vegetables in particular has experienced a dull market for years together. In fact, farmers and stockists had to incur losses because of low price of the item. There were even reports of farmers' agony and desperation over lower price of potato. Cattle were fed potato on taking delivery of their stocks from cold storages just before arrival of new harvest.So what has happened by this time that potato, which is not in a higher demand in the month of Ramadan, has become almost doubly costlier? Even there is no reason for onion to mark a price hike because this is the peak harvesting time of this crop. Then there is report that rice and wheat have at last started showing a price decline. Although prices of these two staples had started coming down in international market three months before, domestic market here defied the global trend. But unsurprisingly, the 3.0 to 6.0 per cent price decline in the wholesale market has not come into effect in the retail market for common consumers. Clearly, there is no relief from a raw deal, at the receiving end of which the consumers in this country always find themselves. But why? It is because of the absence of even the minimum business ethics here. Where outrageous profit making is the last word for an economy no matter if it requires all the guiles, intrigues and insincerity, business syndicates rule the roost. They have a sway over policymakers and people in power so much that popular agenda are often relegated to the back burner. The Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection (DNCRP) did a highly appreciable task by analysing the production cost of broiler chickens in poultry farms. That exposed the irrational profit the poultry farms were making by suddenly raising the price of this cheapest source of nutrition to record high. Thus the price of this meat was brought down from its all-time high of Tk 280-290 to Tk 210-220 a kilogram. In this age of digitisation, the prices of all imported items are a button click away. The other allied costs involving among others, import duty and transport, are also easily available. If the authorities want to serve public interests, they must overcome their weaknesses and empower the DNCRP many times over to keep a tab on all imported goods. After doing the overall costing of the essentials in particular, the price hike of which are politically and socially highly sensitive, the outrageous profit margin can be brought down through negotiation. This was done in case of broiler chicken when the four big companies of poultry farms were shown they could easily slash Tk 50 or 60 and still had a reasonable profit margin. This plan worked, so should it in case of any other commodity. But not all commodities fall in the category of the essentials. So, focus should be directed to those essentials in common and of everyday use. Where business ethics is violated with impunity, such a step will be the right answer to abrupt market volatility. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Investment banking can benefit from machine learning algorithms that analyse large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends for risk analysis, market prediction and portfolio management. Natural Language Processing can help analyse news and public sentiment to predict market fluctuations, while reinforcement of learning algorithms can optimise portfolio management strategies. In commercial banking, machine learning can be used for predictive analytics to assess credit risk and AI-powered chatbots to provide personalised financial advice based on a customer's financial goals. Mobile financial service can also leverage AI-powered fraud detection and prevention to enhance security and customer trust. At present, AI is already transforming the financial industry, opening up new business models and opportunities for financial institutions such as robo-advisory services, peer-to-peer lending platforms and digital wallets. However, with these opportunities there come challenges such as ethical use of AI, data privacy concerns, potential biases in algorithmic decision-making, need for continued upskilling of the workforce and the high cost of implementation. There is also a concern whether AI is going to replace human jobs or not. However, jobs like financial analysis, strategic planning and decision-making are less likely to be replaced by AI as they require critical thinking, creativity, and human judgment. The use of AI can assist professionals in tasks such as data analysis, risk assessment and market prediction, allowing them to make more informed and efficient decisions and reduce the risk of errors in bookkeeping. Hence, the need of financial analysts, research analysts, portfolio managers, hedge fund managers and auditors may not change that much. As AI continues to develop and improve, companies must adapt to remain competitive and the fintech sector must ensure the responsible use of this powerful technology for the betterment of the world economy. \nIfaez Amin Chowdhury, Student of Department of Accounting and Finance, School of Business and Economics, North South University, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
