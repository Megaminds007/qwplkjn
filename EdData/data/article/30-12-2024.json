The Embraer 190 was en route from Baku to Russia\u2019s Grozny when it was diverted and attempted an emergency landing some kilometres from Aktau. While initial fears centered around a bird hit, government and media reports have increasingly pointed at a misguided Russian anti-drone attack on the plane. Holes in the plane and videos of oxygen masks releasing would indicate depressurisation. The aircraft was still airborne after the attack, eventually crossing the Caspian Sea on the east, a distance of some 300 miles as the crow flies. Reports talk about the plane\u2019s control system being damaged, which would possibly explain its loopy flight paths, and permission being denied to the damaged aircraft to land in nearby airports although norms would allow a damaged civilian plane to land anywhere close. The Cockpit Voice Recorder and the Digital Flight Data Recorder have been recovered, which would reveal much information. Azerbaijan has sovereignty over the flight and the Brazilian manufacturer, Embraer, would also be party to the multi-stakeholder investigation that would reveal the cause of the accident, the course of events, and whether and how the control systems of the flight were affected. The last would indicate the role, if any, played by jamming systems that are part of air and drone defence.Azerbaijani and U.S. officials have blamed Russian air defence systems responding to a Ukrainian attack likely with drones. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologised to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev \u201cfor the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace\u201d. In this half-hearted apology, he stopped short of acknowledging active Russian involvement or that it was collateral damage to Azerbaijan, a Russian ally. That the plane was damaged nearly 500 miles from the Ukrainian border has shown the state of warfare today, in which drones and microdrones have moved centrestage as low-cost weapons capable of strikes and surveillance across broad swathes of enemy territory causing much damage deep inside enemy territory. If the Kazakhstan air crash calls for one urgent response, it is for the de-escalation of military action in the region, the success of which would depend preponderantly on Moscow\u2019s willingness to end its invasion of Ukraine and an agreement on limiting the expansion of NATO. Failure to do so now risks not only collateral damage resulting in such avoidable loss of innocent lives, but could also see more regional actors getting pulled into the conflict.

        "full_article": "Over the decades, South Korea has evolved from a brutal military dictatorship to a pro-business democracy. But this journey has also been bundled with controversies involving corruption, abuse of power and political vendetta. The impeachment of the acting President, Han Duck-soo, who took charge a few days earlier following the impeachment vote against President Yoon Suk Yeol, exemplifies the vulnerabilities in the political system. Governance has been in a paralysed state ever since Mr. Yoon became President in 2022. While he won on a thin margin, the opposition Democratic Party took control of the National Assembly. Controversies and scandals followed and his approval rating tanked to below 20%. In April this year, the Democratic Party won the legislative election again, widening its lead in Parliament. As the chasm between the presidency and the opposition-controlled National Assembly widened, Mr. Yoon declared martial law earlier this month, which triggered instant protests from political quarters and the public. In a country that still keeps the dark memories of its not-so-distant military dictatorships, his move was seen as an extreme measure aimed at torpedoing its democracy. He was impeached and Prime Minister Han stepped in as the interim leader. But his tenure has also proved short-lived.This is the first time South Korea is impeaching an interim leader. The crux of the dispute was Mr. Han\u2019s refusal to appoint three judges to fill vacancies at the nine-member Constitutional Court. According to South Korea\u2019s Constitution, a President will be stripped of powers as soon as they are impeached in Parliament but to remove them from office, at least six judges in the Constitutional Court should rule in favour of the impeachment. The opposition accused Mr. Han of delaying the constitutional process, while Mr. Han and the ruling People\u2019s Power Party argued that only an elected President has the powers to sign off appointments for the Constitutional Court. This would mean that the political and constitutional crisis is expected to persist for the foreseeable future at a time when South Korea is grappling with economic woes and also security challenges from the North. A prolonged crisis and paralysis in governance could also weaken the political institutions and empower anti-democratic forces which were in power until the late 1980s. This is perhaps the deepest crisis South Korea is facing since its transition into a democracy. Its fractious political class should prioritise constitutional stability over narrow political interests. The new acting President should strive for consensus with the key parties on appointments to the Constitutional Court and expedite the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Yoon.

        "full_article": "How US healthcare system has a magic trick\nWhile growing up in India, I always believed that US\u2019s healthcare system, much like its TV shows and roads, must be superior. After all, if it weren\u2019t, why would Indian politicians travel there for their medical treatment? Now in US, I have realised that I was conned. It\u2019s a magic trick. Just as there are two cards \u2013 one the magician displays and the other that suddenly appears from your pocket \u2013 there are also two healthcare systems in this country.\nOne is concierge healthcare. It consists of doctors and private emergency rooms that operate outside the insurance framework and can be accessed almost instantly by their clients. You have the doctor\u2019s cell number, and for any emergency care, you can drive in. When you do, you get the best healthcare science can buy. You pay in cash, no insurance. This is why you won\u2019t see Tom Hanks in a conventional emergency waiting room or find Obama trying to see a specialist, only to be told that there are no appointments available for eight months.\nThe other system is designed for everyone else, primarily those with health insurance. In this system, it is common to wait for months for an appointment, a year for a procedure, and hours to be seen by a doctor for something as routine as a ruptured appendix. While some might argue that you get what you pay for, it\u2019s important to note this is not free healthcare. Expenses are astronomical, even with the most basic insurance. For example, a visit to an emergency room for a suspected heart attack, not even a real one, can set you back around ten thousand dollars. If you do not have insurance, expenses can be multiple times higher.\nThe most insidious aspect of US\u2019s healthcare system is its lack of transparency. If you are taken to a hospital that your insurance provider considers \u2018in-network\u2019, be prepared for a flood of excessive bills from \u2018out-of-network\u2019 diagnostic labs and doctors who work at the \u2018in-network\u2019 hospital but bill separately from it and at non-insurance-negotiated rates. You may find yourself having to argue with multiple customer service representatives and navigating different billing systems. After all this, you might receive a \u2018claims denied\u2019 notice from your insurance provider, at which point you\u2019ll realise what you should have done at the very beginning. Quietly die.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Traditional medicine can\u2019t piggyride on allopathy. It will undermine trust & accountability\u00a0\nMaharashtra FDA must know its directive to retail and wholesale drug dealers \u2013 to sell allopathic medicines to homeopaths (who\u2019ve completed a certificate course in pharmacology) and service homeopaths\u2019 prescriptions of allopathic drugs \u2013 will be challenged in court, as National Medical Council is set to. In this directive, state FDA\u2019s done an about-turn. Just years ago it had raided chemists for honouring prescriptions from \u2018cross-party\u2019 practitioners. The issue\u2019s murky, given Maharashtra govt in an ordinance has included ayurveds and homeopaths as \u2018registered medical practitioners\u2019. NMC contested this too but the case is hanging fire in court, almost 10 years on.\nJudicial delay on such a crucial public health matter has allowed for frequent conflict over cross-practice and \u2018mixopathy\u2019, ending up hurting patients\u2019 interests, eroding trust in healthcare system. This is not to argue that interdisciplinary collaboration must not be pursued. On the contrary. To service all Indians, high on misinformation and dogmas, and keeping in mind accessibility and affordability, certainly traditional medicine systems have roles to play \u2013 but each in their own field. Traditional medicine is practically an unregulated sector, awash with adulteration and quackery. State govts routinely crack down on fraudulent practices \u2013 UP alone in one instance banned over 30 \u2018ayurved\u2019 products found to contain steroids, painkillers and hypoglycemic agents. Despite a ministry for all non-allopathy streams of medicine, there\u2019s no regulation, code, or licensing system for practitioners. Given this, encouraging non-allopathy medicine systems cannot mean homeopathy piggyriding on allopathy, two disciplines with vastly contrasting principles.\nWithout the rigorous education modern medicine entails, misdiagnoses, incorrect prescriptions, or lack of knowledge of adverse drug interactions can put patients at risk. It\u2019s a dilution of expertise, undermining qualifications of allopathic doctors. At the core of any health-related regulation, or policy has to be patient safety, legal clarity and accountability. To that end, FDA\u2019s directive can only cause confusion.\nRetail health is at a crossroads with the near-disappearance of the reasonably priced neighbourhood \u2018general physician\u2019 \u2013 the small clinic, everyman\u2019s go-to for routine family ailments and relief for chronic conditions. As allopathic treatment got almost entirely corporatised, and expensive, that space is largely taken over by homeopaths, ayurveds, unani practitioners. In Maharashtra\u2019s system, it will be a challenge to hold homeopaths accountable for adverse outcomes. Better than cross-prescription, it makes far more sense to create the ecosystem that can encourage collaboration between homeopathy and allopathy without overstepping professional boundaries.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "FIDE right on axing Carlsen from chess tournament. That said, dress codes are very silly\u00a0\nI do what I want,\u201d Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios said after breaking Wimbledon\u2019s all-white rule with red trainers in 2022. Chess ace Magnus Carlsen was in the same mood Friday when he chose to exit the World Rapid Chess Championship in New York rather than swap jeans \u2013 which are \u201cexplicitly prohibited\u201d \u2013 for dress pants. Unlike Kyrgios, who\u2019s never won a slam, Carlsen\u2019s stakes were higher as he\u2019s won the rapids five times and was defending his title. But any hopes he had of chess body FIDE making a concession to his greatness \u2013 he promised to wear pants the next day \u2013 were frustrated. It\u2019s rumoured that Carlsen might not be displeased with this outcome as he\u2019s got other irons in the fire. Else, he would have saved the \u201cF*** you\u201d parting shot. But even if jeans were a ruse, breaking a rule and making a virtue of it is hardly fair. FIDE has every right to enforce its rules \u201cimpartially\u201d, and it said it had made Russian grandmaster Ian Nepomniachtchi change out of sports shoes earlier in the tournament.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s also true that most dress codes are silly and shouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s hard to fathom how players in jeans undermine the gravity of chess. In 2005, US basketball body NBA tried to make suits compulsory for players at team events and flights \u2013 no sneakers, sandals, flip-flops or work boots too \u2013 to look less \u201cgangsta\u201d, forgetting that that\u2019s part of the sport\u2019s appeal. Proof: Nike\u2019s Jordan division made $7bn last year. One time, a top Indian IT firm made neckties compulsory for male staff, only to drop the rule a few years later to \u201carrest attrition\u201d. Putting form before function was never a good idea \u2013 ask the dressy minister who changed three suits in three hours on the day of Delhi\u2019s 2008 blasts. \n\n",

        "full_article": "Authored by Anil Ambani\nOn Dec 28, 1932, in Chorwad, Saurashtra, Gujarat, India, Dhirajlal Hirachand Ambani was born to Jamnaben and Hirachand Gordhanbhai Ambani, an ordinary school teacher. To the world, he was Dhirubhai Ambani, a visionary, the architect of Reliance, and the man who transformed India\u2019s entrepreneurial landscape. To me, he was my father \u2013 a guiding star, a source of boundless inspiration, and a living embodiment of resilience.\nThrough his life, I found not just lessons on business but the very essence of what it means to live purposefully and leave an indelible mark. The foundation of his greatness lay in his unshakeable faith, humility, and relentless determination. My father often found solace in the teachings of the Hanuman Chalisa, his go-to source of wisdom and strength. Like Hanuman, he believed that with faith and effort, even the seemingly impossible becomes achievable.\nOne line he frequently quoted was: \u201cBuddhiheen Tanu Jaanike, Sumirau Pavan Kumar; Bal Buddhi Vidya Dehu Mohi, Harahu Kalesh Vikaar\u201d \u2013 Understanding my limitations, I bow to Hanuman; bless me with strength, wisdom, and knowledge, and remove my flaws and grief. For him, this prayer was not just a call to Hanuman for divine help but a reminder of the infinite potential within each of us, waiting to be unlocked through persistence and faith. My father\u2019s journey from a modest Gujarati village to the pinnacle of Indian business was nothing short of a modern epic.\nStarting with a mere few rupees in his pocket, he dreamed of creating a company that would serve millions. \u201cDream big,\u201d he would always say. His belief in hard work echoed the words of Hanuman Chalisa: \u201cRam Kaj Karibe Ko Aatur\u201d \u2013 Eager to fulfil the work of Lord Ram. He approached every challenge with the same fervour \u2013 be it setting up Reliance in a world dominated by multinational giants or overcoming the cynicism of naysayers. For him, work was worship, and every obstacle was an opportunity to serve a larger purpose.\nAs his son, I had the privilege of witnessing his unwavering commitment to empowering others. He always believed that wealth is a means to create a better society, not an end in itself. He often reminded us, \u201cA leader is not the one who leads; a leader is the one who builds more leaders and can attract followers.\u201d\nThe most profound lesson I learned from him was to never lose faith in the face of adversity. Like Hanuman\u2019s leap to Lanka, his life was a testament to the idea that no distance is too far, no mountain too high, if your intentions are pure and your heart resolute. \u201cNaasai Rog Harai Sab Peera, Japat Nirantar Hanumat Beera\u201d \u2013 He destroys all ailments and suffering for those who chant his name continuously. Today, as I walk in his footsteps, I hold his lessons close to my heart. He was, and always will be, my greatest teacher \u2013 a living example of what it means to dream fearlessly, live purposefully, and lead with humility.\nMy father prayed daily to the rising sun as a sign of humility and commitment. He would say, \u201cAditya Hridayam Punyam.\u201d It reminds us that the sun is a reflection of divine strength. It teaches us courage, energy, and focus. My father would tell me, it means life will challenge you, but like the sun, rise again every day, undeterred.\nMay his spirit continue to inspire countless others to leap across their own oceans of doubt and achieve the extraordinary. When I asked my mother Kokilaben, \u201cWhy did papa leave us so suddenly?\u201d She answered calmly, \u201cYour father had done all he could here on earth \u2013 for us, for Reliance, and above all for India\u2026God wanted him to come to heaven and serve Him there.\u201d\n\n",

The stories of South Korea, China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Singapore stand as powerful testaments to this principle. These nations prioritized human capital development over physical infrastructure, understanding that educated minds and innovative ideas are the true engines of progress. Instead of focusing solely on roads, bridges, and skyscrapers, they built world-class educational institutions, fostered a culture of research, and invested in technology and knowledge-driven industries. This strategic approach enabled them to create self-sustaining economies with skilled workforces capable of driving innovation from within. Today, these countries are global leaders in manufacturing, technology, and advanced research \u2014 a testament to the transformative power of prioritizing education before infrastructure. Their success offers a clear lesson for other developing nations: lasting development is not built with bricks and mortar alone but with minds and ideas that shape the future.\nWhile Vietnam is currently following the proven path of prioritising education and research as the foundation for development, Bangladesh remains an exception. Over the past 14 years, Bangladesh has pursued a development strategy that places physical infrastructure ahead of human resource development. The fundamental flaw in this approach lies in its misplaced priorities \u2014 infrastructure requires skilled people to build, operate, and sustain it, not the other way around. By focusing on constructing nuclear power plants, satellites, bridges, and metro rail systems without first developing a pool of skilled local experts, Bangladesh has become heavily dependent on foreign engineers, consultants, and technology. These large-scale projects, financed by foreign loans, are operated and supervised by foreign experts, leaving little room for local capacity building. This approach creates a cycle of dependency, where the nation's pride in grand infrastructure is overshadowed by its reliance on external support. True progress lies in empowering local human capital, for it is skilled people who create self-reliant nations \u2014 not merely bricks, steel, and concrete.\nIt is difficult to name a single country, other than Bangladesh, that has built a nuclear power plant using foreign loans and foreign supervision without having its own world-class nuclear physicists or engineers. Likewise, launching a national satellite without the backing of skilled, homegrown engineers is nearly unheard of. Consider India as a case in point. India's rise as a technological powerhouse was not accidental \u2014 it was the result of deliberate investment in human capital. Instead of rushing to build monumental infrastructure, India focused on creating a foundation of knowledge and expertise. The establishment of world-class educational and research institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) enabled the country to produce a generation of engineers, scientists, and innovators. This approach allowed India to develop and launch its own satellites, build its metro systems, and develop its nuclear technology, all with minimal reliance on foreign expertise. The lesson is clear: a nation must first build its people before it builds its infrastructure. Without skilled human resources, infrastructure becomes a borrowed achievement \u2014 impressive to look at, but dependent and fragile at its core.\nWhy Do We Need Institutes?\n\nThe recent Nature Index ranking of the world's top 200 science cities offers a profound lesson in the power of education and research. Beijing holds the top spot, followed by Shanghai and New York, with five of the top 10 positions occupied by Chinese cities. This dominance is no coincidence. For over 30 years, China has relentlessly invested in education, research, and the development of world-class institutions. Today, multiple Chinese universities are counted among the world's top 20, reflecting the tangible returns on this long-term strategy. But the story doesn't end with China. In India, Kolkata has re-emerged as the country's No. 1 science city, ranking 84th globally \u2014 ahead of Bangalore (85th), Mumbai (98th), Delhi (124th), and Hyderabad (184th). Surprisingly, Kolkata also surpasses renowned scientific hubs like Tel Aviv, Uppsala, Glasgow, and Leipzig. How did this happen? The answer lies in the presence of well-established research institutions like the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), and Jadavpur University, which have cultivated a rich academic and research ecosystem. The success stories of Beijing, Shanghai, and Kolkata underscore a simple but vital truth: nations and cities that prioritise education and invest in top-tier institutes do not just compete \u2014 they lead. Institutes are not mere buildings; they are crucibles of innovation, talent, and discovery. Without them, no nation can hope to achieve lasting progress or global influence in science, technology, or industry.\nThe Power of World-Class Research Institutions\nThe backbone of any nation's scientific and technological progress lies in its research institutions. Take India, for example, where institutions like the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), S.N. Bose National Center for Basic Sciences, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics have played a pivotal role in propelling the country's scientific standing. These institutions boast world-class researchers, robust PhD and postdoctoral programs, attractive research facilities, competitive salaries for scholars, and collaborative research environments. Their contributions are consistently recognized in leading international journals like Physical Review Letters, Nature, and Science, underscoring their global impact.\nIn stark contrast, Bangladesh does not have a single world-class research institute. The absence of strong PhD and postdoctoral programs and a limited pool of internationally competitive researchers has hindered the country's ability to make a mark in the global scientific arena. This is a critical gap in development strategy. Nations like the United States became superpowers not merely because of natural resources but because they built educational and research giants like MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Caltech, and Stanford. Similarly, South Korea has the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Japan has the National Institute of Natural Sciences, and India has the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). Even Vietnam, once seen as a developing nation, has established advanced research institutions and is already reaping the benefits.\nThe lesson is clear: nations that prioritise education and research institutions create a self-sustaining cycle of innovation, skilled human resources, and technological independence. For Bangladesh to break free from its reliance on foreign expertise and loans for major projects, it must invest in building its own world-class research institutions. Without them, the dream of self-sufficiency in science, technology, and industry will remain out of reach.\nWhat About Bangladesh's Universities?\n\nBangladesh currently has around 150 universities, but do we have enough competent faculty members to staff even 50 of them? The shortage of qualified teachers is a critical issue that threatens the quality of education in the country. In addition to these universities, over 800 colleges under the National University offer honors and master's degrees, essentially functioning as universities themselves. For perspective, consider Imperial College London \u2014 though it is called a \"college,\" it ranks among the world's top 10 universities due to its world-class faculty and research resources. In Bangladesh, however, there is a growing trend to convert large colleges into universities under the misguided belief that a name change alone will ensure academic excellence.\nBut where are the qualified teachers to support this expansion? Without creating a robust pipeline of highly trained faculty members, no university can hope to achieve world-class status. Bangladesh needs to focus on developing world-class research institutes that can train scholars who will eventually become the next generation of professors. The key to this transformation lies in nurturing excellence, not merely expanding quantity.\nWhat Kind of Institute Do We Need?\nTo build a world-class research institute, Bangladesh needs to create an environment conducive to deep thinking, research, and reflection. Here's a vision for what such an institute should look like:\n\u2022\u00a0 Natural Setting: The institute should be designed like a serene park, filled with trees, birdsong, and tranquil spaces. Research and creativity thrive in natural, peaceful environments.\n\u2022\u00a0 Collaborative Spaces: Outdoor benches under trees where researchers can reflect and engage in deep intellectual conversations should be a feature of the campus. Genius often emerges from moments of quiet reflection.\n\u2022\u00a0 Comfortable Accommodation: The institute should have a world-class guest house to host visiting scholars from abroad. Comfortable accommodation is essential to attract and retain international collaborators.\n\u2022\u00a0 State-of-the-Art Research Facilities: Advanced research infrastructure like supercomputer laboratories are essential to attract the best researchers, both local and foreign. Cutting-edge equipment and modern technology are prerequisites for high-impact research.\n\u2022\u00a0 Residency Programmes: The institute should invite top Bangladeshi researchers from abroad to return to the country for 2-3 months a year. This would create a dynamic research environment where local and international researchers can collaborate on high-impact projects. In addition, the institute should invite foreign scholars, and organise schools and conferences around the year.\n\u2022\u00a0 Degree it may offer:\u00a0 The institute will offer world-class MS and PhD degrees. It must have its own renowned resident scientists and world-class post-docs. These resident scientists, post-docs together with guest scientists will supervise PhD and take classes at the graduate levels.\u00a0\nHow Will This Help Bangladesh?\n\nSupply of Teachers for Universities: With strong PhD and postdoctoral programs, the institute will create a continuous pipeline of highly qualified faculty members for universities and colleges. This will address Bangladesh's chronic shortage of competent university teachers.\nAttracting Global Talent: By establishing world-class facilities and offering competitive research opportunities, Bangladeshi researchers living abroad will be more inclined to return, even for short-term assignments. Additionally, international scholars can be invited to join collaborative research projects.\nPromoting Research Publications: If the institute fosters research that is published in top-tier journals like Nature and Science, Bangladesh's visibility in the global scientific community will increase. This recognition can attract international grants and partnerships.\nPostdoctoral Programs: Strong postdoctoral programs will ensure that PhD graduates remain in Bangladesh, contributing to local innovation instead of seeking better opportunities abroad. This will help retain the country's brightest minds.\nFostering a Research Ecosystem: The creation of this institute will spark an ecosystem of collaborative research and innovation. Such a research ecosystem has the potential to drive progress in various sectors, from technology to healthcare, ultimately benefiting the entire nation.\nInstead of focusing solely on physical infrastructure, Bangladesh must prioritise human infrastructure. No nation has ever achieved sustainable development without first investing in education, research, and knowledge creation. Countries like China, South Korea, India, and Vietnam have all demonstrated this path to progress. Without world-class research institutes, Bangladesh will remain dependent on foreign expertise for major development projects like nuclear power plants, satellites, and metro rail systems.\nBangladesh must establish at least one world-class institute for natural or fundamental sciences to achieve truly sustainable development. Such an institute would act as a hub for nurturing the next generation of scholars, engineers, and innovators. While this path may not yield immediate results, it will, over time, produce a self-sufficient, knowledge-driven nation capable of sustainable and independent development. Only through cultivating human potential can Bangladesh achieve the status of a truly developed nation.\nKamrul Hassan is a professor in the Department of Physics at Dhaka University.\n",

        "full_article": "We are horrified by the tragedy that occurred at the toll plaza of the Dhaka-Mawa Expressway on December 27, where a speeding bus rammed into three vehicles\u2014a private car, a motorcycle, and a microbus\u2014killing six people from two families. The CCTV footage of the incident shows a bus speeding towards the toll plaza and colliding with the vehicles waiting in queue there. Reportedly, the bus from Bepari Paribahan was operating without a fitness clearance for over a year, and the 26-year-old driver had no valid driving licence.\nThe transport sector in Bangladesh has been mired in chaos and a lack of discipline for decades, fuelled by a corrupt network of transport leaders, police, and politicians. This network has allowed unlicensed and unskilled drivers to operate vehicles, ultimately leading to an increase in road crashes and fatalities. According to the Road Safety Foundation, at least 37,000 lives have been lost in road crashes in the country over the last five years. While several measures, such as establishing lifespans for commercial vehicles, drafting regulations for illegal three-wheelers and enforcing speed limits, were taken by past authorities to enhance road safety, these decisions could not be implemented due to pressure from transport owners and associations.\nThe bus involved in the Mawa expressway crash reportedly had brake problems, and the driver had asked the owner to fix it. But the owner, instead of doing that, told the driver to \"drive slowly.\" The bus also lacked a valid route permit and updated tax documents. And to operate it, the bus owner bribed a close associate of the imprisoned Shajahan Khan, a top transport leader and former Awami League lawmaker. This is a prime example of the lawlessness that pervades the transport sector.\nThis unholy nexus of transport leaders, police, and politicians must be broken up. The government must make this a priority. While it should take steps to immediately implement the Road Transport Act, 2018, it should also take decisive actions to completely overhaul the sector. The adviser to the road transport and bridges ministry recently mentioned that they would take a \"whole new approach\" to reduce road crashes and deaths. We would like to see some concrete action from the ministry now. They can start by establishing a road safety commission to bring about the much-needed reform to the sector. As for the toll plaza crash, we hope the government will do everything in its capacity to ensure justice to the victims. No more lives should be lost on our roads and no more families should suffer lifelong devastation due to crashes caused by unfit vehicles and unskilled drivers.\n",

        "full_article": "The enormous sacrifices made during the July-August uprising have created a historic opportunity for Bangladesh to reshape its political landscape, strengthen institutions, and ensure accountable governance. However, as the months trickle by and the interim government faces various challenges, a critical question has emerged lately: should the desired reforms precede elections, or should an elected government take the reins of reform implementation? Recent statements by government officials and political leaders indicate a divide that must be bridged for the sake of the nation.\nAt a two-day event in Dhaka recently, several government advisers weighed in on the issue, emphasising the need for reforms as well as consensus. In his address, Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus affirmed that preparations for reforms and elections would proceed simultaneously, suggesting that reforms without consensus and elections without reforms would be counterproductive. Currently, 15 reform commissions are working on proposals expected to be ready by January. Adviser Mahfuj Alam, in his address, stated that consultation with all stakeholders, including political parties, would determine the nature and extent of reforms. \"We need agreement on how much reform is possible and whether a legal framework can ensure that future governments continue these initiatives,\" he said. Meanwhile, Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan warned that\u00a0political stability will not be achieved if we falter on the issue of reforms.\nMeanwhile, BNP has insisted that elections and reforms should progress in tandem. Senior leaders, including Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, have expressed concerns that prioritising reforms over elections could stall the democratic process. Rizvi, speaking at a separate event, was particularly critical, claiming that proponents of a reform-first approach harbour \"evil intentions\" by suggesting that political parties' push for a democratic transition equates to opposing reforms. He underscored the urgency of restoring power to elected representatives, who could then implement reforms with a popular mandate.\nWe must say that both sides have points that are valid, and not necessarily contradictory. The government's emphasis on implementing some reforms before elections reflects the understanding that a broken system cannot deliver on people's aspirations. Without addressing systemic flaws\u2014such as the politicisation of state institutions, the erosion of rule of law, economic disparities, etc\u2014elections, no matter how well-conducted, risk perpetuating entrenched power structures. On the other hand, delaying elections excessively risks creating a perception of authoritarian drift as well as alienating those eager to exercise their voting rights.\nSo, how can we bridge this gap? Through dialogue and compromise, of course. Both camps must find common ground in their positions, tempering their adversarial tones to prevent the ongoing reform drive from being questioned or derailed. That said, the sacrifices of July-August demand more than short-term fixes or a partial democratic transition. Proper reforms are crucial not just for safeguarding the gains of the uprising but also for ensuring that future governments operate within the desired framework of accountability.\nWe, therefore, urge political parties to engage in the reform process in good faith, ensuring that their push for elections aligns with the broader goal of strengthening democracy. At the same time, the interim government must address the scepticism about its reform agenda, demonstrating its commitment to meaningful and inclusive change. Only through a collaborative approach can the reform vs election debate be resolved.\n",
