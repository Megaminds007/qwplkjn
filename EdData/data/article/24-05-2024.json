In just the past month, in the UN General Assembly, 143 countries, including India, passed a resolution calling for the recognition of the Palestinian state by the UN Security Council, where the U.S. has vetoed such a move. Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court Prosecutor moved applications for arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for operations after October 7 in Gaza as well as the Hamas leadership for the terror attack that killed 1,200 in Israel, terming these as \u201cwar crimes\u201d. On May 24, the International Court of Justice will pronounce another verdict in the petition by South Africa calling for additional measures in the prosecution of Israel for \u201cgenocide\u201d. The latest decision by the three countries, that have been vocal in their criticism of Israel \u2014 they join eight EU members that have already recognised Palestinian statehood \u2014 may not materially change the situation on the ground. But it is meant to be what the Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris referred to as an \u201cact of powerful political and symbolic value\u201d to Israel, especially as it essays what could be the \u201cfinal assault\u201d on Rafah. While practically every country has condemned Hamas\u2019s terror attacks, Mr. Harris said it would be a mistake to ignore the legitimate Palestinian government in the West Bank, saying that \u201cHamas is not the Palestinian people\u201d. Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that the move aimed to support \u201cmoderate forces that are on a retreating front in a protracted and cruel conflict\u201d. Spain\u2019s action followed its denial of port facilities to a Danish-flagged ship with explosive material from India meant for Israel, which it said was a firm policy now. Israel\u2019s response, however, has been to recall its envoys and summon the envoys of all three countries for a dressing down.In the immediate future, the multiple messages of near-global consensus are meant to push Israel\u2019s government to rethink its plans for Rafah, to stop more civilian losses, and to allow humanitarian aid free access into Gaza. But in the longer term, they are meant to remind Mr. Netanyahu that even if he has disassociated himself from the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d, this is something the world believes is the road map to peace. By turning deaf to these messages, Mr. Netanyahu is only furthering his isolation, especially from an international community that came out in full sympathy on October 7, but has grown increasingly horrified by the military campaign since then. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nPalestine\n\n/\n\nIreland\n\n/\n\nSpain\n\n/\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\ninternational court or tribunal\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict",

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sprung a surprise election announcement when he revealed that the United Kingdom would head to the polls on July 4. While the incumbent government of the Conservative Party was not required to call for an election until January 2025, almost since the day Mr. Sunak entered 10 Downing Street, most polls have suggested that his party would lose the next election by a margin of over 20%, the likes of which are \u201cusually only seen at exceptionally bad moments in the midterm\u201d. It is possible that Mr. Sunak and his team seized upon the political capital that may accrue to them from the recent announcement that the U.K.\u2019s inflation rate has dropped to 2.3%, the lowest in at least three years. There might have been a few other factors including a positive assessment of Mr. Sunak\u2019s cabinet in steadying the economic ship in the post-COVID-19 scenario, and a legal victory securing the government\u2019s plans to implement immigration reforms that will see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda to have their applications processed there.While it is true that polls suggest voter frustration at the end of 14 unbroken years of rule by the Conservative Party, Mr. Sunak\u2019s comment that this election will take place at a time where the world is \u201cmore dangerous than it has been at any point since the end of the Cold War\u201d, is not without merit. Indeed, the denouement of the long-drawn Russian invasion of Ukraine could make or break the security paradigm for Europe and the U.K., including not only serious questions regarding territorial sovereignty on the eastern front but also energy security with knock-on effects for prospects for economic stability. Similarly, the churn in West Asia, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the strategic churn punctuated by the threat of war in the Iran imbroglio, will have echoes throughout the region and certainly for the U.K. Finally, it is unclear that even with the Rwanda plan receiving a legal green light, the Sunak government has been able to have a tangible impact on small boat crossings at a broad level. Contrarily, government statistics indicate that even though such arrivals dropped by around 33% during 2022 and 2023, boat crossings for 2024 are at a \u201crecord high\u201d by comparison, and between January 1 and May 21 of this year more than 9,800 people crossed the U.K.\u2019s border through such means. In this context, his remark that the Labour Party would want people to think \u201cthis election is over before it\u2019s even begun\u201d might not be wrong, but he and his colleagues would do well to ask where the opposition\u2019s confidence in this regard stems from.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nIran\n\n/\n\nrefugee\n\n/\n\nRwanda\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus",

Contestants had to deal with angry farmers whose interests were, yet again, sacrificed on the altar of India\u2019s consumer-first agricultural policy.\nBan first |\u00a0In Dec, GOI banned onion exports. It was in response to initial signs that the rabi crop output would likely disappoint. That\u2019s been the case with the first advance estimate putting onion output at 25.4 million tonnes, 19.4% lower than the previous year. Maharashtra is expected to account for the bulk of decline in production.\nThe policy put the interests of domestic consumers over farmers. A consequence of export bans is that producer earnings are capped to help the consumer. The ban was conditionally lifted in early May, ahead of polling in the onion belt.\nOld template |\u00a0Export bans have been part of GOI\u2019s playbook, regardless of the party in govt. For example, in 2007-08, India banned wheat and rice exports in response to a global food price surge. Domestic consumers were insulated by preventing farmers from seeking markets with the best returns.\nAnd its cost |\u00a0OECD and Icrier looked at data over 17 years (2000-17) to gauge the cost of India\u2019s trade and marketing policies. Input subsidies, classified as producer support estimates (PSE), were matched with consumer support estimates (CSE) such as export bans and marketing restrictions. The result showed that PSE was -14%, a measure of the extent of the consumer bias in policy.\nSubsequent distortions |\u00a0Beyond immediate costs, policies such as export bans also extract a price in terms of compensations and lost opportunities.\nImage credit: ANI\nConsumers at the national level have the numbers to influence the policy direction. But at the state level, political parties can\u2019t ignore farmers. This duality leads to incoherent policy. For example, both BJP and Congress promised to top-up GOI\u2019s MSP for wheat and rice in the four assembly elections held in Nov. It will have distortionary effects on not just agriculture but also in areas such as power tariffs.\nInterventions are not costless |\u00a0Cross-subsidisation of some economic activities is common to all countries. But in India, there\u2019s an overdose that makes overall economic reform harder. Export bans, in general, are a bad idea. Consumers can be insulated from global shocks through temporary income transfers, and not by curtailing potential returns to farmers.\n\n",

OpenAI chief posting \u201cher\u201d on his X account only made sure that even those who weren\u2019t thinking about Her, would now do.

Scarlett Johansson told the world that Altman had pursued a voice that sounded \u201ceerily similar\u201d in clear defiance of her wishes. She is a superstar. A big Hollywood brand. She is even above the Selena Gomez vs Hailey Bieber type of split vibes. Her fandom is global and consolidated. And still, OpenAI denied having used an imitation of her voice, before withdrawing it. Ordinary artistes, whose work and identities are also being hoovered up to raise AI, will meet very different fates. They will be out-litigated by Big Tech. Their only hope lies in collective bargaining. Here in India too, the Johansson fight should mean preparation for many more to come.\nJohansson, of course, doesn\u2019t appear in a single frame of Her. All the power of her performance is from her voice. Why do humans want an AI companion who trains on countless human voices, instead of an actual human companion? Answers run into tomes.

        "full_article": "What is an election for? Over the last decade or so, every controversial election in the country was justified using terms like \"constitutional obligation\" and \"democratic continuity,\" as if an election is something that has to happen because it\u00a0has to\u00a0happen. There is an air of ritualism to how it has been approached or conducted. But election, in the end, is for voters. It is their willing and satisfactory participation that gives contesting parties the democratic mandate and legitimacy sought through this exercise.\nAnd this is what has been missing in the ongoing upazila polls, like the other local and national elections held in recent years.\nThe second phase of the upazila election\u2014perhaps to no one's surprise\u2014has played out exactly like its predecessor: without voters. Held in 156 upazilas, it was able to draw only 37.57 percent of eligible voters. This is the second-lowest turnout in the history of upazila elections. The lowest ever? Well, that \"honour\" went to the first phase of the election held on May 8, in which only 36 percent of voters participated. The decreasing trend has been consistent throughout the upazila elections conducted under the Awami League government.\nFor example, voter turnout in the 2009 polls was 70.57 percent. It was 61.23 percent in 2014, and 40 percent in 2019. After May 8, both the Election Commission and Awami League had blamed rain and paddy harvesting for the ultra-low turnout. What will they blame now? Post-harvest fatigue?\nIt is pointless to talk about the winners in the second phase. Like in the first, most chairman and vice-chairman seats have been won by contestants affiliated with the Awami League. To be clear, the ruling party did not field candidates this year, so its grassroots leaders contested as independents. BNP's boycott of the polls can be a key factor behind the lack of enthusiasm from voters, but Tuesday's dismal showing has again underscored how scant public support is for the kind of elections being held under the current regime.\nSo, the questions we cannot tire of asking are: how does an election rejected by most voters qualify as a democratic exercise? Is the relative absence of violence enough to justify it? Will those elected through this process feel beholden to ordinary people?\nBarring exceptions, they most likely will not. What is the point of an election, then? As things stand, the authorities have two choices: they can either ignore the abstentions writ large and carry on regardless, or they can finally listen to the voters and do something meaningful about it. For the sake of democracy, we hope they choose the latter.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is lagging behind its renewable energy targets, with the current capacity standing at just four percent relative to the target of 10 percent by 2020, making it unlikely to reach the target of 100 percent by 2050. Yet, the success of the latest Conference of the Parties (COP28) agreement to substantially increase renewables in the next decade relies heavily on Asia, where many countries like Bangladesh are struggling to keep up.\nConversations and debates are plentiful around energy sources: renewables versus fossil fuel, and the challenges with renewables like high land requirements for solar expansion. However, what it takes for developing countries like Bangladesh to achieve a green transition gets limited attention.\nSo what are the crucial aspects of successful renewable energy transition that must be considered for a country like Bangladesh?\nTransmission and distribution\nThe Bangladesh government has built many power plants in recent years, but without corresponding investments to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the transmission and distribution systems. Without simultaneous, stepwise improvements in transmission, we risk a capacity logjam by only increasing production capacity, be it in renewables or fossil fuel. Regular planned power outages (load-shedding) while the existing power plants operate below capacity indicate an inadequate transmission system. However, another important cause of below-capacity production is the rising costs of importing coal, gas, and oil amid the growing foreign exchange reserve crisis. This further emphasises the need for diversifying domestic energy sources into renewables, especially because the country's existing gas reserve is dwindling and new exploration is not yet on the horizon.\nHowever, to accommodate the intermittency of renewables\u2014such as the seasonality of hydropower and surge during noon for solar power\u2014the transmission and distribution system must be updated. Moreover, our ambitious 2050 goal is only possible with trade within the region, which also requires expanding the transmission system. Nepal and Bhutan have surplus energy from hydropower during the monsoon season, and India has swathes of arid land with low cloud cover, raising the potential of renewable energy trade with Bangladesh, where the topology, population, and agricultural density limit the renewable production possibility. Indeed, the recent tripartite power-sharing agreement between Bangladesh, Nepal, and India is a step in that direction. But ramping up regional trade may require dedicated transmission lines and grid integration. These technical challenges can be answered with tried and tested solutions elsewhere. However, these require investment and coordinated development across the board, in line with capacity increases and demand mapping for the medium and long run as our industrial energy requirements are expected to continue changing.\nSuch investments in the transmission and distribution system have the added benefit of increasing efficiency and thereby minimising system loss and the associated carbon emissions from power use. The upgrading of grid systems needs to support rooftop solar and net metering options for both households and industrial rooftops, including in economic zones. Lowering high duties on inverters and greater availability of bi-directional metres could incentivise the adoption of rooftop solar by allowing sell-back to the grid. But most importantly, the grid needs to be upgraded to support such an initiative.\n\nSources and costs of financing\n\nInfrastructure projects in developing and emerging economies often cannot attract sufficient financing. Challenges of scaling up investments include the high cost of funds in developing countries like Bangladesh, partly due to the lack of a deep domestic financing market. The constraint may be partially addressed by using a combination of sources at different stages of the project\u2014public financing from governments and banks acting as debt investors in the early stage, and bond financing at a later stage.\nAs we become a developing country, it would be beneficial to continue to have concessional rates for sectors like renewables and transmission. Multilateral development institutions are well-placed to provide long-term financing for projects that have public benefits. With the proliferation of Southern-led development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank (NDB), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), in addition to the traditional Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), different types of support for large infrastructure projects at different stages are possible.\nOlder multilaterals and the newer Southern-led multilateral development banks are increasingly financing different kinds of projects. BWIs are financing preparatory work, feasibility studies, and capacity-building compared to earlier greenfield power projects. Instead, large-scale power projects are now funded through bilateral financing and the newer Southern-led policy banks. This difference between older and newer multilaterals in their respective specialisations could help address challenges around inadequate preparation and due diligence of projects that countries like Bangladesh face when seeking financing, which contributes to the higher cost of financing. The prioritisation of older BWIs on capacity-building could help Bangladesh do the necessary leg work required to seek financing for bankable projects from Southern development banks and other bilateral sources.\nIn addition to sources of financing, the costs of financing must be made more salient and central to our policy conversations. The financing terms, including interest rates and repayment timelines, are often not made obvious to the taxpayers. Increasing production capacity without simultaneously improving transmission and distribution systems will mean unused power plants that are not operating, while loan repayments for their construction keep racking up. Finally, infrastructure financing in Bangladesh relies on policy support such as subsidies or feed-in tariffs for economic viability. This becomes unmanageable in the presence of fossil fuel subsidies. A gradual phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies is necessary to free up resources for investments in renewables and grid modernisation.\n\nJob impacts\n\nHistorically low-emitting and developing countries like Bangladesh need to consider not only emissions, but also the jobs impact of green transition. Furthermore, we need to consider not only the total number of jobs produced by renewable expansion, but also who gets the jobs. An ongoing study by BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) estimates the direct and upstream impact of renewable transition in Bangladesh.\nSolar energy is the most feasible option for Bangladesh, but it is land-intensive and requires importing almost all the necessary inputs. In the medium run, this means solar expansion in the country will not see gains from upstream employment as solar panel-producing countries do.\nGas and coal plants require more construction and land preparation compared to solar, providing jobs for low and middle-skill workers. Our research shows solar expansion just on its own leads to a loss of jobs for low and middle-skill workers in Bangladesh. However, if solar energy is combined with agriculture\u2014called agrivoltaics or agrisolar energy\u2014the land intensity will be reduced. Moreover, solar expansion through agrivoltaics will involve more jobs for women and low-skill workers in Bangladesh than any other power source, fossil fuel or renewable.\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with immense pressure on agricultural land. Agriculture remains the largest employment sector in the country, employing over 40 percent of the country's workforce. Although the agricultural share in the economy has been declining over the years, over 46 percent of all households in Bangladesh have derived some income from agriculture. Gains in agriculture accounted for 90 percent of the reduction in poverty between 2005 and 2010. A land policy draft by the government in 2016 discourages using agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes like industrial or infrastructural development. Hence, land shortages in the nation continue to hold back renewable energy development.\n\nHarvesting crops and solar energy using agrivoltaics on one-crop land could be a promising solution for Bangladesh's land scarcity and agriculture production in the short and medium terms. In the longer term, Bangladesh could benefit by developing its abilities to first assemble and then produce solar panels and their components.\nAgrivoltaics can increase the economic value of the land by more than 30 percent and increase the overall land productivity by 60-70 percent. Crops that grow under partial shade, like tomato, cotton, potato, tea, coffee, garlic, onion and turmeric, are best suited for agrivoltaic systems. For instance, with only four hours of gentle sunlight each day and minimal irrigation, garlic and onions can be grown. The added shade can further reduce irrigation requirements by minimising evapotranspiration rates. Moreover, the production of vegetable crops under the panel can reduce soil erosion and the amount of dust on the solar panel.\nAllocating agricultural lands to produce energy only could have an immense impact on the livelihood of agriculture-based households. Hence, simultaneous use of land for farming the right type of crops and generating solar energy can be a win-win solution, keeping in mind the marketability of the crop. The next steps involve a proof-of-concept pilot where variations in crop types and solar panel angles are considered. Eventually, changes to the 2016 land policy draft discouraging agricultural land use would be required in addition to coordination between the power and agriculture ministries. Incorporating agrivoltaic systems into broader national energy strategies and land-use planning efforts is vital to maximise its potential benefits and minimise potential conflicts with agricultural practices.\nDr Rohini Kamal\u00a0is assistant professor and research fellow at BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), BRAC University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank, recently published a report that poses the question: does freedom lead to prosperity, or does prosperity lead to freedom? In the findings of the research, it is stated that there is strong evidence that increasing freedom in a country eventually leads to prosperity in the long term.\nThe report also indicates that even though Bangladesh has become one of the more prosperous nations among neighbouring countries, the freedoms enjoyed by its people have gradually declined over the past 22 years. In the context of the report, \"freedoms\" refer to political freedom, economic freedom, and legal freedom. Meanwhile, prosperity is quantified through indexes of education, income, health, inequality, environment, and minority rights. The data in the report showed that economic freedom in Bangladesh grew to an extent in the early 2000s but is now relatively stagnant, while political and legal freedoms have been declining since 1995. The clear implication of this data is that the current level of prosperity that Bangladesh is enjoying is not sustainable.\nAlthough the report uses broad definitions for what it counts as \"freedom\" and \"prosperity,\" the argument brought forth is essentially the same one we have been having in Bangladesh for a very long time: the argument of development versus democracy.\u00a0\nThe declining freedoms identified in the report once again give a clear indication that the consecutive governments of Bangladesh, from multiple political parties, have repeatedly failed to empower the country's people. The inequality in society keeps growing, corruption runs rampant, and certain beneficiary groups have hijacked the trajectory of development in Bangladesh, ensuring a fundamentally uncompetitive market, where the only ways to success are through underhanded violations of the rule of law, unethical exploitation of the poor, and undermining of the promises of democracy and social justice underpinned in our constitution.\u00a0\nApologists of the current government's shortcomings have, as usual, resorted to using the age-old talking points taken by undemocratic actors. They will argue the opposite of the data, stating that it is the development that eventually leads to democracy. Therefore, development should be prioritised first, even if it comes at the expense of democracy. They will, of course, not answer the questions of how development can be kept inclusive and sustainable if the process of development is not democratic.\nOther undemocratic talking points include indicating how exploitation, inequality, and breach of human rights were once a norm hundreds of years ago, which allowed Western nations to accumulate wealth in a brutal fashion in the form of colonialism, and their current development is a direct result of the harsh reality of early era capitalism. This line of argument is particularly absurd, as it readily admits that the method being taken by the current government is similar to the colonial exploitation of the past. Humankind records history with the hope that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. There is no rush for Bangladesh to become some kind of emerging world power. Our nation is young. We can take our time to build it in a way that benefits us all. We do not need to sacrifice fundamental rights and the agency of the people in order to develop. Both democracy and development should have equal weight.\u00a0\nAnother favourite hobby of undemocratic actors is repeatedly pointing out the examples of Singapore and China to try and bolster their talking points of how it is possible to achieve prosperity even without democratic development. If the current or past leadership of Bangladesh had the capacity to turn Bangladesh from a third-world to a first-world country within a single generation, as what happened in Singapore under the stewardship of Lee Kuan Yew, then perhaps this comparison could have a leg to stand on. All current data indicates that Bangladesh will not be turning into a first-world country any time soon. In fact, the failures of the government to reduce inequality and ensure freedoms are now actively driving away foreign direct investment. On the other hand, if Bangladesh had an abundance of raw material resources like China, which it could use to become a worldwide manufacturing powerhouse, then perhaps a comparison to China could have been made. But that is not the reality. The main resource of Bangladesh is its people. Bangladesh's only way forward is to give its people better opportunities for economic, social, and cultural growth. And this can only be done in a better democratic environment.\nTo some readers, all these points and counterpoints will seem extremely common. That is because the argument being had has not changed. Whether it is freedom versus prosperity or development versus democracy, there has always been only one right answer. There should be no dichotomy between these factors. Freedom is prosperity, and prosperity is freedom. One cannot grow sustainably without the other, and the responsibility of the state is to grow both in tandem.\u00a0\nThe evidence is clear, and so is public opinion on the matter. The government has neglected to strengthen democracy in Bangladesh, and it is failing to provide economic, political and legal freedom for its people. It is relatively easy to receive funds and technical expertise from foreign friends when building roads, bridges, and power plants. However, by stating that democracy will come later, they repeatedly pass on the responsibility of the truly difficult and important tasks of nation-building to future generations, who will ultimately have to shoulder the cost of this so-called development.\nZillur Rahman\u00a0is the executive director of the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) and a\u00a0television talk show host.

        "full_article": "The launch of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) Framework to protect and assist victims of human trafficking is a commendable initiative. It has been learnt that NRM is a dynamic system that involves a multidisciplinary group of government and non-governmental actors guided by protocols, tools, guidelines, and principles. It will be implemented under the direct management of the National Anti-Human Trafficking Authority, with the leadership of the Public Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs. A Switzerland government-supported project, Ashshash has provided technical assistance in preparing the Framework. Human trafficking is a global crime that trades in people and exploits them for profit. People of all genders, ages and backgrounds can become victim of this crime, which occurs in every region of the world. Traffickers use violence, fraudulent employment agencies, and fake promises of education and job opportunities to trick, coerce and deceive their victims. The organised networks or individuals behind this crime take advantage of people who are vulnerable, desperate or simply seeking a better life. Broadly, human trafficking is behind three common types of crimes---sex trade, forced labour, and domestic servitude. Bangladesh is a source of all the three types of human abuse. While exploitation of the victims---both males and females---in the name of providing jobs abroad has been a common practice, tricking them into the scheme of the trafficking network has also grown over the decades. Add to this, the increasing trafficking within the country, the picture looks grim. It is widely recognised that individuals subjected to human trafficking need assistance and protection. In Bangladesh, the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act, 2012, is basically intended to combat human trafficking through various inter-agency engagements and the establishment of special tribunals. The latest move to protect victims under a comprehensive framework emphasises the need for social and economic reintegration and empowerment of these ill-fated individuals. Experience from government organisations and NGOs over the last two decades has highlighted the crucial need for an inclusive one-stop-service mechanism to effectively deliver, follow up, and monitor protection and care services for trafficking victims. The Ashshash project, supported by Swiss funding and implemented by the Winrock International, will collaborate with all relevant government and non-government agencies throughout the project's implementation process, according to a statement issued in connection with the framework's launch.Understandably, the framework will be in conformity with the standard global practices. However, the peculiarities stemming from country-specific needs should also be addressed. It is here that collaboration of local government and the NGOs will play an important role to make it suitable for the needs of the victims. To ensure effectiveness of the NRM Framework, there is an overriding need for involving community-based organisations and grassroots groups in the process. These groups are often the first to encounter victims and can provide immediate support and protection. Building strong networks at the local level will facilitate better identification of trafficking cases, more efficient referrals, and sustained support for victims. Additionally, continuous training and capacity-building programmes for law enforcement, social workers, and healthcare providers are essential.",

        "full_article": "Senator Bernard, popularly known as Bernie, Sanders' credential as a progressive politician is beyond doubt. Credited to be the longest serving independent in the history of US Congress, he ran for Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, each time coming second to the eventual presidential candidates Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden. His presidential campaign in 2016 actually influenced the Democratic Party to have a left-leaning shift. Now when such an influential politician makes an impassioned appeal to his countrymen to vote for Joe Biden, it has to be taken seriously. In an article titled, \"We're in a pivotal moment in American history. We cannot retreat\", Sanders has argued that Joe Biden's reelection is crucial to saving democracy, America and the rest of the world. Starting from the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the veteran senator, now chairman of the health, education, labour and pension committee, has briefly touched the milestone events such as the civil war that broke out over abolishment of slavery, the Great Depression of 1929, the federal government's role in transforming working class's fate under President Roosevelt, US involvement in the World War II following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. All those were pivotal moments, according to him. Then Sanders compares the 2024 US election with those momentous events on an even keel. His arguments on two of the several key issues he deals with are overwhelmingly compelling. One concerns the rise of the oligarchy in his country where the billionaires can contrive to have an undue sway on economic and political life of the American nation. While the working class Americans' inflation-adjusted wages have slid down over the last 50 years, he claims, the 1.0 per cent superrich are amassing wealth and wielding power never done before. Under the Super Pac endorsement by the US Supreme Court, individual donation for election campaign has no limit and the billionaires take advantage of this to make and unmake the prospect of House and Senate candidates. No wonder, more than 90 per cent of Congress and 80 per cent of Senate elections respectively are decided by the higher amount of campaign money spent. This is revealing. If money wins elections, democracy is suspect. Sanders goes a step further to call the American political system corrupt. The nation that boasts framing the most powerful constitution in favour of individual liberty, human rights and democratic values has obviously declined. But intriguingly, it has not ceased to play the role of the sole moral guardian in sovereign countries across a large swathe of the planet. Sanders considers Donald Trump the most dangerous president the US ever had, who is known for his anti-union labour policy and tax cuts for the billionaires. Extreme income and wealth inequality in America will only rise if Trump returns to power, he warns. Biden, 'a traditional politician who believes in democracy, free elections and the right of dissent', on the other hand, has taken some pro-poor and pro-worker measures to alleviate their sufferings. Sanders then laments how women's rights were dealt a mortal blow under Trump's rule. On yet another crucial count, Biden is miles ahead of his rival. His approach to the climate change which Trump considers 'a hoax' is quite satisfactory. Biden favours investment in sustainable green energy and also energy efficiency as against Trump's promotion of fossil fuels. Bernie Sanders' concern about deterioration of climate is widely shared by conscious citizens the world over and Biden is a better choice as an American and by extension world leader. Yet what is good for America is not good for the rest of the world. Trump is a self-proclaimed champion of \"America first\" principle. If his withdrawal from climate fund proved pernicious to the preservation of the planet's health, his dissociation from the North Atlantic Organisation (NATO) could not only avoid a Russia-Ukraine war but also provide a much needed respite from the unhealthy arms race. The US spends, Sanders reveals, $1.0 trillion on military, more than the next 10 countries combined do. Arms worth billions of those dollars are now channelised to Israel for annihilation of the Palestinians. This is at a time when 60 per cent of Americans survive just on the monthly paycheck. Trump threatens to pardon the 800 of his supporters accused of attacking the Capitol Hill. America surely has reasons to be alarmed but if Trump's plan to part with the NATO is carried out, the world will see fewer conflicts. He brags not for nothing that he could bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours. Whether he could or not, about one thing there is no doubt that the war would not have broken out at all had he been the president. It is Biden's hawkish NATO policy that is responsible for Putin's aggression on Ukraine. Biden's calculation of furthering US interests was to the point. On one count, though, he has erred. It is the wicked policy of bringing Russia on to its knees. Evidently, it has backfired for the European Union toeing the US line, in particular. But poor, developing and emerging countries like Bangladesh are now paying through their noses for Biden's misadventure. Economies have crumbled like nine pins. In the Gaza conflict, he is a party to the carnage. Here Sanders also errs in his judgment of Biden, saying that \"Biden has at least restricted some powerful bombs going to the Israel\". This is nasty argument. Here is no choice for the lesser evil, it is a crime against humanity. The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutors rightly sought an arrest order for Netanayahu. Biden rebukes. This is outrageous. He should also face prosecution for his role in Gaza genocide.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Battery-run three-wheelers have been granted permission to ply certain roads in capital Dhaka. They are now allowed to operate on lanes, but not on main roads in the city. Extensive protests by the drivers and owners of the vehicles amid the police crackdown on the three-wheelers in the capital have earned them the permission. The prime minister herself had to interfere in the matter to calm the protesters who had threatened to launch countrywide protests to press for the legalisation of electric rickshaws.Whether electricity-chrged rickshaws, popularly known as easy bikes in Bangladesh, should be allowed to operate in the country has been a much-debated issue since they started coming to Bangladesh in the mid-2000s. Initially, policymakers were resolutely against the vehicles, complaining that they consumed a huge amount of electricity at that juncture of power scarcity and that they were accident-prone. There was a concern from an environmental point of view too --- the disposal of batteries. The authorities did not issue them any licence or permission to ply. Nevertheless, the import of those rickshaws and their parts and their plying never stopped with the vehicles becoming the main mode of transport for short-distance travel in the rural and suburban areas, replacing human-pulled rickshaws.It is obvious that battery-driven rickshaws will consume electricity. But their consuming power should no longer be a reason to keep them off the road because the power generation has improved considerably.There is no denying the fact that battery-run rickshaws have left transport system in a mess not only in city suburbs but also in lanes within cities and posed environmental hazard requiring measures to regulate them. But the way policymakers have rejected the newer mode of transport will make anyone understand that they have a prejudice against the vehicles and are not properly taking into consideration the merits those have and the way they are treated globally.Compared to the human-hauled vehicles, these rickshaws have made travel cheaper and less time-consuming for passengers and less laborious for drivers. Policymakers and the people who ride in their own vehicles might not understand the contribution of such rickshaws to easing the lives of low-income people, but those who use them feel it.The vehicles save huge work hours of both passengers and drivers. Those have also spared pullers enormous physical labour. No one can drive a human-hauled rickshaw two shifts a day, but in the case of electric rickshaws, they can work two shifts, earning a greater amount of money.Despite the benefits, electric rickshaws should no longer be allowed to operate without proper regulations across the country. It is already late to bring them under regulation and licensing. Now there should be a clear guideline detailing which authority will give them licences and where they can ply and where cannot. Battery disposal should also come under tight regulations. Now anyone can dispose of the battery anywhere, contributing to environmental hazards. A battery collection and recycling chain should be in place to ensure that they do not harm the environment.The design, speed limit and passenger capacity are also big issues which are directly linked to their vulnerability to accidents. Most of the owners now modify the design and enlarge the body to accommodate more passengers. The authority should examine and approve the design of the vehicles and determine how many passengers they can carry.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "No one seems to have complete control over the market. There is a competition commission, but no real competition exists. Consumer rights are neglected, and while laws are in place, they are not enforced. Inflation has presented a new reality for the country's fixed-income population, causing significant trouble for middle-class families who struggle to buy daily necessities. Inflation threatens Bangladesh, affecting both development and the normal lives of people. The fact that some traders exploit festival times to hike prices is no secret. Market management in Bangladesh is disorganised, allowing a class of businessmen to compete in raising prices of daily commodities. Sometimes, prices are increased by creating artificial shortages. However, such manipulation can be prevented with strict market monitoring. It is also clear that without government intervention, it will be impossible to prevent rising prices.The ruling Awami League's election manifesto prioritised keeping the prices of goods affordable to everyone. Following the formation of the new government, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina instructed relevant ministries and departments to take steps to control commodity prices in the first cabinet meeting and secretariat session.The challenges of everyday life for common people have now become prominent. The crucial question is whether there is a fair system to meet people's needs in our country. What should be done now? First and foremost, measures must be taken to curb inflation.Planning is needed to support fixed-income individuals. While the government has sold goods through TCB trucks at various times, a group of people consistently monopolises these benefits. Therefore, a permanent system needs to be put in place for ensuring fair distribution and support for those in need.\nSahadat HussainGulshan, Dhaka[email\u00a0protected]",
