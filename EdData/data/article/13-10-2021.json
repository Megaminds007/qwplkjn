        "full_article": "As India inches towards fresh general elections in 2024, there is a wind of change in the political landscape. The change is being driven by the trend of regional parties like Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trying to expand their footprints beyond West Bengal and Delhi, respectively, and go national. The trend is nothing new, and just a rerun of the past when these two parties had unsuccessfully sought to shed their tag of being regional and aspire for a national status that requires a certain percentage of votes.\nWhile TMC is hoping to expand their footprints in Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Assam, Goa, and Gujarat, AAP is looking to go beyond their stronghold of Delhi and make its presence felt in Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat. But why are these two parties spreading their wings beyond the borders of their established spheres of influence? Unlike many other regional satraps of Indian politics, Mamata and Kejriwal nurture the ambition of seeing TMC and AAP achieving the tag of national parties and play a much larger role nationally. And they are not the ones to give up that ambition based on their past failures in those states.\nTo be recognised as a national party with its own election symbol, a party must have at least two percent representation in the 545-member Lok Sabha from four states, and have six percent of valid votes polled in state legislative assembly or Lok Sabha elections in at least four states. The assessment in TMC and AAP is that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ruling India since May 2014, is facing the heat of anti-incumbency in the run-up to 2024 general elections, and the Congress is struggling with top leadership, in-house churnings, and a shrinking electoral presence in several states.\nThis, according to Mamata and Kejriwal, provides regional parties a chance to gain by projecting themselves as a credible third alternative to the two national parties in other states. As part of Mamata's efforts to build a pan-India image for herself, she pointed out soon after her victory by a record margin in the by-poll in Bhabanipur assembly constituency in Kolkata on October 3 that she won from a constituency that comprises 46 percent of non-Bangalee population. With an eye beyond the borders of West Bengal, Mamata's intended message is that she is popular not just among Bangalees, but also among other linguistic communities. In the state assembly elections earlier this year, her main plank was Bangalee sub-nationalism. Politics is the art of changing track without being bluntly upfront about it.\nHow is the TMC going about venturing into other states? An array of TMC leaders, including Mamata's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, has made several trips to Tripura where fresh assembly polls are due in 2023. The ruling BJP is facing internal dissidence in Tripura, with a section of the party seeking to remove Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb.\nTMC and AAP have chosen the path of inorganic growth (model usually followed by big corporate houses) in other states by going for acquisition of the ranks and files of established parties there. While in Tripura, TMC has roped in dissident leaders from BJP, Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), AAP too plans to feast on the sulking leaders of other parties in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Gujarat.\nThe two parties have opted for the easiest route for growth in other states by luring away leaders from established parties there, instead of going for the time-consuming exercise of building their own party apparatus from scratch, which requires considerable political and economic capital. Ironically, TMC had accused BJP of engineering defections in its fold in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections\u2014when Mukul Roy joined BJP, although he is now back in the TMC\u2014and the West Bengal assembly elections earlier this year, with hordes of leaders from Mamata's party switching to the saffron party.\nIn recent months, TMC succeeded in not only getting back its leaders who had joined BJP in West Bengal, but also snapping up BJP's former lawmaker from Asansol, Babul Supriyo, and senior Congress leaders Sushmita Dev from Assam and former Goa Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro. These acquisitions from other parties are aimed at showcasing the regional parties' appeal as viable alternatives to the national parties. But it is questionable whether such import of disgruntled leaders of other parties pays off in the long run and can be an effective substitute for the organic growth of a party from grassroots over the years. There cannot be any short-cut for political success. No one should know it better than the TMC, which found out how almost all of its leaders who went over to the BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls in West Bengal earlier this year faltered in the elections and are returning to the parent party.\nFor instance, Congress has been reduced to a negligible force in Tripura and Goa, and its leaders have not been able to stem the party's decline. Take, for example, the situation in Goa. Despite emerging as the single largest party in the previous assembly poll with 17 legislators, Congress today finds itself reduced to just four in the 40-member assembly, where BJP got majority by poaching Congress' and other parties' lawmakers. So, how can leaders of the same party be of any help to an aspiring regional outfit like the TMC or the AAP trying to find their feet in an uncharted terrain? Besides, it is being asked if the TMC and the AAP could end up fighting with each other in Goa and cause a split in anti-BJP votes, and in the event of that, if the saffron party would stand to gain. In 2012, TMC had tested the political waters in Goa by contesting 20 seats under the leadership of former Goa Chief Minister Wilfred de Souza of Congress. However, Mamata's party drew a blank in terms of seats and managed just two percent of the total votes. Another Congress veteran in Goa, Churchill Alemao, had unsuccessfully contested South Goa Lok Sabha seat in 2014 as a TMC candidate.\nRegional parties' wanting to become national players must take into account the reality that the established national parties would not easily cede space and would rather throw everything into protecting it.\nOnly time will tell whether or how far the regional players' strategy pays off politically. One thing it has ensured is that it has dealt a major blow to the talks of opposition unity as Congress and TMC are embroiled in a spat. Ironically, the Twitter spat came after the in-person meeting between Sonia Gandhi and Mamata in New Delhi on July 28, apparently to discuss a possible joint strategy for the next national polls.\nWhile TMC has been favouring the presence of Congress in a broader opposition unity against BJP, the Mamata-led party has rightly pointed to the fact that Sonia-led Congress is in the opposition camp in a number of states like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, and Delhi, where regional parties are in power at the expense of the grand old party. Clearly, an over-arching opposition unity across India is easier talked about than done.\nPallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for\u00a0The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India.\n",

        "full_article": "We are all familiar with the sight by now: everyone in a family\u2014adults, children, parents\u2014sitting together, but each concentrating on their personal device, usually a smartphone or a tablet. So familiar are we that we have also accepted it as our reality. Those of us who cannot stand the awkwardness of certain social settings are even grateful to have something else to look at, which makes us appear as if we are otherwise busy or occupied. However, when it comes to children's usage of these devices, there is no denying the fact that such daily and prolonged exposure to screens is indeed concerning as it may have long-term harmful effects on them.\nWith the increased ease of access to high-speed internet and compact devices, children over the last decade or so have been introduced to screens pretty much since infancy. It has been, in a way, fascinating to see how quickly some babies can get the hang of working smart devices without any help. Busy parents even find solace in the fact that at least their child is sitting in one place, occupied with one thing, instead of running around or getting hurt while they\u2014the parents\u2014work outside or around the house.\nBut smart devices are untrustworthy babysitters. While the child is occupied with one thing (and in one place) for hours, that one thing is a screen which not only affects their health\u2014physical and mental\u2014but also eliminates their desire to do anything else that is productive. And in no other time have the effects of this been clearer than during the last one year and a half of the Covid-19 pandemic and of online schooling.\nA recently published research article, titled \"Prevalence and impact of the use of electronic gadgets on the health of children in secondary schools in Bangladesh: A cross sectional study,\" reveals how much dependent students have become on technology. The study was conducted on 1,803 secondary school students (Classes 6 to 10) from English and Bangla medium schools as well as madrasas, between June and December in 2020.\nOne may assume that it is because of online classes that children are spending more time in front of screens. However, for the year 2020, only about 25 percent of survey participants\u2014of more than 87 percent who reported using any form of electronic gadgets\u2014used those for attending online classes. According to the report, most of the students (around 39 percent) used smartphones and other devices for watching cartoons or movies, followed by almost 30 percent using them for other reasons.\nRegardless, one thing that was evident from the study was that students' engagement with screens increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. While 33.5 percent of the students reported using gadgets for over two hours daily in 2019, this proportion surged to almost 53 percent in 2020. The overall percentage of respondents using these gadgets, for at least five hours a day, was also three times more last year than it was in 2019. And while around 28 percent said they spent less than two hours daily engaging in outdoor activities, nearly 27 percent said they did not spend any time outdoors at all, or spent so little time there that it would not be worth considering.\nSo, what does such an increment in children's usage of electronic devices indicate?\nWith in-person classes remaining closed for 543 days since March 2020\u2014and reopening in phases just a month ago\u2014children had to bear the shock of their daily routine being drastically changed. Not only were they now pursuing one of the most important aspects of their lives\u2014their education\u2014through screens, but they were also deprived of all the positives of going to school, such as having a circle of peers and being able to socialise with them through conversation and shared activities.\nIn our cities, where playgrounds are becoming scarcer by the year, school is often the only place where many children get the chance to play outdoors, be physically active, and thus avoid dependence on screens. It is, therefore, not shocking that the study also found an increasing pattern of gadget use going up from children living in rural areas, to those in suburban areas, to those in urban areas. So, whereas a little over 90 percent of urban respondents said they used one or another form of gadget, the percentage was a bit lower, at about 84 percent, for rural participants. Higher technological dependence was also found in students who came from more financially solvent families.\nRegardless of their geographical location and financial standing, the most concerning findings of the study remain true across the board: the harmful physical and mental effects of children's technological dependence. For instance, respondents who spent more than six hours with gadgets daily were found to be more than twice as likely to experience regular headaches, than those who spent an hour or less doing the same. Moreover, more than half of those who used gadgets for more than two hours also reported feelings of depression and sleep disturbances.\nIn contrast, participants who reported less than an hour of daily usage of gadgets reported significantly fewer instances of headaches, back pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and visual disturbance. Pain in limbs was the problem most experienced by this group, but that too in only about a quarter of them. This is in stark opposition to the nearly 50 percent, on average, of participants who reported using electronic devices for more than two hours daily, who were also suffering from different forms of the aforementioned physical and mental ailments.\nNow, the simplest solution to the increased dependence on screens would be to lower and limit the time children spend glued to these devices. But before parents snatch away their children's laptops, smartphones and/or tablets, it may be fruitful to take a minute to visualise the child's perspective, too.\nWhile children are beginning to return to in-person schooling, students from grades besides fifth and those who are SSC candidates (for 2021 and 2022) are only attending classes for a couple days a week at most. Schools that have the infrastructure to do so are still heavily dependent on online schooling. So it will be a while before children can stop looking at their screens to continue their education. And as long as they are trapped at home\u2014especially for those in urban areas\u2014their only solace may be in these electronic gadgets, which they can use to stay connected to and updated about the outside world.\nInstead of imposing blanket restrictions on their screen time, it may be more useful for parents and guardians to first discuss with children why spending excessive amounts of time on electronic gadgets is unhealthy for their mental and physical well-being. The limitations can then be applied in phases, thus letting them eventually get used to using their devices for online classes and then for a specified period of leisure every day. Not only will this help build trust between the caretaker and the child, it may also inspire children to self-monitor and regulate the time they spend with screens. But parental supervision is key to any desirable change.\nThat said, the problem of online-offline class arrangements and the lack of outdoor spaces for children, which in part is responsible for their increased dependence on screens, are something that parents can't solve. It will require interventions from the higher authorities.\nAfia Jahin is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The \"Pandora Papers,\" a new investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), has fuelled outrage around the world. Politicians, businesspeople, sports stars, and cultural icons have been caught in the act of hiding their wealth and lying about it. But how likely is a reckoning for the lawyers and accountants who helped them?\nThere is nothing new about the practices the ICIJ investigation has uncovered. True, the sheer scale, sophistication, and legal firepower deployed to allow today's ultra-rich and powerful to game the law may be newsworthy. But the only truly shocking revelation is that it took more than 600 journalists from around the world to expose these practices, often risking their own safety and professional futures. The difficulty of that task attests to how well lawyers, legislatures, and courts have tilted the law in favour of elites.\nTo hide their wealth, today's rich and powerful have availed themselves of centuries-old legal coding strategies. In 1535, King Henry VIII of England cracked down on a legal device known as \"the use,\" because it threatened to undermine existing (feudal) property relations and served as a tax-avoidance vehicle. But thanks to clever legal arbitrage, it was soon replaced by an even more powerful device: \"the trust.\"\nLegally encoded by solicitors and recognised by courts of equity, the trust remains one of the most ingenious legal tools ever invented for the creation and preservation of private wealth. In the old days, it allowed the wealthy to circumvent inheritance rules. Today, it is the go-to vehicle for tax avoidance and for structuring financial assets, including asset-backed securities and their derivatives.\nFunctionally, a trust alters the rights and obligations to an asset without observing the formal rules of property law; it thus creates a shadow property right. Establishing a trust requires an asset\u2014such as land, shares, or bonds\u2014and three personas: an owner (settlor), a manager (trustee), and a beneficiary. The owner transfers legal title (though not necessarily actual possession) over the asset to the trustee, who promises to manage it on behalf of the beneficiary in accordance with the owner's instructions.\nNobody else needs to know about this arrangement, because there is no requirement to register the title or disclose the identities of the parties. This lack of transparency makes the trust the perfect vehicle for playing hide and seek with creditors and tax authorities. And because legal title and economic benefits are split among the three personas, nobody willingly assumes the obligations that come with ownership.\nThe trust became a favoured legal device for global elites not through some invisible hand of the market, but rather by purposeful legal design. Attorneys pushed existing legal boundaries, courts recognised and enforced their innovations, and then lawmakers (many of them presumably beholden to wealthy donors) codified those practices into statutory legislation. As previous restrictions were stripped away, trust law expanded its remit.\nThese legal changes ensured that an ever-greater array of assets could be held in trust, and that the role of the trustee could be delegated to legal persons rather than honourable individuals like judges. Moreover, fiduciary duties were curtailed, the trustees' liability was limited, and the lifespan of the trust became increasingly elastic. Together, these legal adaptations made the trust fit for global finance.\nCountries that lacked this device were encouraged to emulate it. An international treaty, the 1985 Hague Convention on Trusts, was adopted with this goal in mind. In countries where lawmakers have resisted the pressure to sanction trusts, attorneys have fashioned equivalent devices from the laws governing foundations, associations, or corporations\u2014betting (often correctly) that courts would vindicate their innovations.\nWhile some jurisdictions have gone out of their way to be legally hospitable to private wealth creation, others have tried to crack down on tax and legal arbitrage. But legal restrictions work only if the legislature controls which law is practised within its jurisdiction. In the age of globalisation, most legislatures have been effectively stripped of such control, because law has become portable. If one country does not have the \"right\" law, another one might. As long as the place of business recognises and enforces foreign law, the legal and accounting paperwork can be channelled to the friendliest foreign jurisdiction, and the deed is done.\nNational legal systems, thus, have become items on an international menu of options from which asset holders choose the laws by which they wish to be governed. They don't need a passport or a visa; all they need is a legal shell. Assuming a new legal identity in this way, the privileged few can decide how much to pay in taxes, and which regulations to endure. And if legal obstacles cannot be overcome quite that easily, lawyers from leading global law firms will draft legislation to make a country compliant with the \"best practices\" of global finance. Here, tax and trust havens such as South Dakota and the British Virgin Islands offer the gold standard.\nThe costs of these practices are borne by the least mobile and the insufficiently wealthy. But turning law into a gold mine for the rich and powerful causes harm well beyond the immediate inequities it generates. By potentially undermining the legitimacy of the law, it threatens the very foundation of democratic governance.\nThe more that wealthy elites and their lawyers insist that everything they do is legal, the less the public will trust the law. Today's global elites might be able to continue to conjure private wealth from law, but no resource can be mined forever. Once lost, trust in the law will be difficult to regain. The wealthy will have lost their most valuable asset of all.\nKatharina Pistor is professor of comparative law at Columbia Law School, and the author of \"The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality.\"\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2021\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "An unthinkable and deplorable situation has risen out of the rigid position taken by the Minimum Wage Board (MWB) that was formed to fix the minimum wage for the hapless tea workers of Bangladesh. After much haggling, the wage board sent its final recommendation on the minimum wage structure for the tea workers to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Severely disturbed at the negotiation table of the wage board, Rambhajan Kairi, who represents around 138,000 tea workers from 158 tea gardens in Sylhet and Chattogram divisions, abstained from approving and signing the recommendation. He also did not join the last meeting of the wage board, held just before it sent its recommendation to the labour ministry at the end of June this year.\nThe labour ministry, apparently dissatisfied, sent the recommendation back to the wage board, asking it to reconsider the wages of the tea workers who currently get ridiculously low daily cash pay of Tk 117, Tk 118, and Tk 120. The wages of monthly paid tea workers are also similarly low. The ministry's move brought a ray of hope for the tea workers. The wage board, set up by the government in October 2019 to give a pragmatic consideration while fixing the tea workers' wages, kept the same wages that they currently get. The current wages had been fixed for 2019 and 2020 through an agreement between the Bangladesh Tea Association (BTA), which represents the tea garden owners, and Bangladesh Cha Sramik Union (BCSU), the tea workers' union. The tea workers were surprised and shocked to see that the wage board had not changed their wages. What is more, it scrapped the traditions (dastur) in the tea gardens, showed little respect to the labour law, curtailed tea workers' benefits, and remained blind to the minimum wages that the government has fixed for other industries.\nWe haven't seen the communications from the labour ministry, but it is clear that the ministry was not satisfied with the wage board's recommendation, and wanted it reconsidered to do some justice to the tea workers.\nHowever, the meeting that the wage board convened on October 4 to discuss and reconsider the recommendation in light of the ministry directive was allegedly spoiled. \"The owners' representative questioned the validity of the meeting, on the grounds that the directive and advice of the labour ministry had not come with its letter, which came on the 44th day after the receipt of the final recommendation. They said the directive came after 45 days, and therefore were void,\" said Kairi, representative of the tea workers. The wage board chairman himself reportedly took the owners' representative's side.\nSection 140 of the Labour Act, however, clearly states that the government, represented by the labour ministry, can send back recommendations made by the minimum wage board for reconsideration within 45 days of its receipt with or without comment and information. Giving comments or additional information is not mandatory.\nThe chairman and four other members of the Minimum Wage Board reportedly decided not to have any further discussion and to send the same recommendation back to the labour ministry. The October 4 meeting, thus, wound up with a thumb extended downward.\nThis is a ridiculous development when compared with the minimum wages fixed for workers in other industries. Take the construction and wood sector, for example, where workers are placed in six grades and their wages are calculated on monthly and daily bases. The latest gazette, published on August 16, 2021, has announced their wages. In Grade 6, the lowest-paid among the workers in the construction and wood sector, jogalis (helpers) and labourers will now get a daily wage of Tk 620 in rural areas and Tk 680 in urban areas. The daily wages in Grade 5, for assistant masons and other assistant workers (in rod, wood, electricity, paint and polish), will be Tk 710 in rural areas and Tk 770 in urban areas. Masons, carpenters, electricians, assistant mosaic mechanics, assistant tile mechanics, all belonging to Grade 3, will get a daily wage of Tk 870 in rural areas and Tk 940 in the urban areas. The highest paid workers in this sector (in Grade 1)\u2014mosaic and tile mechanics\u2014will get Tk 1,020 in the rural areas and Tk 1,105 in urban areas.\nWhy, then, are the tea workers, who work harder in the fields and factories, getting such miserable wages? If we recalculate the wages with the subsidies for ration added to the cash pay, a tea worker gets less than Tk 200 a day. As far as we understand, the owners' representative has tried to convince the wage board that it pays a daily wage of Tk 403 to a tea worker. The chairman of the wage board, a senior district judge, must be aware that the owners have monetised the houses given to workers, equipment required for plucking tea leaves, overtime pay, owners' contribution to the provident fund, medical expense, pension, education cost of the children of tea workers, labour welfare programmes, and even the incomes of the tea workers generated from growing vegetables, fruits and raising cattle on the land leased from the government for tea production, while calculating the wages. Section 2 (45) of the labour law does not allow the employers to monetise these and to add them to the wages.\nIf the wage board had any respect for the labour ministry's advice communicated on September 13 and afterwards, it should have further investigated the grievances of the tea workers and consulted all parties\u2014including economists\u2014to reconsider its recommendation. Section 140 (3) of the labour law states that if the wage board thinks there is no need to amend or change the recommendation, it can inform the government explaining the reasons why. However, the government\u2014more specifically the labour ministry, in this case\u2014has the power to take legal measures to make sure the workers get justice in getting fair wages.\nSection 141 of the labour law mentions factors for the wage board to consider at the time of fixing new wage structure for any industry. These are cost of living, standard of living, production cost, price of products, business capability, inflation, type of work, risk and standard, economic and social conditions of the country and of the locality concerned, and other relevant factors.\nHad the wage board been mindful of these factors, and considered the wages that the tea workers get in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, and other countries, it could not have blindly supported the owners and recommended a wage structure that severely infringes the country's constitution and the labour law. Needless to say, the wage board has shown disdain for a largely non-Bangalee and non-Muslim working community, whom many compare with modern-day slaves or a captive labour force.\n\"If we think of living expenses in the Sylhet region, it is Tk 7,750 for a single adult, Tk 14,500 for a four-member family, and Tk 16,800 for a family with more than four members,\" said Dr Binayak Sen, director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), during a recent dialogue on tea workers' wages.\n\"What has been happening with the tea workers is a matter of great injustice,\" said Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, former caretaker government adviser and the executive chairman of the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC). \"The current wages have to be increased because of inflation and other factors. We hope the Minimum Wage Board will increase wages logically.\"\nDespite all the strong arguments shared by different quarters, including the tea workers' union, the owners' side remains rigid about their position to not increase wages at all. With the workers' representative technically excluded, the wage board has blindly taken the owners' side. We can safely say that the owners have hijacked the wage board, to safeguard their profits. This is not fair. The immediate role of the government is to see that justice is done in giving fair wages to the tea workers.\nPhilip Gain is a researcher and director at the Society for Environment and Human Development (SEHD).\n",

        "full_article": "We are disappointed to find that although the Dhaka University authorities recently spoke of their decision to get rid of Gono Rooms at their dormitories, first-year students have been forced to cram into such rooms after the full reopening of residential halls. Only last month, we expressed our doubt about the university's ability to end this Gono Room culture, given that these rooms are mostly occupied by former students who are involved with the ruling party's student wing.\nReports suggest that the authorities had even prepared lists of former students staying in the dorms illegally, and of first- and second-year students to whom these seats would be allotted.\u00a0While these preparations are commendable, it is apparent that the implementation has been less than desirable. On Sunday night, around 30 to 35 students had to sleep on the floor of each Gono Room, which is supposed to accommodate only eight students. The political use of \"guest rooms\" has also returned. According to a report in this daily, first-year students were forced to attend gatherings in the guest rooms of certain dormitories on the same night.\nUniversity students have been deprived of in-person classes throughout almost the entirety of the Covid-19 pandemic due to fears of the disease spreading. Now that they have finally returned to their campuses, it is extremely troubling that they are being forced together into spaces where physical distancing is impossible\u2014that, too, because of political reasons, rather than an accommodation crisis. The repercussions of such actions could be serious, at a time when the Covid-19 situation finally seems under control in the country.\nPrior to the pandemic, the dormitories did not allot seats to first-year students, who had to seek the patronage of Chhatra League men to cram into Gono Rooms in exchange for attending political processions and meetings. This highly toxic practice has been criticised by the prime minister herself, according to the DU vice-chancellor, who sought help from all students to end this culture. However, the cooperation he has asked for must come, first and foremost, from Chhatra League. Although the DU Chhatra League general secretary seemed to agree on the importance of physical distancing, his outright denial of all other allegations against the organisation is not conducive for change.\nWe urge the ruling party to investigate this matter, and rein in its student wing and their political influence over university campuses. The university students urgently need a safe and enabling environment to recover from learning losses. Campuses that are occupied by former students, and where rules do not seem to apply to certain sections of its inhabitants, will only hamper their progress.\n",

        "full_article": "The skyrocketing food prices continue to make the headlines in Bangladesh, exposing the government's failure to put in place an effective mechanism to check the prices of essential goods in the kitchen markets. Week after week, this daily has reported how prices of broiler chicken, edible oil, green chilli, etc have continued to soar, putting immense pressure on low- and fixed-income groups. Even the price of rice\u2014for which the government reduced import duty from 62 percent to 25 percent to keep the price stable\u2014has risen over the past month.\nDespite the commerce ministry saying that onion production reached 2.7 million tonnes this year, against an annual demand of 2.8 million tonnes, the prices of onion rose by Tk 30-35 in about a week. As the government has clearly failed to make traders stick to the set price rate for many essential commodities, consumers have had to cut down on their consumption\u2014their daily protein intake, in particular. Meanwhile, market analysts have raised questions about the authenticity of traders' claims for raising prices. Traders have been saying that they have been continually forced to raise prices due to higher prices of commodities internationally. However, as many experts have pointed out, commodity prices in our kitchen markets have spiked substantially more, compared to the international prices.\nTherefore, it is essential for the government to look into the matter, and punish errant traders and syndicates for trying to exploit consumers at a time when a vast number of people are struggling economically due to various pandemic-related issues.\nAt the same time, it is important to point out that commodity prices have been on the rise for a month now; the recent price hikes have only added to people's woes. The question is: What has the government been doing all this time? Its inaction or failure to control commodity prices only illustrates its apathy to the plight of people.\nWhile the government must take every step necessary to bring commodity prices down to affordable levels, it must also come up with better and more timely strategies of market intervention, as well as put in place effective and sustainable oversight mechanisms to keep the market stable in the long run. It is unacceptable that consumers have to pay for the government's failure every few months, when this is one of the most urgent issues affecting the quality of people's lives.\n",
