The multi-country outbreak in Europe, in 2022, had led to a declaration of a PHEIC. WHO\u2019s announcement comes a day after the Africa CDC declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS), also marking the first time a regional and global health emergency has been declared for a disease outbreak. If this is first such declaration in Africa of a PHECS since 2017, it is also the first time that WHO has declared a PHEIC for a disease outbreak in Africa on the very first time the emergency committee met to decide on the matter. Though WHO claimed in August 2014 that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was declared a public health emergency in the very first meeting of the emergency committee, an Associated Press investigation revealed how WHO resisted calling it a public health emergency for a few months. In the second Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2018-19, WHO declared it a public health emergency only when the emergency committee met for the fourth time.If the 2022 mpox outbreak in the U.K, that spread to over 100 countries, was caused by the milder clade 2b virus \u2014 primarily affecting men who have sex with men, with limited cases among children and adolescents \u2014 the current outbreak is driven by a new and more lethal clade 1b, spread effectively through sexual and non-sexual contact. There have been 2,863 confirmed cases and 517 deaths this year, primarily in the DRC. The clade 1b emerged in the DRC in September 2023, with human-to-human transmission ongoing since then. In the DRC, around two-thirds of infections are in children under 15 years. Vaccines are again in acute short supply. As against 10 million doses needed to control the outbreak, just about 0.21 million doses may be supplied immediately. Even when vaccines were used to blunt transmission in Europe and the U.S. earlier, vaccines were not supplied to Africa despite mpox being endemic there for years. Currently, only the DRC and Nigeria have granted emergency use authorisation for the vaccine. The regulatory hurdle can be sidestepped if the company expresses interest for WHO\u2019s emergency use listing, which will allow international agencies to supply the vaccine to all African countries. Even then, Africa will have to wait till the end of 2025 for the 10 million doses.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nAfrican Union\n\n/\n\ncommunicable diseases\n\n/\n\nvaccines\n\n/\n\npublic health/community medicine\n\n/\n\nhealth organisations\n\n/\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nNigeria",

Ms. Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Thai Prime Minister and tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, and the fourth member of her family to hold the position. Mr. Thaksin was removed in a coup in 2006, while Ms. Paetongtarn\u2019s uncle Somchai Wongsawat was dismissed by the constitutional court in 2008, and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra was also dismissed, again by the same court, in 2014. The latest change of Prime Minister mirrors several such sudden dismissals of the past that are attributed to Thailand\u2019s conservative establishment. Mr. Srettha was among more than a dozen Prime Ministers appointed since 2001. Significantly, the court held Mr. Srettha guilty of ethical violations for appointing a Cabinet Minister who had been convicted for attempting to bribe a judge overseeing Mr. Thaksin\u2019s corruption cases more than a decade ago. Mr. Srettha was himself only elected in 2023, when the reformist Move Forward Party, which won the most seats in the elections, was disqualified from forming a government and banned for suggesting changes to the strict laws governing criticism of the monarchy. As a result, Ms. Paetongtarn\u2019s chances of a smooth term in office, and making radical changes to the system seem bleak. Her most important task would be to help nudge Thailand\u2019s sluggish economy back into shape while averting the fate of her predecessors. Given her age and lack of experience, she is expected to be guided mainly by her father, who is back after his exile in the UAE over corruption charges, following a compromise with the establishment.The developments come at a time of instability in India\u2019s Indian Ocean neighbourhood to the east \u2014 the ouster of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has sent the country into a period of uncertainty, which the interim government must contend with. The developments follow a spurt in violence between militant groups and Myanmar\u2019s embattled junta that imperil India\u2019s investments as well as peace along the border with India\u2019s north-east. With Sri Lanka also heading for presidential elections in September, Thailand\u2019s crisis has cast another shadow over plans to hold the BIMSTEC summit in Bangkok on September 4. Many agreements to be adopted on digital payment mechanisms, connectivity, and maritime cooperation have already been negotiated, and it is to be hoped that the summit will now not need to be put off. While Ms. Paetongtarn\u2019s election may suggest some stability in the short term, New Delhi must keep its shock absorbers on, to deal with other surprise crises and seemingly chronic instability in the neighbourhood.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nThailand\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n/\n\ncorruption & bribery\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nBangladesh\n\n/\n\nMyanmar\n\n/\n\ninvestments\n\n/\n\nSri Lanka",

The delayed elections to J&K will be held under a massive tent of troops \u2013 it\u2019s the first assembly poll since 2014, since Article 370\u2019s abrogation, since J&K was made into a UT (2019), and after delimitation of 2022, in which 6 seats were added to Jammu and 1 to Kashmir.\nJammu has been restive with a sharp uptick in militant activity and encounters. CEC made special note of J&K people\u2019s will and aspiration for free and fair elections. People\u2019s participation in LS polls to J&K\u2019s 5 seats (NC won 2 valley seats, BJP 2 Jammu seats, and an Independent north Kashmir seat Baramulla) is testament to that spirit. Today, an undertrial accused under anti-terror law UAPA is a parliamentarian, having defeated legacy party NC\u2019s Omar Abdullah. One-time BJP ally Mehbooba Mufti also lost the LS polls. People\u2019s grievances and hopes are best captured through elections. J&K\u2019s assembly polls come not a day too soon.\nForce deployment in J&K is one reason CEC gave for de-linking Maharashtra elections that were expected in this round. CEC said another reason was Sept-Oct being festival season. Political parties will be happy with EC\u2019s decision to \u201ctake two at a time\u201d and hold Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls together \u2013 festivals in these two states can be \u201ccelebrated\u201d without looking over their shoulders about any model code of conduct (MCC).\nMCC is also what CEC referred to on the bulk transfers in J&K administration on Aug 15, for which, per local politicians, officials were summoned to work on the national holiday. Local politicians are viewing the transfers as \u201cinterference of LG\u201d. If creases developed on the level-playing field, EC would respond, per CEC. As in LS, EC can expect to be tested as much as candidates, in elections that will be as fiercely contested as LS ones.\n\n",

Infection can also occur through use of contaminated objects. On its part, India would do well to keep its public health system in a high state of alert. Preventive measures like air traveller screening, disease surveillance, testing and contact tracing are the best means for dealing with high-risk infections. From its handling of the first phase of Covid pandemic to its containment of Nipah and Zika viruses last year, Kerala\u2019s example highlights the importance of a timely and effective response to a public health challenge.\nHave systems in place: Global travel, climate change, increasing human interface with natural habitats and growing urbanisation have made pandemics far more probable in the 21st century.

        "full_article": "It is a testament to our unique times that journalists are having to fight against the same abuse and harassment that they did when an authoritarian government was in power. But it does hurt more now because of the expectations created by the student-led mass uprising that overthrew the Awami League government. We understand that the interim government that replaced it requires time to establish full control and effect change, but the responsibility to ensure a safe environment for journalists primarily falls on them, as well as the political and pressure groups active on the ground.\nThat it would not be smooth sailing for journalists after Sheikh Hasina's fall became clear on the very day, when at least eight TV channels and three newspaper offices in Dhaka were attacked. While many assumed these were spur-of-the-moment reactions and would not be repeated, subsequent events, especially on August 14-15, have upset the calculation. On August 14, as many as 20 journalists were injured when the Chattogram Press Club was attacked and ransacked. The same day, a journalist was hacked in Pirojpur. The next day, BNP leader Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu threatened to burn down media houses that will publish photos of Sheikh Hasina. Also on August 15, a number of journalists were assaulted and even made to delete photographs they had taken in Dhaka's Dhanmondi Road 32 on the occasion of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's death anniversary.\nIn fact, the scenes unfolding in Dhanmondi were quite disturbing, as young men interrogated pedestrians, checked their identity cards and phones, and also manhandled visitors who came to pay respects to Bangabandhu. They also prevented any documentation, with announcements being made over loudspeakers instructing journalists and spectators to refrain from filming. Many of these young men were armed with iron rods, plastic pipes, bamboo, and wooden sticks. These harsh measures were apparently part of efforts to prevent a so-called counter-coup by Awami League and allies, with BNP and its student wing staging sit-ins at various locations in Dhaka and the Students against Discrimination movement holding a \"resistance week\" programme. While none of them acknowledged responsibility for the harassment, it just goes to show how chaotic the situation is at the moment.\nClearly, it is not just media freedom that is at stake in such a situation; human rights in general are being violated, too. This is painful to see in the wake of an uprising that wanted to break people free from these very shackles of oppression and subjugation. It's apparent that fascism has not left the building even if the fascists have. The rights to publish, speak, organise or mourn are all inviolable ones. It was, however, heartening to see the student leaders vowing to protect these rights. At least four key coordinators of the students' movement have publicly condemned the excesses that occurred in Dhanmondi and elsewhere. They cautioned against \"fake platforms\" pretending to represent students and also pledged to expel anyone from their platform if found guilty of human rights violations.\nWe appreciate the swift and strong condemnation. But it is important to remind the student leaders that they must be more cautious going forward. Other political forces that are now active and pushing their own agenda must also answer for any crimes committed or instigated in their names. Most importantly, the interim government must take stern actions to prevent such crimes, especially against journalists. Together, they must prevent a return to the same excesses that the past regime made a habit of committing.\n",

        "full_article": "In recent weeks, our country has echoed with the triumphant cries of a movement sparked by students demanding the end of a repressive regime. As someone who stood shoulder to shoulder with these courageous individuals, I have felt the euphoria of our shared victory and the weight of our collective responsibility. The triumph was not just a political victory; it was a testament to the power of unity and the enduring spirit of resistance. But as we bask in its aftermath, a disturbing reality is surfacing: the rise of mob justice. Instead of celebrating our newfound freedom with dignity and respect, we are witnessing a troubling shift towards a new form of oppression, one that mirrors the injustices we once fought to eradicate.\nI want to be clear: I am not here to belittle anyone or question their commitment to the cause. But as we stand on the threshold of a new era, it is imperative that we address the ways in which our movement's ideals are being compromised. If anything, history has taught us that the most dangerous threat to freedom is not always an external oppressor, but the internal corruption of the very ideals we fought to protect. In the wake of our triumph, some disturbing reports have surfaced\u2014of so-called \"representatives\" of the movement seizing rooms once occupied by oppressive leaders, of individuals being harassed and assaulted for their attire or political affiliations, of phones being checked and hotels being raided. This behaviour, cloaked in the guise of justice, is nothing more than a new form of oppression.\nThe essence of our movement was never solely about toppling a tyrannical regime, but about ushering in a new era of inclusivity and respect. Our cause was built on the promise of a society where discrimination would find no refuge and where every voice could be heard without fear. Yet, instead of fostering a culture of tolerance, some of us have chosen to perpetuate a different kind of oppression, casting aside the very principles that fuelled our fight. It is crucial to recognise that true freedom is not merely the absence of tyranny, but the presence of equity and respect for all.\u00a0The shift from people championing the anti-discrimination movement to some of them engaging in acts of mob justice represents a perilous deviation from our original mission. We must confront this shift head-on and reaffirm our commitment to the values that inspired us. I appreciate that the leaders of the anti-discrimination student movement addressed the recent incidents and made it known that these are reprehensible, unacceptable acts.\nIn a true democracy, criticism should not be equated with betrayal, but embraced as a necessary part of the discourse. To label dissent as support for a discredited regime undermines the very essence of the freedom we sought to achieve. The measure of our success should be found not only in the regime we dismantled, but in our ability to uphold democratic values in the face of new challenges. While it is definitely too early to comment on where we are headed, we must engage in these difficult conversations and keep things in check.\nThe interim government now faces a pivotal moment. The decisions made now will shape the future of our society and determine whether we won't become the very power we sought to overthrow. It is time for courageous leadership that embraces the full spectrum of democratic principles, including the protection of individual rights and the encouragement of open discourse. The challenge before us is not just to avoid the pitfalls of authoritarianism, but to actively build a society that reflects the highest ideals of justice and equality. This requires more than just symbolic gestures; it demands substantive actions and a commitment to creating systems that promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. The revolution was not an end but a beginning\u2014a chance to forge a new path and to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated. True freedom is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all. Power must be used to uplift, not to oppress.\nTo the student leaders and coordinators who guided us through this historic struggle, I urge you to recognise the immense responsibility that comes with the power we have gained. You have the ability to set an example, to lead with integrity and ensure that the ideals we fought for are not lost in the process of rebuilding. When you first called for action, you sparked a fire within countless students who stood with you, ready to support the cause in any capacity. Now as you reform the political infrastructure, please remember the power and influence you hold over these students, and guide them so they can lead from the front to uphold the rule of law and ensure equity and justice for all. As we navigate this new era, let us remain steadfast in our commitment to the values that united us.\nMaisha Islam Monamee\u00a0is a student of Institute of Business Administration (IBA) at the University of Dhaka and a contributor at The Daily Star.\n\n\u00a0\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Revolutions spark dramatic changes, but the real test lies in the reform strategies that can steer a country toward justice. With numerous pressing issues, prioritising the right reforms is crucial. Recent upheavals, such as the Arab Spring, illustrate how popular movements can falter and revert to oppressive practices under new regimes. This makes future protests even more challenging, particularly in poorer nations with less experienced protesters.\nRevolutions are rare, and missing the opportunity can mean losing it forever. While a revolution can ignite immense hope, without proper reforms, it risks descending into chaos rather than improving people's lives. Marginalised groups, including workers, farmers, and minorities, have historically been promised the benefits of democracy but have rarely seen these promises fulfilled. Time and again, they have been betrayed by politicians who prioritise self-interest, profiteering, and looting of the state. This has often created distrust and anxiety among the general populace, who lack the means to voice their concerns through legitimate institutional mechanisms.\nIn Bangladesh, the structure of political parties, characterised by a lack of internal democracy, raises doubts about the long-term success of student-led revolutions. While the student movement has achieved a significant victory, true success remains elusive. Discussing reforms in public institutions like the justice system, law enforcement, and the election commission is insufficient. For lasting justice, peace, and socio-economic well-being, we must prioritise internal democracy within political parties. Internal democracy is a fundamental cornerstone of any democracy, yet Bangladeshi political parties have consistently evaded it, bringing us back to square one repeatedly. For instance, from the fall of the former President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, including the end of the last BNP government, people have been disappointed by autocratic attitudes, governance, and rampant corruption. These parties have often suppressed dissent and alternative voices through intimidation, abductions, and extrajudicial killings, perpetuating a cycle of abuse.\nFocusing solely on public institutions while ignoring political party reform risks repeating past mistakes. Without addressing internal party dynamics, the same autocratic and oligarchic behaviours are likely to resurface. Therefore, any reforms initiated by the interim government must prioritise the internal revolutionization of political parties.\nThe biggest hurdle is the undue influence that a few families exert over their political parties. They hold undemocratic power and monopolise their parties. Sheikh Hasina had total control of her party, with family members and close associates installed in key positions, thereby protecting her dominance, and avoiding criticism. The lack of internal democracy and dialogue has further silenced dissent through state machinery.\nTo break free, political parties must democratise. They need to be free from dominant family politics, which often function like mafia operations. Leaders should be elected, not selected, and internal election processes must be genuine and observed by an independent body to prevent them from becoming mere box-ticking exercises. An independent body, through constitutional changes, can rigorously scrutinise whether these parties uphold and practice democratic values, providing all members a fair chance to run for leadership at all levels.\nImposing term limits on party leaders and their families is also necessary to prevent entrenched autocracy. For example, the main leader and their family members should only be allowed to run for office twice. Without such limits, the old guards will find excuses to stifle new leaders and maintain their grip on power. The current political vacuum clearly shows that parties have hardly allowed any members to consider running for leadership, let alone pursue the democratisation of their parties.\nFurthermore, separating student politics from party politics is essential for genuine reform. Students should have the freedom to engage politically through student union elections, but this involvement should not be swayed by the direct influence of political parties. So far, students have been used by all political parties to pursue their political agendas, rather than being provided with free and fair spaces for dialogue and education.\nDecentralising the abuse of power at the local party level is also crucial. Committees in villages and towns, as well as in major cities, should be elected by grassroots members and local public, rather than being handpicked by central leaders who are often disconnected from local issues. This may help reduce the bribery and nepotism rampant within parties and obstruct internal democratisation. Marginalising alternative voices within the parties prevents those who could contribute to greater democratic rights and values from being heard, both within the party and among the public.\nAll this may sound radical to the existing parties, especially when they are in a hurry for an election, but they must be honest with themselves before convincing the public that the old ways are acceptable. The old politics of violence and revenge are no longer acceptable. Current acts of vandalism against public and private properties, along with communal violence, all indicate why reform is urgently needed as the transition of power to a democratic party hopefully occurs in due course.\nThough the interim government and the spirit of the movement face a tough task, they must ensure political parties undergo necessary radical democratic reforms, just like public institutions. Otherwise, history will repeat itself, and the real freedom and well-being of the people will suffer.\nAt this critical moment, the revolution must serve every citizen, not just a few politicians or oligarchs who seek to govern without accountability or transparency.\nRashedur Chowdhury\u00a0is professor of business and management at Essex Business School (EBS).

The irony is, as pointed out in a TIB report published earlier, the afore-mentioned agencies failed to take necessary action against the said minister and his wife, though there was ample evidence about their corruption. Notably, the TIB has been consistently complaining about the failures of the entities like the ACC to function properly. It was not just the lack of courage on the part of the ACC or the bureaucracy that was at fault. On the contrary, the anti-graft body has always been way behind its core tasks. A case in point was the dismissal of an investigating officer of the ACC by the anti-graft agency's higher authority as the investigator unearthed massive corruption involving land acquisition by a powerful syndicate in Chattogram. On a number of occasions, such dubious role played by the anti-graft body naturally raised questions about not just capacity, but its very probity and integrity. In a similar vein, the BFIU's role in enabling the anti-graft bodies to conduct investigations into corruption cases by providing necessary information on suspicious activities and transactions in the banks and other financial institutions has also been questionable. Consider that in a report published in February this year, it was revealed that over the past five years, suspicious financial transactions increased by about 300 per cent and 90 per cent of those took place in the banking sector. But one would like to ask how many of those Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) were analysed to track down the perpetrators of actual financial crimes. Instead of that, just saying that all such suspected transactions were not necessarily instances of money laundering, as some senior executives of BFIU actually did, does not exonerate them from their responsibility of analysing each of the STRs meticulously to find out the genuine instances of money laundering or other forms of financial crime. That was also not an impossible task given that there is no dearth of digital tools to do the job. Unfortunately, far from doing their job professionally and impartially, these anti-graft bodies became tools in the hands of government to harass its political opponents. As things stand, effecting a massive reform, as recommended by the TIB, is the right option to render the anti-graft bodies useful and effective.",

        "full_article": "Despite having built up an over-capacity of power generation in the energy sector), the past government did little to ensure a cheap and reliable supply chain of primary energy, over which it would have total control. That is the irony of the $460 billion dollar economy in Bangladesh. Opinions differ about actual demand for power in the country, but it is around 16,000 MW (megawatts). Despite this, power plants were built and commissioned and today, the grid connected power generation capacity stands at slightly above 27,000 MW. Over the course of the last one year or so, the past government has had to take expensive high-interest, short-term loans from international lending institutions simply to defray payments for energy purchases. A ridiculous situation and one that threatened macro-economic stability in the mid to long term!According to an article published in Energy & Power magazine: \"The highest-ever generation was 16,477MW on 30 April 2024. In the peak hours on that day, the deficit was 1,000MW. The unit cost of generation in FY 2022-23 was Tk 12.13. The average power tariff was Tk 7.04 per unit\" On top of that, the erstwhile government had decided that subsidy on power sector would be removed in phases within the next two years. It is the bulk and retail consumer who would bear the burden of subsidy withdrawal. While consumers could curtail energy consumption by reducing usage, energy-efficiency transformation of industry cannot happen overnight and there is also a cost factor involved.The arrogance with which the ministry of power & energy and policymakers had ramrodded the entire process was sad to see. The explanation, if any, was that utility companies were running into billions of Taka worth of losses and these had to be covered with ever-increasing rise of tariff. During the golden days of economic development, subsidies on power increased by leaps and bounds in the name of \"capacity payment\". According to a study by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), over the last seven years, capacity charge jumped from Tk50 billion to Tk320 billion. One would have thought that with so much financial outlay, generation cost would be managed. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) \"forecasted that the generation cost would be reduced to Tk10.50/unit.\" Why so? Because one major element in all these calculation was not shared publicly. Yes, the power generation capacity (on paper) increased dramatically over the last 14 years, but as experience had shown that little thought had gone into awarding of contracts. There was no audit to calculate whether contracted power companies were actually delivering stated power outputs as per contract. The only thing that mattered was awarding of contracts with zero oversight and this is what has landed the nation in the mess it is in today!As pointed out by a member of the Bangladesh Energy Society, the capacity charge clause necessitated the unnecessary payment on huge reserve margins that shot up the generation costs. This is supported by the fact that the former state minister of energy had informed the last parliament that the government had to pay beyond Tk 1,000 billion as capacity charge for the past 13 years. Perhaps it was a pipedream that policymakers believed in that international markets for three primary energy sources: liquid fuel, coal and LNG would remain stable for eons to come. It simply goes to show that greed overtook common sense and the economy had become dependent on an energy plan that could be undermined at any time. Every nation strives for energy self-dependence, regardless of the source of energy. In the case of Bangladesh, it was fortunate to have gas and coal reserves - but these are finite resources, regardless of the reserve size. Yet, we have witnessed the obtuseness of policymakers in making energy plans that was focused on making the country import-dependent while disregarding the very basics of energy-efficiency, curbing wastage and unbridled corruption that would overwhelm the state of finances within a short period of time. The current government has landed on this mess and it must tackle the severe energy crisis. Much has already been written on the formation of a banking commission to deal with the runaway corruption in the financial sector. It is time to form a proper energy audit commission comprising renowned energy experts of the country and people who understand the energy affair. The task of this commission would be to sift through the evidence of how and where subsidies went, who got what under \"capacity charge\" and precisely, what is the actual power generation capacity of the various power plants commissioned. Only with such data in hand, can a proper energy policy be formulated and the road to recovery may begin. Recovery will be both painful and time-consuming but this can no longer wait.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "After the fall of Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian regime last week, the demand for broad-based reforms in various sectors has become vociferous. The interim government is, however, not in a position to fulfil all such demands within a short period, as its primary responsibility is to restore law and order and make all the state machinery and institutions functional. Citizens also need to cooperate with the interim government to bring some stability to the country within a reasonable time. So, the demand list needs to be brief, and emphasis should be put on making the measures effective.Nevertheless, one necessary and rational demand now is banning student politics or at least restricting it for now. The reason is simple. Student politics is rotten already and has become a pervasive tool of intimidation and corruption. After the overthrow of autocrat Ershad regime in 1990, thanks to the vital role of student bodies, the country entered into a democratic phase. Unfortunately, student politics also started to degrade as its link with power politics increased. For the next three and a half decades, student wings of two major ruling parties gradually turned into organisations of bullies and criminals. They became intolerant to the opposition and other student bodies. The situation deteriorated severely in the last decade when the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL) became an organisation of terror at worst. Backed by the ruling party, the Bangladesh Awami League, and with support from law enforcement agencies, leaders and activists of BCL terrorised rivals as well as innocent students. Intimidation, torture, illegal toll collection, physical harassment of female students and even murder of students go to their 'credit'. The brutal killing of Abrar Fahad in BUET by a group of BCL activists in 2019 horrified everyone. Following the incident, students compelled the BUET authority to ban student politics at the campus. The list of BCL's misdeeds and criminal acts is long, and the number of victims is innumerable. However, BCL activists' attack on students demanding the reform of the quota system became a major turning point of the movement in July last. It fuelled mass anger and protests erupted across the country, and for the first time, ordinary students resisted the goons of the BCL.Ordinary students, not aligned to any party, have suffered a lot due to the politics of terror. They have rightly raised their voices against partisan politics at campuses. Echoing their voices, coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement have already demanded that all political activities in the name of student politics be banned in all educational institutions. Parents and guardians also demand this. Except for some irresponsible and insensitive people, no one favours student politics in the traditional form. In fact, the underlying message of the demand for banning student politics is restricting the current form of student politics, where various student organisations are affiliated with multiple political parties and primarily serve the interests of the mother organisations, not students. Instead, students need to be allowed to organise themselves for various valid reasons on any non-political platform. Students of BUET have already demonstrated how to do it and set an example. The anti-discrimination student movement is the most shining example of this connection, showing that students with more outstanding common interests can join hands together to advance the cause.So, it will be the right move to restrict party-affiliated student politics in the country immediately, and a wholesale ban may be taken into consideration later. As colleges and universities need to be opened soon and students have to return to their classrooms and work hard to make up for losses to studies, suspension of student politics is a must. Also, politics for teachers should also not be entertained. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The reopening of primary schools across the country after nearly a month of closure marks a crucial step towards resuming normalcy in our education system. Following the indefinite closure of government primary schools and related educational institutions on July 17 due to unrest surrounding students' quota reform demonstrations, it is heartening to see students returning to their classrooms. However, the extended closure has inevitably resulted in significant learning losses for many young students, which we must address with urgency and effective strategies.The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education has rightly instructed all government primary schools, Children's Welfare Trust-operated schools, and Bureau of Non-Formal Education learning centres to fully resume classroom activities. Despite these efforts, the poor attendance reported following the reopening, due to lingering safety concerns, underscores the need for immediate action to mitigate the impact of the closure on students' education.To recover the learning loss experienced during the closure, schools should take effective initiatives to address the academic gaps that have emerged during the closure. These programmes could include additional classes, remedial sessions, and targeted support for students who have fallen behind.There should be enhanced support from teachers. Teachers can play a vital role in helping students recover losses. Additionally, parental engagement is also imperative. Encouraging parents to be actively involved with their children's learning process can help reinforce classroom teachings at home. Schools should organise workshops and resources to support parents in this endeavour.The authorities have to create a safe learning environment at school. Ensuring that schools are safe and conducive to learning is critical. Addressing safety concerns can help increase student attendance and participation.In the end, monitoring and evaluation are the key. Regular assessments and monitoring should be put in place to track students' progress and identify those who need additional support. This will allow for timely interventions and adjustments to teaching strategies.The reopening of schools is a positive development, but we must now focus on implementing these measures to effectively address the learning loss and support our students' educational recovery. The success of our education system depends on our ability to act decisively and supportively during this critical period.\nFaruk IqbalAn education instructorDhanmondi, Dhaka",
