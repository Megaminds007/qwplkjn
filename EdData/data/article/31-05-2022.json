Rarely has a political party abandoned a set of principles within days of announcing it with such boisterous aplomb and self-righteousness as the Congress has done in this case. The Udaipur Shivir resolved that the \u201cprinciple of \u2018one family, one ticket\u2019 should be ensured\u201d. A retirement age for leaders for elected posts was suggested, though no specific decision was made. These moves would have been a good start, though not in the least sufficient, to stir some fresh thought, infuse some new blood and breathe new life into the party. But far from making any serious attempts to adhere to this modest reform agenda, the Congress party trampled all over it, if not in letter, most certainly in spirit. The exclusion of Anand Sharma and Ghulam Nabi Azab, who have been in the Upper House for four and five terms, respectively, merely shows that scores have been settled rather than fidelity shown to any principles. Who will now be waiting for its 2024 Lok Sabha candidate list in which the Congress has promised to include 50% of those below 50 years of age?At the end, of the 10 members the Congress will send to the Upper House, there are at least two who are the second members of their family to represent the party at the State legislature or Parliament; all five seats that the party can win in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh \u2014 the last two States where it has Chief Ministers \u2014 have gone to leaders from outside. Even the candidature of Randeep Singh Surjewala is not from his home State of Haryana, but Rajasthan. As it happens, the Congress is holding State-level congregations across the country on June 1 and 2 to communicate the decisions taken in Udaipur. The Rajya Sabha list hardly forms an inspiring backdrop to that exercise. The party demands blood and sweat from its workers, and offers bounties to a select few. All this has naturally triggered resentment in the party, as there are no objective and defensible criteria that the Congress has followed. This utter disregard, and in fact, humiliation of the ordinary worker has already brought the Congress to its knees. Any other party would have held those responsible for its string of defeats to account. The Congress brand of politics has been reduced to deal making among the small club of managers and power brokers without a support base. While that might suit those who control it, any analysis that pins hope on the Congress to be a source of democratic revival in India must be tempered by a cold shower of sobriety.",

Gujarat Titans did precisely that while clinching the Indian Premier League (IPL) title through a clinical display against Rajasthan Royals during Sunday\u2019s final in front of a delirious home crowd at Ahmedabad. Summit clashes, except in rare episodes, can be tepid affairs despite all the hype and the IPL climax dished out a low-scoring tussle on a dry surface. But credit is due to the Titans for remaining the stand-out unit through the tournament that remained anchored in Mumbai and Pune before shifting base to Kolkata and Ahmedabad in the concluding stretch. The league also offered some redemption for all-rounder Hardik Pandya, the Titans\u2019 captain. Often weighed down by injuries and the comparisons with Kapil Dev, Pandya finally turned the corner, leading Titans with finesse, scoring brisk runs and prising out valuable wickets like he did in the final \u2014 scalping Jos Buttler, Shimron Hetmyer and Royals\u2019 skipper Sanju Samson. Through the IPL\u2019s long summer, Titans always had consistent performers chipping in without fail. In the final too, players cutting across skill-sets and nationalities excelled, be it spinner Rashid Khan or batters Shubman Gill and David Miller while Hardik too etched a 34. For Royals, there were expectations about the team wresting the cup as a tribute to its first captain, the late Shane Warne.However, sport does not entirely ride on emotion and Royals stumbled at the last step. But there was no shame as the squad did remarkably well until the final with Buttler leading the run charts, scoring tons almost at will. Royals last won the title during the 2008 inaugural edition and the latest comeback augurs well for Samson\u2019s men. Another debutant unit, Lucknow Super Giants, also performed fine to book a last-four slot. That Titans and Giants stayed the course allayed those fears about a bloated league with 10 teams, throwing up forgettable cricket. Instead it was the established behemoths, former champion Mumbai Indians and defending champion Chennai Super Kings, that ate humble pie and reiterated the surprise factor in sport. India\u2019s blue-chip batters \u2014 skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli \u2014 had a horror run while the success of rookie speedster Umran Malik, spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and veteran Dinesh Karthik, who blitzed with a strike-rate of 183.33, revealed that hope is intrinsic to the league. In a year that will witness the ICC Twenty20 World Cup, the league was a selection-primer. But a few worries remain and those are centred on the IPL\u2019s commercial heft. The drop in TRPs hints at saturation with the event and the organisers need to find ways to get back viewership. Other than that, the league is here to stay with 10 teams to boot.",

        "full_article": "In the Narayanganj City Corporation (NCC) election earlier this year, most polling centres looked pretty much how they should look. There were voters standing in long queues, waiting for their turn to exercise their voting right. Polling agents, officers and law enforcement officials were seen doing their usual election day duties. However, there was one element at almost every polling centre that was very unusual: hand-washing arrangements. At first glance, you would think they were there as part of the usual Covid safety protocol. But if you waited long enough, you would see people actually washing only their thumbs, used in the electronic voting machine (EVM) for identification.\nAs it turned out, the EVMs could not read many people's fingerprints, especially of the elderly voters, and every time that happened, they rubbed petroleum jelly on their thumbs, which were kept at the polling officers' tables. Some also used other remedies such as lotion and slices of lemon.\nFingerprint mismatch on the EVMs was one of the reasons that slowed down vote-casting during the NCC polls; there was a number of cases where people could not even cast their votes as their fingerprints did not match with the machine. In addition, many voters were confused during voting as they were not familiar with the process. Some were seen expressing frustration as they waited a long time in the queues to vote. But there was the opposite picture, too: it took a considerably short time for young people to cast their votes.\nThe NCC election was free, fair and peaceful, except for the EVM trouble. In a city corporation election where only 500,000 voters were supposed to cast their votes, EVMs appeared to be a major problem. I saw how the election officials were struggling to manage the situation. If EVMs are used in all 300 constituencies of Bangladesh in the upcoming general election, where some 120 million people are supposed to cast their votes, what would happen? I, for one, am worried.\nThe issue of EVMs came to the fore as the top leaders of the ruling Awami League said EVMs would be used everywhere during the parliamentary election scheduled next year. It may be the ruling party's desire, but the whole issue grabbed public attention as the performance of the last two Election Commissions in holding free and fair elections was a cause for sheer frustration. The current Election Commission, formed in February, said they were yet to decide on the matter, and were debating whether they would make the decision after speaking with the political parties and other stakeholders. The BNP and some other political parties are completely against using EVMs, terming them \"automated vote-rigging machines.\" They said these machines could be programmed in such a way that, no matter which symbol a voter pressed on in an EVM, the vote would go to a preselected symbol. There would be no paper trail or proof on paper of voting. Although it is absolutely at the Election Commission's discretion whether EVMs will be used in the polls or not, the ruling party's desire for EVMs has put the commission under pressure, and now it has to walk a tightrope.\nAccording to media reports, countries like Namibia, Nepal, Armenia, Bhutan, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and the US use some form of electronic voting. Meanwhile, in October 2006, the Netherlands banned the use of EVMs. In 2009, the Republic of Ireland declared a moratorium on using EVMs. Italy followed suit. In March 2009, the Supreme Court of Germany ruled that voting through EVMs was unconstitutional, saying that transparency was a constitutional obligation, but efficiency was not a constitutionally protected value. Norway stopped using EVMs in 2003. Pakistan, the UK, and France used EVMs once, but these countries stopped it as well.\nIn Bangladesh, EVMs were used for the first time in 2010, as an experiment, at 14 polling centres of a ward in Chattogram City Corporation polls. The last Election Commission, led by KM Nurul Huda, held talks with various stakeholders, where many were against using EVMs in the polls. The newly formed commission also held talks with various stakeholders, where the majority opined against using EVMs, without reaching consensus. Many even suggested including the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the EVMs so that voters would get a printed slip after casting their votes. The Election Commission held talks with information and communications technology experts last week, where they said it would be almost impossible to manipulate the EVMs.\nThe issue of EVMs is now more of trust than technical. When the distrust between the ruling party and the opposition parties are very high, this EVM debate will do nothing but widen the gap and may foil the government's intention to bring the BNP in the next election. In countries like Bangladesh, voting is a festive activity where people enthusiastically go to the polling centres to cast their votes. But in the last two general elections\u2014in 2014 and 2018\u2014many people were denied their chances to cast their votes. If the Election Commission can ensure a congenial atmosphere where voters will be able to cast their votes without any hassle, that should not be hampered by a controversial issue like EVMs. Machines are supposed to make a task smoother, but if it creates hazards instead, people will be discouraged to cast their votes, and the election will come under question. Moreover, as I said earlier, it is a matter of trust, not a technical issue. If trust is lacking, why make the situation difficult by using EVMs instead of ballots?\n\u00a0\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Recently, the United Nations published the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2022, highlighting the slow progress of Covid-19 recovery in developing countries due to fiscal constraints, while developed economies recovered quickly by borrowing a record amount of low-interest loans. This discrepancy among countries has been defined as the \"Great Finance Divide.\"\nBangladesh, which is set to become a developing country by 2026, started to meet the SDGs early, backed by strong political commitment as well as the achievements during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. But like the rest of the world, Covid had a negative impact on Bangladesh's economy, causing a setback to the hard-earned progress in poverty alleviation. Consequently, the GDP growth has slowed down since FY2019-20 (3.5 percent), and is predicted to continue at 6.7 percent in FY2022-23. As a result, investments into SDG-aligned projects have shrunk. It is, thus, critical to address how Bangladesh, as a lower middle income country, is strategically preparing to respond to the crisis and access to productive investments, which are pivotal for achieving the SDGs by 2030.\nThe INFF is the tool to implement the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (the framework outlined in 2015 on financing for development) at the national level by supporting countries in their planning process and overcoming their barriers to SDG financing. The Bangladesh government and the UN are jointly implementing a programme titled the Integrated National Financing Framework for Accelerating Achievement of SDGs in Bangladesh (INFF4SDGs), which began in 2020, to support the government in mobilising resources and filling up the financial gaps for attaining the SDGs.\nCurrently, the Economic Relations Division (ERD) under the finance ministry, with technical support from the UN Development Fund (UNDP), has been re-assessing the development finance landscape (first conducted in 2016) to identify the gaps, opportunities, and options of policy reforms that can mobilise new forms of public and private financing, strengthen collaboration across the ministries and with the private sector, and boost government policies for managing, measuring, and influencing financing in the context of the 8th FYP, Agenda 2030 and Covid recovery. The findings of the DFA will support the government and other stakeholders\u2014e.g. the private sector, development partners, civil society organisations, etc\u2014to take a more integrated approach to SDG financing.\nThe SDG financing strategy lies at the core of INFF operationalisation. Therefore, the General Economics Division (GED) under the planning commission prepared the first SDG financing strategy in 2017 to estimate the overall additional costs of implementing all 17 SDGs. However, considering the new realities\u2014e.g. graduation from the LDC status, the Covid pandemic, need for creating innovative fiscal spaces and developing business models for the private sector to strike a balance between profit maximisation and social objectives\u2014the financing strategy has been re-calculated with technical support from the UNDP.\nWhile the public sector and public finance are central to the implementation of SDGs, the private sector and capital markets must also play a key role. According to the SDG financing strategy, Bangladesh requires an additional USD 928 billion to implement SDGs by 2030, of which the private sector accounts for 42 percent. Therefore, to unlock the private sector's potential, UNDP Bangladesh has initiated an SDG Investor Mapping to help investors identify investment opportunity areas (IOA) by providing real-time market intelligence needed by the private sector to increase investments towards achieving the SDGs. Collaborations between the right matches are the next step, catalysing the financial flow into SDG-aligned investments. A database of these projects will be hosted in a pipeline builder (Virtual Investment Platform), offering an avenue for an investor to search, select and invest in potential projects based on certified investment and market analytics.\nInnovative instruments like the potential of Islamic financing (e.g. Zakat Fund) and SDG bonds in Bangladesh can be new sources of resource mobilisation. Also, Blended Financing, an instrument to use public funds to unlock private investment in support of the country's efforts for sustainable development, could be a useful frontier.\nInstitutionalisation of a national-level multistakeholder platform can strategically guide the updating process of existing policies and strategies, monitor and review the public and private investments in light of SDG financing, and build a concrete pipeline of bankable projects.\nFinally, the implementation of this ambitious Agenda 2030 requires not just more financial resources, but collective efforts and coordination to improve efficient allocation, effective operations, and the impact of SDG-aligned projects and programmes.\n\u00a0\nSk Abdullah Jonayed\u00a0is a sustainable development specialist, currently working at UNDP Bangladesh.

        "full_article": "The World Health Assembly, which is meeting in Geneva for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began, has agreed to set a framework to begin preparing for future pandemics. But this decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), with its many delegates from middle- and low-income countries, faces a difficult reality: Even as the world only begins to comprehend the scale of our devastating failures responding to Covid, the rich countries of the world want to move on from the pandemic.\nPreparing for the next pandemic will require more than a commitment from delegates at the World Health Assembly. It requires a structural shift towards a fairer framework of global health, where power is distributed more equitably via a social business model of vaccine and drug production. Social business is the form of business which is built on the principle of solving human problems in a sustainable business way, where owners are not interested in taking any profit except for the return of the original investment amount over a period of time. It's a non-dividend company aimed at solving social problems, not personal money-making.\nThere are concrete steps that world leaders can make towards this framework. If governments can give billions of dollars of grants to pharmaceutical companies to develop and distribute vaccines, they can invest these funds in social business pharmaceutical companies and pass on the benefits to the needy users of the vaccines.\nThe global inequities wrought by the pandemic are apparent: More than 20 million people have died of Covid, with the deaths overwhelmingly concentrated in lower-income countries. The WHO had set a target of vaccinating 70 percent of the world's population by the middle of this year. But, as we approach that deadline, just 16 percent of people in low-income countries have received a single dose. At this rate, it will take another two and a half years for the poorest countries to hit the WHO target.\nAfter lower-income countries were denied vaccines for more than a year, some doses are finally beginning to arrive. Supplies arrive unpredictably all at once, in large volumes, and often close to their expiration date. When doses do arrive, lower-income countries have little say about which vaccines are delivered, in what volume, and on what timeline, making it nearly impossible to plan vaccination campaigns. Production, meanwhile, remains concentrated in the Global North.\nAnd now that effective treatments such as antiviral pills have been developed, the cycle is beginning again.\nWealthy countries have already bought up almost the entire supply of Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's Lagevrio for 2022. The companies are gatekeeping which countries can produce the drug\u2014excluding many countries, including almost all of Latin America. Pfizer has even made the outrageous claim that an attempt to produce Paxlovid in the Dominican Republic would be a breach of the company's \"human rights.\"\nWealth is power. And the brutally unequal global roll-out of Covid vaccines and treatments is a consequence of an ever-increasing concentration of wealth and focus on profit maximisation. Today's pharmaceutical industry supplies drugs to the highest bidder to make ever greater profits. Equity and access are treated as little more than public relations issues.\nAgainst this backdrop of stark inequity, immediate funding for the global roll-out of Covid vaccines, treatments, and tests is essential. It is the wealthy nations, the G10, the continuous beneficiaries of the wealth-concentrating economic machine, that have benefited from the current pharmaceutical model at everyone else's expense. They have the resources to narrow the great vaccine gap, if they want to. And to make a start, I recently called on US President Joe Biden to take the lead with a USD 5 billion commitment to support global vaccination efforts.\nIncreasing numbers of vaccines are getting produced, but they are not reaching the right places and the right people. When new, more effective vaccines are ready, they will once again be sold to the highest bidder, leaving lower-income countries fighting today's virus with yesterday's tools. It's imperative that this system be changed. We must have clear decisions on where vaccines and treatments are produced, by whom, for what objective, and how accessible and affordable they are. And freeing Covid vaccines from profit and patent is the key.\nI have appealed for the establishment of social business pharmaceutical companies. These would be non-dividend-seeking companies that would produce vaccines and medicines to reach out to places and people who are always missed by the current system, and sell them at production cost, without markups, also at prices that are affordable to the lowest-income people, through cross-subsidies. It is the clearest thing the health sector could do to address one of its most pressing problems, reaching everyone, everywhere from the bottom up. But it requires removing barriers like intellectual property rules and social business initiatives. And, while the appeal to make vaccines patent-free to allow global production gained some good traction, it has not been enough to deliver action.\nNow, amid a crisis of this depth and breadth, is the best time to undertake this initiative. If we decide to switch gradually from a charity model to a social business model, we will lay the foundation for local manufacturing and distribution of vaccines, tests, and treatments. Leaders can start with the next generation of coronavirus vaccines, by overriding patents and investing in socially driven generics manufacturers, to ensure the Global South does not have to fight tomorrow's variants with yesterday's tools.\nWorld leaders can clear away the barriers to generic vaccine and treatment production, by supporting a comprehensive waiver of intellectual property rules on Covid tools at the World Trade Organization (WTO) this month. And they can do everything in their power to compel pharmaceutical companies to share their vaccine, test, and treatment technology with the Global South.\nInstead, however, the EU, UK, and Switzerland have blocked an intellectual property waiver for more than a year. The US has refused to countenance removing these barriers for treatments, insisting that a waiver cover only vaccines. They can sense that the domestic political pressure on Covid is waning. So, just as negotiations intensify, rich countries are closing ranks.\nAny meaningful progress will be too late for the millions who have died needlessly from Covid. But our actions today can correct our course for tomorrow's variants and set a model for future health crises. There is still time for world leaders to say never again, to ensure that the right to health is extended to everyone, and to commit to a fairer system of global health that prioritises human life over the profits of a handful of pharmaceutical companies.\n\u00a0\nDr Muhammad Yunus is an economist, social business entrepreneur, and civil society leader.

        "full_article": "In a 2014 article on sterile policy measures of European technocrats, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek cites\u00a0the example of Romanian leftist writer Panait Istrati who visited the Soviet Union in the 1930s. It was a time of big purges and show trials. So a Soviet apologist, trying to convince Istrati of the need for violence against the enemies of the state, evoked the proverb, \u200b\"You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.\" To which the latter tersely replied, \u200b\"All right. I can see the broken eggs. Where's this omelette of yours?\"\nThe same can perhaps be said, mutatis mutandis, of the drive for development in present-day Bangladesh. For years, big government projects and initiatives were packaged under that umbrella term with a promise to end the country's perennial poverty. Citizens were assured that there would be food at affordable prices, jobs in every household, proper housing, schooling, and healthcare. That their rights would be protected, their safety guaranteed, and their mobility unrestrained. In return, all they have to do is have faith and wait. But seeing how long that waiting period has been, citizens may well ask: Okay, but where is that omelette that the government keeps promising us?\nThe omelette and broken eggs are apt metaphors for the ever-widening gulf between the promise of development and the reality. The omelette, or as you may like to call it \"Shonar Bangla,\" is the glue that has held a disgruntled nation together. For 50 years and counting, it gave politicians the equivalent of the American Dream to entice citizens with a future that would be transformative\u2014not just for the nation in general, but at the individual level as well. After all, what is development if its fruits are not enjoyed by all intended beneficiaries? The broken eggs, the price to be paid for the proverbial omelette, give them a sobering reality check.\nThe pitfall of measuring development based on macrodata is that it shows the big picture\u00a0but fails to account for the development achieved, if at all, on a micro/personal level. There is no scope for taking stock of the lived experience of individuals. One of the reasons for having public representatives in the policy circles is that they can offer insights that technocrats sitting in their armchairs cannot. But if the lived experiences are any indication, both groups have miserably failed to recognise or offer any solution to the continued sufferings of ordinary people.\nJust think of all the road\u00a0and transport related projects taken up over the last decade or so. Have we experienced increased mobility during this time? Have our roads become safer? Do women and girls feel more secure? Does any of us? Despite all the money that has been spent during this period, the daily traffic hasn't thinned out, nor has it become more manageable. Out in the highways, the mobility has increased somewhat, but at the cost of commuters being more at risk than ever before. The state of air and sound pollutions\u2014due in large part to mismanagement and irresponsible behaviour in the transport sector\u2014has deteriorated to a point where Dhaka is cited as a cautionary tale for botched urban planning.\nAs I write this, a national daily reports that the price of rice has increased again, despite the high yield of Boro rice. We're repeatedly told how Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in food production. On the other and more relatable side of this picture is how food is becoming more inaccessible by the day. How do you reconcile these contrasting scenarios? The prices of all food and non-food items have skyrocketed beyond comprehension, even though ordinary citizens' capacity to purchase hasn't risen concurrently. More people today are living in semi-starvation. The sad part is, this is never reflected in any official statistics. The robust economic growth figures shown by the government are thus either designedly selective or manipulated to cover the gaping hole underneath our feet.\nTrue, our economy has grown in size and scope, but so has public spending on ill-planned and ill-executed projects. Unnecessary construction projects are being taken up to fill the coffers of groups with vested interests, even before the scars of old projects are healed. Amid ongoing concerns about a currency crisis, there seems to have been a realisation in the policy circles about the importance of tightening our purse strings from austerity measures, leading to the cancellation of foreign trips of public officials and postponement of projects requiring imports. But the drive wasn't born out of a genuine desire to cut all unnecessary expenses of the government, which would have required fixing internal, systemic challenges that are draining public coffers across the administrative spectrum. Today, public projects and initiatives are essentially money guzzlers\u2014thanks to corruption, mismanagement and lack of coordination. They exist to serve the interests of the politico-bureaucratic complex. Citizen welfare makes for good lip service only.\nThe situation in law enforcement, education, health, environmental and other sectors is no less dystopian. Many had hoped that the end of Covid-19 would usher in Vivid-22, but the pandemic has laid bare\u2014for all to see and panic while doing so\u2014how fundamentally flawed these sectors have been all along, nipping in the bud any lingering romanticism about the pre-Covid time. The pain and sufferings that are being caused on a daily basis are bound to disillusion anyone.\nI can rattle off a long list of problems dogging each public sector from newspaper reports alone. These will show how the lived experience of the majoirty hasn't reflected the rosy picture drawn of the country's development. It's getting increasingly harder to navigate the chaos, insanity and unending suffering on the streets and markets, in the employment and service sectors, in educational institutions, and in virtual space. The question is: How long will we have to bear with the encumbrances of development before we see a truly transformative future?\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is an assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "We're disturbed by the news of the deaths of 10 individuals, including a nine-year-old, in a road crash in Barishal's Ujirpur area early Sunday morning. Reportedly, the driver was dozing off and speeding before the bus crashed into a tree, almost splitting it into half. Despite requests from the passengers to drive slowly, the driver would not listen as he was allegedly an hour late as per his duty roster and tried to make up for lost time. There is no denying that the fault lies with his reckless driving, and he should be held accountable, but the driver was also a victim of the difficult circumstances that prevail in the transport sector. It is these systemic problems that are responsible for so many deaths on our roads.\nIt can be noted that those employed under the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) usually receive formal contracts, but the majority of bus drivers outside this group have to operate under uncertain working conditions. Many work to tight deadlines for long hours, and are paid meagre wages. Often, bus owners rent out their buses to the drivers. So, the more trips a driver is able to make, the higher the amount of money he can take home. Realistically, with such pressure or expectations at play, it is no wonder that they would drive so recklessly sometimes.\nThen, of course, there is the lack of accountability for transport owners and workers, coupled with the tendency to break the law at will or not enforce it as it should be, further endangering the passengers. The Road Transport Act-2018 is still a long way from being implemented or even finalised, as it went through frequent revisions to accommodate the demands of transport associations. Meanwhile, in April 2022 alone, around 543 people were killed and 612 others were injured in road crashes.\nWe're told that the families of those killed in the Ujirpur crash will receive a compensation of Tk 20,000 each, while a three-member investigation committee has been asked to hand in their report within seven working days. We hope all that is necessary will be done without any delay. We also hope the authorities will speed up the finalisation and implementation of the Road Transport Act-2018. Moreover, the importance of formalising employment of drivers with flexible work hours and decent wages in line with the labour law cannot be stressed enough. Doing this will help not only transport workers, but will improve the safety of ordinary passengers as well.\n",

        "full_article": "We lack words to describe the devilry that has been afoot in some private hospitals and clinics operating outside the law in Bangladesh. According to a report by this daily, the ongoing crackdown on unlicensed health facilities has brought out some disturbing truths about how these are run, with no regard for the sanctity of the profession and zero accountability. In one of them in Narayanganj, called Padma General Hospital, doctors, nurses and other staffers abandoned a mother and her just-born baby on the operating table after hearing that health officials were raiding unlicensed hospitals in the area. Three other mothers and their newborns were also left behind. All of the patients had undergone C-section surgeries.\nHow can a hospital endanger its patients like this? The illegality of its operation alone cannot explain this behaviour. There must be something deeply rotten in how our healthcare system has been built that makes the lives of patients secondary to self-serving interests. The DGHS drive\u2014which, as of May 29, reportedly closed over 880 unauthorised private hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres and blood banks across the country\u2014also brought out how these\u00a0establishments exploited lack of regulation and loopholes in the system. In one instance, a clinic even managed to secure contracts from two embassies to conduct medical assessments of people travelling to those countries. But its name was found neither in the list of licensed hospitals, nor in the list of those with pending applications for licences.\nThe issue of licensing for health facilities has frequently come up during the pandemic period. The DGHS itself courted controversies by allowing unlicensed facilities to run and even secure government contracts for Covid tests and treatment. The whimsical manner in which it adopted policies and conducted drives like the current one\u2014with barely any follow-up action to check resurgence of such facilities, or ensure their lawful operation\u2014makes any regulatory intervention untenable. It doesn't prevent corruption; if anything, it only temporarily suspends it. We've seen the futility of such efforts as even licenced hospitals felt emboldened to charge exorbitantly high fees from patients, and make them suffer even after that.\nThat said, we're glad that the authorities have finally conducted a largescale drive against unlicensed facilities. It will help them get a clearer picture of such operations, the exact number of which has long eluded us. But we urge the authorities to ensure proper follow-up actions, including by closing or revoking licences of any facilities or health practitioners found in breach of the law. Unregistered doctors too must be identified and punished. At the same time, registered hospitals and clinics should also be kept under observation so that they follow the standard operating procedures at all times.\n",
