While Mr. Scholz\u2019s visit was a scheduled engagement for the bi-annual Inter-Government Consultations, this was his third visit since 2023; Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited Germany in 2022. Thus, there were MoUs on innovation and technology, skilling and mobility, and green energy cooperation, as well as improving trade, pegged at $26 billion, with about $27 billion in German investments. The conversation over trade and investment intensified with both leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business, a first in India, amidst an attempt by German businesses to reduce their exposure in China. The two-day visit of Mr. S\u00e1nchez (officially called the President of the Government of Spain) shone a spotlight on unnoticed India-Spain bilateral ties. Trade is nearly $10 billion, and Spain is India\u2019s 16th largest investor. Despite its relatively lower stakes in India\u2019s economy, Spain is increasingly seen as a technology and engineering partner; one of the MoUs signed was for rail transport. The highlight of the visit was the inauguration of an Airbus-Tata private sector plant to assemble C-295 aircraft for the Indian Air Force. It did not go unnoticed that the visits were scheduled close to each other, even as Germany and Spain are competing for defence deals, indicating New Delhi\u2019s desire to diversify its options.The timing of the visits followed just after Mr. Modi\u2019s Russia visit for the BRICS summit, and his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which show how India continues to balance ties amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India expressed deep concerns over the loss of life in the Ukraine conflict and the need for lasting peace, in the joint statements with Germany and Spain. But the statements differed to a degree in the paragraphs on the West Asian crisis. The statement with Germany squarely condemned Hamas for its actions on October 7 last year, and called for the immediate release of Israeli hostages. The statement with Spain did not name Hamas, and emphasised the need to protect civilians and for all parties to comply with international law. Spain has taken a step away from other European countries by recognising Palestine and blocking all shipments of armaments including from India to Israel. It is important that India continues to engage with European countries individually, as well as with the European Union, especially with such evidence that even the closest partners have nuanced differences on geopolitical issues of the day.

        "full_article": "Policy decisions that are clairvoyant are most likely to serve well, and for long. A clairvoyance that comes from reading the signs today and now, can save lives, and make living better. Tamil Nadu\u2019s move to declare heat as a State-specific disaster, rendering people so affected eligible for assistance from the State, is unequivocally a beacon shining in a country where environmental degradation goes together with unplanned cities, poverty, and limited access to shelter and health care. The World Meteorological Organization declared that 2023 was the hottest year on record. A study on \u2018Deadly heat waves projected in the densely populated agricultural regions of South Asia\u2019 portends that the most intense hazard from extreme future heatwaves will be concentrated around the densely populated agricultural regions of the Ganges and Indus basins. It is critical that the human body remains at the optimal temperature of 37\u00b0 Celsius: living in temperatures that constantly and consistently exceed this limit can cause immeasurable stress and the breakdown of bodily functions, impact vital organs, and lead to death in vulnerable populations. Tamil Nadu\u2019s move is a laudable recognition of the inevitability of extreme weather events affecting people\u2019s health even as it prepares to address issues arising out of extreme heat events. The government order says many parts of Tamil Nadu have consistently recorded temperatures above 40\u00b0 C during the summer of 2024, acknowledging that heatwaves are emerging as a threat affecting the day-to-day life of the elderly, children, those with prior illnesses, co-morbidities and those who work in open environments. Tamil Nadu\u2019s vulnerability is exacerbated by its long coastline where humidity goes up during summer, giving rise to the peculiar wet-bulb temperature phenomenon. The World Economic Forum has warned that global warming is on track to reach a \u2018wet-bulb temperature\u2019 level of 35\u00b0 C, where humans can no longer regulate safe body temperature through sweating.While mechanisms must be alerted to mitigate the effects of global warming at the local, regional and national levels, it is also sagacious to prepare during the interim. The Tamil Nadu government\u2019s move to provide relief to the victims of heatwave under the State Disaster Response Fund will feature a comprehensive range of activities, including ex gratia payment to families of those who died of heat-related conditions; provision for medical care, and drinking water, including supply of ORS packets, and rescheduling working hours, will make the State and its most vulnerable at least prepared for the worst. Other States would do well to be inspired by this model.

        "full_article": "Israel\u2019s restrictions on UN assistance for Palestinians, who are in a desperate situation, are unconscionable\u00a0\nIn a huge blow to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, Israel this week passed legislation that effectively bans UNRWA \u2013 UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency \u2013 from operating in the Palestinian enclave and the West Bank. UNRWA is the chief aid agency for Palestinians, serving 2.5-3mn Palestinians in refugee camps spread across Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. But Israel says the agency has been infiltrated by members of Hamas and terrorist organisations. Investigations have failed to prove such allegations, though UNRWA did fire nine staff members.\u00a0\nWeaponising relief work | The development raises a fundamental issue about aid and helping people in distress. In most cases, aid agencies can only do their work with the support of governing administrations. In conflict zones that means granting aid workers immunity and facilitating their operations within active battlegrounds. But right from the beginning of Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza last year, aid workers have been caught in Israeli crosshairs. Recall the Israeli military attack on a convoy of World Central Kitchen that killed seven aid workers earlier this year. Similarly, more than 200 UNRWA staff have been killed in Israeli attacks since last year.\u00a0\nDangerous precedent | Israel\u2019s actions may now incentivise similar behaviour in other cases, jeopardising humanitarian work. In fact, in April, UN highlighted a shocking increase in denial of access to life-saving humanitarian aid for children in conflict zones worldwide. Besides Gaza, such intentional blocking of aid has also spiked in conflict-hit Myanmar and Sudan. Meanwhile, in Taliban\u2019s Afghanistan, the ban on women working for UN has similarly hampered aid work. This trend needs to be countered to save lives in the most desperate of places.\u00a0\nPreserve UN assistance | At the heart of the issue is the growing trend of viewing UN\u2019s work as partisan. But the erosion of UN\u2019s moral force jeopardises people\u2019s lives. Notwithstanding the political machinations at UNSC, UN\u2019s humanitarian work is desperately needed by the world. And where UN goes, other aid agencies follow. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative to strengthen UN\u2019s aid work and unequivocally censure those who impede this.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "La bella Italia\u2019s gelato scoops a victory over its Johnny-come-lately rival, ice cream\nRight now, it\u2019s snowing in Italy, as it always is. And the Italians love it, as do the many millions of visitors who throng to this land of sun and operatic song.\u00a0\nSnow in Italy comes in the form of a divine confection called gelato, which means frozen in Italian, and which is also called \u2018The snow of milk\u2019.\nUnlike normal snow, Italy\u2019s snow of milk descends not from the sky but emanates from shops called gelateria. But for all its earthly origins, Italians treat their milky snow with the devout reverence accorded to manna from heaven.\u00a0\nIsn\u2019t gelato just another common or garden ice cream? So what\u2019s the big deal?\u00a0\nGelato is related to ice cream. In much the same way as a Ferrari is related to a Ford. Like a Ferrari that zooms past the stodgy Ford, gelato is sleeker, slicker, and zippier than its commonplace counterpart, ice cream.\u00a0\nIce cream, as the name makes obvious, is cream based, while gelato is made largely with milk and has two-thirds less fat content, making it a healthier treat. Gelato is generally eggless, a bonus for vegetarians.\nThe making of gelato and ice cream also differs. Gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream which has a lot of air incorporated into it. Gelato, churned slower, takes in 15-20% less air, which gives it a smoother, silkier texture.\nFood historians claim that gelato, the forebear of ice cream, was created in its modern version, in the 16th century, supposedly by a Florentine, Bernardo Buontalenti, who was part of the court of Catherina dei Medici, later to become the Queen of France.\nFrom Florence, the gelato spread to the rest of Italy and Europe, its recipe passed down from generation to generation within a family. Gelato reached America in the late 18th century, and was turned into its New World, mass produced avatar of ice cream.\nBut for all its supermarket appeal, for sheer \u2018savour-faire\u2019 ice cream can\u2019t lick gelato, not in a month of sundaes.\n\n",

It\u2019s a jobs crisis\u00a0\nMind the numbers \u2013 288 contests, almost 8,000 candidates and 10,905 nominations. Job fair? Not unlike one, but ahead of Maharashtra\u2019s legislative elections, a measure of the chaos on ground. Maharashtra\u2019s six parties may as well have held primaries to decide their candidates. Smart intra-coalition contests to identify nominees may have also tackled the headache of \u2018rebel\u2019 candidates and the convolutions \u2013 or is it convulsions \u2013 that the two coalitions are facing, as in Mahim. In Mahim, BJP has said it\u2019ll back Raj Thackeray\u2019s son in his poll debut as an MNS nominee. The official Mahayuti nominee is a Sena veteran. Shinde Sena has argued that MNS isn\u2019t in Mahayuti, so if BJP backs MNS, many Shinde Sena electors will vote UBT Sena. The three-Sena prestige fight makes Mahim a knife-edge seat. Join the dots.\nBJP is likely seeing in seats like Mahim a counterbalance to Shinde Sena\u2019s growing heft. Contesting in the highest number of constituencies, 148, BJP\u2019s playing hardball with partners Ajit Pawar NCP (53 seats) and Shinde Sena (80). BJP state HQ is reportedly awash with Fadnavis-as-CM posters, feeding into the who\u2019ll-be-CM wars, a battle MVA has managed to place on the backburner for now. State BJP is understandably adamant it won\u2019t campaign for \u2018D-connect\u2019 Nawab Malik, Ajit Pawar NCP\u2019s nominee. Mahayuti already has a Shinde Sena candidate here, while the discredited Malik confidently claims he\u2019ll win. Malik being high profile, gets the attention, but the bigger point is, this isn\u2019t the only such seat.\nAs of now, MVA is hoping its LS win will help it bring rebels around, especially as it has wheeled out wily veterans to soothe ruffled neta feathers. MVA (Congress is contesting 103 seats, UBT 89 and Sharad Pawar 87) claims those disgruntled at not being nominated have \u201c90%\u201d come around. But in electoral campaigns, nothing\u2019s done \u2019n dusted till the last vote is in.\u00a0\nFor both MVA and Mahayuti, there are several constituencies \u2013 reportedly at least 40 Mahayuti ones \u2013 on which politicians have filed multiple nominations. If coalition doesn\u2019t agree, then as party nominee. If the party doesn\u2019t agree, then as Independent. As of now, till the nomination-withdrawals on Nov 4, fact is there\u2019s an average of 28 candidates on each seat. The assembly polls may end up being a classic case of players scoring big but the team losing the match. And the jobs crisis remains just so. \n\n",

        "full_article": "Ever since my student days in the late 60s and early 70s, and later throughout my 52 years in journalism, I have tried to analyse our development strategies and understand how our experts planned our future. It does not require too much thinking to realise that our two biggest assets are our people and rivers. I always wondered why our planners did not use them as the centrepiece of all their thinking and planning.\nIf we look at our map, it becomes obvious how widespread our river network is and how amazingly it reaches every nook and corner of the country. It is almost like the network of nerves through which oxygen-rich blood flows to every part of the body to keep us alive and healthy.\nJust imagine what we could have done with our rivers. Every part of Bangladesh could have had easy access in terms of transport of people, goods and services. Transportation could have been cheap, dependable and democratic as all strata of our population could access them. What's more, given the climate crisis, we could have made it an environment-friendly transport system. Rivers are our nature-gifted infrastructure of communication. Of course, we need roads, but building a communication network through rivers could have made a most attractive, productive and pro-poor alternative.\nInstead, what we have done with our rivers has been unthinking, destructive, and near suicidal. We never adequately valued them, nor did we develop any comprehensive plan that would integrate them with our overall development strategy. We never even performed the most rudimentary functions to maintain them. We never dredged them adequately. So, over the years, silt and sediments accumulated and raised our riverbeds and clogged the water flow. In addition, we built dams, culverts, sluice gates and elevated roads without adequate planning to maintain the water flow, and on occasions diverting them in ways that harmed our rivers.\nThen we poured poison into them. All city sewers went into them. But what was disastrous was the dumping of poisonous industrial waste into the rivers. Just imagine: millions of tonnes of poison-laden waste were released into our beautiful, life-giving, food-supplying rivers ceaselessly for years. To put it bluntly, we killed our rivers.\nThe number of rivers in Bangladesh was originally estimated to be around 1,200. Later, the figure was revised to about 700, and now the official estimate is 405. The National River Conservation Commission, however, says the number is 907. The ones that are still around, in spite of our neglect, are so polluted that, in some, even bacteria cannot survive. We have made our process of industrialisation fundamentally anti-nature. This cannot be sustained. We are jeopardising our own future.\nOur other story of neglect is of our people. Our biggest asset\u2014our human resource, especially the youth. We all know that we are among the most densely populated countries in the world. We could have also become a highly productive country if we had educated this population, trained them with appropriate skills, and equipped them with the right technological tools. Instead, we played with the future of our youth.\nFrom the moment in human history when humans became surplus producers, we started accumulating wealth. As we became divided into nations and formed our own separate countries, the wealth of each country depended on how productive its citizens were. With the Industrial Revolution, productivity reached new levels and technologically advanced countries became rich. All these lessons are right in front of us.\nInstead of educating our people for the 21st century, we left them unskilled, so they remained unprepared to navigate the world of artificial intelligence, and were forced to opt for the lower-level unskilled jobs when seeking employment abroad. How could we not have spent more on education and healthcare, and equip our people with greater skills and entrepreneurship to bring home the unimaginable opportunities that the modern world has to offer? How could we have missed the point that the present is a world of ideas? Yes, infrastructure is needed, but creativity is needed much more. How could we have not seen that some of the world's biggest conglomerates are mere products of ideas\u2014Google, Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, Microsoft, etc? Even Apple, which builds some of the most amazing phones, is driven by ideas.\nI have often wondered about what we have done, in the 53 years of our independent existence, in the field of education. We have had several education commissions since 1971. What were their outcomes? The Qudrat-i-Khuda Education Commission, established in 1972, aimed to establish a new education system to meet the needs of the new nation moving away from its colonial past as well as the Pakistani version of it. There was no shortage of education commissions: Mofizuddin Ahmed Commission in 1987; Shamsul Huque Commission in 1997; National Education Policy Formulation Committee in 2000; and Kabir Chowdhury Commission in 2009.\nExcept for the first, no other education commission acquired the needed prestige and clout to have any impact. Some significant political changes occurred which had their own impact on the commissions' findings and their subsequent implementation.\nLike everything else in Bangladesh, education is a highly politicised affair. Each regime has tried to impose its own political philosophies and views on the students through control and change in school curricula. As the Awami League was the longest-serving party in government, it did the maximum damage. One of the political aims of the AL regime was to show that during its tenure, students were better educated than before. Hence, emphasis came on the quantity rather than quality, with larger and larger numbers of students being shown as passed in public examinations. Quality and learning discipline were largely abandoned.\nLater, when it became evident that passing an exam was losing all meaning and that students at the college and university levels couldn't take the burden of higher learning, quality began to receive increased attention. By then, much ground was lost.\nComing back to our planning for the future, we urge the present leadership to finally put emphasis on the two assets\u2014rivers and people\u2014that can be our passport for a sustainable and prosperous future. Given all the uncertainties that the world now faces, having well-educated, appropriately skilled and sufficiently trained human resources will be the most appropriate development policy to follow.\nSo here we are, facing an ever-changing world, technological innovation of unimaginable potential, social transformation of unpredictable consequences, and a future of unknown\u2014and in many ways unknowable\u2014realities with a population totally unprepared to deal with the impact.\nAs we celebrate the new opportunities opened up by the recent student-led people's uprising, we must, with utmost urgency, start focusing on the future. The two assets referred to above are our best options.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We heartily congratulate the Bangladesh women's football team on successfully defending their South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Women's Championship title with a thrilling victory in the final match against the host country, Nepal. Their remarkable achievement not only makes the nation proud but also underscores the impressive growth of women's sports in Bangladesh. By winning back-to-back SAFF titles, the team is establishing itself as a formidable force in South Asian women's football.\nWhat is especially impressive is that, prior to the tournament, the women's national team had to overcome significant challenges due to the difficulty of arranging preparatory matches. According to the general secretary of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF), the federation struggled to secure adequate match practice due to funding shortages. Despite these hurdles\u2014which can greatly impact both the physical conditioning and mental preparedness of athletes\u2014our women footballers continued to improve once the tournament began, going from strength to strength and ultimately retaining their title.\nBangladesh began the tournament with a frustrating 1-1 draw against Pakistan, but improved with each match afterwards. Compared to the 2022 final, this year's final was far more competitive. In the end, the team's talent and determination carried them to a well-deserved 2-1 victory over Nepal.\nThis win represents far more than just a trophy; it symbolises the rising potential of women in sports and serves as an inspiration to the next generation of athletes in Bangladesh. In recent years, the BFF has taken some commendable steps to support women's football, with initiatives taken to improve facilities, coaching, and competitive opportunities for young players. However, despite this progress, women's sports in general still have to contend with limited resources, inadequate exposure, and societal barriers. The triumph of the national team against such odds speaks volumes about their resilience and dedication.\nThis victory should be a call to action for both the government and the private sector to strengthen their support for women's sports. Enhanced investment in training facilities, sponsorships, and development programmes can further empower our athletes and help translate Bangladesh's regional successes into broader international achievements. What is noteworthy about the current crop of footballers is that nine players from this year's starting eleven also played in the momentous 2022 SAFF final. This not only highlights the talent within this group but also serves as a reminder of the importance of investing in young players to ensure the sustained success\u2014and perhaps even dominance\u2014of our women's team in the future.\n",

        "full_article": "The polling numbers for the US Presidential election show a horse race. The early voting does not yet indicate any specific trend. Either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris can win. On November 5, election day, the Democrats could lose the Senate Majority, and the predictive models show a 50 \u2013 50 split. On the contrary, the House of Representatives could flip from Republican to Democrat. A razor-thin majority is expected in both legislative bodies.\u00a0\u00a0No one knows what is coming. However, in this scenario or its comparable approximation, it would not be easy to implement policies for either of the two who win the presidency. It is highly possible that at the end of the day, the US may end with an executive branch and a legislative branch squabbling in a gridlock on many policy issues. The governing procedure in the Senate could be changed to avoid an impasse by reforming the use of filibusters that hinder a vote on a bill.\nThis is a unique parliamentary procedure. The Senate tradition of unlimited debate has allowed for the use of the filibuster, a loosely defined term for action designed to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote on a bill, resolution, amendment, or other debatable question. Cloture is a process that prevents filibusters. Currently, cloture requires 60 votes out of 100. This number has changed as time passes, but the procedure is complicated. However, a few types of legislation, such as budget reconciliation and Senate confirmation of Supreme Court judge appointment, are done now on a simple majority. Based on the polling forecast about Senate elections, I anticipate that the cloture number will stay at 60.\u00a0\nLet us examine those policy differences, which include abortion, foreign affairs\u2014especially for the Middle East, NATO, and Ukraine, energy production, environmental regulation, health care, immigration, taxation, and international trade and tariffs. This is one of the most recent election cycles in US history in which the policy differences between the two presidential candidates are significantly different.\nDonald Trump plans to expand his tax cut of 2017, increase tariffs, eliminate environment-friendly regulations, restrict immigration, support state laws against abortion, increase hydrocarbon production, and end the war in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nBy contrast, Kamala Harris plans to increase rich-class tax, restore Roe v Wade to assure abortion as a women's right, assist housing ownership for the underprivileged, impose strict regulations for environmental causes, invest in renewable energy, and expand government-provided healthcare.\nLet us compare the costs associated with Trump's policies to Harris. Currently, the national debt held by the USA is $28.2 trillion against its GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, of $28.269 trillion. According to Richard Rubin's report in The Wall Street Journal, Trump's plan will boost the budget by $7.5 trillion over the next decade, double that of Harris's plan. The budget deficit for the financial year 2024 stands at $1.9 trillion. One can imagine the negative impact on future generations regarding budget deficits and national debt.\u00a0\nThe question is how the fiscal conservatives of the Republican Party in the Senate, who advocate lower budget deficits and national debt, would react to Trump's plan if he is elected President. Additionally, the traditional conservatives, the \"Reaganites,\" do not support excessive tariffs. Despite all these issues, most voters consistently grade Trump higher than Harris for the economy.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, if Harris wins, what would her foreign policy be for the Middle East? Will it be the recycled version of Biden? Will she be able to hold the motley coalition of progressives, especially Bernie Sanders's followers, Gen Z, and the moderate democrats?\nNovember 5 will tell us if Americans will have to endure a period of challenging governance unlike any we have seen before.\u00a0\nDr Mostofa Sarwar\u00a0is professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, former visiting professor and adjunct faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, and former dean and former vice-chancellor of Delgado Community College.
