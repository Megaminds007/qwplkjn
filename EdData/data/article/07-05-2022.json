Apart from tribal people, Muslims and Dalits in particular have borne the brunt of these senseless acts of mob violence and murders. Reminiscent of the murder of a dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, after he and his sons were attacked by self-described \u201ccow vigilantes\u201d in April 2017 in Rajasthan, the two men, Sampatlal Vatti and Dhansai Invati, were attacked by nearly 20 men; both died of injuries. The police have arrested 13 people for their alleged involvement; at least six of them were members of the Bajrang Dal, according to the family members. An insinuation by the police that one of the dead men was involved in a \u201ccow slaughter\u201d case has shown yet again where the priorities of law enforcement lie in such cases. In another pattern, there has been a certain acuity in the implementation of cattle slaughter laws which is missing in trying and bringing those involved in lynch mobs to justice. Stricter cattle slaughter laws have been implemented with a fervour that has less to do with animal preservation and more to do with appeasement of majoritarian impulses to garner political support.In 2005, the Supreme Court had justified the total ban on cattle slaughter by an expansive interpretation of the directive principles of state policy, and relying on Articles 48, 48A, and 51(A) of the Constitution, that seeks to preserve breeds used in agriculture and animal husbandry, explicitly prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle, besides promoting compassion to animals. The judgment had overturned an earlier ruling in 1958 which had limited the ban only to \u201cuseful\u201d cattle which are still engaged in agriculture and husbandry. This interpretation only laid the grounds for State governments \u2014 especially those led by the BJP and its alliance partners \u2014 to come up with stringent laws on cow slaughter, and in the public sphere, a stigmatisation of communities such as Dalits, Muslims and tribals for their dietary habits and their dependence on cattle products for a livelihood. Four States (Rajasthan, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Manipur) had passed laws against lynching after many such incidents but they were under various stages of implementation with the Union government taking the view that lynching is not a crime under the Indian Penal Code. While civil society in Madhya Pradesh must demand justice for the injured and dead tribal men and a return to the rule of law in which such murderous acts do not go unpunished, it is time for a judicial rethink on legislation around cattle slaughter.",

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended his tour to Europe this week by dropping in on French President Emmanuel Macron, who was re-elected recently. What was billed a simple \u201ctete-a tete\u201d during a \u201cworking visit\u201d turned out to be a comprehensive discussion on bilateral, regional and international issues, with a 30 paragraph-long joint statement. As with his other stops in Germany and Denmark for the Nordic Summit, as well as the visit to India by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen the week before, the Ukraine war remained at the top of the agenda. The joint statement records their differences on the issue. However, they also discussed mitigating the war\u2019s \u201cknock-on\u201d effects, and Mr. Macron invited India to cooperate with the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) initiative for food security in the most vulnerable countries, particularly in terms of wheat exports. However, as the severe heatwave has damaged India\u2019s crops, the Government will have to do some hard thinking on its promises of wheat supply to the rest of the world at a time when fears of shortages are sending wheat prices soaring. Climate change was another key issue during the stopovers in Berlin and Copenhagen. France and India, that worked closely for the success of the Paris climate accord, and co-founded the International Solar Alliance in 2015, are ready to take it to the next level \u2014 setting up industrial partnerships to build integrated supply chains in solar energy production for markets in Europe and Asia. There was also a bilateral strategic dialogue on space issues, which will build on their six-decade-long partnership in the field of space \u2014 a contested area now with China, Russia and the U.S. stepping up hostilities in this frontier.India and France have decades of an unusually productive partnership given that neither has allowed other relationships to play a role in the bilateral. This has been the basis of their strong defence partnership. In 1998, France stood out as a western country that did not judge or impose sanctions on India for its nuclear tests; in 2008, it was the first country to conclude a civil nuclear deal with India after the NSG passed a waiver allowing India to access nuclear fuel and technology. It would be a fitting tribute to the consistency of the relationship if the French bid for six nuclear power plants in Maharashtra\u2019s Jaitapur makes some headway now, more than 12 years after the original MoU was signed and a year after the French company, EDF, last year submitted an offer to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. It is however disappointing that Mr. Modi\u2019s visit did not give as much fillip to talks on the India-EU FTA (suspended since 2013) as seen in India\u2019s other FTA talks. This was the second such tour where Mr. Modi travelled to Germany and France on the same visit \u2014 a significant gesture that he recognises the importance of both in India\u2019s new push for stronger ties with Europe.",

        "full_article": "The national budget for the next fiscal year will be the third since the start of the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020. Can we expect it to address the current realities, contexts and challenges of Bangladesh?\nThe economy is on the path to recovery from the unprecedented economic and social crises induced by Covid-19. Several international and domestic factors, however, constrain the recovery process. People's livelihoods were severely affected during Covid, and are yet to get back on track. Also, rising inflationary pressure in recent months is adding to people's woes.\nTo help marginalised people, the government should prioritise economic recovery, job creation and inflation control in the next fiscal year's budget. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the persistent economic stress of Covid have disrupted global supply chains and driven up commodity prices.\nThe pressure of the current price hike is beyond the endurance level of the low-income people. Some are even curtailing their necessities, especially food. Though, as per government estimation, the food inflation rate is around six percent, according to recent estimates by SANEM, marginalised people have been facing double this rate while buying foodstuff. The official estimates of the food inflation rate depend on the food basket specified in the 2005 survey, but the food habits of people both in cities and villages have changed a lot in the last 17 years. These changes in food habits and poor people's typical consumption baskets are not considered in the official estimates. This suggests that the actual situation is worse than what is officially stated.\nIn recent times, the prices of products in the international market have increased; so have shipping fares. However, the question is whether prices are rising at a higher rate in Bangladesh than in the international market. There is a lack of surveillance in this regard. Reliable data on the local production and the amount of import necessary is vital for maintaining the balance between supply and demand. Lack of information and supply-demand mismatch push up prices of goods. Some traders also take advantage of asymmetric information to bid for higher prices. Regular market supervision is needed to avoid such a situation.\nThe unpredictability of the geopolitical environment does not help the country's recovery process, either. In such a situation, we must keep a year-round eye on the international market. To monitor the international market, a permanent system must be established. This would aid in the formulation of better and more effective policies.\nDuring the pandemic, severe flaws in social safety net programmes surfaced. There are concerns that an important portion of the support allocated to the SSN does not reach the poor due to identification problems. As a result, targeted groups continue to suffer. While local government authorities and officials compile beneficiary lists, there is no system in place to ensure accountability and transparency throughout the process. Therefore, substantial coordination between ministries is required. In addition, all safety net programmes must be consolidated onto a single platform. While the allocation for SSN programmes should be raised substantially, there is also a need to ensure coordination, accountability, and transparency in the overall process of allocation, distribution, and management of the programmes.\nThe government's initiative to sell products at a lower cost by providing TCB \"family cards\" to 10 million families is commendable. However, the coverage must be expanded, as many low- and middle-income families, in addition to poorer families, are still unable to take advantage of this benefit. Along with TCB trucks, sales centres for beneficiaries could be set up across the country.\nMost micro and small firms, which play an important part in the economy's supply chain, are still struggling. The resulting supply chain disruption will continue to obstruct economic recovery at the intended pace. As the informal sector employs more than 85 percent of the workforce, a substantial portion of which is made up of micro and small companies, if these businesses fail to recover, the overall economy will not revive, leaving many people to keep struggling in the labour market. Micro and small enterprises have benefited the least from the government's stimulus packages.\nBecause the private sector accounts for over 80 percent of total investment in the country, boosting private sector investment is crucial for economic recovery. The indicators for private sector investment are still not encouraging. One of the main goals of the budget for 2022-23 should be to illustrate how to break the cycle of stagnant private sector investment, which has persisted over the past decade.\nBangladesh's tax effort also continues to fall short of its potential. The tax-GDP ratio is less than nine percent and is one of the lowest in the world. The necessity for a prudent fiscal framework has become much more obvious than in the past. There are also expectations that the government will demonstrate some strong political will in implementing long-awaited vital reforms in the financial sector, the business environment, and in social sectors like health and education.\nSri Lanka's situation also highlights the necessity of learning lessons on managing foreign debt and implementing development projects. Surely, there is the necessity for infrastructural development and mega projects. But considering their economic viability is extremely crucial. Avoiding unnecessary large-scale projects and conducting\u00a0 proper feasibility studies for development projects are extremely important. The projects which are already undertaken could become burdensome if the expenses eventually become exorbitantly high and it takes more time to implement them. We expect to see reflections of some strong directives in this regard in the upcoming budget.\n\u00a0\nDr Selim Raihan\u00a0is a professor of the Department of Economics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and is executive director at the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM).

For those of us who used our devices to get our share of the happy hormone as a temporary relief from our daily stress, the apparent lack of human touch during a highly social festive event indicates asocial behaviour, if not screen addiction. Some of us even committed the cardinal sin of binge-watching. As for me, I followed the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard court details, supplemented by a season of \"Inventing Anna\" on Netflix.\nYou must be chuckling by now thinking this op-ed is literally blowing in the wind. Well, by design, it is. When I started writing this weekly column almost three years back, I was inspired by the Nobel laureate Bob Dylan's song in which the lyricist answers a series of hypothetical questions through hints reminding the audience that the answers were right before them. You do not necessarily need to say it aloud as long as you can internalise the riddles that surround you. I reserve my Friday morning to unwind thoughts that have been troubling me, to share them with the reader every Saturday. Writing for me is a journey in which the reader is a fellow passenger, and I can point out to them: Did you see that?\nI started my career as a cub reporter with this paper during its inception in the early 1990s. I have drifted away to a relatively freer profession, but not without its share of fair criticism and odd controversies. I no longer have the nose of sniffing or the ways of telling facts like that of a journalist. I do not know how my journalist friends even pursue such a risky career in a country that ranks the lowest among South Asian countries in terms of press freedom. According to the World Press Freedom Index 2022, Bangladesh now holds the 162nd slot, slipping 10 notches from its previous ranking.\nI envy social scientists and data curators who can engage with realities with a dash of factual details, and shield them with facts and figures. As someone who teaches poetry, I deal with reality in its arcane form. I try to make the unfamiliar familiar, and vice versa. I teach my students to be critical thinkers with creative solutions to connect different discursive dots. My binge-watching sessions over the Eid break offered a rude awakening. Freedom of expression is a far cry even in countries ranked above ours.\nHollywood actress Amber Heard is being sued for defamation by her former husband, based on an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post. The headline on the online version reads, \"I spoke up against sexual violence\u2014and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\" The onus is on her to prove that she was a victim of domestic violence.\nDepp, who previously lost a libel case against the UK-based The Sun for labelling the actor as a 'wife-beater,\" is having a second go at his ex-wife for the damage that has been done to his career. The 58-year-old actor, famous for impersonating Jack Sparrow in the Disney production of the fantasy series Pirates of the Caribbean, has already been dropped off the project. Even though Heard's article does not specify Depp as an abuser, the court heard how that article caused damage of over USD 40 million for the actor struggling with substance abuse and emotional instability.\nIn the courtroom, Heard and her team of lawyers were outperformed in every sense of the term. The media trial is already demanding that Depp be restored to his iconic Pirates role, and Amber be dethroned from her role in the sequel of the critically-acclaimed sci-fi fantasy, Aquaman. The court washed the dirty laundry of the couple in a public courthouse in what has become a visual phenomenon. Heard is presented as a bipolar personality who is the \"real\" abuser in this toxic relationship. The media construct made the Heard team request a dismissal. They were not ready for the number of digital footprints that depicted the actress in a negative light.\nHow is this related to the true-crime drama in which a compulsive liar pretended to be a European heiress to con the upper echelon of New York? A young woman of Russian origin, raised in Germany, Anna Delvey suppressed her peasant surname of Sorokin and fashioned her life after glitzy magazines to pose as a socialite. She duped banks, hotels, and contacts by pretending to be a trust-fund heiress. Her success shows everything that is wrong with our society wrapped in ego bubbles. The promise of a pending fund made her pursue a dream of building a cultural hub in New York. She was convicted on multiple counts of grand larceny, indicted in 2017, and incarcerated from 2019 to 2021. The story was doggedly pursued by a journalist who later felt responsible for catapulting Anna to fame. Anna was very much a creation of the media. In the Netflix version, Vivian Kent of Manhattan Magazine is a hardcore investigative journalist who starts connecting the dots of Anna's life. Then there is the other group of parasitic journalists who feed on the elites. When Anna traps her journalist \"friend\" from a fashion magazine into paying for a luxury trip to Morocco, Rachel Williams of Vanity Fair cooperates with the police to rat her out. The series thus pits one group of media people against the other. Vivian is trying to climb out of the \"scribe-ria\" of has-been journalists to reclaim her position through \"inventing\" Anna. Rachel is there to seduce Anna for her own benefit. In a Trump era, Anna was the ultimate \"fake it till you make it\" who took the media for a ride. And the relationship was mutual.\nCan Media A be free unless it frees itself from Media B? The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "The war in Ukraine has spawned a mindless Russophobic war hysteria in the West that is appalling. It reminds me of my days in the US during the Iraq war. As Yogi Berra said, \"It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\"\nThe fierce moral posturing. The uncompromising Manichean worldview where the West is the knight in shining armour, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is evil incarnate. Just like Iraq's Saddam Hussain, Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic or Syria's Bashar al-Assad, or whoever America's bogeyman du jour is.\nThis is a battle for a rules-based world order, we are told by the US and its supine western European allies, and if you're not with us, you're against us.\nThe bit about rules-based order will surely be news for the Palestinians, who are still waiting for their state for over half a century as Israel's continuous illegal land grabbing includes most recently the annexation of East Jerusalem. We barely heard a peep when Israeli armed thugs attacked worshippers in Al-Aqsa mosque during Ramadan.\nThe US media is going to town with the fact that an overwhelming majority of the UN general assembly has condemned the Russian attack. The entire world is against Russia, and Putin is now an international pariah, we are told.\nNot so fast.\nIndeed, the vote overwhelmingly was in support for the West, but you can dissemble with numbers. While numerically impressive, it's a hollow claim.\nIndia and China refused to play ball. Even the usual US chums, like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have baulked.\nExcept for a handful of US allies, it is remarkable how pretty much most of Asia, Africa and Latin America don't buy the West's fevered moral crusade against Russia.\nNow let me be clear. Russia's attack on Ukraine was grievously wrong\u2014just as the US attack on Iraq was. That is why few countries have actually backed Russia's attack.\nMost of the world outside the US and its Western allies, however, abstained because they reject the moral posturing of the West.\nThe US would do well to get off its moral high horse and try to recognise why.\nIt must realise that its efforts to paint Russia as the biggest evil this side of hell does not cut much ice. No matter how many times the likes of EU president Ursula von der Leen, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and top US officials make a beeline to New Delhi, for instance, India is not going to jeopardise its deep strategic and economic ties with Russia.\nThese bilateral ties have a long history that transcends ideology. The Soviet Union stood by India in 1971 when Pakistan refused to hand power to the democratically elected Awami League and the Pakistan army unleashed a genocide, while Richard Nixon's US administration backed Pakistan. So much for the US being champions of democracy.\nYou'll have a hard time telling South Africa how bad Russia is. Veteran leaders of the ruling African National Congress have fond memories of the vital support from the Soviet Union in their battle against apartheid. Meanwhile, the West dragged its feet to impose sanctions and US intelligence was in cahoots with the apartheid government, backing leaders like Jonas Savimbi and Renamo guerrillas to thwart anti-colonial battles in Angola and Mozambique.\nThere is much talk about Russia's war being a threat to a rules-based order. The US has waged war in Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan\u2014all without UN sanction. The West is making furious demands to punish Russia for alleged war crimes at the International Criminal Court, but it is led by the US, which does not recognise its jurisdiction. In fact, the US revoked ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's visa, widely thought to have been in response to her request to investigate possible crimes committed by US forces in Afghanistan.\nThe US demands that the entire world accept punitive sanctions against Russia. Yet these are not UN sanctions\u2014the West just declared punitive sanctions by fiat without consulting the rest of the world and expects everybody else to fall in line. As Indian External Affairs Minister Jayashankar Subramanyam curtly noted when asked about cutting fuel imports, \"How is it that west European countries get a free pass?\"\nAll of this, I am afraid, reeks of a bygone imperial colonial mindset. Isn't it remarkable how you can almost tell who backs the US-led crusade against Russia by skin colour? Most white folks are gung-ho on Ukraine. Nations with people of colour? Not so much.\nThe US and its European allies are also making ominous noises about China. But if the Ukraine invasion is any guide, the West has its work cut out if it wants to get the rest of the world to agree.\nWhen asked about whether China was a threat, Malaysian statesman Mahathir Mohamed said in 2018, \"We have traded with China for nearly two thousand years\u2026But China never conquered us. We have relations with Europe. The Portuguese came to Malaysia in 1509. Two years later, they came and conquered us. So I always feel that I'm safer with China than with Europe.\"\nThe West is haranguing us. Better get on the bandwagon, this is about protecting the Western civilisation\u2014the civilisation which gave us two world wars, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and decades-long mass slaughtering in Vietnam, Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib? Mahatma Gandhi's pithy retort, when asked about what he thought about the Western civilisation, is still as valid today as it was over half a century ago: \"It would be a great idea.\"\n\u00a0\nAshfaque Swapan\u00a0is a writer and editor based in Atlanta, US.\n",

        "full_article": "After the 2008 global financial crisis, the world seemed ready to undertake meaningful reform of the international monetary system. But the promised structural changes never happened. And the recent spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank indicated that the current bout of global economic upheaval will similarly fail to spur transformation.\nWhen the 2008 crisis rocked the global financial system, policymakers took radical action to stabilise it. Beyond government bailouts of distressed banks in the United States, the epicentre of the crisis, liquidity was expanded substantially through large-scale quantitative easing and foreign-currency swaps by central banks.\nThe obvious next step was regulatory reform, aimed at preventing future crises. To this end, more power was delegated to the Financial Stability Board, an international body focused on identifying and promoting strong regulatory, supervisory, and other financial-sector policies.\nBut critical reforms were thwarted by pushback from the financial community. Similarly, in the US, the tougher regulatory regime put in place after the crisis was subsequently weakened.\nMeanwhile, the massive monetary expansion that had propped up the global economy generated new risks, with prolonged ultra-low interest rates encouraging short-term speculation and fueling asset bubbles, without increasing long-term productivity. At the same time, the financial sector and ownership of wealth became far more concentrated.\nNow, a new set of shocks are threatening to generate further upheaval. According to the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development, the most pressing challenges include debt distress among emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), vaccine equity, the surge in inflation, and growing risks to financial stability.\nEfforts to address such urgent challenges are largely piecemeal. For example, last August, the IMF approved a general allocation of special drawing rights equivalent to USD 650 billion. This expanded the IMF's resources substantially, but the demands for funding have increased exponentially.\nWith the war in Ukraine generating severe increases in energy and food prices, which are hitting EMDEs particularly hard, the situation is set to deteriorate further.\nMore fundamentally, \"urgent\" and \"important\" are not the same thing. And there are some crucial structural-reform questions that the IMF and its most powerful stakeholders have not even begun to answer. Perhaps the most fundamental is whether the current US dollar-based system designed at the end of World War II can continue to provide global public goods.\nThat system has certainly worked well to foster globalisation, trade, financialisation, and overall growth during the largely peaceful post-WWII period, including the tense Cold War era. But it was not designed to deal with the complex challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, rapid technological innovation, rising inequality, long-term demographic change, and escalating geopolitical conflict. It certainly was not intended to operate within a multipolar world order.\nWith the US dollar being weaponised through sanctions, it has become all too clear that the current system is far from neutral.\nMoreover, the US is no longer the global hegemon. The world order now seems destined to split into two blocs, each with their own security structures, supply chains, technologies, and financial systems. As Bernard Snoy et d'Oppuers points out in a forthcoming book, when any national currency functions as a global currency, at least six types of instability ensue: environmental, economic, social, financial, political, and ideological.\nBuilding a more stable international monetary system demands a shift to a truly global currency. The SDR is the most obvious candidate, backed by the Palais-Royal Initiative in 2011. But the US, which holds the most sway at the IMF, would not agree to turn the Fund into a quasi-central bank with the power to issue a supernational currency that would erode America's \"exorbitant privilege.\"\nEven if no national currency is likely to replace the dollar any time soon, there are two other avenues for reducing the dollar's dominance as a means of payment and store of value: digital currencies and the creation and expansion of non-dollar-based payment systems.\nThe international monetary system is unsustainable. We can either reform it now or wait for a catastrophic crisis\u2014an EMDE debt crisis on the scale of the Latin American and Asian financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s, a global bout of depression like that seen in the 1930s, or war among major powers\u2014to force our hand.\n\u00a0\nAndrew Sheng is a distinguished fellow of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.\u00a0Xiao Geng is chairman of the Hong Kong Institution for International Finance.\n",

        "full_article": "It's a distressing reality that the country's farmers are faced with an ever-spiraling problem of losing their lands and crops to the burgeoning brickfields, such as in Dinajpur's Biral upazila. We are worried to learn that over a hundred acres of agricultural land are being devoured by brickfield owners, and that black fumes from the kiln are scorching the semi-ripe crops in the farmlands near them. Reportedly, this damage to farmers is being done for many seasons, but no permanent actions have been taken by the administration to drive off unscrupulous brickfield owners.\nBesides destroying crops with their noxious fumes, brick kilns and brickfields also destroy the physical structure and fertility of the lands on which these are built. Not to mention the adverse effects they have on the health of the nearby population. Even if the brick kilns in farming areas are removed now, it will be many years before they regain their past fertility. A look around the outskirts of the cities and towns reveals that brickfield owners are unstoppable in expanding their reach, usually by greasing the palms of corrupt officials, who help them carry on with their business. It is indeed surprising that thousands of brickfields are operating throughout the country either with no permission from the Department of Environment (DoE) or with permission that expired long ago. Except for some occasional raids and closure of one or two brickfields, we do not hear of any sustained campaigns by the relevant ministries against these polluters. It is understandable that, with rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, demand for the traditionally built bricks is rising every year but it does not give the owners the right to operate without following government instructions. The laws of the land must be enforced to stop illegal brickfield owners from subjecting our already vulnerable environment to long-lasting damage.\nAccording to the Food Planning and Monitoring Unit (FPMU) under the Ministry of Food, land used for agriculture declined at 0.26 per cent annually between 1976 and 2010\u2014and faster after 2000 at 0.45 per cent. Other sources report that croplands have declined by one million hectares since 1976.\u00a0 Brickfields are one reason for such loss of agricultural land.\nWe urge the government to take necessary steps to reverse the situation. Experts mention cement blocks as the possible alternative to clay-made bricks, as used in many other countries. In addition, relevant authorities must ensure that brickfields are being operated legally and using the most environmentally-friendly methods possible. Farmers have enough to deal with in terms of unexpected financial hardship (such as the pandemic) and sudden weather disasters (flash floods and droughts). They cannot also be repressed by the misdoings of brickfield owners.\n",

The government has fixed the price of a litre of bottled soybean oil by 23.65 percent\u2014the biggest such increase in Bangladesh's history\u2014reportedly to address an unprecedented crunch of the essential cooking item. Prior to Eid, when demand for it was at its peak, cooking oil all but disappeared from the market, following a ban by Indonesia on palm oil exports. It was the nail in the coffin of an already unstable market, which has had to confront rising production costs amid higher raw material prices in the international markets and rising shipping costs, supply disruptions and pent-up demand.\nIn addition to the external shocks, we have observed\u2014with increasing alarm\u2014how unscrupulous businessmen have created artificial crises in the domestic market in an effort to drive up prices over multiple occasions in the past year. In fact, we have penned many editorials urging authorities to take steps to reign in the price manipulations at each of the four stages of the value chain within the country, involving refiners, dealers or supply order traders, wholesale traders and retailers. Unfortunately, we are yet to see decisive action by the government against these actors despite detailed reports of such manipulations.\nOver the past year, the price of edible oil has gone up eight times. While we have little control over the external shocks, the government can and must do more to ensure that it\u2014and not the unscrupulous traders\u2014is calling the shots in the domestic market and that it is representing the best interests of the consumers, not that of the traders. Meanwhile, given that the supply crunch in the international market will not ease anytime soon, the government must urgently find alternative sourcing destinations, alternative edible oils and take trade-related measures to maintain a smooth supply of edible oil in the local markets at affordable prices.\nThe commerce ministry is reportedly going to recommend that the National Board of Revenue (NBR) reduce the import duty on canola, sunflower and olive oil to 10 percent from the existing 32 percent. Given the current constraints, this would no doubt be a welcome move, but we can't help but wonder if the benefits would actually trickle down to the consumers. We have observed how the government waiver of 15 percent value-added tax at the production stage and 5 percent at the retail level, and another 10 percent VAT cut at the import stage, had little effect in stabilising prices of edible oil. Will the government ensure that history doesn't repeat itself? We urge them to open their eyes to the unending sufferings of the middle and working classes as they formulate policies to tackle the crisis.\n",
