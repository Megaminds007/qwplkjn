The State government has issued a notification to extend the law\u2019s imposition to the whole State, barring the areas falling under 19 police stations in the Imphal valley. The notification maintains the status quo on the applicability of the potent law that grants extensive powers to the armed forces in notified \u2018disturbed areas\u2019 in the use of force. In normal circumstances, the only question that may have arisen is whether AFSPA is needed any longer. However, given the violent ethnic conflict since this May between the Meitei and the Kuki communities, the exclusion of the Imphal Valley from its purview even while extending it elsewhere comes across as quite ironical. The Army had sought its re-imposition in the Valley districts, as it felt that the absence of the law is hampering its operations against insurgent groups, which may be using the unrest to gain a foothold in the State. It can be nobody\u2019s case that AFSPA should remain or its ambit increased; but it is difficult to avoid the question whether, if at all AFSPA is needed for some more time, areas that have witnessed considerable violence in recent months should remain excluded.Perhaps, the government\u2019s logic is that AFSPA is meant only to provide legal protection to forces engaged in counter-insurgency operations and not those engaged in law and order duty amidst internal conflict. However, the exclusion of the valley districts from AFSPA at this stage is liable to be interpreted as yet another instance of the government\u2019s partisan conduct. One of the reasons for the government maintaining the status quo on the extent of the \u2018disturbed areas\u2019 is that a detailed assessment of the ground situation is not possible at the moment when the security agencies are engaged in maintaining law and order. Further, the notification says the issue of declaring an area as \u2018disturbed\u2019 is quite sensitive and it may lead to public criticism and resistance. The only possible interpretation is that the fear of displeasing the majority Meitei seems to be the core aspect of the government\u2019s policy. In the backdrop of the hostility of the community towards the Assam Rifles, and the Assam Rifles\u2019 apprehension that trucks made to resemble its vehicles may be used to commit offences in a bid to tarnish its image, the situation is rife with possibilities of further conflict. The Centre should not delay any further a serious initiative to bring about reconciliation between the two communities, lest the situation fester and deteriorate.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\narmed Forces\n\n/\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\npolice\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\ntribals\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war",

Tensions were high between China, which claims much of the South China Sea, including areas away from its coast, and a more assertive Philippines in recent months. Manila has repeatedly accused Beijing of blocking its shipping vessels in and around the Scarborough Shoal, a triangular reef encircling a resource-rich lagoon that China seized from the Philippines in 2012. When the Philippines realised that China\u2019s forces were setting up a barrier blocking Filipino fishermen from getting closer to the reef \u2014 it was fully accessible until 2012 \u2014 President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered its removal at the risk of inflaming tensions with Beijing. The Philippines sent Coast Guard crew in a boat to the Shoal, who dived and cut the rope that anchored the buoy line. Malaysia and Indonesia, which also have disputes with China, have sent vessels to the disputed waters for survey at various times this year. Manila\u2019s action underscores the trend of smaller countries in the region trying to be more assertive in their maritime claims as China tightens its hold over the South China Sea.Under Rodrigo Duterte, the former President, the Philippines tried to play down its tensions with China, even though Manila got a favourable ruling from an international tribunal in 2016 over Beijing\u2019s claims in the South China Sea. However, Mr. Marcos Jr., who assumed office in June last year, has taken a different approach. His administration has named and shamed China\u2019s high-handedness even as it has strengthened defence and strategic ties with Washington, its former colonial master. In February, the countries announced a defence cooperation agreement, which provides the U.S. access to nine Philippine bases, from the previous five. In April, the Philippines hosted its largest joint military exercises with the U.S. Enhanced cooperation with the U.S., with assurances from Washington that the mutual defence treaty \u201cextends to Philippine public vessels, aircraft, armed forces and the Coast Guard\u201d, seems to have emboldened Manila in its disputes with Beijing. But such actions carry risks, which could lead to tensions spiralling out of control. The U.S. and its Paci\ufb01c allies might get dragged into a conflict between China and the Philippines, potentially turning the South China Sea into a battle theatre, which is in nobody\u2019s interest. Both China and the Philippines should be mindful of the risks that their actions pose to the world and be ready to engage in talks and establish guardrails, ensuring stability in their volatile relationship. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nPhilippines\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nMalaysia\n\n/\n\nIndonesia\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\noceans",

Drug enforcement authorities the world over are losing sleep over meth, which is fast displacing heroin. The meth trade\u2019s epicentre is South Asia, with Afghanistan emerging as a huge s ource. This month the UN office on drugs and crime (UNODC) highlighted the surge in meth trafficking in Afghanistan, which was earlier a big source of heroin supply. No country is safe from this drug, which is pushed as a cheaper stimulant than cocaine.\n\nIndia is on red alert to this danger. GOI has dubbed its exercise to target maritime trafficking of drugs originating in Afghanistanas Operation Samudragupt. In response to a Parliament question in March, it said that in 2018 it destroyed 4.2 kg of seized meth. By 2022, the number increased to 357 kg. This is only the tip of the iceberg. The problem\u2019s source is Afghanistan\u2019s descent into a narco-state, where illegal drugs have emerged as the single largest economic sector, according to the European Foundation for South Asian Studies. And Taliban provides \u201cstructural oversight\u201d. In a desperately poor country, the presence of ephedra plants growing wildly provides a natural input for meth. UNODC estimated that the financial return for 1 kg of meth (50% purity) sourced from ephedra is $405.\nState governments in India need to be alert to the dangers meth poses. With substantial youth unemployment (graduates under 25) and meth being pushed as a cheap stimulant in an economy that\u2019s witnessing an expansion in purchasing power, risks are high. For drug enforcement, it\u2019s akin to being on a treadmill. Illicit products and their supply chain keep constantly evolving. Eternal vigilance is the only answer.\n\n",

But it must be seen in context. Other middle-income countries like Turkey, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Iran have accomplished even steeper climbs. The plain takeaway is that while the global innovation environment is full of novel opportunities, the competition is tough and will only keep getting tougher.\n\n\u00a0\nThe index notes for example that fulfilling Moore\u2019s Law (which predicts that the speed and capability of computer chips will double every 18-24 months) has become increasingly expensive. Factories designed to produce advanced chips cost more than $20 billion each. On such fronts, India\u2019s relatively low R&D spend has grave significance for its long-term competitiveness. Although the significance of this deficit has been widely discussed for some time now, the delivery date of significant remediation is yet to become clear. A second point worth highlighting is that compared to China\u2019s 24 and US\u2019s 21, India has only 4 S&T clusters among the world\u2019s top 100. Japan, Canada and South Korea also have 4 clusters each but each of their population is only a slight fraction of India\u2019s. That innovation and capital formation still remain overwhelmingly concentrated in Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai means that too much of this vast country\u2019s potential is still going waste.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is well-known that Dhaka faces a shortage of roads and that, while roads are being constructed on top of each other, no new streets are being created. So, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway project included a broadband network of roads, particularly for those travelling long distances in buses and trucks. This project aimed to connect the industrial belt adjacent to Dhaka, facilitating faster and more efficient commutes. Additionally, it aimed to address the complexity of diverting the three bus rapid transit and three mass rapid transit lines also mentioned in the Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka, reducing the inconvenience caused to the public.\nThe idea was to utilise railway land without the need for acquisition and to swiftly complete the project in the planned 42-month timeframe, as outlined in the ruling party's then election manifesto. Essentially, if long-distance travellers freed up space on the lower levels of the streets, it was proposed that the public transportation system could be reorganised to complement mass transit effectively. The goal was to establish a transportation skeleton for the entire area surrounding the expressway since vehicles on flyovers could already move quickly, and a similar approach was needed below using a public transport network.\nWhether it's the metro rail or an expressway, they all have limitations. But a bus route covers a broader spectrum. It doesn't end where the physically constructed roads or lines do. This is why it is crucial to make public transport faster on the roads. Unfortunately, investors were not enthusiastic about this idea and entered negotiations with the government regarding the placement and routes of the expressway. Investors argued that constructing the expressway outside of Dhaka wouldn't alleviate traffic within the city. This is why we ended up with an expressway within the capital. At the time, rail wasn't a separate ministry from roads. But when the minister realised they wouldn't need to go through the lengthy process of land acquisition since the railway already owned the land, the tender process began as it met all the criteria: speed, location (within Dhaka), and no requirement of land acquisition.\nHowever, reality threw a wrench into this plan. As the project didn't receive the necessary attention from the start, the government decided to separate rail into a different ministry. It injected significant funding and launched projects to improve the railway industry, for valid reasons. However, this clashed with the expressway project, causing further delays. The adverse effect of this was that the expressway's intended purpose \u2013 to alleviate traffic while the metro rail was being built \u2013 was not achieved. To add to this, traffic congestion worsened even more rapidly, with around a million motorcycles now on Dhaka's streets.\nAdditionally, the original alignment and ramp location in the tender were not realised either. Whenever there was a hiccup regarding the location, the ramp placement was shifted elsewhere, to Kakoli, Mohakhali, and even on the Bijoy Sarani-Tejgaon Link Road. The last flyover struggles to bear its own traffic load, which has now been exacerbated by the addition of the elevated expressway ramp. This was not part of the original design, signifying how our current model of \"development\" consists of additions and subtractions.\nConstructing a large-scale road like the expressway on top of existing roads naturally comes with drawbacks. To address this, certain design features were implemented, such as the ones at Bijoy Sarani and Kakoli. However, when there is a sudden influx of vehicles in already congested areas like Kakoli, measures like U-loops become necessary. Regrettably, these measures were not implemented, indicating that the completed project significantly deviates from the original.\nIt is essential to remember that the Dhaka Elevated Expressway is a PPP (public-private partnership) project. In determining tolls, the government plays no role since investors themselves financed the construction and must also maintain operations during the 24-year contract period. The government's role is limited to providing land and viability gap funding. A base rate for the tolls was set in 2013, with adjustments every three years to account for inflation. If currency devaluation reaches, say, 10 percent, that percentage can be added to the current toll. This means that even operators cannot set toll prices arbitrarily, and the government cannot object to price increases within the toll pricing framework.\nIn terms of pricing, the investors may consider reducing tolls strategically for their benefit. Inside cities, flyovers are utilised primarily when the streets below are highly congested. People are willing to pay for faster travel during such times. However, during late-night hours when there's no traffic, few would be willing to pay tolls. In such instances, the investor could introduce off-peak rates, potentially attracting more users. For daily commuters, paying tolls twice a day is a significant expense. Investors could lower tolls to attract more users, thus achieving a higher return on their investment.\nIf expressway usage doesn't pick up soon, it could render the project's aim redundant. Such a substantial investment for improved infrastructure should yield visible benefits. The project was supposed to reduce traffic by 30-40 percent \u2013 a goal that remains elusive as of yet.\nIn many countries, traffic engineers work on road transport, bridges, and similar infrastructure to optimise traffic flow. Peak hours result from the uniform application of rules, regulations, and tolls, causing everyone to hit the road at the same time. Encouraging a portion of commuters to start their journeys even half an hour earlier could alleviate congestion. Implementing on-peak and off-peak hour rates can incentivise this behaviour, resulting in smoother, faster travel and financial savings for commuters. Singapore, in particular, takes it a step further with variable congestion pricing, adjusting tolls based on road congestion.\nFor a Smart Bangladesh, relying solely on fixed tolls is insufficient. By altering travel behaviour and extending the peak hours over a longer period, everyone could enjoy improved lives and the economy could see a boost.\nAs told to Monorom Polok of The Daily Star.\n\nDr Md Shamsul Hoque\u00a0is a professor of civil engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "On May 24, 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring September 30 as International Translation Day, commemorating the feast of St Jerome, a multilingual with a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, canonised as the \"Patron Saint of Translators.\" He was commissioned by Pope Damasus I in 382 to revise the Latin translations of the Bible by revisiting and reviewing the original texts in Hebrew and Greek (Septuagint) by 404, resulting in the Vulgate Bible, to be officially used by the Roman Catholic Church henceforth.\nSuffice it to say, this belated recognition of the translators was long in the making. The International Federation of Translators advocated for marking this day from its very inception in 1953, until its official celebration kicked off in 1991. It was intended as an acknowledgment of the profession, historically instrumental in bringing about a bridging network among an ever-growing number of language communities, cultures, and nations arguably to facilitate meaningful dialogues and public discourses that potentially beef up international cooperation and security, and bolster and enhance alterity, diversity, equity and inclusivity. The essence of this enterprise is captured in the theme of this year's theme for the day: \"Translation unveils the many faces of humanity.\"\nAccolades for and invectives/innuendoes against translation were never in short supply. The growth of world culture, the development of comparative literature, and the civilisation in Western Europe were deservedly attributed to the shaping influence of translation. French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (2004) describes the role of a translator as an arbiter, or cultural mediator, imbued with the art and ethics inherent in translation, considered invaluable within the confounding context of unending ethnic and religious conflicts. He argues that translation not only spreads knowledge, but also transforms what it means to know, to the extent that the notion of navigating an increasingly complex world is inconceivable without translation. As millions of people keep moving, migrating and fleeing across the world in the 21st century \u2013 more than ever before \u2013 for a wide array of variables including, but not limited to, unemployment, underemployment, famines, persecution, natural disasters, environmental calamities, warfare and tourism, prompting displacement or \"deterritorialisation,\" to borrow from Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari (1972), the global significance of translation inexorably springs to the fore.\nNonetheless, a double entendre has always been imputed to translation. The Italian adage, \"Traduttore Traditore\" or \"Translator, Traitor\" obtains unabated. The translator, Ricoeur postulates, serves two masters \u2013 the foreign author and the reader who speaks the same language as the translator, propelled by the pressing need to appropriate, resulting in the paradox of being \"doubly sanctioned\" in which the \"vow of faithfulness\" is undercut by \"a suspicion of betrayal.\" The plight of Afghan translators following an abrupt pull-out of the US from Afghanistan in 2021 epitomises a blatant case in point.\nThere is no denying the truism that translation historically served the best interest of the colonisers anywhere from intelligence-gathering to sustaining colonial rule through persuasion, knowledge and exoticisation of the colonised \"other,\" by definition without history and unable to represent itself before being rendered (translated, better still) adequately compliant and subservient as a faithful subject to be counted on contemporaneously and prospectively, consistent with the discursive construction and formation underpinning how power is complicit with knowledge. Translations from the non-Western originals to the Western target texts were found replete with deep-seated Orientalism, reflected in their caricature, denigration, distortion, oversimplification, trivialisation, stereotyping, subjugating, subtending, subsuming, and domesticating of the irremediable \"other\". More to the point, regardless of how translation has been scandalously exploited and sidelined as a discipline and an enterprise, it indefatigably served as a powerful site of resistance by interrogating the contradictions and hypocrisies implicit or explicit in the dominant cultural values and practices, as Lawrence Venuti (1998) so cogently argued.\n\nTranslation not only spreads knowledge, but also transforms what it means to know, to the extent that the notion of navigating an increasingly complex world is inconceivable without translation.\nThe search for the holy grail of perfect translation from the source language to the target language has been likened by Walter Benjamin to the \"messianic echo\" of the original. In spite of its inevitable pathways of digression/dispersion/dissonance/distortion, translation tends to (re)constellate into an afterlife or incarnation of the original text at best. In other words, translation embarks on an intercultural and intertemporal endeavour, bearing the trace of the original, carried over to the present through metamorphosis. In Benjamin's own words, translated from the German original (as\u00a0mise en abyme), the translator's task is \"to find the intention towards the language into which the work is to be translated, on the basis of which an echo of the original can be awakened in it.\"\nIn this process, the survival or afterlife of the original text hinges on the transitional space between the two languages/cultures, generating hybridity, analogous to the \"international space of discontinuous historical realities\" (Bhabha, 1994:217), requiring iterative disambiguation. \"It is not about the passage from one language to another, but about the crossing of a threshold characterised by blurred limits,\" suggests Maria Teresa Costa (2022, Pg 17-18). The putative echo turns out to be \"a complex figure of resonance that cannot be reduced to the repetition of a stable entity\" (Pg 216).\nDerrida's rereading of Benjamin reduces the text's survival, or afterlife, through translation into one \"living on the boundary, on borderlines, on the edge\" (Bassnett, 2013, Pg 342). It resonates with Hans-Georg Gadamer's (1989) framing of translation that dispenses with the original's reproduction by embracing empathy and distance. Ricoeur treads the fine line to posit that \"a fantasy of perfect translation takes over from... (the) banal dream of the duplicated original\" (Pg 5). Extending the dialogic underpinning of Gadamer's hermeneutics, Ricoeur also comes up with a heterodox exegesis that \"the self only knows itself through the other.\" In this hermeneutics of selfhood, oneself is understood as both selfhood and an(other), adding to the problematics of the illusory origin associated with translation.\nThis is an excerpt from a larger article.\n\nFaridul Alam\u00a0teaches at the City University of New York.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

According to a report by this daily, over 3,000 illegal structures have been constructed on nine hills owned by the Bangladesh Railway in various parts of the city. It is well-known that building such structures increases the risk of deadly landslides. Yet, over 5,500 people currently reside on these state-owned hills, while the latter are being subjected to degradation in various ways. Clearly, those enabling and profiting off of this risky venture, including politically connected individuals and corrupt government officials, care little about the danger residents face.\nAs per a study, some 400 people have been killed in landslides in Chattogram between 2000 and 2017. Subsequent years have seen little improvement in this scenario. The question is: Why are the authorities failing to prevent this? Just last month, two people died in a landslide at the Soloshohor Hill, where people are still living. This is partly because of a general lack of awareness, and partly because of the increasingly high house rent in other areas which drove many families to such informal settlements in landslide-prone areas. Reportedly, several syndicates of powerful individuals in collusion with corrupt government employees are responsible for the construction of these buildings, violating relevant laws.\nSimilarly, land grabbers have been inflicting irreversible damage to the environment and biodiversity of hills under the nose of the local administration. Over the past 40 years, according to an estimate, some 120 hills have been lost in the port city. If the trend continues, we dread to think what will become of this still environmentally rich region. Experts have long blamed corruption and political interference for the lack of effective measures to stop the practice of hill razing. This must stop. We urge the authorities to undertake stern measures, including regular drives, to take down risky structures and rehabilitate residents, and also punish those responsible for this situation.\n",

        "full_article": "Despite all the hoopla about how Dhaka city's traffic situation is improving thanks to the introduction of metro rail and projects such as the Dhaka Elevated Expressway, these measures are not truly making a dent in the horrendous traffic jams in a city the size of Dhaka. The reality is that only one out of the six metro rails are nearing completion end of October this year and a portion of the elevated expressway has been opened to the public. Years have been spent on prestigious, expensive road and rail infrastructure projects that are years behind completion and this is reflected on the time wasted by the average commuter in Dhaka.As per a study released recently by Bangladeshi think-tank, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), it has been found that, on average, 23 minutes are lost per hour due to traffic jams in Dhaka. The end result of this waste has a direct impact on productivity lost for millions of people who call the city their home. On top of that, the jams lead to increased fuel consumption, which is detrimental to the environment and out-of-pocket expenditure for people riding their own vehicles.Though the presence of so many vehicles on roads is leading to all sorts of health issues (due to pollution), yet, it is obvious that current measures being undertaken by the authorities are invariably failing to arrest the situation. It is indeed strange that this city has so many rules for traffic movement, but yet so little enforcement! Certain areas in the city like Mirpur have literally been overrun by so-called 'easy bikes', which are passenger-carriers running on battery. No one needs any sort of license to drive these contraptions and they pick up and drop passengers wherever they like. Similarly, pedal-driven rickshaws have access to major road links from Malibagh to Rampura. So, Dhaka roads are open to all sorts of vehicles to ply as they will. The failure to deal with such issues has landed the city in the mess it is in today. Although some academicians have been demanding a slew of taxes, like the carbon tax, question would arise as to how practicable it is for Bangladesh. A very large percentage of public transport in the city is served by unfit mini-buses which should have been retired decades ago. They lack not only basic fitness, but like the 'easy bikes', those have drivers who do not pass any test before they're handed the keys to these large vehicles.Unfortunately, placing a carbon tax on vehicles in Bangladesh will do little to dissuade people from using vehicles. They still need to travel from point A to point B on a daily basis. The only thing it will do is to increase some government revenue whilst leaving the chaotic traffic situation as it is. Instead of carbon tax, the authorities can do what can be implemented much easier because the infrastructure already exists. The railway network has rail lines leading in and out of Dhaka city. Why not introduce shuttle trains during the peak office hours of the week so that people can travel to Dhaka for work, and leave at the end of the day? This has worked perfectly for Kolkata city for decades and it certainly can be done here. Private sector operators can be given contracts to run these services so as not to overburden the state body. While the feasibility study for the Dhaka Circular Rail is ongoing, the current infrastructure can be used to introduce such innovative services to lessen the population pressure on Dhaka city.",

        "full_article": "Within five months, World Trade Organization (WTO) members will meet at the highest-level decision-making summit in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It will be the 13th ministerial conference (MC13) of the multilateral trade-rule-making organisation. Preparations are in full swing, and member countries are doing their homework. Though some critical issues will be tabled in the conference, only a few will be finalised. The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are expected to push several agendas, including the extension of trade benefits for the graduating LDCs. During the MC12 in Geneva last year, their effort in this connection did not bring any fruitful results. The MC12 Outcome Document acknowledged the challenges, including the loss of trade-related international support measures (ISMs) for the graduating LDCs. However, there was even no mention of the continuation of the steps to be taken for a certain period so that the countries leaving the LDC category could avail of those even after graduation. Instead, the document added a general statement that specific measures in the WTO can facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition for these members after graduation from the LDC category. It was in 2021 that the LDCs floated a proposal to allow LDC-specific Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) and preferential market access for 12 years after an LDC has graduated from the group. There is no doubt that the demand was highly ambitious and non-LDC members of the WTO were not ready to pay heed to the arguments behind the proposal. Later, the LDC group revised the proposal, seeking the continuation of trade preferences and gradually phasing out those over six to nine years. The scaled-down proposal was submitted in MC12 by the LDC group, which was not welcomed by many developed countries. Some advanced developing nations also expressed their reservation about such a move. Against this backdrop, LDCs resubmitted another revised version of the proposal, which suggested a comprehensive and effective smooth transition package in the WTO to support members when they leave the LDC category. The core element of the proposed package is extending and gradually phasing out unilateral trade preferences granted to LDCs for six years or a period determined by the preference-providing country. As mentioned earlier, the demand received a cold shoulder in MC12.Nevertheless, the LDCs jointly submitted a slightly revised proposal at the general council meeting in December last, seeking support from the WTO members. Besides extending duty-free quota-free (DFQF) market access for countries that graduated from the LDC category, the proposal also demanded smooth transition support measures in favour of the same countries. These include exemption from any action under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, an extension of time for LDC-specific special flexibilities incorporated in future WTO agreement, and continuation of all LDC-specific technical assistance and capacity-building programs and facilities provided under the WTO system. LDCs seek these supports for 'an appropriate period of time', which is negotiable. Two opposing views may be presented here for understanding the pulse in this regard. During the WTO Public Forum 2023, which took place in the second week of September in Geneva, this scribe approached two international trade experts to get their views. Dr Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, the former Executive Director of the Geneva-based International Trade Centre (ITC), briefly said that the multilateral trading system is already there to protect the LDC interests. She believed that gradation means improving the overall condition of the least developed country (LDC) like Bangladesh. She added: \"Bangladesh has been doing better gradually in terms of trade and economy and social sectors, and all these are reflected in the country's advancement to coming out from the LDC category. It also indicates that the country becomes more competitive in the global market as it is now more productive.\"Dr Rupa Chanda, director of the trade, investment and innovation division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), expressed her views elaborately. She said: \"The LDCs' move to push the agenda of extending the preferences for the graduated LDCs for a couple of years is necessary. Whether it is feasible in the WTO is not the issue, as the continuation of the S&DTs for LDCs coming out from the category is required for various reasons.\"Dr Chanda explained that the graduating LDCs have to work hard to keep pace with their changed status and adjust to stringent standards. \"So they need more time, especially when changes in many areas are quite fast,\" she added. \"There are new and complex issues like digital trade, tariff, how to tax digital trade, complex supply chains, rapid technological advancements, etc. What was negotiated yesterday may change tomorrow or may change very fast. Commitments or obligations taken today can affect policy flexibility tomorrow.\" The ESCAP director also argued that the extension of preference of DFQF for a couple of years and phasing out the perference gradually will help the graduated LDCs.It appears from the above views that not all are convinced of the necessity of extending and continuing preferences for the countries leaving LDC status. Bangladesh, along with Nepal and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, will formally come out from the UN-defined category by the end of 2026. More LDCs follow these countries. There are 46 LDCs, of which 16 are on the path to graduation. Ten are WTO members.LDCs are likely to push their demand in the upcoming ministerial conference in February. The proposal, already submitted to the general council last December, has some merits. It, however, requires strong support, especially from the influential members of the WTO. Getting support is a challenging task as these countries also have some arguments for not allowing the benefits to graduating LDCs. They believe such an extension would be discriminatory as both LDCs and some non-LDCs, graduated LDCs to be specific, get similar treatment regarding market access and other waivers. LDCs have already argued that graduated countries need these supports to adjust themselves in a post-graduation era to sustain the primary pressure in a competitive environment. It is to see how developed nations and advanced developing countries respond to the demand. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "In spite of its spectacular development in many sectors, notably communication, Dhaka still remains plagued with scores of problems. Most of those are too raw and rudimentary to befit the declared goals of this city. Given the state of its anomalous development spree, many are doubtful about its meeting, finally, the aspiration of emerging as a tolerably advanced city. To the woes of many old residents of the once-idyllic Dhaka, the city remains deficient on a number of counts. The country's capital lacks the basic urban amenities which are normally associated with livability. In order to elaborate on this feature, one might point out its ill-planned traffic movement network. Footpath encroachment by hawkers leading to traffic gridlocks almost throughout the day remains a major problem. Besides reckless jaywalking, road blocks resulting from accidents and on flimsy grounds, and many other hindrances keep making large segments of the roads veritably dysfunctional. The latest menace which has started afflicting the frenziedly growing city for the last few years is an unusual form of water-logging caused by heavy rain. Except some exclusive and high-end areas and the roads passing through them, the city remains under stagnant rain water for long hours. A spell of night-long rain in last mid-September caused the Dhaka New Market shopping centre to stay submerged under waist-deep water for one-and-half days. Similar flooding of middle and lower middle class areas is now a recurrent phenomenon in Dhaka. Roads and walkways submerged by spells of heavy rain cause great hazards including deaths. They occur due to humans' coming into contact with severed live wire which lies hidden in ankle-deep water. This is what has happened during the long bout of rain that battered Dhaka recently, in which four persons died.Water-logging of relatively low-lying areas has emerged as an urban scourge in Dhaka for over two decades. Amazingly, the Dhaka residents were completely stranger to it even in the mid-1960s. In those days, non-stop night-long rain would witness in the morning few areas in the city water-logged, except the extremely low-lying swathes in the suburban areas. Thanks to Dhaka's low population in those days, a properly functional drainage could operate in those days. Moreover, dumping of municipal waste into public places indiscriminately had yet to become a general practice. The city's drainage network went haywire after the country's independence, when people began arriving in Dhaka in droves to have the taste of a better life. Unabated increase in solid wastes played a great role in the decline of the city's atmospheric balance. It was in the seventies that over a dozen functional canals became victims of the grabbers' syndicates. Many eventually turned into ditches filled with viscous fetid water. At present, the locations of the Dhaka canals are found only in the site plans of the city planners.In order to emerge as an ideal city, Dhaka ought to deal with its pressing problems without frittering away its time. Already unsolved problems keep multiplying. Access to market of essentials is difficult. Scourges like dengue and air and dust pollution turn terrible; with long unheard-of problems threatening to return with vengeance. Violence of different types and slide in law and order has started digging in their heels. Life in the capital is fast becoming fraught with a feeling of unease. All this may hinder the country's graduation into a middle-income country.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The life expectancy of an average Bangladeshi is cut short by 6.8 years due to fine particle air pollution, according to a recent piece of news. The report has been composed on the basis of the Air Quality Life Index 2023 prepared by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute. The index quantifies the decrease in life expectancy due to exposure to air pollution in countries around the world. The recently published index states that the quality of Gazipur air is the worst in Bangladesh with 89.8 micrograms per cubic metre. In Dhaka and Chattogram, some 74.7 million residents are on the track to lose 7.6 years of life expectancy on average as per the WHO (World Health Organization) guideline if the current pollution levels persist, according to the index.  Air pollution is the second highest risk factor for non communicable diseases like heart diseases, acute respiratory problems, lung cancers, stroke and more. The factors that are contributing to the declining air qualities are mainly rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. Our development work should keep going but we must remember that it should not come at the cost of our environment. Now what we need is a strong commitment to curb air pollution in the country. Bangladesh is a densely-populated country. This is an ideal condition for respiratory diseases. So, we should motivate the people and make them more conscious about air pollution. Whatever we do, we must keep environment as our top priority so that it does not degrade. We have to convince everyone that if we uphold our commitment, the air quality in the country will improve one day. We should bring down the use of fossil fuel that contributes highly to the air pollution. We should also take a pragmatic green policy where social activists and politicians would come forward with their sincere efforts. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) can play a major role in this regard. Md.
