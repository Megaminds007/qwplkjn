Mr. Kumar had been at the forefront of championing a broad alliance of Opposition parties to take on the might of the ruling BJP in the upcoming general election. The Centre\u2019s decision to honour Karpoori Thakur, an icon of social justice politics in Bihar, with the Bharat Ratna, has given Mr. Kumar a convenient excuse to warm up to the BJP. Mr. Kumar recalled his demand for conferment of the Bharat Ratna on the socialist leader since 2006, obliquely blaming the Congress which was in power then for overlooking his demand. He has also expressed the hope that other demands of Bihar would be met by the Centre, which many see as a prelude to yet another alliance between his party, the Janata Dal (United), and the BJP. Mr. Kumar has clearly distanced himself from the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, his partners in the State government; the BJP, which had ruled out a revival of its alliance with Mr. Kumar until recently, has now said it is possible. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s Bhagwant Mann, Chief Ministers of West Bengal and Punjab, respectively, have meanwhile ruled out seat-sharing with the Congress in their States.Except for closed door meetings followed by press conferences, the INDIA bloc has not had any big public outreach programme since its formation seven months ago in Patna. Time is running out and there is no clarity on when the bloc will be able to seal the division of seats among its constituents. The alliance is staring at a crisis in the battle of perception and in building a robust structure for a joint campaign or election strategy. The initial euphoria had blinded the parties to the political peculiarities in each State, and the ambitions and fears of regional leaders that soon began to emerge. On January 13, Ms. Banerjee skipped a virtual meeting of the bloc that had been organised in haste. The Shiv Sena\u2019s Uddhav Thackeray and the Samajwadi Party\u2019s Akhilesh Yadav also stayed away. It is still possible that partial seat sharing arrangements depending on tactical considerations in individual States might still emerge, but any programmatic national alliance against the BJP seems to be out of reach. The Opposition parties may have to look at State-level alliances, and the possibility of post-poll alliances. The BJP, meanwhile, has ramped up its campaign, not merely to win the election but also to extinguish the last signs of opposition to it. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\nPunjab\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\naward and prize\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nJanata Dal (United)\n\n/\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n/\n\nShiv Sena-Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray\n\n/\n\nSamajwadi Party\n\n/\n\nBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi",

Russia says Kyiv downed the plane, which had 65 Ukrainian soldiers, in Belgorod, a Russian border town, that has seen repeated Ukrainian shelling in recent months. Kyiv has slammed Russia for spreading propaganda, but has not ruled out its possible role in the downing. The incident comes at a time when Ukraine\u2019s troops are struggling to keep up the fight on the front line amid Russia\u2019s incremental advances. Russia, which suffered humiliating setbacks in 2022, has since retaken the battlefield momentum. Last year, Ukraine\u2019s top general said the counteroffensive, which began in June 2023, aimed at recapturing Russia-held territories in the south and east, had failed. Russia has made territorial gains in the east, capturing Mariinka and making advances towards Avdiivka and Kupiansk. With its huge losses on the battlefield, Ukraine\u2019s generals are calling for the mobilisation of up to 5,00,000 soldiers \u2014 which would be hugely unpopular. Worse, the changing mood in Washington has sent an alarming message to Kyiv.Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government has vowed to uncover the truth behind the plane crash. If it has been downed by a Ukrainian missile, it would pose a political challenge to Mr. Zelensky. But a bigger problem he is facing is the future of the war. Until now, he has put up a brave face, saying Ukraine would fight until victory \u2014 which is, recapturing all the territories Russia has taken. While Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine regions and its war are a violation of international laws, Ukraine does not seem to have a practical path towards victory. Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, which has the Biden administration\u2019s full support, has also distracted global attention from Ukraine. If Donald Trump, the U.S. Republican leader, is re-elected in November \u2014 he has vowed to end the war in days \u2014 Ukraine could come under heavy pressure. The war cannot be sustained without uninterrupted support from the U.S. and its NATO partners. When pressure increases on the battlefield, what Ukraine is doing is to carry out missile and drone attacks inside Russia. Ukraine\u2019s possession of advanced weapons, supplied by the West, has enhanced its fire power. Last week, a fuel export terminal on Russia\u2019s Baltic coast came under attack. There is suspicion, deep mistrust and misinformation on both sides, which could lead to more violence and accidents. Russia, Ukraine and NATO should take a more practical assessment of the progress of the war and be ready for talks, instead of continuing an endless war which is hurting all sides. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nNATO\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\ninternational law",

But when it is asked of courts, there must be greater standardisation. Our constitutional courts must take guidance from the great document that came into effect on this day 74 years ago. If they keep muddling the issue with reference to ancient texts or traditions, that\u2019s unjust not only to one woman in one case. Denial of equal rights to women is holding back India itself.\nWife isn\u2019t synonym for drudgery\u00a0\nThis week Jharkhand HC opined that it is \u201cobligatory\u201d for a wife to \u201cserve\u201d her mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law; and not make \u201cunreasonable\u201d demands to live separately. It quoted from Yajurved, Rigved, Manusmriti and Brihat Samhita. The case only concerned maintenance, which HC disallowed for the wife and increased by 66% for the minor son. Problem is clear. Instead of sticking to facts, court is propagating a subjective morality.\nHusband isn\u2019t synonym for saint\u00a0\nSons are enormously coddled in Indian families but courts shouldn\u2019t continue this nannying. Courts shouldn\u2019t echo mohalla bullies in declaring that where a married couple lives cannot be their decision alone. After all, a neigbourhood might also believe that honeymooning is anti-Indian or only to be done with mother-in-law in tow. A young wife insisting otherwise is hardly \u201ctorturing\u201d her husband. Courts must stop reading such in-differences from the point of view of \u201cpoor husband\u201d.\nBreak out of these cages\u00a0\nThese blinkers are of course turned against \u201cthe second sex\u201d from childhood on. Aser 2023 describes how even young girls\u2019 desire to continue studies after Class XII is linked to school being \u201ctheir only escape from their household duties\u201d. It is in continuum that a Kerala HC judgment suggested that making a daughter-in-law do all domestic work or abusing her is \u201cnot something unusual\u201d. All of this is deeply damaging to women. And courts keep telling women to just accept such treatment as their \u201cculture\u201d.\nWhat about the culture of Constitution of India? Right to equality. Right to freedom. Right against exploitation. Women who are before courts are the minority who have found the courage and support to fight, rather than surrender to unjust social norms. Judges must remember that.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Evasion and avoidance of tax by individuals and corporate businesses cause substantial revenue loss to the nation. According to an estimate made by a local think tank, tax evasion alone is costing the nation between Tk 418 billion and Tk 2,230 billion a year. When tax avoidance is taken into account, the loss amount goes up further. Notably, tax payment is avoided when individuals or organisations cheat government by not paying tax, while avoidance is when tax liability is reduced using legal loopholes. Overall, going by that estimate, potential loss to the nation's tax revenue through tax evasion and tax avoidance would come to between Tk558 billion and Tk2925 billion a year.So, when the revenue department has always been in a struggle to meet its annual revenue collection target, the government, at the same time, is allowing a section of the business community and individuals to deprive the economy of funds worth billions of taka annually. All this is happening on adoption of dishonest methods like showing less income than actually earned by the companies and individuals often with support from unethical tax practitioners, claiming more investment allowances by companies than justified and carrying out informal or cash-based transactions extensively. This is simply unacceptable. However, a recent report published in this paper that the tax regulator has finally put its foot down on the matter, though belated, is still welcome. The Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is learnt to have launched a campaign against corporate entities based on, what the report says, suspicion of tax evasion by the businesses concerned. Understandably, the objective of such drives against the companies so suspected would be to ensure their tax compliance. The report further states that a reputed private hospital of the city, which had allegedly been hiding its real income and evading source taxes has already come under the NBR's action to this effect. Hopefully, the NBR's drive against corporate tax evasion would prove useful and send a strong message to other tax-evading business entities and individuals. While the move is commendable, the campaign has to be run on a sustained basis. Also, mounting such raid against any business entity should better be done on the basis of hard information rather than on mere suspicion so that it may not appear persecutive and can stand any legal challenge. Otherwise, the very purpose of ensuring tax compliance from the suspected-to-be errant corporate houses might be defeated. As records show, the country has over 288,466 companies registered with the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC). Unfortunately, going by the NBR record, only 30,000 corporate houses, which is around 10 per cent of all the companies so registered, submit tax returns to the revenue authority. Regrettably, in South Asia, Bangladesh has one of the lowest tax-GDP ratios at 7.9 per cent, whereas, ideally, it should be at least 15 per cent. To reach the benchmark (at 15 per cent), the NBR would be required to collect an additional amount of Tk2506 billion as tax. Obviously, it is going to be a humongous challenge before the tax authority to achieve the target. So, to meet its goal of bringing all those evading tax or avoiding due amounts under tax net, the tax regulator should be adequately equipped with the required manpower and other technical resources. Most importantly, the need for the political will to carry out the task through to the end cannot be overemphasised.",

        "full_article": "Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government has apparently approved a proposed plan by the finance division (under the ministry of finance) that will oversee phasing out of subsidies on power. While it may make sense from the Ministry of Finance's point of view, but will certainly have dire consequences for people's lives and industrial (and agricultural) production. Instead of treating the cancerous elements that are eating away at energy security of the country, policymakers are merely following prescription of donors. This depicts total capitulation at policy level to the import lobby that has brought nothing but pain to the millions of citizens who are somehow eking out a living. Inflation will continue to rise and their collective lives will become more miserable in the next three years - if this plan of action is implemented.According to IMF projections, current subsidy to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is Tk57 billion for Financial Year (FY) 2023-24. Unfortunately for BPDB, this subsidy is sadly inadequate to cover its costs because the public power utility company is hamstrung by the exorbitant sums it must pay to privately-owned and operated power producers (IPPs), to buy power that it must sell to consumers at subsidised rates. The gap between what BPDB paid for electricity purchased and what it got for selling that high-cost power at lower prices is what constitutes the loss of billions of Taka by BPDB. It is not simply a question of paying high prices for electricity produced, but the billions of Taka dished out each year in \"capacity payment\" - a net loss to the national exchequer, but one which successive governments have refused to annul.So, instead of going out for all-out explorations of own resources, i.e. natural gas reserves (on-shore and off-shore) and natural deposits of high-quality coal, the situation was created over a decade whereby, existing natural gas production continued to dwindle and share of imported fuel increased. Today, Banladesh is in an unenviable position where more than half the fuel it needs to produce electricity comes from foreign countries / markets. Today, Bangladesh is at the mercy of foreign interests. The crisis that BPDB faces is not at all surprising. This was done deliberately to make Bangladesh weak and subservient. Given the statements coming from the government, it appears that peoples' woes are not a matter of any concern to policymakers. People are suffering silently but there is a limit to the forbearance. It is not merely a question of paying more for electricity consumed at home by citizens. A report carried in this newspaper contends, \"Power Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) will take necessary measures to decide the extent of tariff hikes and timelines to ensure that the country's power sector be subsidy-free\". What is now abundantly clear to everyone is that the government policy will remain squarely big-business focused where expensive fuels will keep getting imported. Tariffs will continue to rise, regardless of the pain it causes to agriculture, industry and consumers at large.Now that the government has run into multi-billion-Taka debt where it can no longer afford to pay power producers, it is going to issue special bonds and those banks that host accounts of these power producers and importers will purchase such bonds. The irony of the situation is not lost upon anyone, least of all bankers. The banking sector is already suffering a serious liquidity shortage, and now these financial institutions are being pressed by the authorities to snap up bonds. As per media reports, Tk80 billion in bank money has been pumped into these bonds. Unfortunately, hundreds of billions of Taka will be required to pay off IPPs and other suppliers of energy. God only knows where that money will come from. Even if the State phases out Tk57 billion subsidy it currently gives to BPDB, the rot that has set in cannot be treated by the issuance of bonds and raising retail and bulk tariff of power. People are going to start using less electricity and there will be a major fall in demand for goods. It's quite simple really. Industrial production will fall as people's capacity to buy goods will be hampered by runaway prices. No matter what prescription is given by donors and how much the authorities try to whitewash the situation, Bangladesh is heading for an economic blackhole if these suicidal policies are implemented. There is no alternative to reversing the damage caused by unsound policies whereby the country moved away from self-reliance to a mostly import-driven national energy policy. There is still time to get out of this get-rich-quick mindset before the whole house of cards comes crashing down on everyone's head.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Parents have long preferred religious education for their children in this part of the world. The number of people receiving religious education during the past three decades has only gone up. The Population and Housing Census 2022 report showed that the population ratio obtaining religious education increased to 7.19 per cent in 2021 from 5.58 per cent in 2011 and 3.16 per cent in 2001.Understanding the trend is necessary by putting the figures in perspective. The latest population census also showed that the population ratio in the field of general education had declined during the period under review. In 2021, it came down to 89.26 per cent from 93.71 per cent in 2011 and 96.44 per cent in 2001. Do these statistics mean people are increasingly becoming less interested in general or regular education, and more are opting for religion-based education? Any straight-cut answer is not available.In Bangladesh, religious education is offered by madrasas, which have a long history. As more than 90 per cent of the country's population is Muslim, madrasas have a strong foothold to spread Islamic education with focus on the religious scriptures. There are two main streams of madrasa education. One is government-funded Aliyah madrasas that teach both secular and religious subjects simultaneously, from primary to secondary levels. These educational institutions follow the national curriculum and are regulated by the Madrasa Education Board. Another is Quomi madrasa that the government does not regulate. These madrasas generally follow orthodox Deobandi traditions. Many Quomi madrasas have, however, started to teach secular subjects like Bangla and English language and literature, mathematics, and social sciences. Since 2018, the government has recognised the unregistered Quomi madrasa's highest degree, Dawrah Hadith, which is equivalent to a master's degree. There are 20,000 Quomi madrasas, whereas Alia madrasas are around 10,000. Besides these two mainstreams of madrasa education, there is a growing trend of madrasa-oriented kindergarten, pre-cadet and other general schools. These institutions are hybrid in nature, where religious and secular teaching simultaneously follows the modern approach to some extent. There are various reasons behind a growing number of children taking religious education. Many low-income families prefer madras education as they have to pay a marginal amount as expenses. They can also get some support from solvent relatives and charitable organisations for sending their children to madrasa. Even a growing number of middle-income households now seek educational institutions offering this education. The misperception about general education, coupled with various controversies over curriculums, textbooks and frequent changes in curricula have driven many to go for madrasa or similar educational institutions. Many also apprehend that the ongoing debate on the newly introduced national curriculum may further push many to opt for religious education. Again, some parents also firmly believe that getting an education from a madrasa or religion-based school will help their children strengthen their moral character. There is also a widespread belief that education from these institutions will enhance the deep knowledge of the religious doctrines and practices, which is necessary for emancipation in the afterlife. Nevertheless, the country's madrasa education is complex and sometimes shady. One strong allegation is that some of these educational institutions are used to promote religious extremism, leading to fanatic and terrorist activities. In some institutions, undermining the fundamental spirit of the Liberation War is also prevalent under cover of religious principles. That's why strict supervision and effective regulation are necessary. Educational institutions are not places for promoting hatred and fanaticism, they are centres for learning and acquiring knowledge for upholding the cause of humanity. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Studies indicate that nearly all Trans Men (TM) and Trans Women (TW) experience gender dysphoria by the age of seven (7), with some individuals continuing to experience it throughout their lives. However, there are numerous strategies to improve one's inner feelings and body image.Recent estimates suggest that the prevalence of gender dysphoria ranges between 390 and 460 per 100,000 people, with trans women (MTF, Male to Female) consistently having a higher prevalence than trans men (FTM, Female to Male).The exact cause of gender unease remains unknown, although specialists believe that a combination of factors such as prenatal hormones, genetics, cultural influences, and environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, hormones responsible for biological sex may not fully affect the brain, reproductive organs, and genitals, leading to discrepancies between them.Symptoms of gender dysphoria in children include a strong desire to be the other gender, cross-dressing, engaging in cross-gender roles during play, preferring playmates of the opposite gender, rejecting toys and activities associated with their assigned gender and a dislike for their sexual anatomy.Counselling, hormonal therapy, and surgery are common treatment. Treatment has been shown to reduce suicidal tendency and improve the quality of life in individuals with gender dysphoria. Many transgender individuals undergoing feminising or masculinising hormone therapy, such as estrogen or testosterone, report emotional improvement as their gender dysphoria diminishes or resolves.\nDr Sayed InamAssistant Professor of PsychiatryFellow, American Psychiatric Association",
