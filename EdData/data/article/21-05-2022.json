        "full_article": "Pronouncing its verdict on a protracted dispute over the levy of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on ocean freight charges paid by importers, the Supreme Court on Thursday held that such a tax was untenable. Its 153-page judgment has also dwelt at length on the nature of the recommendations of the GST Council, the constitutional body set up to oversee the operations of the indirect tax regime. Invoking the spirit of cooperative federalism, the Court has held that both the Union and State legislatures have \u201cequal, simultaneous and unique powers\u201d to make GST laws, and the recommendations of the Council, where they have a one-third and two-thirds voting share, respectively, are not binding on them. While amending the Constitution to pave way for the tax system that subsumed multiple central and State levies, Parliament had intended for the Council\u2019s recommendations to only have \u2018a persuasive value\u2019, as per the Court. This has sparked fears that individual States can start vetoing the Council\u2019s recommendations that they do not agree with, and refuse to implement them, thus threatening the \u2018One Nation, One Tax\u2019 edifice of a reform that took years to bring about. Opposition-ruled States have hailed the verdict as upholding their rights vis-\u00e0-vis what a few termed as the \u2018arbitrary imposition\u2019 of Centre\u2019s decisions in the Council. The Finance Ministry has sought to quell anxiety by indicating that the Court has only elaborated on the Council\u2019s existing arrangement and the status quo would continue. States can already reject the Council\u2019s decisions but none has chosen to so far, it said.While North Block undertakes a detailed review of the verdict, it is pertinent that it had argued that if the Council\u2019s recommendations were not binding, it would lead to an impasse and the entire GST structure would crumble. This does not hold water, the Court averred. That it has struck down a tax notified two days prior to the launch of the GST regime just as it is on the verge of completing five years, is perhaps, a fortuitous nudge for introspection on its journey and the way ahead. At worst, it can trigger more contestations in Council meetings, and at best, infuse a fresh sense of responsibility among members. The Centre could strive to be more conciliatory towards States\u2019 concerns and fiscal dilemmas, especially as their assured compensation clock winds down next month, rather than seek to bulldoze over thorny predicaments with the tacit support of NDA-ruled States in the Council. The Council should also meet more often to nurture the critical fiscal federalism dialogue in the right direction and minimise trust deficits. There are many pending reforms that require the Centre to work more cohesively with States to take India\u2019s economy forward and lift those left behind \u2014 including, but not limited to, an overhaul of land and labour markets as well as the agrarian sector.",

        "full_article": "It is a matter of great concern that laws are being used to rake up religious controversies to give a fig-leaf of legitimacy to a communal onslaught on the country\u2019s secular character. Obviously emboldened by the Supreme Court verdict handing over a disputed site in Ayodhya to Hindu claimants, determined and malicious efforts are being made by communal elements to capture sites in Varanasi and Mathura where the Gyanvapi mosque and Shahi Idgah Masjid are located. The idea that key places of worship among Muslims have been built after demolishing Hindu temples is beginning to take hold among sections of Indian society, with the active encouragement of politically affiliated religious groups. It was to prevent such attempts to change the character of places of worship in the name of correcting perceived historical wrongs that Parliament enacted the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. It sought to freeze the status of places of worship as on August 15, 1947, so that existing suits and proceedings abate and new claims are not entertained. Yet, in flagrant violation of the law, courts are repeatedly allowing proceedings to be initiated. In Gyanvapi, not only has a civil judge entertained a suit but has also ordered a commission to videograph the mosque to ascertain its religious character. The Supreme Court has not been strong enough. Instead of putting an immediate halt to such proceedings aimed at creating a groundswell of opinion in favour of converting such sites into temples, it has only ordered some elementary measures to protect Muslim worshippers and their place of worship.Anyone familiar with the history of the Ayodhya dispute, which led to the Babri Masjid\u2019s demolition, riots and bombings, will understand that all such attempts to change the character of places of worship have a motive of using religion for political ends and marginalising minorities. Yet, even the Supreme Court feels some inexplicable need to let procedural aspects of civil law to be gone through in such litigation. It has transferred the Gyanvapi suit to the District Judge and asked for priority to be given to the petition to reject the plaint \u2014 which will involve the question whether the suit is barred by the Places of Worship Act. As long as even one application is pending somewhere, revanchist groups will continue the relentless onslaught on minority places of worship. In Mathura, the District Court has overturned a lower court\u2019s order and ruled that the Act will not bar a suit aimed at removing a Masjid in the name of the site being the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The political atmosphere is conducive for such efforts, whose proponents will expect state backing. It is up to the courts to act early and act decisively to uphold the spirit of the Places of Worship Act and preserve communal peace.",

        "full_article": "The number of risks that our economy currently faces because of all the global instabilities is perhaps unmatched since the early days of Bangladesh's independence. Amid this reality, the government is set to present the new budget early next month.\nIn the last two years, the government had to prepare less ambitious budgets due to the pandemic. But now it has no option but to increase its support for the people, who are suffering both from the after-effects of the pandemic and because of various supply-related shocks due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\u00a0Simultaneously, debt servicing\u2014particularly after watching what's happening in Sri Lanka\u2014and budgetary deficits are becoming increasing concerns for Bangladesh. In the last fiscal year, Bangladesh's debt-service-to-revenue ratio jumped to 81.2 percent from 56.2 percent in 2019. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \"Although the risk of debt distress remains low, the risk from a rising debt-service-to-revenue ratio has increased.\"\n\u00a0And this is where the concern is particularly acute, because for years, Bangladesh has struggled to improve its tax-GDP ratio. Over the last nine years, our highest tax-GDP ratio was an embarrassingly low nine percent in FY2017-18. In the last fiscal year, that declined to 7.6 percent\u2014the lowest in South Asia and one of the lowest in the world.\n\u00a0\"Money is really going out of taxpayers' pockets. But it is not going to the state coffers,\" says Zahid Hussain, former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office. \"The money is going to the pockets of various intermediaries in the system.\" This great leakage is affecting the whole fiscal management of the country. Then there is the issue of tax evasion, which is suspected to be quite common among the political and business elite.\n\u00a0Without increasing tax revenue, the government has no other alternative to finance its expenditure\u2014without increasing the risks of debt servicing. Already, the Finance Division has warned the government to avoid hard-term loans and discourage import of luxury goods to cope with macroeconomic pressures arising from external shocks. Moreover, it observed that the financial health of commercial banks has weakened due to rising non-performing loans (NPLs), pushing up the costs of letters-of-credit (LC)\u2014putting greater pressure on our forex reserves\u2014and that the government needs to take initiatives to finish megaprojects on time, which would relieve some of that pressure. But these recommendations have been conveyed to the government for years now. Instead of paying heed to them, the government lashed out at anyone who made the suggestions.\n\u00a0Loan payments already account for the fourth biggest head in the overall budgetary expenditure. However, that would not be a problem if loans were judiciously used on financially viable projects which benefited the economy and the people. That must be the government's focus going forward\u2014unlike in the past.\n\u00a0Also, in regard to expenditure, allocations for the education and healthcare sectors have to be increased. Not only that, their capacity to absorb budgetary allocations must also be improved. In the budget for FY2021-22, the education sector received only 2.08 percent of the GDP. In its Education 2030 Framework for Action, Unesco recommends allocating four to six percent of GDP for education. However, at the current rate of resource allocation, the education budget as a share of GDP may only reach up to 2.15 percent in 2025 and 2.26 percent in 2031.\n\u00a0Even in the post-Covid period, Bangladesh is spending around 2.5 percent of its GDP on health, which is the lowest in South Asia. Numerous studies have shown that, because the out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare services is so high, the majority of people are just one health crisis away from going below the poverty line. In fact, many people have gone below the poverty line because of some form of health emergency.\n\u00a0Understandably, the allocation for subsidy is being revised upwards by 24.1 percent to Tk 66,825 crore in the next budget. The alleged purpose of this is to keep prices low, amid volatility in the international market. But will that purpose really be served?\n\u00a0If we take the power sector for example, the government for years has been paying for far more generation than we need, while making very little improvement in transmission capacity. Therefore, crores of taka from the public fund have been wasted to subsidise the overcapacity in power generation. Will the new increase in subsidy similarly get flushed down the drain?\n\u00a0To pay for the increased allocation in subsidy, the government is set to slash funds for the annual development programme (ADP) by 7.89 percent. According to Dr Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem), \"Whenever there is a budget cut, it is the ADP that is the main casualty.\" But development activities should get priority over non-development aspects of the budget.\n\u00a0While that is true, how useful would that be? After all, since FY2008-09, the government has not once been able to implement the budget fully. In its recommendations for the upcoming budget, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) said, \"Over the last decade, the budgetary target setting in Bangladesh has primarily emerged as a numbers game.\"\n\u00a0But the budget needs to be more than that. As the World Bank explains, \"Accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts are a key input to the preparation of a credible budget. In Bangladesh, overly optimistic expenditure allocations are presented with aspirational revenue targets.\" Which, in short, translates to: the government plays politics with the budget.\n\u00a0It is unclear how long the government can afford to do so, but it is clear that the people no longer can. Neither can they afford the government's poor execution and waste of budgetary allocations. The sooner the government realises that, the faster it can work on making the budget relevant again, and for the right reasons.\n\u00a0\nEresh Omar Jamal\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Food prices have been keeping us awake at night, making some of us seriously rethink our diets. Confronted with the news that there was a severe soybean oil crisis reflected by the ludicrous price hike in this essential item, people were toying with the idea of switching to mustard oil, using less oil in cooking or just \"going boiled,\" which would have been a healthy decision for those who have an irrepressible weakness for greasy samosas and morog mussalam, plus can afford such \"delicacies.\" We have to admit, as Bangladeshis we do consume an extraordinary amount of oil\u2014and onions\u2014hence the panic during sudden shortages in supply of these items. Of course, later we found that it was much ado about nothing, since there were gallons and gallons of it stashed away by mischievous traders in their storage areas, merely so that they could create an artificial crisis and make some money off the oil-less public. While we heaved a sigh of relief at being able to go back to our oil-soaked begun bhaja and greasy Mughlai porota, other food scares continued.\nThere was the wheat scare and the rice scare, both of which seem to have been tackled by the authorities for the time being. Now it's the dollar scare, which brings us back to the food scare. It's a vicious cycle.\nAll this negativity makes one's head spin. Thankfully, there were some positive developments to distract us from the mildly important issue of how to deal with the escalating food prices. There was the much-publicised capture of PK Halder, the great con artist, and the fascinating plots and subplots of how he, as the top official of a bank, managed to embezzle thousands of crores of taka as loans and launder them to various countries, buying luxurious mansions in Canada, Europe and India, and finally his dramatic capture in India. One has to give credit to this Einstein of a man for being able to distract people from the shrinking food basket. Now there's a candidate for a Bangladeshi remake of \"Catch Me if You Can\" (Dhorte Parle Dhor). Move aside, DiCaprio.\nAnother piece of good and breaking news is that the government has decided to abandon the ambitious \"palm tree project\" launched in 2017 to trap lightning, which killed at least 336 people last year. It seems someone had an epiphany that palm trees take time to grow and a natural phenomenon like lightning will not wait around for these natural buffers to become adults. Genius.\nSo, now we have a brand new, Tk-950-crore project to build shelter homes and very cool, techy lightning arresters in the lightning-prone areas of 15 districts. Now now, don't raise your eyebrows, please\u2014Tk 950 crore is peanuts compared to the thousands of crores \"redirected\" by PK Halder and Co from Bangladesh to foreign lands. In fact, if we can recover at least some of the PK stash, it would go a long way in funding the extra cost of numerous delayed projects. It could be called the PK Halder Redemption Fund, with many more such funds to follow as more and more of such innovative artistes of deception are unveiled.\nTalking about projects, the goals of which are a little fuzzy, let's take the four ongoing projects to address the perennial waterlogging in Chattogram, worth Tk 11,000 crore, and how some of them were initiated without some minor homework\u2014trivia such as having project proposals, feasibility studies, seeing whether the designs were correct or if they complied with the city master plans. According to a news report, one such project, for instance, was worth Tk 5,617 crore in 2017 and supposed to have been finished by 2020, but then was extended to 2022. But by April 2022, only 65 percent of the work had been completed, pushing the project deadline to 2023 with an increase in total cost of either Tk 9,526 crore or Tk 10,420 crore, depending on which government body's estimate is taken. It's no big deal\u2014around a Tk 1,000 crore difference, give or take.\nDelays in projects are a rule rather than an exception, which is why even a three-kilometre canal could not be built in the last seven years because of complications with acquiring the land. This is the city, one will remember, where mayors have gleefully said during elections that they would solve all the waterlogging problems of Chattogram (even during the time when it was called Chittagong). While these megaprojects are being delayed, Chittagonians, or rather Chattogramians, have the pleasure of getting floods in areas where there was no waterlogging before, thanks to temporary dams in the canals as part of the project to mitigate waterlogging! For those who enjoy living a bit dangerously, Chattogram has also become a city where, at any given time, one may literally disappear into an open drain or canal.\nBut seriously, we must applaud our government for restricting all \"unnecessary\" foreign trips of the employees in government or semi-government institutions in a bid to save some taxpayers' money during these hard times created by the pandemic, the Ukraine war, taka devaluation and because of the general apprehension that things will get worse before they get better. Hopefully, this will mean a curb on trips (complimentary of Biman) with a battalion of officials and their family members to Toronto to celebrate Independence Day.\n\u00a0\nAasha Mehreen Amin is joint editor at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "\"Oh, I know we've come a long way\nWe're changing day to day\nBut tell me, where do the children play?\"\u00a0\n\u2013 Cat Stevens\nSince the pandemic began and schools were shut down, my sole worry was my niece's well-being. Will she become isolated? Will she be able to remain physically fit? Could she go into depression?\nI could never imagine myself being cooped up in my home for two whole years from ages six to eight. I could never imagine any child, as a matter of fact, in that situation. Until Covid came and I had to witness it first-hand.\nNo, it was not her education I was worried about\u2014it was her health, both mental and physical.\nWhile there were online classes, tutors and home-schooling, no matter how much we tried, as working adults, it was difficult for everyone in the house to ensure she wasn't missing out on \"playtime.\"\nThe moment schools reopened, despite financial distress, we readmitted her to a reputed English medium school in the city.\nA week in, I asked her how she was liking her new school and how much she got to play with her new friends.\nTo my utter shock, her response was, \"We have a playground but we are not allowed to use it unless it's during games class.\"\nI began asking other guardians and parents about their children's schools and the responses were ridiculous, to say the least.\n\"My son's school doesn't even have a playground. The children run around and play in the underground parking area.\"\n\"My child's school has a playground, but it's only a small area with a swing.\"\n\"My nephew's school does not allow them to play during breaks.\"\nBarely a month ago, parents and children across the city stood with the residents of Kalabagan to save the Tentultala playground from the hands of police authorities, who were building a station on the field.\nThe fight and the consequent win reminded us all about the importance of play areas and physical activities for the development of children.\nThe children who fought alongside the grown-ups, too, began cherishing their playground more than they had done before.\nBut are we supposed to rely only on these few fields?\nI always thought of school as the second place, after the home, to not just ensure a child's mental and physical well-being, but to also encourage it by any means possible. But why are they not doing so?\nOut of genuine concern, I began doing some research to know whether my niece's school was doing enough for her.\nFirst, I learnt how \"playtime\" helps a child by improving their attention and decreasing stress and anxiety (and yes, contrary to popular belief, children also feel these emotions, and our education system does not help). It also helps motivate children to try new things and make more friends.\nIn a biological sense, playtime promotes the growth of new brain cells, which in turn helps them absorb and remember new information. Meaning, if your child plays more, they can learn more.\nBut does one \"games class\" a week ensure enough play?\nAD Pellegrini, a retired psychology professor of the University of Minnesota, and RM Holmes, a psychology professor at Monmouth University, conducted research on the importance of recess. According to their study, titled \"The Role of Recess in Primary Schools,\" games classes, i.e. physical education classes, do not provide a child with the same benefits as recess or breaks, during which they can play.\nThat's because these classes are much too structured and rely on rules made and imposed by adults (teachers).\nFor children to reap the benefits, playtime must be \"playful,\" without a structure or directions from adults\u2014and recess is more suited to serve this purpose.\nSome children may want to play \"ice and water\" or \"hopscotch,\" instead of running PE class races or playing basketball.\nChildren consider recess or break times as a small window of time during which they can breathe while coping with the heavy pressure of school education nowadays (my second-grader niece seems to be learning things about Julius Caesar that I even don't know of).\nThat small window seems to be slowly diminishing in many school systems, not just in our country but across the globe, according to the research.\nResearchers also suspect that this is because society and its adult actors see this as a way to \"get tough on education,\" provide more \"academic time\" for students, and improve their academic performance.\nThe lack of playtime, coupled with the intense pressure to excel in class, is weighing down the tender shoulders of our future generation.\nI think it's time we really asked ourselves what we wanted our next generation to be: Free-spirited, playful, active, and intelligent children? Or robots churning out A+s and GPA-5s?\n\u00a0\nNaziba Basher\u00a0is a sub-editor at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Global food prices are soaring. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Price Index\u2014which covers a basket of basic food commodities (cereals, meat, dairy, vegetable oils, and sugar)\u2014reached an all-time high of 159.7 in March, up from 141.1 the previous month. While it declined slightly in April, to 158.5, ongoing developments\u2014not least Russia's war in Ukraine\u2014are set to keep driving prices to new highs, with devastating implications for global hunger.\nThe Covid pandemic exposed the fragility and dysfunctionality of the world's food systems, with movement restrictions and supply chain disruptions driving up prices, damaging rural livelihoods, and exacerbating food insecurity, especially for the poor. Now, the war in Ukraine is compounding these challenges, because both sides are major exporters of food, fuel, and fertiliser. Moreover, climate change poses an even larger threat to global food security. Already, extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and prolonged droughts has triggered shocks to agricultural production and food availability. As temperatures rise, these shocks will become increasingly frequent and powerful. If global warming crosses the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold (relative to Earth's pre-industrial temperature), they are likely to become catastrophic.\nAs the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows, avoiding the threshold will require immediate and drastic action. But mitigation is only part of the challenge. Large-scale investments in adaptation will also be needed to protect vulnerable communities from the warming that is already locked in.\nEven under the most optimistic mitigation scenario, global warming is expected to hit the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold in a decade, before receding. This will result in shifts in climatic zones, rising sea levels, and disruptions to the water cycle that increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather. Beyond raising economic and health risks, the resulting disruptions to food and water supplies are likely to drive social and political upheaval, fuelling a vicious cycle of poverty, hunger, instability, and even conflict, accompanied by a sharp rise in migration.\nA more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food system must be a pillar of any climate mitigation or adaptation agenda. But the barriers to building such a system should not be underestimated, especially for countries and regions where soil is poor, land has little agricultural value, natural resources such as water are limited or degraded, and socioeconomic conditions are difficult.\nGiven the low productivity of their agricultural land, such marginal environments are unable to support the sustainable production of sufficient food to meet local people's nutritional needs. In fact, while marginal environments are home to less than 25 percent of the global population\u2014an estimated 1.7 billion people\u2014they account for 70 percent of the world's poor and most of its malnourished.\nPoverty and hunger can lead farmers to overuse fragile environmental resources in order to ensure their short-term survival, even at the cost of long-term depletion of their lands and impoverishment of their households and communities. Those living in remote areas with minimal infrastructure, few alternative economic opportunities, and limited market access are particularly likely to make such choices.\nGiven this, countries with significant marginal lands rely on food imports\u2014in some cases for more than 80 percent of their needs. But pandemic- and war-related disruptions, together with the price increases they have fuelled, have shown just how vulnerable such countries are. According to the FAO's State of Food and Agriculture 2021 report, an additional 161 million people were affected by hunger in 2020, compared with 2019. And the World Food Programme is now cautioning that the combination of conflict, Covid, the climate crisis, and rising costs has pushed 44 million people in 38 countries to the edge of famine.\nWith countries struggling to secure enough food to meet their populations' nutritional needs, many are now re-evaluating their food dependencies and seeking to expand local production. But unless sustainability is taken into account, efforts to increase short-term resilience by shortening supply chains could undermine medium- and long-term resilience by further depleting agricultural resources like soil and water.\nSustainability isn't cheap. Efficient production amid biophysical and climate constraints requires investment in costly technologies. But poor governance structures, limited growth prospects, and high debts pose major challenges for many countries. The pandemic has placed massive strain on public budgets, and debt crises loom for many governments, as loans taken out to address the pandemic come due.\nPoor and vulnerable countries cannot be expected to address the myriad interconnected challenges they face\u2014from pollution and biodiversity loss to hunger and poverty\u2014without help. To bolster long-term food and nutritional security, we must look beyond country-level solutions to regional and international ones that consider the needs of communities living in marginal environments. Otherwise, there will be no escaping destabilising cycles of hunger, migration, and violence.\n\u00a0\nSeta Tutundjian\u00a0is a member of the High-Level Expert Group to assess the need for the International Platform for Food Systems Science and a co-leader of the global Food is Never Waste initiative.\n",

As the Russia-Ukraine war drags on and continues to push up prices, world leaders believe the situation can improve only with the conclusion of the war. Bangladesh, as a developing nation, has already felt the heat from the global market, with the people struggling with skyrocketing prices of essentials.\nAddressing the situation, the UN secretary-general pointed to the reality that shortages of grains and fertilisers happened because of some perceivable factors, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, rising temperatures, and pandemic-driven supply problems. He expressed caution that, unless effective steps were taken now, tens of millions of people would face severe food insecurity. He stressed that without goodwill on all sides involved in the war, an amicable solution would be hard to reach.\nIt can be noted that taking cognisance of the worsening food situation, the World Bank has announced an additional USD 12 billion in funding to stave off the \"devastating effects\" of a prolonged food crisis, which might lead to mass-scale malnutrition, mass hunger and famine in many of the countries where food shortage is already a pervasive phenomenon. Reports show that in many of the far-flung areas, people live in semi-starvation almost half the year. A prolonged food crisis would put the lives of these marginalised people in total jeopardy. Experts fear if the depleting food stocks are not replenished soon, it would push the vulnerable communities towards the edge of famine.\nTogether, Russia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat. But the Ukraine invasion and subsequent economic sanctions on Russia have disrupted supplies of fertilisers, wheat and other commodities, thereby causing global prices of food and fuel to go up phenomenally. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports\u201412 percent of the planet's wheat, 15 percent of its corn and half of its sunflower oil. To handle the rising inflation, many countries are now opting for austerity measures to stabilise their economies. Bangladesh, too, is doing what it can to offset the effects.\nWe urge the world leaders to urgently find a solution to counter the threats and effects of a prolonged food crisis.\n",

This is an alarming statistic by any measure, and deserves the highest degree of attention from the authorities and guardians.\nChildren, either accompanied or on their own, have to go out just like anyone, but don't have the experience or wisdom of adults to escape the many traps laid out on our roads and highways, which make Bangladesh such a risky country for travelling. Not that the adults are doing much better, with the number of road crashes and casualties rising every year, but children are especially vulnerable in such situations and deserve proper care. This is more so in rural areas, where traffic rules are seldom followed. As per the figures compiled by the Road Safety Foundation, 889 children were killed on rural roads, which is 53.10 percent of total deaths in the time period surveyed. At least 287 children were killed on national highways, and 328 on regional highways. And unsurprisingly, 731 children\u2014or 43.66 percent of all victims\u2014got killed on their way to or from their educational institutions.\nIt's perhaps no surprise that road accidents, according to Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum, remain one of the main causes for unnatural deaths of children in the country. If you dig deeper, the red flags begin to emerge. True, as passengers of vehicles, children are as likely to suffer as any victim of road crashes. But they are at a greater risk of being hit or run over by vehicles while jaywalking. Many of the children who died were drivers or helpers of the vehicles that crashed, or were either riders or pillions on motorcycles. All these are illegal and potentially life-threatening activities, and as a society we have failed to ensure an environment in which children will not be bound to work or undertake risky endeavours.\nThis is why awareness is so important. We urge the authorities to strictly enforce traffic laws so that underage drivers of any vehicle are not allowed on our roads and highways. Parents and school authorities also have a big responsibility in minimising the risks for children. We also need child-friendly roads and transports. Most importantly, awareness campaigns should be run especially in rural areas so that all, including the children, are aware of the challenges associated with travelling.\n",
