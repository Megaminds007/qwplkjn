        "full_article": "Amidst fast-deteriorating ties between India and Bangladesh, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri\u2019s one-day visit to Dhaka provided a much-needed outreach to the interim government led by Professor Muhammad Yunus. The bilateral, and once model, relationship, with Bangladesh, has been unravelling ever since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India. These include India\u2019s concerns over attacks on minorities, particularly Hindus, Bangladesh\u2019s anger over \u2018unwanted Indian interference\u2019, and Ms. Hasina\u2019s continued stay in India as Bangladesh calls for her to stand trial over charges of police crackdowns and corruption. In particular, protests in India against Bangladesh\u2019s arrest of a Hindu monk for sedition, which led to an attack on their mission in Tripura, and marches against Indian missions and cultural centre in Dhaka, had fuelled anger in both capitals. After talks with Mr. Yunus, Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain and Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Muhammad Jashim Uddin, Mr. Misri stressed New Delhi\u2019s \u201cdesire to work closely with the Interim Government of Bangladesh\u201d, which was well-received. Unlike the shrill rhetoric in Delhi, his measured comments acknowledged the concerns of both sides over the \u201cregrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties\u201d. Mr. Yunus is understood to have described the relationship between Bangladesh and India as \u201cvery solid\u201d and \u201cclose\u201d, asking India to help \u201cclear the clouds\u201d. He also said that Ms. Hasina\u2019s statements were creating \u201ctensions\u201d in Bangladesh, an issue that India must consider carefully. The two sides also picked up the threads of previous talks on border management, trade and connectivity, cooperation in water, energy sectors, development cooperation, consular, cultural and people-to-people ties.Given the largely positive optics of the visit, it would appear that there is an attempt to chart a new course in ties. While it is important for New Delhi to nudge its friends on issues of concern such as the attacks on minorities, as well as the need to restore a democratic and inclusive process at the earliest, the Modi government must also be prepared to hear the worries of its friends and neighbours on such issues that have a spillover effect in the region. At a time when changes in governments in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have thrown up challenges to India, the violent change in Bangladesh, that saw the ouster of an India-friendly leader, was no doubt a blow. It is time, however, for India to engage with the new realities in Bangladesh, based on a strong understanding that a close, consultative partnership is in the enduring interests of both countries.

        "full_article": "The Draft UGC (Minimum Standards of Instruction for the Grant of Undergraduate Degree and Postgraduate Degree) Regulations, 2024 propose significant changes to India\u2019s higher education landscape. These include bi-annual admissions to undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses, enabling students from any stream to pursue any discipline in UG and PG if they pass a relevant national qualifying examination, and allowing for the extension or acceleration of courses. Students can pursue multiple degrees simultaneously. Higher educational institutions will have the autonomy to determine student attendance requirements. According to the UGC Chairman, M. Jagadesh Kumar, these changes will remove rigidity, ensuring that global standards are met. While the intent is laudable, one provision further centralises examinations as a qualifying criterion, which may limit flexibility. The draft rules align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises hybrid learning models and skill-based education. The draft rules also support the implementation of the National Credit Framework, providing students greater academic flexibility.However, while the goals of these reforms are clear, the question is whether there are resources to implement such sweeping changes. Hurdles exist as systemic issues such as insufficient faculty strength, underfunded institutions, and a lack of adequately trained or motivated teachers. Moreover, the regulatory framework, such as on class strength requirements, governing affiliated colleges where a majority of the students study, is ill-equipped to support these new rules that may be implemented more easily in autonomous institutions. Since education is on the concurrent list, State governments often show initial compliance with new regulations only to backtrack. The inertia within academic bodies and administrative procedures further complicates the effective adoption of changes such as the \u2018academic bank of credits\u2019. This initiative allows students to register at one institution, take courses from another, and complete apprenticeships in a company, with the degree being awarded by the first institution. While such flexibility is groundbreaking, it faces considerable resistance from traditional academic structures. Moreover, the success of these reforms hinges on a substantial increase in investment in education. Unfortunately, this year\u2019s Budget allocates 15% less funding to higher education compared to the previous year\u2019s revised estimates. While the draft UGC rules offer a promising vision, their success will depend on addressing existing systemic challenges and ensuring that there are adequate resources in place.

        "full_article": "An MLA who turned out to be a foreign citizen is such a perfect Indian story\nGerman citizen Chennamaneni Ramesh is a shoo-in for the history books. Ramesh won assembly elections four times from Vemulawada \u2013 twice in undivided Andhra, and twice in new state Telangana between 2009 and 2023. Ramesh had relinquished his passport in 2003 when he turned German, re-applied and got a passport in 2008. Ever since this son-of-the-soil, nephew of a former Maharashtra governor, with reportedly a PhD from Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University, won on a TDP ticket in 2009, his citizenship issue has been in and out of GOI corridors, Andhra & Telangana HCs, and SC \u2013 until HC finally junked his Indian citizenship this week. Andhra HC in 2009 stayed GOI\u2019s notice to Ramesh alleging fraud in his citizenship status. By 2013, HC declared Ramesh wasn\u2019t an Indian citizen. But election officials clearly knew better \u2013 he was allowed to contest as a BRS candidate in 2014 and 2019. In 2020, Ramesh, with a heavy heart undoubtedly, had \u2018offered\u2019 to give up his German citizenship, but remained MLA. Denied an assembly nomination in 2023, KCR made him an adviser with cabinet rank.\nThe matter should be taken in all seriousness. But we\u2019re cracking up at the sheer absurdity of a German shepherding a constituency for 16 years while his dubious Indian citizenship was an open secret. Had Ramesh turned out to be a citizen of say China or Pakistan or Bangladesh, all hell would have broken loose. But a West European? We can live with that. Ramesh pulled off this farce for over a decade and held a constitutional post by banking on the Chalta Hai trilogy Satyajit Ray never made: The Great Indian Documents Maze, The Great Indian ID Hack & The Great Indian \u2018Adjustment\u2019. End of day, it\u2019s schadenfreude for incumbent Vemulawada MLA, Aadi Srinivas, who hauled the not-Indian-perhaps-German Ramesh to court, and also lost to him in four consecutive elections.\n\n",

        "full_article": "America\u2019s health insurance is broken, India\u2019s is not on solid ground. But answer isn\u2019t vigilante justice\nBrian Thompson\u2019s killing shook corporate America last week. He was CEO of America\u2019s biggest private health insurer, and because his shooter had engraved \u2018deny\u2019, \u2018defend\u2019 and \u2018depose\u2019 on shell casings, the attack seemed motivated by rage against industry malpractices. It\u2019s known that insurers use delay-deny-defend as a tactic to maximise profits and returns to shareholders, never mind suffering customers. Now that Luigi Mangione \u2013 26-year-old wealthy, Ivy-schooled computer scientist and admirer of \u2018Unabomber\u2019 Ted Kaczynski\u2019s manifesto against industrial society \u2013 has been detained for Thompson\u2019s murder, the retribution theory might be true. But killing industry leaders cannot be the answer to corporate shenanigans. As Gandhi said after the killing of a British Raj cop boss John Saunders: \u201cWhat requires mending is not men but the system.\u201d\nInsurance industry certainly has its flaws, in America as well as India. In a three-page handwritten \u2018manifesto\u2019 police found on him, Mangione says: \u201cthese parasites had it coming\u201d. A parasite is an organism that weakens its host to grow stronger and multiply. After Thompson\u2019s killing, social media witnessed an outpouring of pent-up anger and complaints from people who felt cheated by health insurers. CNN reported that most US adults with health insurance had faced at least one issue, including denial of claims within a year. People wrote about how their insurer had refused to pay for a surgery days before it was scheduled. One doctor said the problem was health insurers believing their job is to make money, not paying for healthcare. Many commentators have noted that Thompson did not get the sympathy he deserved. United\u2019s own Facebook post about his death got 57,000 laughing emojis in response.\nIndia has had its share of insurance malpractices. High-margin Ulips sold as great investments via banks made news in the noughties. Despite reprimands, the bank-insurance nexus continues. On the health front, a large survey of policyholders this summer showed 43% had faced rejection or partial approval in their hour of need. Insurers often reject claims by terming ailments as pre-existing conditions. Lack of transparency in policies is another major issue. The opposite of a parasitic model is a symbiotic or mutually beneficial one in which insurers make profits without ripping off buyers. It wasn\u2019t Thompson\u2019s fault that America\u2019s health insurance model was short-changing its intended beneficiaries. He was just executing his brief. What did his \u2018execution\u2019 achieve?\n\n",

They can go find another sucker!\u201d\nTough talk. But are Americans tough enough to isolate themselves economically from the rest of the world?\nAmerica lives far beyond its means, and has done so ever since the end of World War II when USD replaced the British pound to become the currency of international commerce.\nThis has entitled US to behave like a greedy brat let loose in a sweet shop with unlimited credit to dispose of and engage in an orgy of gluttony.\nThe US economy is based almost exclusively on services; America makes hardly any material goods. But with only 5% of the Earth\u2019s population US consumes 25% of the planet\u2019s resources.\nIn 2022 Americans bought 13.6mn cars, 40mn TV sets, and 124mn smartphones. Almost all these products were imported from China, Korea, Japan, or elsewhere.\nAmerica can afford such extravagance simply by printing more US dollars which the world has to buy to do global business. But if, as Trump has threatened, US imposes 100% import duty on countries that try to \u2018dedollarise\u2019 their trade, a $500 TV set in America would overnight cost $1,000, a $10,000 car become $20,000, with the extra cost passed on to the consumer.\nCan pampered American consumers learn to cut costs by living frugally, or will they remain prodigal spenders, creating hyper-inflation and undermining the dollar?

        "full_article": "The first high-level talks between Bangladesh and India should be seen both as a recognition of the challenges straining our bilateral relationship and as a welcome attempt to recalibrate it in light of the new reality following Bangladesh's political changeover four months ago. During his daylong visit to Dhaka on Monday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held separate discussions with Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain, as well as his Bangladeshi counterpart Md Jashim Uddin.

Currently, we are facing a war of disinformation that is geared towards tarnishing our historic secular character, to depict us a nation of Islamic extremists, and to present us as a failed nation of anarchy and chaos without any rule of law.
