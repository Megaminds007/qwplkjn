Long-pending issues regarding regional autonomy exist around a demand for carving out a State in the eastern region, but Nagaland appears to have achieved a typical equilibrium that hinges on transactional politics. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its regional partner, the Nationalist Democratic People\u2019s Party (NDPP), are continuing with their 2018 seat-sharing formula: contesting 20 and 40 seats, respectively. The Opposition Naga People\u2019s Front (NPF) joined the NDPP-BJP government in August 2021 in a \u2018united push\u2019 to solve the vexed \u201cIndo-Naga political issue\u201d, a euphemism for the final settlement with extremist groups, primarily the NSCN (Isak-Muivah). Voters, parties and other groups appear to be at peace with the Opposition-devoid arrangement of politics. Of the NPF\u2019s 25 MLAs, 21 merged with the NDPP in April 2022, but most were denied a ticket; one moved over to the BJP to become one of its 20 candidates. The Congress, decimated in 2018, has 24 candidates while the once-formidable NPF has named 22 candidates.Demand for a Frontier Nagaland State remains an issue despite the withdrawal of a poll boycott call by the organisation fighting for it, across six districts in the eastern part of the State encompassing 20 constituencies. The most talked about issue, as in the past elections since 2003, is the peace process with extremist groups. Political ideology has a limited role in Nagaland, and elections are usually fought around personalities and their capacity to project proximity towards the ruling establishment in Delhi. Electoral calculations by groups are made around central funds, which form the foundation of the State\u2019s rent-driven political economy. The BJP-NDPP alliance had characterised 2018 as an \u2018election for solution\u2019 to the autonomy question. The Centre signed the Framework Agreement with the NSCN (I-M) in August 2015 and the Agreed Position with the Naga National Political Groups (a federation of seven outfits that have joined the talks), in November 2017 \u2014 towards resolving the insurgency, but soon ran into a stalemate over a separate Naga flag and Naga constitution. The extremists have demanded a political settlement before polling, accusing the BJP of betraying Naga trust. The new government will have its hands full.",

With the four-month period fixed by the Supreme Court in November last year set to lapse soon for those who were in service as on September 1, 2014 to exercise the option, his observation that the Court\u2019s directions, which have \u201clegal, financial, actuarial and logistical implications\u201d, are under examination, has not been reassuring. The issue of allowing higher pension \u2014 pension proposed in the event of employers making 12% mandatory PF contributions on employees\u2019 actual pay that exceeds the statutory ceiling \u2014 has been bothering the PF establishment almost from the start. Adopting actuarial principles for ensuring long-term financial viability, the Pension Scheme is funded by the transfer of 8.33 percentage points out of the 12% PF contributions by employers coupled with the central government\u2019s contribution of 1.16% of the monthly wages that do not go beyond \u20b915,000. Opposition to the higher pension is around the projected actuarial deficit in the valuation of PF, lower returns on investments and increasing pensioner longevity. The EPFO top brass feels that higher pension may deplete the resource base in no time. The PF establishment has every reason to feel concerned but what has not helped its case is the proviso \u2014 paragraph 11 (3) of the pre-amended rules of the EPS \u2014 allowing for such requests to be entertained.\rEven in September 2014, when the proviso was removed and amendments made to the EPS\u2019s rules, the concept of higher pension was not abolished. Instead, the amendments provided 12 months for employees and employers to exercise the joint option. This is why sections of pensioners are justified in their demand for higher pension, as their employers had, during their service period, made contributions on their actual pay which had exceeded the statutory ceiling. But, the authorities, while providing an online option for pre-2014 retirees to exercise the option, have sought to mirror the conditions in Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (a battle for higher pension that began over 15 years ago). Such an approach goes against the spirit of the Court\u2019s 2022 judgment, which was based on the 2016 verdict of the Court, as the two judgments are for eligible pensioners to reap the benefit. What has added injury to insult is the EPFO\u2019s circular (January) re-opening the cases of higher pension after 2016, and initiating recovery proceedings. The government and the EPFO must explain to the stakeholders the genuine difficulties in implementing the Court\u2019s directions. Bureaucratic shortsightedness and compliance difficulties around simplistic legal directives have raised hopes as well as triggered anxieties among pensioners and those nearing retirement.",

Election manifestos of most political parties overlap significantly in terms of welfare promises. Any idea that resonates in one state is quickly emulated elsewhere. But very few ideas travel well across states or even between the Centre and states. There are two structural reasons for this.\nGovernments are overstretched in terms of their welfare agenda. For example, GoI\u2019s budget contained 780 schemes classified as centrally sponsored and central sector schemes. It\u2019s impossible for either the political executive or bureaucracy to devote adequate attention to all of them. Therefore, when schemes such as Swachh Bharat or Ujjwala or Aawas Yojana do well, it really comes down to the prioritisation of the political executive. The entire system reacts to the signals sent from the top. To take another example, Tamil Nadu\u2019s Amma Canteens are the most successful attempt at providing cost-effective meals. Started by the J Jayalalithaa government in Chennai in January 2013, they were rolled out to 160 municipal areas in just 21 months. These canteens were even certified under FSSAI.\nRegional parties also seem to fare better in delivery of handpicked schemes. Telangana was the pioneer of the investment support to farmers with the Rythu Bandhu scheme, which now offers an annual Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers. In Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government used the idea to expand its coverage to even landless agricultural households to engage in allied activities such as goat rearing with the Kalia scheme. A grab-bag of welfare promises is hardly enough to win over a savvy electorate. It\u2019s about latching on to a couple of big ideas and getting the governance structure to respond.\n\n",

The decision was taken citing the worsening condition of Afghan women and girls since Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. In fact, Sweden too had announced a similar policy in December.\nTrue, large sections of the Afghan population as a whole are facing dire circumstances. There is acute hunger and the local economy is in tatters. But Afghan women are doubly discriminated. Taliban have barred them from high school and university education, banned them from working in government offices, local and international NGOs, and put serious restrictions on their movement. These are major violations of basic human rights. And GoI too has expressed concerns about these developments.\nIndia had introduced the \u2018e-Emergency X-Misc Visa\u2019 after the fall of Kabul, for which an estimated 60,000 Afghans had applied in 2021.

        "full_article": "In a democracy, it is important for a political party to tolerate and respect other parties. When we see that the ruling Awami League lacks such qualities, it becomes evident that Bangladesh's oldest political party is going through a critical phase. One might wonder why I am saying \"critical\" when the party has been in power for the third consecutive term.\nWhen the BNP started holding divisional rallies protesting against the hike in prices of fuel and daily essentials, the murder of its leaders, and demanding the release of Khaleda Zia, the party received a warm response at the grassroots level. Then, the ruling party showed up with counter programmes. Consequently, tensions intensified, verging on panic. Although ruling party leaders claimed that the BNP took to the streets with the intention of committing arson and violence, the rallies were found to be largely peaceful. The ruling party's apprehension, however, could not be brushed aside because of the BNP's role in widespread violence and arson preceding the 2014 elections, for which it was roundly criticised at home and abroad. But this time, the BNP seemed desperate to shake off that stigma by holding peaceful rallies.\nUnfortunately, whenever the BNP announced a programme, the AL countered it with their own. Announcing counter programmes on the same day as the BNP, and often at a venue close to the BNP's, raises the possibility of tension at best and outright violence at worst. The phenomenon remains commonplace till date.\nAlthough the BNP repeatedly asked the Awami League not to announce counter programmes, the ruling party did not listen. But when Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader requested the BNP to withdraw its mass procession scheduled on December 24 in Dhaka, the BNP did defer it to December 30. Where are such good gestures from the ruling party?\nAwami League and its leading front organisations said they announced the counter programmes for the sake of public safety and to resist the \"terror and anarchy of BNP.\" One wonders, if the ruling party men must take to the streets to ensure public safety, what is the role of the government, administration, or law enforcement agencies?\nSuch statements from party leaders not only go against the rule of law but also betray a lack of confidence in the very government they currently run. Does the ruling party think that responsible wings of the government are not capable of ensuring public safety or reining in the BNP (should it turn violent)?\nHolding rallies and processions is a constitutional right of a political party. But countering a political event with another, and thus potentially impinging on it, is not. The ruling party can take to the streets with its own political programmes. But when it announces counter programmes, what it demonstrates is nothing short of political bankruptcy.\nThe party has been in office for around 14 years now and has done substantial development work which has benefited the people. As such, it should be confident about itself. But a knee-jerk reaction in the form of counter-programmes in response to street mobilisations by the opposition is hardly demonstrative of any confidence it may have.\nSo why does the ruling party still feel compelled to employ such tactics? There could be several reasons. First, the ruling party takes to the streets to send the message that the opposition will never enjoy a walkover. Second, the counter programme announcements boost the morale of the party's rank and file, which is perhaps necessary at AL's grassroots, as BNP rallies themselves have been hugely successful in that respect. Third, and most dangerous, is that they believe a counter-programme would be an effective tool to obstruct and hinder the BNP's programme. Whenever two major political parties announce programmes on the same day and in nearby areas, it creates panic among the people, and leads to more suffering on the streets. Inconveniencing the people in this manner should be unacceptable, but the ruling party pays little heed to such \"trivialities.\"\nAs the next general election is just a year away, we know that the political parties will take to the streets more often and campaign harder to get their respective messages across. The ruling party will beat its drums, harping on its development activities. The opposition will campaign against the misrule and misdeeds of the AL-led government.\nSo far, it must be admitted, the BNP has acted mostly maturely. We expect that the party that has been in office for 14 years will learn to reciprocate. If the AL fails to do so, it will be the one to pay the price. Today's voters are more politically conscious and unlikely to repeat past mistakes come elections.\nThe ruling Awami League appears to be in a bind. Neither does it have the confidence to be gracious to an all but annihilated opposition camp that refuses to collapse, nor can it be confident of a recurrence of either of the previous two elections (held in 2014 and 2018).\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n\n",

It came as a warning that insufficient response from the state is as much responsible for this as reckless conduct by private citizens and entities.\nThe two reports that were printed shed light into the predicaments of a canal and a bird sanctuary. The first, Karikapara canal,\u00a0a 3-kilometre-long stretch of water running through the Khulna city, is on the verge of extinction due to pollution and encroachment. Every day, untreated waste water from a number of wards flows directly into it, while household and industrial garbage is also dumped there, choking the life out of it. This has been causing all sorts of problems both for the aquatic species and residents and farmers of the area. Meanwhile, unchecked encroachment has seen structures illegally built along its banks, narrowing it down to a point that it can no longer be used as a route to transport agricultural produce.\nThe canal is one of 47 flowing through Khulna city and adjacent areas. The city corporation, which has 31 of them under its jurisdiction, apparently has a list of 460 grabbers and 382 structures built on 26 canals. The question is, why is it sitting on that list? Why was nothing done to protect these canals? Grabbers are usually influential people, which partly explains why eviction drives are so infrequently conducted, or so unsuccessful, in the country. Other state initiatives to protect or revive waterbodies have also been found similarly lacking.\nThe second report of the day also paints a sad picture of official interventions. It's about a waterbody in Nilphamari known as Nilsagar, once a favourite place for migratory birds. Things changed after 1999 when a project was taken up to develop it into a bird sanctuary, which instead had the opposite effect. Reportedly, as part of the project, century-old indigenous trees were replaced by foreign varieties that neither grow big enough to provide shelter for birds nor produce food for them. As a result, Nilsagar started to attract fewer birds. This shows how insufficient or inappropriate action can lead to disastrous consequences, which natural resources in Bangladesh are no stranger to.\nThe continued assault on such resources \u2013 rivers, canals, hills, hillocks, forests, green spaces, agricultural land, etc. \u2013 has been a recurrent theme in Bangladesh's development narrative. Over the last decade or so, we have seen how the triple whammy of pollution, encroachment and bad policy/governance led to indiscriminate destruction and degradation of nature. Numerous warning flags have been raised and ignored, both in equal measure. This is deeply alarming. There is only one way to go following this path: down.\nThis must change. We urge the government to take a long, hard look at the gap between its environmental commitments and actions/inactions. It must recommit to creating an atmosphere in which all \u2013 individuals and institutions \u2013 are aware of the impacts of their decisions and held equally accountable for their failures or transgressions.\n",

        "full_article": "Throughout my career, I have seen many examples of triumph against the odds \u2013 extraordinary accomplishments that often begin with a small group of individuals seeking to solve a problem. In the best cases, local communities, government, and the private sector align and invest in programmes and policies that create more opportunities for these groups to flourish.\nThe extraordinary success of women's self-help groups in India represents one of the best-case outcomes. Established by women determined to build a brighter future for themselves and their families, these groups have thrived thanks to innovative financial and infrastructure support from the Indian government. With over 80 million women participating in 7.5 million such groups, India is fostering the world's largest community development programme, which is now a key component of the country's economy.\nWomen, especially in rural areas, face gender-based barriers to participating fully in their communities and building a livelihood. Many are unable to open a bank account or access credit and are dependant on informal loans from relatives, friends, or money lenders. Moreover, traditional family structures and social norms may constrain women from engaging in activities necessary to start or expand a small business.\nSelf-help groups were first formed in the mid-1980s to address these barriers by providing access to savings and credit so that women could earn a livelihood and lift themselves and their families out of poverty. The results speak for themselves: women's self-help groups have contributed to India's extraordinarily sharp reduction in poverty, from 55.1 percent to 16.4 percent (415 million people), over the last 15 years.\nInitially, new groups were dependant on members, though often impoverished, pooling what little money they had to get started. The Indian government stepped in to alleviate this hardship by providing unsecured loans without the need for a formal, registered business entity. Importantly, these loans are offered at a very competitive interest rate of 12 percent, which drops to seven percent if a group repays its loans within 30 days of the due date. With this support, the average self-help group was able to borrow around INR 200,000 (USD 2,500) each, and in 2021 the limit for collateral-free loans was increased from USD 10,000 to USD 25,000.\nOver the past decade, more than USD 60 billion has been made available to self-help groups in India and, cumulatively, women in these groups have saved an estimated USD 6 billion. Access to low-interest loans continues to help an increasing number of women create sustainable sources of income, accumulate assets and savings, and build financial security. And individual group members are building more than their financial skills; they are also raising their self-confidence and influence within the community.\nFor example, a self-help group in Chak Singar Barari village in Bihar state was able to structure their enterprise so that each member is sent home with INR 3,000-4,000 per month. And each woman has her own story. Sunila Devi enrolled her children in private schools, Chitrekha Devi is working toward a bachelor's degree, and Pushpa Devi has started her own ambitious business renting mobile sound systems, which allows her to employ others.\nNow multiply those stories by millions, and you can begin to grasp the full effects of these groups. As each woman contributes more to the household income, she gains more say in household decisions. And collectively, they show what is possible when one of the most essential challenges to gender equality \u2013 increasing women's economic power \u2013 is addressed.\nUltimately, we know that increasing a woman's economic power bolsters her personal agency and empowers her to play a greater role in her family and in her community. India's government-supported self-help groups demonstrate the transformative effects of policy initiatives that are designed to meet the needs of marginalised women. The task now is to replicate this success.\nThe goals should be clear: to make credit accessible and affordable, build women's financial skills and credit history, and strengthen their financial security. And the various players must be resolute in their support. The closer you look at the details of the self-help groups in India, the more you see the dedication it took from all stakeholders to bring together the people, resources, and tools needed to succeed at this scale. Government agencies at both the federal and state levels were involved, along with banks and other financial institutions, researchers, and an extensive network of non-government and voluntary organisation partners working at the grassroots level in communities across India.\nThis formula of determination, collaboration, and political will can be applied to other stubborn barriers to gender equality. One of the more persistent challenges I hear from women, most recently during a visit to Dakar, Senegal, is that entrepreneurs also need business development services, skills-building, and access to markets and value chains. India's programme shows that this is feasible: Currently, about 20 percent of self-help group members have these additional supports, and efforts are underway to promote women-owned cooperatives and businesses.\nEveryone deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life. My resolution for this year is to remain inspired by the determined efforts of individuals and by our collective capacity \u2013 as India's self-help groups' remarkable success have demonstrated \u2013 to innovate as we strive for a healthier, happier, more equitable world.\nAnita Zaidi\u00a0is president of the Gender Equality Division at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\u00a0\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2023.\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

This is definitely a triumph, albeit minor, for freedom of expression in the country, at a time of increasing censorship and muzzling of dissenting voices. However, it is still concerning that the court ordered the publishing house not to sell or exhibit three specific books to which the Academy had originally objected. It is particularly confusing as a press release signed by the Deputy Director of the public relations sub-division of Bangla Academy stated that the publication was barred from having a stall on the grounds of only one of their books containing \"political obscenity\".\u00a0\nThe court also issued a rule asking Bangla Academy and the government to explain why the academy's decision not to allow Adarsha Prokashoni to run its stall in Boi Mela should not be declared illegal. We would also respectfully urge the court to consider on what grounds the books were found \"obscene\" in the first place and whether such censorship goes against our constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. Bangla Academy, we are saddened to note, has thus far failed to provide a consistent or convincing answer for its decision to bar Adarsha.\nWhile the three books in question may contain criticisms and narratives that challenge dominant discourses with which one may not agree, we believe the answer lies in counter-criticisms and debates, not in bans and censorship. It is important for the health of a democracy to allow diversity of views and creative freedom(s), but we have noticed with increasing alarm how that space has shrunk over the past decade, leaving little to no room for divergent thoughts. From arrests under increasingly stringent digital laws, to attacks on writers, journalists and bloggers, to films getting stuck at the censor board, creativity and critical thought are now essentially under siege.\u00a0\nThis incident, even if it is somewhat resolved, has contributed to the growing culture of fear and censorship that has left our media and intelligentsia crippled. New publishers will think twice before publishing content that may be critical of the dominant narrative in any way, while writers will find themselves having to navigate an even more tricky terrain of censorship simply to get published. It is all the more alarming that such censorship should take place in the month of February and at the Boi Mela, which for Bangladeshis signify the Language Movement and freedom of speech and expression.\u00a0\nWe have noted with increasing apprehension the politicisation of the Bangla Academy, particularly with the enactment of the Bangla Academy Act 2013 which allows the government to nominate more members to the executive committee compared to those nominated by the general assembly and fellows of the academy. We hope there will be no arbitrary bans on books and publication houses from the Boi Mela in the future, and that, moving forward, the Bangla Academy will uphold the true spirit of the Language Movement.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's recent experience with e-commerce has shown the latter's great potential. The usefulness of e-commerce became more evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. The enforced lockdowns for prolonged periods of time propelled the emergence of multiple e-commerce (e-com) sites and some of those have become household names. Today, people in the country are used to using e-com sites to purchase daily needs from groceries to acquiring fashion goods, electronics and a host of other products and services. The hectic lives of urban citizens in the country, coupled with endless hours of traffic congestion have provided the prefect ground for both consumers and sellers - to do transactions electronically (where payment is also made electronically using debit/credit cards or mobile financial services like Bkash, Nagad, etc.). Some e-com sites couldn't scale up and handle the increased volume of trade, but many did and flourished. However, fraudulent activities by a few e-commerce sites have dented the consumers' confidence.It is sad to see that Bangladesh e-com sites are not being able to go international and take advantage of the huge cross-border e-com market', (CBEC). The hurdles are not insurmountable. A study conducted by the Dubai chamber of Commerce tells us that \"the value of UAE e-commerce market is expected to reach US$9.2 billion in 2026.\" That is not all. Market information states that the two countries, Singapore and Malaysia together account for more than half the cross-border gross merchandise value (GMV) in Southeast Asia. The lesser, next tier markets include Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. Hence, this is a massive e-commerce market that needs to be tapped by Bangladeshi companies. As artificial barriers to cross-border electronic trade are coming down, it is time for the right policy guidelines be set up so that local companies can take part in the trade and flourish. Although, it is learnt that the draft CBEC policy is being finalised, concerns have been raised by stakeholders about the efficacy of it, given the non-favourable stance of the foreign exchange policy.There exist differences of opinion between the ministry of commerce and the association of e-commerce entrepreneurs about roadblocks that are holding back the CBEC. These need to be addressed because there is no point in being left out of an annual multi-billion dollar global market where Bangladeshi e-com enterprises and entrepreneurs may take part and earn revenues. It must be remembered that overwhelming reliance on apparel export in an uncertain global economic climate could prove to be a serious Achilles heel for the country. It is time to rethink barriers and changing long-held ideas on foreign exchange, if it can kick-start new areas of business. That monetary policy has failed to create a dent in foreign exchange outflow shows the inefficacy of some policies that would do well with amendments so that formal trade, like CBEC, may flourish. Hence the present e-commerce policy needs to be rethought with the draft CBEC policy accommodating all stakeholders' opinions. There will always be pushback against letting relevant stakeholders have a say in what should or should not be included in policy. But in the event of not recognising legitimate concerns of entrepreneurs involved in the trade threatens to not address the problems the e-commerce association have put forward. Government policy must be in tune with the needs of those individuals and/or entities involved in e-com.",

        "full_article": "No respite will be there from high inflation in the near future. It is the core message of the latest annual report of Bangladesh Bank. The central bank released the annual report for fiscal year 2021-22 last month, around seven months after the end of the past fiscal year. The release of the report was preceded by the formal announcement of half-yearly monetary policy statement (MPS). The MPS for the last half of the current fiscal year (FY23) largely concentrated on fighting against a persistent increase in inflation. The annual report further highlighted the risk of persistent inflation in the near future.Usually, the annual report presents an analytical review of the country's economic activities of the past fiscal year, or the year the report is prepared for, with extensive focus on the banking sector. It also contains the overview of activities and annual financial statements of Bangladesh Bank and provides a series of updated statistics on economy. The latest 350-page report continues on the usual structure. So it is not difficult for anyone familiar with the annual flagship publication of the central bank to find the desired things in the report.It is the near-and medium-term outlook for Bangladesh economy that economists, businessmen, analysts and journalists want to know first once they have the report in hand. The outlook sub-section under the 'macroeconomic performance and prospect' section is brief. There are two more relevant sub-sections available in the next two sections. One is 'sectoral growth outlook', another is 'near-term inflation outlook.' These sub-sections of the report provide projections on the economic growth, potential drivers of growth, and possible inflation situation by the end of the ongoing fiscal year.As Bangladesh Bank is used to making its analyses and projections quite cautiously, it may be sometimes difficult to comprehend the actual meanings and messages of the statements. An 'intentional ambiguity' in the texts is there due to conservative approach to public communication of the central bank. This may also be misleading to some extent, which is not desirable. Nevertheless, what is derived from the near-and medium-term outlook is that the country's economy would likely stay in the post-Covid recovery path. At the same time, external factors like higher global commodity and energy prices are set to cast shadow on growth momentum. The protracted Russia-Ukraine war is considered main source of trouble and uncertainty in the global economy, and Bangladesh also cannot escape its fallout. So, growth rate is likely to come down.Several internal factors may also undermine the growth prospect in the current fiscal year, argues the central bank annual report. These include recent flood in the north and northeastern regions of the country which \"may be harmful to crops, livestock, fisheries, and infrastructures.\" Moreover, \"low power supply and fuel price hike in the recent months may also have some negative consequences on the cost of production, import costs and GDP growth.\"The central bank, however, underscored some internal factors as growth drivers in the current fiscal year as well as future. It said that the Padma Bridge opened a new economic gateway between southwestern districts and the rest of the country. \"The economic activities in the southwestern part of the country have already been significantly stimulated and are expected to further gear up in the coming months, especially after the launch of ongoing rail-connectivity project through the Padma Bridge,\" the report added. It also observed that the economic growth \"will come back to its normal path by successful implementation of stimulus packages taken by the government and Bangladesh Bank.\" Various policy measures, including expansion of the mobile financial services and agent banking and the opening of sub-branches in the remote areas, and creation of sufficient loanable funds will contribute to growth.Not that the economy is going to face a sharp decline in growth rate in the current fiscal year. What is obvious is modest fall in economic growth. Initially the government set a target to achieve 7.50-percent growth in the FY23. Now, it has been revised down to 6.50 per cent. The final estimate of GDP for FY22, released by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in the last week, showed that the economy posted 7.10-percent growth in the past fiscal year which was 6.96 per cent in FY21. Now, it will again come down below 7.0 per cent in the current fiscal year.With lower rate of GDP growth, the economy is set to be hit hard by higher rate of inflation now. The government's primary target was to keep 5.60-percent general inflation ceiling in the current fiscal year. But since the beginning of the year, inflation has been on upward curve, causing sufferings to lower-and fixed-income people. In January, the average rate of inflation reached 7.92 per cent. Monthly rate, however, slightly declined to 8.57 per cent in the last month which was 8.71 per cent in December and 8.85 per cent in November.The annual report of Bangladesh Bank acknowledged that containing inflation at tolerable levels along with maintaining stability of exchange rate will be a critical challenge. It, however, linked the inflation outlook in the coming months with four factors. These are: spillover of price from supply-demand mismatch, Russia-Ukraine war, volatility of exchange rate and commodity price hike on the global market. It also stressed both monetary and fiscal measures to contain the inflationary pressure in the coming days.These cautionary notes on price situation also indicate that the central bank has to extend its fight against the inflation with all its tools and limitations. It thus calls for government's all-out effort to moderate the surge in prices. Slight drop in the monthly inflation rate should not be the matter of complacency.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Every time a killer earthquake strikes any place outside the country, the general people of Bangladesh begin reviewing the pros and cons of the possibility of such a calamity. Following the recent 7.8 magnitude temblor that jolted a large tract in Turkey and Syria, a seemingly fraught mood has started creeping into the psyche of many. The sizeable segment comprises seismologists, among others. In line with this, many might remember that in the period 1988-2013 several small-scale tremors shook a few districts of the country repeatedly. Seismologists said the minor quakes would lead up to a catastrophic one. During those small eruptions, the collisions between the Indian tectonic plate and the Burmese one failed to release their trapped energy. In fact, this has been occurring since the time 800 to 1000 years ago.In areas of Bangladesh, energy trapped in-between the vacuum of plates has the tendency to blow out. Thanks to geological reasons it has yet to occur. According to geo-science, the great energy blowout is poised to occur any time in the form of a disastrous earthquake. The educated classes in society with a scientific bent of mind believe that a massive earthquake is in the way of Bangladesh. This is where they stop thinking further; at least until another massive earthquake hits a territory in the Asian region. Although there are graphic pictures of what a post-earthquake landscape of Dhaka would be, in fact few take it seriously. That an earthquake with 5+ on the Richter scale could spawn great devastations eludes many. Seismologists believe an 8.2 magnitude temblor cannot be ruled out for Dhaka. If that does occur, parts of the city might turn into sheer heaps of concrete rubble. The enormity of the deaths and injuries would be appalling.The city planners of Dhaka haven't failed to emphasise the drawbacks of the country's capital. The first of those comes in the form of poor planning of the city. It is being made worse by overpopulation, unplanned constructions and poor road network. When an earthquake strikes, it behaves without discrimination. To some extent natural disasters are a great leveller, earthquake being one of them. Yet humans have a great role in mitigating sufferings. Proper city planning, in other words the detailed area plan, can deal with many deficiencies. If they are not under the scanner of higher and relevant authorities on time, Dhaka mess-up will aggravate the earthquake impacts.In an overpopulated city with narrow neighbourhood roads and alleyways, conducting rescue operations may turn out to be a massive challenge. It's the rural area-based and spacious human settlements in Turkey which fell under the wrath of the recent earthquake. The irony is in spite of this spacious landscape the Turkish village people couldn't escape the quake's multiple impacts. In the late 1980s Dhaka had put lots of stress on earthquake drills and mock rescue operations. Unfortunately, those eventually fizzled out. The reason could be a wrong notion that Dhaka is out of the path of earthquakes. According to experts, Dhaka and some other districts are very much within the range of temblors. Given the earthquakes being overdue for long in the country, a tiny shake-up could see a devastating aftermath.Dhaka's fear arises from a number of factors. Two of them are its high density of population, and the lack of logistics needed for rescue operations. Therescue gears' necessity cannot be felt in times of frequent natural disasters like storms or floods. But they are badly needed after the strike of catastrophic tornados and nor'westers leading to the collapse of weak buildings and other structures. Although the earthquake-focused rescue tools might not be needed at the moment, given the disaster's unpredictability the tools' necessity may arise any time, be it day or night. Massive earthquake energies may lurk beneath tectonic plates for long, and may strike any place in their full force.[email\u00a0protected]",

The women footballers continued their supremacy at the age-level tournaments in South Asia. They won another championship by beating Nepal in the under-20 final on Thursday in Dhaka. Bangladesh's team was unbeaten in the game and finally clinched a 3-0 victory. After winning the under-15 in 2017, under-18 in 2018, and under-19 in 2021 this is another championship for the current senior SAFF Champions. It was only in September last year when Bangladesh beat Nepal in the final of that tournament by 3-1 in Kathmandu.Dedicated efforts brought a series of successes. Bangladeshi girls have also proved their devotion. Despite limited resources and incentives, these girls have become a great source of inspiration for the whole country. Credit goes to coach, Golam Rabbani and the assistant coaches. Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) also deserves appreciation.Nevertheless, more budget and greater facilities are needed to continue the success. The successes of Shamsunnahar, Shahida Akter, Aklima Khatun and Rupna Chakma will attract many potential young talents to join the team in the near future. Therefore, BFF needs to work in a planned way.Arman ArkoNarayanganj[email\u00a0protected]",
