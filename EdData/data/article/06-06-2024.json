        "full_article": "After 24 years and three months in power in Odisha, outgoing Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik will finally pass the baton to a new Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. The performance of the Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the Assembly elections was not poor \u2014 a 40.22% vote share, that was marginally ahead of the BJP\u2019s 40.07%. But the BJP was able to win in more constituencies, getting 78 of the 147 seats as against the BJD\u2019s 51. The BJD\u2019s performance in the simultaneously held Lok Sabha polls was slightly worse \u2014 its vote share dipped by 2.76 points to 37.46% while the BJP\u2019s increased to 45.41%, by a whopping 5.34 points. Clearly, a section of BJD voters preferred the BJP for the Lok Sabha despite voting for the incumbent in the Assembly elections. The BJP mustered a strong vote share across geographical regions, besting the BJD even in its rural strongholds, while enhancing its already substantial urban vote shares. The BJD\u2019s relatively poor performance, compared to the 2019 Assembly elections, when it won 44.7% of the votes, must be attributed to Mr. Patnaik\u2019s diminishing appeal. The party had assiduously built its popularity on the basis of welfare measures, including targeted schemes in the largely agrarian State. Mr. Patnaik garnered much of the credit for these schemes and each electoral victory over the years deepened his support base. The BJP emphasised Mr. Patnaik\u2019s alleged frail health and attacked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the former bureaucrat-turned politician V.K. Pandian and his Tamil roots. The insularity of this campaign notwithstanding, the question of Mr. Patnaik\u2019s succession was deftly used by the BJP to sow doubts in the BJD\u2019s base. A number of defections from the BJD to the BJP over the years also helped the BJP seize the initiative. That prior to the elections, both parties had engaged in parleys to contest as an alliance and the BJP later broke off the talks suggest that the BJP had an inkling that it stood a better chance fighting the BJD. The BJD\u2019s policy of endorsing most of the BJP-led government\u2019s measures, including controversial ones, and to play the role of a friendly party that was not part of the NDA backfired, just as it did with the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh. These parties along with the Bharat Rashtra Samiti in an earlier period and the Bahujan Samaj Party, allowed themselves to be used as buffers by the BJP in the expectation that the BJP would help them stave off their rivals in their States. But these stances only affected them in the long run as they allowed the BJP to pick up support and leaders who defected from their ranks. The BJD\u2019s loss of power and the rapid decline of the YSRCP and BRS offer a cautionary tale about these parties\u2019 ploy of equivocation. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nOrissa\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nBiju Janata Dal\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi\n\n/\n\nBahujan Samaj Party\n\n/\n\nYuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party",

        "full_article": "The African National Congress (ANC), South Africa\u2019s ruling party that led the country out of apartheid three decades ago, suffered a setback in the May 29 general election when it lost its majority in Parliament for the first time. In the final results on Sunday, the ANC, currently led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, saw a dramatic fall in its vote share to 40.18%, from 57% in 2019, while the main opposition Democratic Alliance emerged as the second largest party with 21.81% vote. The surprise was the surge of the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), a left-wing party founded in December and led by Jacob Zuma, the scandal-ridden former President, which secured 14.58% of the votes. The far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, former ANC Youth League leader, came fourth with 9.52% vote. The ANC\u2019s decline itself was not surprising, from the peak of its popularity in 2004, when it won nearly 70% vote. A whopping 17 percentage point drop in vote share points to the rapid erosion of confidence the electorate has in the party which was once led by Nelson Mandela. When Mr. Ramaphosa became President in 2018, after Mr. Zuma was forced to resign, he promised economic stability, employment and modernisation of infrastructure. But under six years of his rule, there has been little progress in addressing the critical problems of Africa\u2019s most advanced economy, which has shrunk over the past two and a half years. Officially, at 32%, the country has one of the highest unemployment rates. Voters also complain about a lack of quality water supply, hours-long power blackouts and rampant violent crimes. After three decades of ANC rule, nearly two-thirds of Black South Africans are living in poverty, as compared to 1% of white South Africans. The ANC knew voters were upset, and Mr. Ramaphosa sought votes in the name of the party\u2019s legacy rather than its performance. But voters did not buy into his arguments. The ANC breakaway parties winning more votes than the right-wing Democratic Alliance suggests that the legacy of anti-apartheid politics remains strong, despite the ANC\u2019s decline. The three opposition parties have shown an interest in coalition talks, but with riders. The MK will join hands with the ANC only if Mr. Ramaphosa steps aside and the EFF has a radical economic agenda, including expropriation of land. A tie-up with the Democratic Alliance, which is largely seen as a representative of the apartheid era, would not be popular with the ANC\u2019s base. Mr. Ramaphosa is in an unenviable position. The era of the ANC\u2019s dominance is over. He should form a coalition that would not mar the party\u2019s anti-apartheid legacy and keeps it in good stead so that it can focus on resolving the country\u2019s myriad economic woes.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nSouth Africa\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\npoverty\n\n/\n\nwater\n\n/\n\ncrime\n\n/\n\nunemployment",

The most striking change that we saw this time around was the organic appearance of an independent ecosystem of voices.\n\nDhruv Rathee perhaps single-handedly acted as the spearhead of the opposition\u2019s communication efforts, without being formally aligned with any party. That he managed to garner between 35-40m views for some of his videos is a sign of the tremendous impact he had on voters.\nIn a peculiar reversal of sorts, the decreasing credibility of all institutions, in particular media, has led to a search for non-institutional voices. There was a time when we looked for institutional certification in order to believe in something; now it seems to be the opposite.

Only on two previous occasions has Congress\u2019s seat share increased by over 40 seats (1991 and 2009).\nThe second is the jump in vote share by about 3 percentage points even though the party contested 93 fewer seats this time. At 328, it was also the only time it contested on fewer than 400 constituencies.

        "full_article": "Over the last decade, there were perhaps few surprises as heartwarming to observers of India's democratic journey as the ones from its latest Lok Sabha election. The Indian election authorities rightly deserve kudos for successfully conducting the world's\u2014and history's\u2014largest democratic exercise that, over six weeks, saw 64.2 crore people vote, including a record 31.2 crore women. This in itself is a watershed moment that needs to be celebrated. The staggered election has also thrown up some big surprises, especially the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) failure to secure an outright majority for the first time since sweeping to power in 2014, as well as the rise of a strong parliamentary opposition.\nThe relative peace and enthusiasm that marked the election serve as a lesson for countries like Bangladesh where violence and poor voter turnout have become synonymous with the electoral exercise. It stands as a testament to people's power, and also the fact that a fair election\u00a0is\u00a0possible despite sharp ideological divides among the contesting parties. The election results, from that perspective, can be seen as a rejection of attempts to sully India's rich secular legacy. We have seen how the Hindutva and anti-immigrant rhetoric was used, especially by BJP, to rally voters behind its re-election campaign. While PM Modi is set to return to power for a rare third consecutive term, one hopes for the sake of ordinary Indians and the region at large that such divisive rhetoric will come to an end.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of all\u2014and one that we can particularly relate to\u2014is the resurgence of the Congress-led opposition alliance, INDIA, which secured 232 seats against BJP-led NDA's 293, as per latest counts. It is a defeat that feels more like a victory considering the last decade, as some observers said. We cannot deny the significance of a strong opposition in democracy. A strong parliamentary opposition ensures checks and balances, preventing any single party or leader from holding excessive power. By scrutinising government actions and policies, it holds the government accountable to the public. Without a robust opposition, democracy can become stagnant, unresponsive, and vulnerable to authoritarianism.\nThe Indian experience thus offers a lesson for Bangladesh where the lack of such an opposition has been acutely felt for long. Equally instructive has been the rebalancing of powers among coalition partners\u2014with the BJP having to rely on allies it hardly needed before\u2014which can also provide stability and a check not just in parliamentary affairs but also coalition politics.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe drama over the Indian election may not be over yet, as speculations over the formation of the next coalition government continue. As a neighbour and friend, it is our hope that Indian voters' desire to see a pro-people, pluralistic polity will be honoured regardless of what the next government looks like. We also hope that the two countries can continue on a path of mutual respect and growth in the coming days. As for those involved in Bangladesh's politics and electoral exercise, they can certainly take a leaf or two out of the Indian book.\n",

        "full_article": "The possibility that the government may offer financial criminals a special facility to \"whiten\" their black money with just a flat 15 percent tax and full amnesty has raised concerns not just among the country's economists and civil society but also the common people. And rightfully so, for the honest breadwinners have to pay an income tax at 25 percent at the highest slab. Adding VAT and other indirect taxes that ordinary taxpayers are required to pay, this plan of whitening black money\u2014which, unfortunately, is not a new phenomenon in Bangladesh\u2014is ill-judged and unjust at the very least.\nThe Income Tax Act, 2023 allows legalising illegally amassed money by paying a mere 25 percent tax and a 10 percent fine on the tax amount. This time around, however, what's raising eyebrows is the nature of the special offer: no questions asked, just a 15 percent tax, and illegally earned money becomes legal.\nSome may argue that bringing black money back into circulation would be good for our economy's health. But at what cost? It is a no-brainer that allowing such impunity to black money hoarders will encourage the practice further, and discourage honest taxpayers from paying their taxes compliantly. The maths is simple: it is a 50 percent saving on taxes if one simply turns their legitimately earned income into undisclosed money and then whiten it\u2014no strings attached and no repercussion involved.\nIt has been suggested that such an unconditional scheme to legalise black money is required, as the last time such a facility was offered in FY2020-21, a record Tk 20,600 crore was legalised\u2014enabling the National Board of Revenue (NBR) to collect Tk 2,064 crore in taxes\u2014by about 12,000 individuals, including government employees, doctors, businesspersons, and bank sponsor directors, among others. But once this scheme was lifted, in the subsequent years, fewer people availed the offered options for whitening black money.\nDoes this mean that the facility anticipated to be offered again would reduce the tax collection pressure on the NBR and inject more money into the economy? Not necessarily. We must remember that due to the travel and communication restrictions during the Covid pandemic, which essentially limited the hundi channels, people had little option but to keep their dirty money home, hence many availed the golden opportunity. The context in 2020-21 was different from that in 2024-25, and expecting to generate the same response from dirty money owners based on a general clemency and a flat tax rate might be a folly.\n\nWhile unbridled inflation is feared to have pushed around five lakh people into extreme poverty, the salaried individuals are also bearing its brunt. A recent media report quoted leading economist Dr Ahsan H Mansur as saying that out of every Tk 100 earned by a salaried individual, they can only take about Tk 35 home after considering all tax deductions, including VAT and other advance taxes. Hence, reimposing the 30 percent tax on the population with a minimum income of Tk 16 lakh per year would be a biting blow for them, the simple reason being inflation.\nInterestingly, in this budget, the government is also planning to raise the highest tax slab back to 30 percent. While some may argue that such an increase is just and the right thing to do, we need to take a closer look at a few data points to understand how this would impact the salaried individuals.\nAs per the current slab, an individual with an annual income of Tk 3.5-4.5 lakh has to pay income tax at five percent. In the second slab, individuals with an income up to Tk 7.5 lakh need to pay income tax at 10 percent. An annual income up to Tk 11.5 lakh requires payment of 15 percent income tax. Those earning up to Tk 16.5 lakh have to pay 20 percent income tax. Anyone earning more than Tk 16.5 lakh per year has to pay 25 percent of their income as income tax.\nAt a time when food inflation stands at 10.22 percent (as of April 2024), income growth is falling behind inflation, the taka has depreciated against the US dollar by around 36 percent (since January 2022), utility bills are rising, and health spending has surged by over 202 percent, this tax regime is a staggering burden.\nSome may argue that in India, the tax-free income is up to 300,000 rupees per year, and the highest tax slab is 30 percent for an annual income of 15 lakh rupees and above. If we compare our tax regime with India's, we should also factor in the inflation rates in both countries: in Bangladesh it is 9.74 percent (April 2024), while in India it is 4.83 percent.\nWhile unbridled inflation is feared to have pushed around five lakh people into extreme poverty, the salaried individuals are also bearing its brunt. A recent media report quoted leading economist Dr Ahsan H Mansur as saying that out of every Tk 100 earned by a salaried individual, they can only take about Tk 35 home after considering all tax deductions, including VAT and other advance taxes. Hence, reimposing the 30 percent tax on the population with a minimum income of Tk 16 lakh per year would be a biting blow for them, the simple reason being inflation. In 2014, when the 30 percent tax was slapped on this slab, the inflation rate was 7.35 percent. When the same was reduced to 25 percent in 2020, the inflation rate was 5.65 percent.\nBack in 2020, Leave Fare Assistance (LFA) and income from Workers Profit Participation Fund (WPPF) were tax-free as long as they were within Tk 50,000. Both are now taxable, reducing further the disposal income of salaried individuals who fall in the 25 percent bracket. There are about 89,290 taxpayers who fall in this tax category, according to BBS. How is it just to tax someone earning Tk 16.5 lakh and someone earning, say, Tk 1 crore in the same slab?\nIf one assumes that the government is considering raising the tax slab back to 30 percent to ensure social equity and fair taxation, it should consider two points. First, it should expand the range for each slab and reduce the tax burden on each of these slabs, expanding the tax-free limit to up to Tk 5 lakh, so that the middle-class taxpayers can meet their basic necessities with dignity.\nSecondly, the government should further break the current highest tax slab into several brackets and impose a super tax\u2014a tax in addition to a normal tax, upon an annual income above a certain amount\u2014on the rich and wealthy. The concept of super tax is gaining popularity globally as a tool to ensure social justice and could get the NBR the much-needed extra tax that it needs to extract from the right people.\nInstead of taking the easy way out and burdening the already struggling segment of the taxpaying population, it is vital that the government look for a way to efficiently utilise the tax money it collects every year. A study by the Policy Research Institute (PRI) of Bangladesh reveals that a whopping 43 percent of taxpayers' money is spent on salaries, pensions and other benefits for government officials.\nAt the same time, the government must focus on containing the rampant corruption that enables the shameless plundering of taxpayers' money through various projects.\nIt is understandable that the government needs money to pay off its debts and meet its expenses, but allowing wholesale legalising of dirty money and taxing people further are not the solutions to this problem. Our policymakers must come out of this tendency to take shortcuts and figure out how we can sustainably steer our growth aspirations forward.\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Defying predictions of pundits proffered for almost a year, opinion polls of the past months and exit polls over the past six weeks, the opposition alliance INDIA has done so well that the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fallen short of a clear majority, although the incumbent alliance NDA is holding on to more than 272 seats to form a government. The results and trend are evident that no single party has been able to secure a majority. As Modi's return to power for a third consecutive term breaks a record set six decades ago, it is also a return to a coalition era after a decade. In the previous two elections in 2014 and 2019, BJP had enough seats to form the government alone.\nThe conventional wisdom is that alliances are formed to be together to go to and stay in power. The NDA is no exception; the members of the alliance have remained together since 1998 and have been in power on several occasions since. In the past decade, despite BJP's enormous support among voters, its extraordinary mobilisation capacity, and the rise of Narendra Modi, NDA remained a key element in Indian politics. Since the poll results started to come in, what became a matter of speculation is whether some alliance members will ditch the NDA and join the opposition. In India, as elsewhere, that's not without precedence. Alliances, especially when a government's survival is dependent on it, tend to be more fragile. Horse-trading has been part and parcel of Indian politics; besides, as the BJP seems to have done poorly and voters have expressed a dismay regarding its politics, it is not out of the realm of possibility that some parties will try their fortune elsewhere. Two parties are being watched closely at the time of the writing of this commentary: Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh led by Chandrababu Naidu, and Janata Dal United of Bihar led by Nitish Kumar. While publicly the leaders have reaffirmed their allegiance to the NDA, politics is a game of unpredictability; tomorrow is another day.\nIf the opposition alliance INDIA can cobble together 272 seats, a coalition of disparate parties will end up in power. Press reports suggest that the alliance leaders are reaching out to parties who can only be described as \"strange bedfellows.\" While it is speculation, or in some ways wishful thinking, such a scenario will be deja vu\u2014a return to the 1990s. India witnessed a tumultuous time between May 1996 and October 1999 when coalition governments came and left in quick succession. The period is referred to as \"the era of fragile coalition.\" In the context of a long history of stable Indian democracy, the instability during the 1990s was seen as deeply concerning. This period ended with the emergence of the BJP as a dominant party. It offered stability but over the past decade, such stability only contributed to serious democratic erosion and deep entrenchment of authoritarianism. It produced a leader who claimed that he had been chosen by God. It is in this context that if India returns to the 1990s' pluralistic political instability, that will be progress. Indeed, it sounds outlandish to suggest that going backwards is progress, but in the battle against authoritarianism, returning to a flawed democracy is a step forward. The election has created an opportunity.\nSpeculations aside, the unanticipated better results of the alliance INDIA has a message insofar as reversal of autocratisation around the world. In a democratic society, each political party has its own ideology, vision, strategy, and tactics; they compete, but when the democracy itself is at stake, they might have to compromise and build a wall of resistance. Waiting for a perfect solution to the democracy crisis and the emergence of a democratic force free of stains of past deeds will not only help authoritarianism to sustain, but will increasingly make citizens depoliticise. The Congress-led alliance INDIA is not an ideology-driven cohesive alliance. Some of the differences among these parties are significant; the past of some parties is chequered, to say the least. The partners of the alliance INDIA set their eyes on a goal: to stop autocratisation by offering an alternative to Modi's divisive policies.\n\nIf the opposition alliance INDIA can cobble together 272 seats, a coalition of disparate parties will end up in power. Press reports suggest that the alliance leaders are reaching out to parties who can only be described as \"strange bedfellows.\" While it is speculation, or in some ways wishful thinking, such a scenario will be deja vu\u2014a return to the 1990s. India witnessed a tumultuous time between May 1996 and October 1999 when coalition governments came and left in quick succession. The period is referred to as \"the era of fragile coalition.\" In the context of a long history of stable Indian democracy, the instability during the 1990s was seen as deeply concerning.\nWhile the alliance has not succeeded in winning the majority, it has emerged as a roadblock to the politics of divisiveness and hate. Faizabad's result is telling in this regard. The place, which became the symbol of BJP and ilk's rise due to the demolition of the mosque and the pompous inauguration of the Ram Mandir in January, has now delivered a defeat to the BJP. As for the alliance INDIA, bringing the parties together was a difficult task, holding each other together through the election was harder, but keeping the alliance intact in the coming days to fight for democracy will be the hardest.\nThe numbers of the final election results will be dissected in many ways. A more nuanced picture will emerge, and analysts and political scientists will try to explain the messages from Indian citizens. In the meantime, it is evident that a strong opposition in the parliament has emerged, and voters have expressed their desire to see a pluralistic polity in India, a past that defined the Indian polity and made it worthwhile to call the country \"the largest democracy of the world.\"\nAli Riaz\u00a0is distinguished professor of political science at Illinois State University, US and a non-resident senior fellow of the Atlantic Council.

        "full_article": "That inflation has galloped once again at the beginning of the second quarter of the current year bodes ill of the country. In the past month, it registered a record high in seven months. The inflation soared to 9.89 per cent in May from 9.74 in April last. On point-to-point basis, the jump was 0.65 percentage point from 9.24 per cent this month a year ago. This is indeed a cause for concern. Perhaps more concerning is the higher inflation in rural areas where it has hit the double digit at exactly 10 per cent as against 9.72 per cent in cities and towns. Still more unsettling is the fact that the overall inflation has been spurred by costlier foods both in rural and urban areas. Even a drop in non-food inflation by 0.15 percentage point has paled before the aggressive rise in food prices. Thus villages and urban centres had to grapple with food inflation at 10.73 and 10.86 respectively. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics paints a bleak picture for the country, no doubt. But reading between the lines what emerges as a highly disconcerting development is the factors responsible for triggering the rural inflation higher than that in the urban locations. The factors obviously concern non-food items which are pricier in rural areas than in urban centres. Transportation costs of such items may be one of the reasons for their higher prices in villages. But there are other reasons such as illegal tolls during their transportation. Although this happens on both ways, the fact is that most industries are located in urban areas or in their vicinities. Naturally such items are more outbound. In villages, the majority of population can at least manage the staple for several months if not for the entire year. May arrives immediately after Boro harvest and this explains lower food inflation in villages. In the lean months, many of their fortune is likely to run out. But for the urban poor, there is no respite from the inflation blight. True, the global food market has started growing jittery after registering a steady fall in prices. In 2023, according to the World Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), prices of food commodity fell by 13.7 per cent after it reached the record high in October 2022. However, there was no reflection of this price fall in Bangladesh's CPI. Accusing fingers are pointed at unholy business coteries which manipulate the market to their advantage. But there are middlemen who also take a big slice of the ill-gotten cake. The hideous nexus has turned the country into a breeding ground of corruption that sucks into it people in power and high position. It is hardly surprising if men of ex-IGP Benazir's ilk have proliferated to help advance the nexus's dubious cause instead of common people's interests. Sure enough, monetary policy cannot fight such corruption, nor even the fiscal policy. Although there is enough scope for bringing about improvement on both fronts, the focus ought to be directed sharply to the unholy nexus of business syndicates, middlemen and a section of political and administrative elements. If the shady collaboration among the culprits can be tamed, inflation can also be managed better if not controlled fully.",

        "full_article": "In his book \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,\" noted American economic historian Chris Miller, argues, \"Microchips are the new oil. This vital and precious resource has an even more profound impact on people's lives than oil\". In the book, which has been named the Financial Times Best Business Book of 2022, he says microchips are \"the most complex piece of machinery ever assembled by humans, and there is no other item with a greater influence on globalization and international politics.\"To put it simply, the microchip, also known as an integrated circuit (IC), is a small piece of silicon that contains a complex network of electronic circuits. These chips are fundamental building blocks of modern electronic devices for a vast array of functionalities. Their demand is currently exceeding all initial expectations. From guiding complex missiles to heating your morning coffee, microchips are the hidden heroes behind everything from smartphones and televisions to the refrigerators and washing machines that keep our modern lives running smoothly. What's intriguing is their capability to manage numerous tasks, including processing, memory, storage, logic control, digital communication, sensing and detection, and power management. As technological progress marches forward, semiconductors are poised to become even more integral to the majority of devices used by humans in the future.The global semiconductor market is a trillion-dollar powerhouse in the making, surging at 20 per cent annually. It is no surprise tthat a fierce global race is on. Tech giants like the US, China, South Korea, and Japan are pouring billions into securing their slice of the pie by increasing domestic chip production. Fueled by the US-China tech war and potential disruptions in Taiwan, the race for semiconductor dominance has become a top global priority.In the USA, the Biden administration's recent allocation for the semiconductor industry includes a $39-billion investment to help companies build more factories and boost domestic production. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act, which provides federal funding, loan guarantees, grants, tax credits, and other support for domestic chip-making investments. Responding to these government incentives, Intel, the American multinational corporation, unveiled its plans to spend $100 billion in four U.S. states to build and expand semiconductor factories.Meanwhile, China is also redoubling its efforts to dominate advanced technologies of the future by setting up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund. Beijing's latest investment, a staggering $47.5 billion, is allocated to semiconductor R&D and manufacturing. Seeking a foothold in this vital industry, India is also accelerating its efforts to become a global hub for semiconductor manufacturing. The Indian government's Semicon India Program, approved by the Union Cabinet, plans to invest approximately $10 billion in developing a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem. This initiative focuses on chip design and display fabrication, aiming to position India as a \"premier global location for electronic design and manufacturing.\"Amidst this global race of big powers, recent hype about Bangladesh's 'huge potential' in the semiconductor industry is intriguing. Projections suggest that Bangladesh could earn $10 billion from semiconductor manufacturing by 2041 with proper policy support. Bangladesh is a new kid on the block, currently earning around $5 million a year through providing microchip design services. Local companies, however, have not yet ventured into the more advanced stages of chip development, such as fabrication, packaging, assembly, and testing.Experts believe that a skilled workforce shortage is the primary hurdle Bangladesh must overcome to become a serious player in the semiconductor industry and capitalise on its enormous potential. Despite an annual output of approximately 25,000 graduates in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and relevant courses offered by some universities and technology institutes, fresh graduates reportedly lack the technical knowhow required by the industry. Their academic knowledge of semiconductors seems inadequate for professional application, hindering companies' expansion plans.To cultivate a high-end talent pool for specific roles in the semiconductor industry, experts advocate for a well-coordinated effort between private sector companies, academia, and the government. This strategic partnership requires investment in education and training programmes focused on chip design, microfabrication, and other critical areas. Collaboration with established global technology partners can further strengthen these programmes by incorporating best practices used in leading semiconductor nations. Universities and institutes should introduce relevant subjects like VLSI design, microelectronics, and nanotechnology into their curriculum, equipping students with a comprehensive understanding of IC design, production, packaging, and fabrication from an early stage. In addition, comprehensive and practical training programmes for engineering graduates, potentially through internships or joint research initiatives, can empower them to become competent professionals and address the industry's specific needs.Looking at international examples, Bangladesh can take a leaf out of China's book. China has strategically shifted its educational focus to produce skilled human resources for the semiconductor industry. This involves establishing dedicated integrated circuit schools within universities, and offering specialised degree programmes in fields like semiconductors, chips, and integrated circuits. These programmes foster a pipeline of highly skilled professionals and emphasise the development of top-level research talent, potentially culminating in master's and PhD degrees. Bangladesh could benefit from adopting a similar approach, focusing on developing a comprehensive educational infrastructure to cultivate talent in this critical and highly profitable sector. Furthermore, to accelerate the growth of its semiconductor industry, Bangladesh could consider engaging in bilateral dialogues and workshops with experts from leading producers like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. This knowledge transfer would be crucial alongside efforts to nurture a business environment conducive to semiconductor manufacturing. This includes streamlining regulations, ensuring access to necessary infrastructure, and providing tax breaks and other incentives. Besides, attracting foreign investment, fostering public-private partnerships and formulating policies that support domestic technology development will be essential for long-term success.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "For the last two decades, a lot of promises were made by the authorities for reviving the jute industry of the country, which once earned the lion's share of its export revenues through shipment of jute and jute goods.The golden days of this sector started to fade away from the late 1970's mainly due to the introduction of man-made artificial fibres, as it triggered huge fall in the demand for jute worldwide.However, in recent times, the use of inorganic materials like synthetics have been discouraged in countries that are highly sensitive about environment issues.This trend has paved the way for the revival of the jute sector. As the largest jute producing country of the world, Bangladesh should be in a comfortable position to fetch huge foreign exchange through jute exports but unfortunately this could not be done due to the lack of proper initiative by both public and private sector.Recently, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) said that it would collaborate with entrepreneurs in the jute sector, as well as government and private sector stakeholders, to address the industry's current challenges.This is a welcome step towards reviving the past glory of jute, which earned the fame as 'golden fibre of Bangladesh' for its cash-generating capacity.One of the problems of our jute industry is its lack of diversification of products which is crucial to boost exports.The entrepreneurs should concentrate on more innovation in diversifying their products. Though some small entrepreneurs recently started to produce different varieties of jute goods, the big names in the industry should come forward in such ventures.The steps, which are urgently required to rejuvenate the sector include withdrawal of 2 per cent source tax on raw jute, implementation of the Jute Wrapping Act 2010 fully, banning of the use of polythene, initiation of appeals against anti-dumping measures, designating jute products as agricultural products, establishing a Jute Sector Development Fund (JSDF) to support the industry, and providing a 30 percent subsidy for modernising jute mill machinery.Besides, the entrepreneurs, for long, have been demanding the availability of low-interest-bearing bank loans, adjusting tax rates on jute exports, increasing cash assistance to 20 per cent for various jute products, waiving tax at source on export incentives, ensuring the supply of high-yielding jute seeds, and making raw jute production, consumption, and export statistics accurate.The government should set up a special task force to consider these demands.Industry people feel that the 2 per cent source tax on raw jute affecting farmers and traders, is potentially discouraging jute production and disrupting the industry. They also called for the mandatory use of jute wrapping, as stipulated in the Jute Wrapping Act 2010, to boost domestic demand for jute products.In 2016, Bangladesh government signed an MoU with Chinese government for modernising the ailing state-owned jute mills . China has agreed to provide over several hundred million dollars for this project but due to unknown reasons the government two years ago backtracked from this project.As the closed state-owned jute mills has huge infrastructure, these can be a major contributor to the jute sector once they are modernised.Most of the public sector jute mills have been closed citing their poor fiscal performances. But age-old machinery and mismanagement were the prime reasons behind this. Naturally, questions have been raised whether such an opportunity to modernise the mills with Chinese help should be missed.Still, thousands of farmers are dependent on jute cultivation and a vibrant jute sector will surely help them in generating more income. Unlike the RMG sector, which is receiving huge cash benefits from the government, the value addition in this sector is also 100 per cent.So for picking up the growth momentum of the economy, jute sector needs to be revived through comprehensive and prudent steps.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "\"The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth,\" and this is something we tend to forget. Earth is the only planet that allows us to live in its surroundings, yet we, as human beings, are often ungrateful, unconscious, and irresponsible. We don't care for our mother-like planet; instead, we constantly make our home planet uninhabitable by contaminating our environment. Consequently, we encounter numerous challenges in our lives. For instance, climate change, water scarcity, poor air quality, soil degradation, endangered marine life and coral reefs through ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, and escalating health risks like respiratory issues, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.It is time to incorporate ourselves into the sustainable management of the environment. We should promise to keep our environment safer, cleaner, and greener. Remember, one small step can lead to greater attainment. In this context, World Environment Day, observed annually on June 5th, is a powerful reminder of our collective duty to care for the environment. This year, the theme is \"Land Restoration, Desertification, and Drought Resilience.\" It is high time to embrace this theme.Moreover, the government should take stern action to prevent environmental pollution. We should raise our voices against the unethical activities that pollute the environment. We are leading our lives to the edge of extinction. Only our awareness and inclusive programs can help the Earth thrive. To take care of our environment, we can build a green valley for future generations.So, let's embrace the theme of World Environment Day 2024 and save our planet.\nNusrat Jahan Isha StudentInstitute of Social Welfare and ResearchUniversity of Dhaka [email\u00a0protected]",
