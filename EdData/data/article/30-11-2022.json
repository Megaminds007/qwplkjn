Unlike Covaxin, an inactivated vaccine, the intranasal vaccine uses a viral vector platform that utilises a recombinant adenovirus as a vector. As a heterologous booster, the intranasal vaccine was tested on around 875 participants, immunised earlier with two doses of either Covaxin or Covishield. Among the advantages intranasal vaccines have over vaccines is that they can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection at the point of viral entry in the respiratory tract. They are also far easier to administer. As in the case of the intranasal vaccine for primary vaccination, the booster dose too was tested only for safety and immunogenicity, but not efficacy. Unlike the vaccines tested early in the pandemic, evaluating the efficacy of a new vaccine for primary vaccination and heterologous booster at this stage of the pandemic might be very challenging as a vast population has been already vaccinated and/or naturally infected, especially with the Omicron variant.However, even higher immunogenicity need not necessarily translate into higher efficacy, particularly the ability of the vaccine to prevent infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has now acquired an even greater ability to evade existing immunity and cause an infection. Since the intranasal vaccine does not have the virus spike protein with newer mutations, it is important to study within a defined time period the effectiveness of the intranasal vaccine to prevent infection and severe disease and death when used as the primary vaccination and as a booster dose. Alternatively, the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness can be tested in human challenge studies. Studying this becomes important as the results of an intranasal vaccine in the phase-1 trial using the Oxford vaccine \u2014 an adenovirus-vector vaccine \u2014 originally developed for intramuscular administration, elicited antigen-specific mucosal antibody responses only in a \u201cminority\u201d of participants, and the antibody levels were far lower than from a natural infection. The Oxford vaccine, as an intranasal vaccine, did not elicit \u201cconsistent mucosal antibody response nor a strong systemic response\u201d. The demand for vaccines for primary vaccination has been reducing since the third wave peaked in end-January while those for boosters has been low even when available for free for 75 days beginning mid-July. Yet, the development of an intranasal vaccine, a new vaccine platform for India, is welcome, and having a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent infection remains a high priority.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nvaccines\n\n/\n \nmedical research",

Former President Donald Trump took U.S. sanctions to the extreme by barring oil companies from operating in the South American country, which has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, and recognising Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-declared unelected acting President. This policy had little impact on Venezuela\u2019s political crisis, for two reasons: first, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 never managed to mobilise enough political capital to shake Mr. Maduro\u2019s regime, powered by the Bolivarian grassroots movement; and then, the regime found a way to work around the sanctions by selling its heavy crude at a discounted price to China and other countries. The Biden administration followed the Trump line in its initial months, but started holding talks with Venezuela in March, a few weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the U.S.\u2019s official narrative is that the decision to ease sanctions was part of a larger political reconciliation process within Venezuela, the catalyst seems to be Ukraine and the energy crisis. Sanctions on Russia have pumped up prices. Mr. Biden\u2019s attempts to revive the Iran nuclear deal have not succeeded so far. The move by Saudi Arabia and its allies to slash oil production has also mounted additional pressure on prices. The only option now to get more oil into the market is to allow Venezuela to do so.To be sure, the easing of sanctions comes with riders. Chevron can produce oil from its fields in Venezuela, but the oil should be exported only to the U.S. Also, the sale proceeds should be used to pay back state-owned Venezuelan oil company PdVSA\u2019s debt to Chevron (some $4.2 billion), and the licence can be cancelled any time. Even so, Mr. Maduro can claim victory in the U.S.\u2019s clear U-turn. He has offered to begin talks with the opposition, but has not made any major concession beyond that. The U.S. move could also prompt European countries to revisit their policy towards Caracas. The return of foreign companies would allow Venezuela to ramp up its oil production. Mr. Maduro seems to have survived western attempts to isolate him, but his bigger challenge is to ride out the storm at home. The window of reengagement is his opportunity. He should embrace it with steps to address the critical failings of Venezuela\u2019s economy, partly because of his own policies, mend ties with the West, and join serious talks with the opposition. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nVenezuela\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\neconomic sanction\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\npolitics",

        "full_article": "Sensex closed at 62,681.84 points on Tuesday, a record high. Indian equities are an outlier, unaffected by the flow of negative global economic and geopolitical news. For sure, there are proximate reasons such as a cooling of prices of key commodities like oil. That\u2019s bound to have influenced the current surge in equity indices. But of greater importance is a sticky trend which suggests not just equities, but the larger financial system may be on the cusp of an important change.\nFor long, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have had an outsized influence on equity indices here. Hence every global shock has had a big impact on both India\u2019s foreign exchange and equity markets. This link is weakening. Consider the aggregate FPI investment pattern since April 2021. Over the last 20 months, almost $22 billion of FPI investment has flown out of equities. Over the same period, the BSE Sensex has risen 25%. This is perhaps the most important change as domestic inflows into equities have more than offset FPIs.\nHouseholds, the main source of savings in India, have driven this change. RBI\u2019s data shows that in the three years preceding 2020-21, household net financial savings as a percentage of gross national disposable income was between 7.5% and 7.9%. In the pandemic year, this surged to 11.5%. A part of the surge was directed into shares and also equity-oriented mutual funds, which saw an increase in assets under management by more than 50% to over Rs 15 lakh crore between April 2021 and October 2022. This, however, may not fully account for the trend in equities. Other areas where household savings flow such as life insurance funds and even EPFO have also undergone a significant tilt in favour of equities. EPFO, for instance, now invests up to 15% of annual inflows into financial instruments linked to equities.\nHow is this trend likely to play out at the macro level? India\u2019s bank-dominated financial market is in the midst of a transformation. RBI estimates that bank credit accounts for nearly half of the total flow of resources to the commercial sector. Of the remaining flow of resources, as the share of equity grows it simultaneously enhances the availability of riskier forms of investment into the commercial sector. It comes just as automation disrupts traditional economic structures. India\u2019s entrepreneurs should be delighted.\n\n",

The premier public healthcare institute caters to around 15 lakh outpatients and 80,000 inpatients every year. Consequently, there are fears that the attackers could sell the now force-encrypted AIIMS databases that contain personal information of patients \u2013 including political leaders, senior administrators and judges \u2013 and their healthcare records on the Dark Web.\nOf course, what has happened to AIIMS is hardly a local phenomenon. A massive increase in cyberattacks on healthcare institutes worldwide has been witnessed during the Covid pandemic. According to research by CloudSEK, the first four months of this year saw cyberattacks on the healthcare industry increase by 95% compared to the same period last year. And the Indian healthcare sector was the second-most targeted globally. In the US, the most common target for global ransomware hacks, the consequences have been particularly devastating \u2013 from delaying chemotherapy treatments to diverting ambulances from a San Diego emergency room after computer systems were frozen. In fact, in July the US government warned that American hospitals had been targeted by an aggressive ransomware campaign originating from North Korea.\nWhile the origin of the AIIMS attack is yet to be determined, it is clear that Indian hospitals are even more vulnerable than their American counterparts given their measly budget for cybersecurity. Add to this the increasing digitisation of hospital operations and records, and we are looking at a perfect storm. India\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure includes agencies like National Informatics Centre and the India Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), which are investgating the AIIMS case. But more needs to be done. The latest industry best practice advocates a \u20183-2-1 backup approach\u2019 for healthcare entities, that includes saving three copies of each type of data in two different formats, including one offline.

        "full_article": "Last week's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt highlights the growing consensus that multilateral cooperation is necessary to avert environmental catastrophe. But with geopolitical tensions spiking and the US-China rivalry heating up, such efforts seem doomed to fail, much like previous efforts to promote global coordination on vaccines, trade, technological innovation, and macroeconomic policy.\nThe good news is that the consensus may be wrong: A lack of multilateral cooperation need not be fatal to the climate cause. The existing frameworks for international coordination are outdated anyway, and technological competition, fuelled by the United States' climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), may prove to be a more potent driver of innovation, ensuring that the fight against climate change continues apace.\nSo far, the main framework for promoting multilateral cooperation on climate change has relied on the principle of \"cash for cuts,\" whereby developed countries offer financial aid to persuade developing countries to launch ambitious decarbonisation efforts. But this approach is no longer credible, given that the international community has failed to meet its financial commitments and has shown no sign of improving.\nWorse, the \"cash for cuts\" paradigm is premised on a double standard. While lower-income countries are asked to reduce emissions, rich countries are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels, particularly in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, the European Union's\u00a0planned border tax\u00a0on carbon-intensive imports would effectively punish lower-income countries in Africa and elsewhere, limiting their own clean-energy transition. The EU's\u00a0carbon border adjustment mechanism\u00a0essentially foists developed-world policies on poorer countries, making it tantamount to climate imperialism.\nFortunately, rapid technological advances have sharply reduced the price of\u00a0renewables\u00a0bringing decarbonisation within financial reach. That is why some developing countries, notably India and China, have embarked on massive renewable-energy programmes over the past decade.\nNonetheless, given the need for massive investments in renewable-energy infrastructure and already-elevated storage costs, the transition to a net-zero economy is still not financially viable. Moreover, the transition would dislocate millions of people in developing countries who earn their living from fossil fuels, leading to enormous adjustment costs. Underestimating these costs or believing that these problems will resolve themselves is another, subtler form of climate imperialism.\nWhile multilateral cooperation in the fight against climate change seems unlikely, America's new IRA could be a global game changer. By subsidising renewable-energy research and development, it would obviate the need for onerous and inequitable carbon-taxation mechanisms. More to the point, such measures would help create a new, hopeful narrative that focuses on mitigating climate change through technological innovation and boosting supply, rather than sacrifice and reduced demand. Like the US, few developing countries are likely to \"carbon tax\" their way to emissions reductions.\nThe IRA could also help lower-income countries to reduce the costs of decarbonisation by encouraging the deployment of technologies such as low-cost batteries and carbon capture and storage. In our book\u00a0Greenprint, Aaditya Mattoo and I argue that by making greater use of these technologies, developing countries could meet their energy needs without increasing global climate emissions.\nThe IRA is essentially a protectionist trade and industrial policy. As such, it could spark an international arms race of green-energy subsidies. But that might be a good thing. A global subsidy war could spur technological innovation, potentially driving down the price of renewables. Moreover, it may do for new technologies what China's\u00a0subsidies\u00a0for photovoltaics did for the global solar-energy industry.\nAs many have\u00a0warned, the IRA is not without risks. President Joe Biden's signature legislation links many of its subsidies and incentives to production and research in the US and North America. It thus constitutes what the World Trade Organization calls \"local content requirements.\" The EU, one of America's biggest trading partners, has complained about this barrier to\u00a0trade.\nBut, given the urgency of the existential threat posed by climate change, a global rush to subsidise key technologies seems like a feature, not a bug. To the extent that a global subsidies race could make clean energy financially viable, it would save rich countries the charade of committing to provide trillions of dollars to poorer countries that they cannot raise.\nFinally, such a race could help resolve developing countries' grievances about the rich world's climate hypocrisy. Driving down renewable-energy costs would be a global public good provided by the developed world \u2013 assuming, of course, that whatever new technologies emerge would be freely available. The\u00a0unequal global rollout\u00a0of COVID-19 vaccines should serve as a reminder that the mere invention of new technologies does not guarantee an equitable distribution.\nThe Green Revolution of the 1960s, when industrialised countries significantly\u00a0reduced global hunger and poverty\u00a0by introducing high-yield crops across the developing world, is a useful model for distributing cheap, non-proprietary renewable technologies. But to achieve a green revolution for the twenty-first century, the world must move beyond stale and divisive discussions about which countries are responsible for the climate threat.\nGiven today's geopolitical rivalries, efforts to strengthen multilateral cooperation on climate change are likely to be futile. But competitive technological progress, even if promoted by protectionist policies, could save the planet.\n\nArvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at Brown University, is a distinguished non-resident fellow at the Center for Global Development and the author of\u00a0Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy\u00a0(India Viking, 2018).\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2022.www.project-syndicate.org\n",

        "full_article": "On November 20, 2022, there was nothing unusual in or around the Dhaka Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) court premises. Around 11 in the morning, a police team produced 12 militants \u2013 death row convicts and also accused in the high-profile murder cases of Faisal Arefin Dipan, Avijit Roy, Xulhaz Mannan, Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy and Nazim Uddin \u2013 before the Dhaka Anti-terrorism Special Tribunal at CJM for hearing. It was when these 12 convicts were being taken to the prison cell at the court \u2013 about 100-yards from the tribunal \u2013 that chaos ensued. A band of militants from Ansar Al Islam's military wing attacked the police personnel who had been escorting the convicts and managed to whisk two of them away.\nLater, it was revealed in media reports that Ansar Al Islam's military wing chief Ayman, alias Mashiur Rahman, had orchestrated the operation with a team of 12 to 18 criminals, with the aim to secure four of the convicts \u2013 Arafat Rahman, Abdur Sabur, Abu Siddiq Sohel and Moinul Hasan Shamim \u2013 with the latter two successfully managing to escape. Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) officials told this daily that Ansar Al Islam's motive behind securing release of these four convicts is to involve them in a plan to launch a major attack in the country. The four are said to have expertise in various skills including the use of firearms and sharp weapons and military training.\nOne might be pardoned for asking why was Ayman not arrested earlier \u2013 especially after he quit his job in March 2020 \u2013 and how could a person harbouring pro-militant thoughts be a member of government service, specifically assistant director of the Public Service Commission? Was this another case of intelligence failure?\nWhile this gross breach of security at the court area is an indictment against the law enforcement agencies entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the integrity of the space, it also raises important questions about the ability of our intelligence and security agencies.\nFirst of all, a very obvious question to ask is, why were there only four police personnel responsible for guarding 12 death row convicts, that too, those involved with a notorious militant outfit. Secondly, what were the on-ground security personnel doing when the attackers were taking position and waiting for their queue or even conducting the operation to free the criminals? Were the law enforcers and surveillance teams so naive and imperceptive that such movements evaded their radar?\nEarlier in February this year, a robber named Harunur Rashid fled from the Dhaka Court area. That should have been a key lesson for the law enforcers and surveillance teams in the area, since more than 600-700 criminals are taken to the court every day. But that clearly does not seem to have been the case.\nMoreover, in the media reports, it has been suggested that transportation guidelines for militants and dangerous and daring prisoners have been issued multiple times. Were they followed when handling these 12 notorious convicts? If yes, these guidelines and protocols need to be reviewed to identify the loopholes. If not, stern action should be taken against those responsible for their enforcement.\nFrom the news reports, we have learnt that Ansar Al Islam had been hatching this plan since at least February this year. And work for this well-orchestrated attack had been underway for some time now. The prisoners had been given detailed information about the operation over phone while they were in jail, and recently they had even been shifted from high security prison to regular cells. Moreover, the militants in the rescue operation also had in possession master keys to unlock the handcuffs. These facts unfortunately point to the potential involvement of insiders from law enforcement and even intelligence agencies in this operation. And this is something the investigating bodies must look into very seriously.\nThe escape of these militants poses serious risks for national security. These criminals are ferocious and extremely dangerous and harbour very dangerous sentiments towards the minority communities. They have smothered multiple dissenting voices, and with these criminals at large, and Ansar Al Islam planning to carry out major attack in the country, everyone should be on alert. This is especially applicable for the family, relatives, friends and close associates of the individuals murdered by these convicts.\nAt the same time, with elections looming next year, there have been warnings from various groups that certain vested quarters are trying to create unrest in the country to sabotage democracy. Could Ansar Al Islam be one of those rouge actors? This daring operation should also be analysed from this perspective to assess potential threats and adopt remedial measures.\nThe success of Ansar Al Islam in freeing these two prison-bound militants sends a dangerous message to the other militant and terrorist outfits operating inside the country. Although law enforcement agencies are on the hunt for the two escaped convicts and both the police and home ministry have formed multiple committees to investigate how this happened, without substantial results, these would be of no use. The law enforcement agencies should launch a comprehensive crackdown operation against Ansar Al Islam to not only catch the two who got away, but also apprehend the other members and their leadership, to extract information from them about their plan of action.\nIn the internal investigations, it should be thoroughly scrutinised if there are moles compromising our national security. In the meanwhile, people at high risk should be kept under watch and security around the country should be beefed up. Law enforcers working at different checkpoints should be instructed to be more active and vigilant and public gatherings and crowded places should be carefully monitored for any suspicious movements.\nThis operation should also serve as a wake-up call for our intelligence agencies that their game plan (if any) is not well-planned or effective, and that they must do more to keep an eye on the movements of rogue, militant elements in the country.\nMilitancy is one of our biggest national security threats. It should be dismantled and neutralised, as had been done in the past. We must turn every stone, explore every possibility, to root out terrorism from the country, and create a safe space for all our citizens.\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Default loans are not something new when it comes to the country's banking sector. The problem has persisted ever since Bangladesh's independence, and attempts have been made on numerous occasions to resolve the issue. Back in the 1990s and in 2001 or 2002, the problem was reduced to some extent by introducing a number or financial reforms. The downward trend in default loans continued till 2011.\nHowever, in later years, due to the shortcoming in governance, and lack of discipline in the financial sector, scams of a massive scale involving default loans were identified. This eventually re-established the culture of default loans in the country once again.\nEven though the amount of our default loans is over Tk 130,000 crore, according to the government accounts, IMF suggests it is almost over Tk 300,000 crore. However, what remains outside of the government's calculations is the thousands of crores of money currently stuck at the country's ports, which the banks can never recover.\nAnother excluded element is the political influence used by loan defaulters. Politically influential defaulters do not repay their loans on time; however, by using their influence, they can reschedule the deadline of repayment and turn the schemes into medium or long-term loans. Under such an arrangement, an unpaid loan taken over 20 years ago does not fall under the category of default loans, as the loanee clears a small portion of the repayment \u2013 a mere two to five percent \u2013 but never repays the full amount. This was the case a few years ago when such loans were systemically prevented from going under the default criteria. However, the crisis only aggravated after that.\nSome other catalysts have also been added to the crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, over Tk 200,000 crore was given as loans under an incentive scheme by the government. However, the money was distributed by banks, whereas the government only provided some subsidies. This huge amount of money eventually turned into default loans, where the loanees have shown their reluctance in repaying the money they got as \"incentives.\"\nThese loan defaulters remain free of consequences as the government continues to stay silent and take no actions against them. They roam freely, in both the country and abroad, where they continue to buy property with smuggled money.\nAnd that is a massive amount of money that we are talking about. We have no hopes of getting it back as the money might not even be in the country. If nothing is done about this situation, the amount of all default loans combined will continue to increase.\nWhat the government can do in this regard is ensure good governance. We have to come out of the social liability or tendency to give in to political pressure and start enforcing the law properly. It has to be a level-playing field, where the law is the same for everyone, regardless of their political identity. This is the only way of getting out of the culture of default loans.\nThe weaker banks need to be taken over by the government to get rid of corrupt decision-makers. If need be, these banks have to be merged into one, or just the number can be decreased by giving back the money to depositors. These banks will only weaken the entire banking sector if left without any intervention.\nIn my opinion, if we want to revive the country's economy, we need to pay attention to our financial sector, which is one of the most backward sectors in the country. The banking sector itself is in a disastrous position. The return on assets is decreasing, so is the return on equity \u2013 which has seen a massive decrease from the previous 26 percent to a current 4.5 to 5 percent.\nInvestors who have invested in the banks' stocks are not getting proper returns. Banks are being used as a tool of economic oppression, where the directors are sharing the money among themselves but the real investors are being deprived of the benefits.\nAt this moment, the government needs to introduce major reforms. If we fail to ensure good governance, we will fail to make economic development a reality. The financial sector has a big role to play in this regard. The stock market, along with the banking sector, and the bond and insurance markets need massive development. If the banking sector is reduced to a mere tool of economic oppression and exploitation by a chosen few, there is no hope for us to take the country forward.\nDr Ahsan H Mansur is Executive Director of Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI).\n",

        "full_article": "When it comes to serving justice for rape and other forms of gender-based violence, one of the objectives of a proper legal system should be to minimise the distress of survivors, who have already gone through tremendous suffering. Yet, responsible public institutions including our judiciary continue to lengthen or complicate survivors' quest for justice, with obstacles put in their way from the very beginning. A recent report by this daily has once again brought this reality to the fore, narrating the experiences of some survivors seeking justice.\nThe women and their relatives explained how, on top of the immense mental distress they had to endure because of the rape incidents, they also had to face financial burdens after being blackmailed by their tormentors, as well as the costs of a lengthy trial including that of bringing witnesses to courts. These costs could have been avoided if only our legal system prioritised speedy delivery of justice to rape survivors. Unfortunately, the Crime Victims Compensation Act, proposed by the Law Commission 15 years ago, remains in draft form to this day. Under it, the state would be responsible for compensating victims of violent offences, including covering their medical and legal expenses.\nThe barriers for rape survivors are not just financial. They also have to navigate an unhelpful, often hostile environment to pursue justice. It's a trend that starts with inaction or lack of initiative by responsible institutions\u00a0to ensure security of women and girls in general. This, today, also extends to the digital space. According to a recent study commissioned by ActionAid Bangladesh, only 14.91 percent of the women surveyed were found to have submitted formal complaints against online violence, while more than 85 percent of the sufferers remained silent. The lack of interest to file complaints can be explained by the fact that at least 64.71 percent of respondents said that they did not receive any redressal after registering complaints. This lack of response can hugely discourage victims from reaching out for help.\nWhat all this shows is how the authorities are failing to protect victims and potential victims of sexual violence, both online and offline. Given the social stigma, mental trauma and financial burdens that rape survivors as well as other victims of sexual harassment have to go through as a result of the crimes committed against them, ensuring that necessary legal and administrative infrastructure is in place and functional is the minimum that the state can do for them.\nWe urge the authorities, including the judiciary and police, to take these issues seriously. They must undertake necessary measures and reforms to ensure that survivors of sexual violence feel empowered while seeking justice for themselves. It is a long-overdue need that our legal system and law enforcement agencies become trustworthy allies of survivors, rather than contributors to their unending woes.\n",

        "full_article": "The prime minister is learnt to have issued an instruction during a recently held Secretaries' Committee Meeting to the effect that she be informed of the real situation in the country's banking sector. Evidently, she was concerned about some recent questionable developments in the banking sector. In this connection, mention may be made here of the report that a huge amount of loan (over Tk68 billion) has been withdrawn from a private sector bank, Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL), allegedly by some business entities that fell short of proper address or documents. The incident raised a few eyebrows. But the bank in question has contested the report and maintained that the amount was given as loan following standard procedure. One would like to believe that it has been so. However, the central bank, the Bangladesh Bank (BB), has reportedly informed that it would 'monitor and supervise' the matter.Notably, default loan culture, scams and irregularities have long been dogging the country's banking sector. Meanwhile, in a recent report it has been revealed that the total defaulted loans in the country's banks have soared to more than TK 310 billion. All this has been happening at a time when the economy is going through a serious crisis arising from high inflation and dwindling foreign exchange reserve. Small wonder that against this backdrop even the High Court, during a hearing on Sunday (November 27), questioned why the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was not holding big loan defaulters to account while it (ACC) was only going after the small loan defaulters. Interestingly, the court hearing in question was related to a case involving loan defaulting.The prime minister's directive and the High Court's observation only point to the gravity of the predicament the country's banking or for that matter the country's entire financial sector is in. But such instances of gross irregularity and mismanagement are also nothing new in the financial sector. One may recall at this point how a little known company using forged documents swindled a private sector bank, Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited (BCBL), out of Tk 2.0 billion in 2018. It was later discovered that the fraudulent company actually laundered the money in the name of export. Strangely enough, the said bank did show the laundered money as a loan extended to the fraudulent company. What the bank next did was more surprising as it rescheduled the loan (obviously defaulting) in favour of that fake company. Of course, it was done without informing the central bank. Most surprising of all was that the central bank later allowed the private bank in question to reschedule the 'defaulted loan' in violation of rules set by the financial regulatory body itself. According to the BB rules, no bank can regularise a bad loan that has been obtained through forgery. On top of all these previous incidents of gross irregularities in the banking sector, the latest developments have proved to be the straw that finally broke the proverbial camel's back.Oddly though, all these unsettling reports are coming from the country's financial sector when the government is seeking support from the multilateral donor agencies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to keep the economy afloat in the midst of a high inflationary pressure, forex reserve crisis and huge trade deficits. So, the nation expects that the central bank would take serious note of these upsetting developments and devise deterrent measures against corruption or infringement of rules in the financial sector.",

        "full_article": "Strange it indeed is that the High Court's (HC) repeated rulings prohibiting brick making by illegal brick kilns in the country are not being heeded to by none other than the government agencies. The last in the series of such rulings from the highest court came weeks ago. This time the HC asked the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to issue notifications within seven days banning the operation of all illegal brick kilns. The court also asked the government to explain within four weeks why its failure to stop the operation of illegal brick kilns and use of fuel woods in brick kilns should not be declared illegal.There were several such directives in the past. Months back, on March 1, 2022, the High Court directed the Director General of the Department of Environment (DoE) and the DCs of Dhaka, Munshiganj, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Manikganj districts to demolish 319 illegal brickfields within 15 days. Some actions were reportedly taken, but only partly -- as though as a face saving measure. The narrative of defiance is long, going back years, and hence there are reasons to worry whether reining in the operation of the hazardous brick kilns is really is possible. It is not just the media reports or the environmentalists' concern about the ruinous effects of these illegal structures that have failed to prevent the unabated misdeed but flouting of law stipulating the dos and don'ts in this regard is worrying enough to make one lose hope. There is hardly any argument that among the many hazards affecting the environment, brick making is one that not only adversely affects the ecosystem but also leaves a disastrous impact on a host of livelihood means of the masses, notably among others, cultivation. This is particularly so when it comes to conventional brick making practices in the country for ages. Emergence of brick kilns irrespective of locations has been on the rise for decades, facilitated largely by the absence of any enforceable rules. This is not to say there was no law governing brick making. The Brick Burning (control) Act 1989 had its inadequacies to dictate terms in the first place, and besides, the lacuna in the enforcement of some of the compliance issues made things worse. Consequently, the practice of setting up brick plants at any location of choice went unopposed.The law currently in force apparently addresses the core issues associated with brickmaking -- meant chiefly to check widespread environment pollution as well as save arable land and forest. The law 'Brick Making and Brickfield Establishment (Control) Act 2013' has brought tough regulations for brick production that among others provides for trial of offences under the penal code. The stipulations envisaged in the law apply to all brick kilns in the country. The law prohibits establishment of brick kilns in residential, protected, commercial and agricultural locations, and also in forests, sanctuaries, wetlands and ecologically critical areas. According to the Department of Environment (DoE), there are well over 6,000 brickfields in the country, of which around 3,000 are located in and around Dhaka. However, environmentalists claim the number is far higher. According to a UNDP estimate, Bangladesh produces some 8.66 billion bricks a year valued at $450 million -- almost 1.0 per cent of the country's GDP. Despite the sizeable contribution of brickmaking to the economy, one of the grim realities is that brick fields all over the country are getting increasingly invasive in grabbing the country's less than sufficient arable lands. More dangerous is the threat that comes in terms of affecting neighbourhood lands under cultivation because of the heat, caustic smoke and dust generated by the brickmaking plants. A local daily reports that over 6.4 million tonnes of carbon emissions are caused by the brick kilns annually.As things are going unabated despite the law in force, it is clear that mere formulation of the law didn't help -- although the law was a foremost necessity and it did take a lot of things to work on. If not enforced in the right spirit, a law is no more than expression of intent. The job, no doubt, is challenging given the vast swathes of land, mostly agricultural, occupied by brickmaking plants. Disciplining these in line with the law is one thing, and setting up new plants is another. The law does not categorically mention relocation or phasing out of the outmoded plants from the prohibited areas. Experts feel there should have been clear guidelines in the law for setting up of new plants adopting green technology.Concerned quarters emphasise the need for introducing modern green technology capable of taking care of the pollution aspect to a great extent. Some brickmaking plants in the country have moved in that direction, and in view of the wide acceptance of the technology in many countries chiefly because of its emission-preventing device, Bangladesh should move in a concerted way to facilitate wide acceptance of the technology. It is highly imperative that the government gradually phased out the traditional kilns, and provided necessary support by way of soft-term financing to encourage the green technology.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has made a decision in favour of investing US$2.0 billion in the education sector of Bangladesh for the next three years. This is welcome news for the country, as education suffered tremendously during the Covid restrictions and ADB's fiscal entry at this stage will undoubtedly help in more ways than one. Although the government has made great strides in imparting education, the sector has not been receiving its due share in budgetary allocations. More than that, most of the allocations it has been receiving have gone into infrastructure development. When one takes into account that Bangladesh ranks the lowest among South Asian nations in terms of allocation for education proportionate to GDP, the situation becomes clearer.While ADB's involvement is of great import, it is difficult to fathom why the State has not been investing its own resources to improve the quality of education in the country. We have a massive young generation of people and in today's globalised world, with millions of our workers are going abroad to work as blue-collar workers, it makes sense to equip them with the right education. Instead of exporting blue-collar manpower, we could be sending white-collar manpower. Countries in South-East Asia like the Philippines earn many times more than Bangladesh in terms of inward remittance because their manpower includes nurses, who fall under the skilled category and hence have earnings that are significantly more than the average blue-collar workers from Bangladesh.Looking beyond manpower export, the young people of this country could be part of the multi-billion (if not trillion) dollar global market for outsourcing. Till date our contribution to this industry has been nominal. India, took to the skies decades ago because it has some of the best IT (information technology) institutes in Asia. Those institutes are not there due to divine intervention, they have materialised and excelled because successive governments there made quality education a priority for India. The neighbouring country didn't make our mistake and has consistently invested not just in education, but also in language proficiency (English) and research. We have been independent now for half a century, and still, we continue to neglect education.Has the time not arrived when we rethink education in our land? It will, of course, require political will at the very top to effect a massive overhaul in the education system. Educationists need to be given priority over bureaucrats, if there is to be any meaningful change. This is not simply about cents and dollars, rather it is about a change in mindset. Again, it is not only about having a revamped syllabus, but delving deeper into unlearning the way our young people are taught at institutions. If one is to have meaningful reform in the education sector, we must be willing to start with unlearning things that have not worked for us and instilling in our teachers, new technologies, new methods of teaching and new ways to communicate. Re-training teachers will always bring resistance and backlash, but without teachers equipped with the right skills, teaching methods will not change and students will not be on a par with any of its neighbours. As the world prepares itself to enter into the age of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), our primary and secondary level education system is in dire need for a major change. The choice for the State is simple. Change the system to keep up with the times, or be left in the void.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Many of us may not know that coffee can be grown in Bangladesh. What is more encouraging is that the experiment of cultivating coffee in Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT) has yielded positive results. Experts believe that the coffee beans grown in three CHT districts -- Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati -- can be as good as the ones from central and South America. Currently, two types of coffee are cultivated on an experimental basis in Bangladesh. One is Robusta, while the other is Arabica, also known as mountain coffee. The coffee shrubs differ in size and harvest based on the hilly sites. On an average a hectare of land yields 7.5 to 11 tonnes of Robusta coffee, while three to six tonnes of Arabica is grown in each hectare. Since Bangladesh has huge hilly areas in Chattogram and Sylhet divisions, Arabica would be the best option for large-scale commercial production of coffee beans. It has better taste and aroma than the Robusta variety. State-owned Bangladesh Tea Board may be assigned with the responsibility to encourage farmers to grow coffee. This measure will help reduce coffee import in Bangladesh. If proven to be of good quality, coffee can be a game changer for us as it has huge demand worldwide. Since the cultivation is new, farmers do not have enough knowledge about this and are not skilled. Realising the potential of coffee production, the authorities concerned should be sincere and proactive so that coffee's potential is fully tapped. \nMd Ashraf Hossain, 120, Middle Bashabo, Dhaka-1214, [email\u00a0protected]",
