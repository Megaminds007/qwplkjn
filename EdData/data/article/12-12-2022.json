Such was the respect she garnered for her medal-winning exploits at the Asian level while the collective heart-break she bequeathed in narrowly missing a bronze in the 400m hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics is remembered even today. After she retired from track-and-field, she evolved as a coach, groomed fresh talent and kept an eye on the grassroots. Her latest appointment as president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) comes with a surfeit of goodwill. Additionally, it busts the patriarchy inherent in many sports hierarchies across India. She becomes the first woman president of the IOA, a post she was elected to unopposed. In a sense the IOA\u2019s hand was forced as factionalism drew censure from the International Olympic Committee and there were whispers of a ban. A change of guard from the earlier well-entrenched lobby with political links was inevitable and Usha was seen as the ideal candidate. Already a nominated Rajya Sabha member, Usha\u2019s latest sporting elevation was seen as an organic progress. Having handled many batons while running her famous relays, Usha will find the latest one perhaps the toughest to manoeuvre.As the umbrella organisation for sports bodies in India, the IOA has to deal with sister associations lost in dissidence. Stadiums become white elephants, leased out for housing loan expos or music concerts. Age-fudging and doping are grim realities as young athletes, seeking jobs, chase medals at the zonal, age-group and national levels. Medals often secure a career opening in public sector units, banks and a few corporates and Usha is aware of this. She and her team of administrators that includes sportspersons and other officials, need to crack the whip. For all the political jostling that happens during the elections, men and women representing opposite ideologies shake hands and become entrenched in sports administration, seeking brownie points and fame. The Government\u2019s leaning on the soft power of sports, the Sports Authority of India\u2019s initiatives and corporate-backed academies have changed the landscape. India is beginning to aspire for golds beyond the Asian realm and Neeraj Chopra and Abhinav Bindra\u2019s exploits in the Olympics are a pointer that the skill-sets are there and if support is provided, medals with better lustre can be secured. With India hoping to bid for the Olympics in the 2030s, Usha and her team are expected to create a road map for that too. The Payyoli Express has a tough challenge ahead.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nsport\n\n/\n\nathletics, track and field\n\n/\n\nOlympics\n\n/\n\nRajya Sabha",

        "full_article": "When Pedro Castillo was elected the President of Peru last year, he promised voters a new social contract. With four Presidents in the past five years, there were widespread corruption allegations and growing anger in the country against the ruling elites with unemployment and poverty rising. Mr. Castillo, a former schoolteacher lacking administrative experience, vowed to fix the chronic economic problems and fight corruption. But in less than two years, the socialist met with the same fate as his immediate predecessors \u2014 impeachment by Congress. Rather than his ouster \u2014 a President being impeached is not new in Peru \u2014 what shook the nation were the developments leading to his impeachment. Just after he took over, clashes erupted between him and Congress. He also faced allegations of corruption and running a criminal organisation that profited off government contracts. While he rejected these allegations, by saying old political elites wanted to take back power, his inability to mobilise public and institutional support only emboldened his rivals. Lawmakers tried to impeach him twice invoking a clause in the Constitution that allows the sacking of Presidents \u201cfor permanent moral incapacity\u201d, but failed to garner enough votes. The crisis came to a tipping point last month when Mr. Castillo threatened to dissolve Congress.In 1992, President Alberto Fujimori (currently in jail), shut down Peru\u2019s Congress, suspended its Constitution and went on to rule as a dictator until 2000. Mr. Castillo announced the dissolution of Congress on December 7, a few hours ahead of a scheduled impeachment vote. He wanted to convene a new Congress and rewrite the Constitution. But unlike the Fujimori plan, Mr. Castillo\u2019s collapsed as the military, the police and even aides came out against him. Congress impeached him with 101 to six votes (with 10 abstentions), and Vice-President Dina Boluarte took charge as the new President. While Peruvians avoided a major constitutional crisis by defeating Mr. Castillo\u2019s power grab plan, the whole incident should serve as a reminder of the challenges the young democracy faces. Congressional powers could be critical in preventing the rise of another Fujimori, but the constant clashes between the executive and the legislature and the back-to-back impeachment of elected Presidents are not signs of a healthy democracy. In the current political climate and context, it is nearly impossible for any elected President or legislature to have a reform agenda without triggering power clashes. And without reforms, one of the most unequal societies in South America would only get trapped in cycles of economic and political crises.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\nexecutive (government)",

        "full_article": "Air pollution in India is often seen as a challenge confined to the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) airshed, the seven states beginning with Punjab in the northwest to West Bengal. A report in TOI showed that it\u2019s not always the case. Coastal metros, Mumbai and Chennai, recently recorded air quality index readings worse than Delhi. In general, the situation is worrisome. The World Air Quality Report this year showed that of 50 global cities with toxic air, 35 are located in India.\nPoor air quality is a public health problem, whose effects spill over to other areas. The Global Burden of Disease Study in 2019 estimated that 18% of deaths that year in India were attributable to air pollution. The economic cost came to 1.36% of GDP. Within India, it\u2019s the poorer states across IGP which experienced the largest increase in pollution. In other words, a disproportionate burden of India\u2019s abysmal air quality is borne by the more vulnerable sections of the population. It\u2019s certainly not a price that needs to be paid for economic progress. World Bank\u2019s cross-country data for 25 years (1990-2015) shows that China and Vietnam recorded a higher average GDP per capita growth with a smaller change in mean annual PM 2.5.\nAmong air pollutants, it\u2019s the growing incidence of PM 2.5 that is the most damaging. With a diameter of about one-thirtieth the width of human hair, it arises from many sources, including dust. Therefore, tackling air pollution in India can no longer be about localised solutions. So far, India\u2019s policy approach to improving air quality has tended to be city-centric. It won\u2019t work because the source of the problem is an airshed, which represents a common geographic area of pollutants. Consequently, Delhi despite a huge vehicle density sometimes has better air quality than surrounding areas.\nThe common thread running through urban areas such as Mexico City that have managed to improve air quality is approaching the challenge as one that spills across political boundaries. Once a geographical airshed is the focus, the nature of incentives offered by public policy will change. In India, it means that GoI has to play a more proactive role of coordination as airsheds span clusters of states. Given the health and attendant economic costs of toxic air, a solution is in the common interest of GoI and all affected states.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Congress\u2019s pick of Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu as the next Himachal CM nips in the bud factional fights that could have broken out in the state. Himachal has been the only bright spot for Congress in a long time. With three Himachal Congress leaders \u2013 Sukhu, Mukesh Agnihotri and ex-CM Virbhadra Singh\u2019s wife Pratibha Singh \u2013 vying for the top job, things could have easily fallen apart.\nBut in electing Sukhu \u2013 a self-made politician who led the Congress campaign \u2013 as CM and Agnihotri as deputy CM, Congress has managed to accommodate two of the three leaders. Plus, passing over Pratibha Singh was a good idea to neutralise BJP\u2019s dynasty barb. That said, factionalism continues to be a big problem for Congress across states. It was the single biggest factor in the party\u2019s Punjab disaster earlier this year where the tug of war between Navjot Singh Sidhu and ex-CM Charanjit Singh Channi wrecked its campaign.\nSimilarly, the party also faces factionalism in big-ticket elections next year. In Karnataka, where Congress is well-positioned to mount a serious challenge to BJP, the party needs the two factions led by Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar to pull together. It remains to be seen if party president and Karnataka leader Mallikarjun Kharge can facilitate this. In MP, Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh have to keep their personal interests in check, while in Rajasthan another Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot dogfight could spell deep trouble for GOP. Unlike BJP and PM Modi, the lack of a charismatic, vote-pulling central leadership in Congress means the party high command can\u2019t easily discipline warring factions. But Himachal has shown keeping factionalism in check will be key to the party\u2019s prospects in direct electoral contests with BJP. Perhaps this rather than the Bharat Jodo Yatra needs greater attention.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Roquiah Sakhawat Hossein was born in 1880, Kazi Nazrul Islam in 1899. Apart from their difference in gender, there could not have been more differences in the circumstances of their class and upbringing. Roquiah was born and brought up in an affluent Muslim family of Pairaband. Her brothers went to elite schools in Kolkata. Though she was forbidden to read and write Bangla or English as a child, her brother Ibrahim Saber helped her to learn both languages so that she could write fluently in both. Later, her husband, Sakhawat Hossein, encouraged her to read and write, both Bangla and English.\nKazi Nazrul Islam was born in an impoverished family in the village of Churulia in the district of Bardhaman in West Bengal. Nazrul's father was the khadim or caretaker of a mosque next to his small mud hut. The death of several earlier children led to Nazrul's being given the nickname \"Dukhu Miah,\" the sorrowful one, perhaps also to cast off the evil eye. Initially, Nazrul studied in a maktab, an Islamic elementary school. When Nazrul was about nine, his father passed away, and the young boy was obliged to support his family. This might have meant teaching the children at the maktab, cleaning the mosque, and participating in religious rituals which entailed reciting the Quran.\u00a0\nSometime in 1915, Nazrul got admitted to Searsole Raj High School, and studied there till 1917. This was the longest time he had spent in one place and in one school. However, he did not sit for the matriculation examination, but went off to join the British Indian Army which had started recruiting Bengalis.\u00a0 Posted to Karachi, Nazrul started subscribing to Kolkata papers and also writing for them.\nIn 1898 \u2013 a year before Nazrul was born \u2013 Roquiah Khatun was married to Sakhawat Hossein, an Urdu-speaking widower from Bhagalpur. A civil servant under the British Raj, Sakhawat Hossein, not only encouraged his wife to read and write but was so amazed at her piece of English writing that he showed it to Mr. Macpherson, Commissioner, Bhagalpur.\u00a0 Mr. Macpherson commended the quality and content of the writing.\u00a0 We do not know whether Roquiah sent the story herself to Indian Ladies Magazine (Madras) or whether her husband did so. Nevertheless, Roquiah's first published writing appeared in the magazine in 1905. Three years later, her Bangla translation of the story \u2013 with some changes \u2013 was published as a small book by S. K. Lahiri and Co., Kolkata.\nSakhawat Hossein passed away on May 3, 1909, leaving a large sum to his widow to start a school. Roquiah initially started the school in Bhagalpur but was unable to continue there and moved to Kolkata. It was there that, on March 16, 1911, she re-started Sakhawat Memorial School at 13 Wellesley Lane. Besides persuading Muslim parents to let their daughters enrol in her school and running it, she also had to write letters explaining why certain things were being done or not being done in her school. In addition to these activities, she started writing for local Kolkata newspapers and journals.\nPerhaps the earliest Bangla essay of hers that was published was \"Pipasha.\" This piece about Muharram was published in Nabaprabha in Falgun 1308 (Bangla) corresponding to mid-February to mid-March 1912.\u00a0 She also wrote in other journals such as Mahila, Nabanur, Bharat Mahila, Al-Eslam, Bangiya Mussulman Sahitya Patrika, Saogat, Sadhana, Naoroz, Mohammadi, Sahityik, Sabujpatra, Muezzin, Bangalakshmi, Gulistan, and Mah-e-Nau. News about her school was published in The Mussulman under her initials, Mrs. R. S. Hossein.\nDuring his deployment in Karachi, Nazrul subscribed to Bangla journals from Kolkata and also sent them some of his writings. His first publication was a short story \"Baundeler Atmakahini\" [The Autobiography of a Vagabond], which was published in Saogat in May 1919. The short stories \"Hena\" and \"Byathar Dan\" [The Gift of Sorrow] were published in Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Patrika in November 1919 and January 1920 respectively. Roquiah's writings too were being published in Saogat and Bangiya Mussulman Sahitya Patrika. \u00a0Though it is not known whether Nazrul and Roquiah actually met, it is impossible that they did not know about each other's writings.\nA few years ago, I asked Majeda Saber, Roquiah's grandniece who has written considerably on her grandaunt, whether Nazrul and Roquiah had ever met. Majeda Saber did not know. However, even if they did not meet, it is quite evident that Nazrul and Roquiah did meet in print and that they shared some common ideas. Nazrul reveals a deep empathy for women in both his poetry and his fiction. The short story \"Rakshushi,\" about a woman who has killed her husband and gone to jail for her crime, is a sympathetic portrayal of a murderess in her own voice. Nazrul's poem \"Nari\" demands equality for women.\nI sing of equality.\nIn my eyes, there is no difference\nBetween a man and a woman.\nWhatever is great and blessed in this world,\nHas come equally from both, man and woman.\nTranslated by Selina Hasib\nHis song, \"Jaago Nari Jaago\" [Rise Up, Women], gives a clarion call to all women to rise.\nRise up women \u2013 rise up like the flaming fire!\nRise up, O wife of the Sun god,\nwith the mark of blood on your forehead!!\n...\nLike the fire blazing out of a smouldering heap,\nrise up \u2013 all you mothers, daughters, wives, sisters!\nTranslated by Sajed Kamal\nIn his epistolary novel, Bandhon Hara \u2013 which began to be serialized in Moslem Bharat from mid-April 1920 and was published as a book in 1927 \u2013 the feelings of the women letter writers reflect Roquiah's ideas.\nThe narrative of Bandhon Hara seems to focus on the soldier-protagonist Nuru. However, the letters of the women not only contribute to the narrative of the triangular love story but also reflect on the condition of Muslim women in seclusion. For example, Mahbuba writes to Sophie \u2013 her friend, who, like her, is also in love with Nuru \u2013 about the claustrophobic nature of the inner quarters where women reside. It is a place where even the sun may not enter. But women are not criminals, Mahbuba says. \"We are entitled to some freedom, for are we not human beings? Are we not made of flesh and blood, don't we have feelings? Do we not possess a soul?\" (Unfettered 50).\nAfter Mahbuba gets married, she writes to Shahoshika, a Brahmo teacher and a family friend,\u00a0 that women are supposed to be self-sacrificing. She tells Shahoshika that she has no wish to be renowned for self-sacrifice. She would like to die but refuses to die locked up in the inner quarters. \"If I have to die, I would wish to have all the doors and windows around me open wide . . . . I want to die looking straight at Mother Earth\" (Unfettered 149).\nIn her essay \"Subeh Sadek\" [Dawn] published in Muezzin (Asharh-Sravan 1337 BS/mid-July-mid-August 1930) Roquiah asked women to proclaim aloud that they were human beings, not possessions. \"Buk thukiya bolo ma! Amra poshu noi. Bolo bhogini! Amra asbab noi. Bolo konye! Amra jarau olonkar rupe lohar sinduke aboddha thakibar bostu noi. Sokole somoswore bolo, Amra manush. Mother, proclaim aloud, We are not animals. Proclaim, sister, We are not inanimate objects. Proclaim daughter, We are not ornaments set with precious gems to be locked up in iron trunks. Proclaim together, We are human beings.\" In Aborodhbashini [The Secluded Ones], published in 1931, several years after Bandhon Hara, she described the claustrophobic, unhealthy, and often fatal conditions of extreme purdah.\nThese similarities might simply be coincidences. However, it is clear that Nazrul thought highly of Roquiah and that she too reciprocated that feeling.\u00a0 Roquiah had been contributing to several Kolkata journals.\u00a0 In 1922, she contributed two pieces to the newly founded bi-weekly paper, Dhumketu, edited by Nazrul. The paper started publication from 26 Sravan 1329 BS/11 August 1922. A month later, a large extract from Roquiah's essay \"Pipasha\" [Thirst] was published in the Muharram issue of 16 Bhadra 1329/ September 2, 1922.\nThanks to Selina Bahar Zaman, we have facsimiles of Dhumketu. From this valuable collection we realize that, from the very beginning, the paper not only voiced Nazrul's anti-British views but also displayed his non-communal and non-gendered outlook. Many of the contributors to the paper included Hindu writers as well as women. There were at least ten women who wrote at least once. One of these included a ten- or eleven-year-old girl as well as a thirteen-year-old girl, the former Hindu, the latter Muslim.\u00a0 Mrs. M. Rahman, to whom Nazrul dedicated his book Bisher Banshi, wrote several times. Roquiah \u2013 as Mrs R. S. Hossein \u2013 was published twice in Dhumketu.\nWe do not know whether Roquiah sent the extract from \"Pipasha\" herself or whether Nazrul asked her for the piece for the special issue of twenty pages. The extract published in Dhumketu reflects on the plight of Hazrat Imam Hossain and the group of warriors, women and children, who accompanied him on his tragic journey to Karbala.\u00a0\nThe only other piece by Roquiah to appear in Dhumketu was a poem, \"Nirupam Bir\" [The Dauntless Warrior], published on 5 Ashwin 1329 BS / September 22, 1922. Unlike \"Pipasha,\" the poem does not seem to have been published before. This time, Roquiah might herself have sent the poem to Dhumketu. She would not have had to go in person to the office of Dhumketu. With a good postal service, contributions were mailed to journals.\n\u00a0\"Nirupam Bir\" is a remarkable poem from a woman who has been called an \"Islamic Feminist.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The 1 Bhadra 1329/ 18 August issue of Dhumketu had published a photograph of Kanailal Dutt (1888-1908). Did this inspire Roquiah to write the poem?\u00a0 Kanailal was a revolutionary belonging to the Jugantor Group. Arrested with a number of other revolutionaries, he was imprisoned in Alipore Jail.\u00a0 There, along with another revolutionary, he succeeded in assassinating Narendranth Goswami, a government approver. Kanailal was hanged on 31 August 1908.\u00a0He was the second revolutionary to be hanged by the British after Khudiram Bose \u2013 whose picture also appeared in Dhumketu.\nIn the poem, Roquiah eulogises Kanai as the dauntless warrior. The poem begins with the magistrate telling Kanai that he will be hanged. But Kanai \u2013 addressed here as Shyam, another\u00a0 name of Krishna \u2013 laughs. The one who willingly sacrifices his life does not fear hanging.\u00a0 \"Moriya kanai hobe omor/ Shadhyo ki bodhe tarey? By dying Kanai will become immortal. Who can slay him?\" The poem ends with a strident call hailing Kanailal: \"Bolo bolo 'Bande Shyam.'\" It is a brave poem by a woman who was the widow of a government servant, a woman who ran a school for Muslim girls and promised their parents that purdah would be observed.\nThere were no Muslim revolutionaries at the time \u2013 though Nazrul's friend Muzaffar Ahmad was a communist \u2013 and in Mrityukshudha Nazrul would describe a Muslim Bolshevik and in Kuhelika he would portray a Muslim revolutionary. In his two poems on Durga, \"Agamoni\" and \"Anandamoyeer Agamane,\" published in the Puja issue of Dhumketu on 9 Ashwin 1329 BS /September 26, 1922, Nazrul used the legend of the goddess to call for the overthrow of the British. In his editorial in the thirteenth issue of Dhumketu, 26 Ashwin 1329 BS / October 13,1922, Nazrul called for complete independence from the British: \"'Dhumketu' bharater purno swadhinata chay.\" He quoted a line from his poem \"Bidrohi\": \"Ami aponare chhara kori na kahare kurnish\" [I bow to no one but myself]. Unlike Khudiram and Kanai, Nazrul did not resort to bombs or pistols, but to soul-stirring words. Just as in some of his writings, Nazrul revealed the feminist perspectives of Roquiah, in this poem Roquiah approached the revolutionary spirit of Nazrul.\nSelected Bibliography\nHossein, Roquiah Sakhawat, \"Subeh Sadek.\" Rokeya Rachanabali ed.

This year's death toll, which is significantly higher than in 2021, when it was\u00a047, also represents an alarming\u00a0deterioration of the situation, requiring urgent interventions.\u00a0\nAccording to the IFJ, the war in Ukraine has taken the lives of 12, mostly Ukrainian journalists. While covering a war always carries the risk of casualties, there have been many cases where states have been directly involved in silencing journalists. The shocking shooting of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by Israeli forces in May is a prime example of the risks journalists face when they expose truths that contradict the state narrative. In Mexico, 11 journalists were killed, highlighting the terror of\u00a0organised crime.\nIn countries where there have been public uprisings against repressive governments, journalists have been targeted quite blatantly. Since the US troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban regime took over, journalists in both electronic and print media have been arrested, some even killed. Women journalists in radio and TV channels were forced to give up their jobs and even flee the country to save their lives. The IFJ recorded at least 375 media professionals currently in prison; most of them are in China, Myanmar, Turkey, Iran and Belarus. But what about democratic states? Are journalists safe from arbitrary arrests and physical harm here?\u00a0In Bangladesh, for example, there has been a proliferation of newspapers and TV channels, but does it mean we have total press freedom?\nThe Digital Security Act (DSA) has become the greatest obstacle to independent journalism in the country, as it gives carte blanche to law enforcement agencies to randomly arrest people for publishing/sharing digital content that may be construed as being \"seditious\" or \"hurting religious sentiments\" or some other vaguely defined offense. The DSA and other laws related to the media have resulted in self-censorship, which is the first symptom of an ailing democracy. Moreover, the ownership of media is being dominated by individuals or groups connected to political power which leads to further compromises in objective, authentic journalism. This is quite alarming.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, in many democracies, social media has been used as a tool to spread misinformation as well as discredit, humiliate and intimidate journalists who have been critical of governments or have exposed uncomfortable truths. Women journalists especially have been targeted for relentless misogynistic trolling and incriminating rumours. The IFJ has also criticised the new form of mass surveillance, Pegasus, used to spy on people including journalists.\nAll these constitute major threats to the rights of journalists to pursue their careers freely and independently. Governments around the world are failing to realise that apart from providing the public with objective, authentic information, the media also helps governments to keep track of anomalies in their institutions which need to be corrected. It will, therefore, be in their own interest to ensure a safe and enabling environment for journalists, so that they can do their job without their lives and livelihoods being threatened.\n",

        "full_article": "Stefania Maurizi is an investigative journalist working for the Italian daily Il Fatto Quotidiano. She has worked on all WikiLeaks releases of secret documents and partnered with Glenn Greenwald to reveal the Snowden Files about Italy. In an interview with Eresh Omar Jamal of The Daily Star, she talks about her latest book, \"Secret Power: WikiLeaks and Its Enemies,\" and how WikiLeaks revolutionised the world of journalism.\nWhat is this \"secret power\" that you are referring to in the title of your book, and why does it consider WikiLeaks its enemy?\u00a0\nI chose that title so that people around the world could\u00a0understand who the real enemy of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks is, who it is that wants him, the WikiLeaks journalists, and the WikiLeaks revolution dead. That is what I refer to as \"secret power,\" which is not a conspiratorial entity: it is the highest level of power, where intelligence services, armies, and diplomats operate. Long before WikiLeaks was created, President Eisenhower warned the US against this power: the military-industrial complex, which has at its heart agencies like the Pentagon, the CIA, and the NSA. Eisenhower was not a pacifist: he was a great military leader,\u00a0one of the principal architects of the victory over the Nazis in Europe, and yet he warned his country against this leviathan.\u00a0\nThe power and influence exerted by these institutions are felt in every corner of the globe; they plan wars, coup d'\u00e9tats, assassinations. They sway governments and elections.\u00a0\nI call it \"secret power\" because this power is shielded by\u00a0thick layers of secrecy, and ordinary citizens don't even perceive it as relevant to their lives. They tend to think: I am a humble teacher in Bangladesh or a caregiver in New York or a waitress in London, how can secret services influence my life as an ordinary citizen? And yet, that secret power does influence their lives. It decides, for example, if a war will be unleashed in Iraq or Afghanistan, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and creating millions of refugees desperately trying to leave their countries and seek refuge in other nations. So, it is clear that this secret power influences the lives of all of us, but the ordinary citizen has no control over this power, because he/she has no access to the restricted information on how it operates.\u00a0\nBut for the first time in history, WikiLeaks has ripped a gaping hole in this secret power, giving billions of people systematic and unrestricted access to enormous archives of classified documents revealing how our governments behave when, completely shielded from public and media scrutiny, they prepare wars or commit atrocities.\u00a0\nThis is the revolution unleashed by Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and this is the reason this secret power wants him dead. It wants him and WikiLeaks dead for exposing its dirty secrets, and those secrets have nothing to do with protecting the security of citizens, but rather with shielding state criminality at the highest level, so that the state criminals are protected and enjoy \"complete impunity.\"\nYou mentioned how WikiLeaks had discovered methods to bypass some of the weaknesses of the traditional media in the digital age. Can you elaborate on that? Did it inspire any of the big traditional media houses to adopt any new strategies?\n\nJulian Assange and the WikiLeaks journalists have pioneered the use of cryptography and the power of the internet to bypass censorship and reveal exceptionally important information in the public's interest. Their use of cryptography to protect whistleblowers and journalistic sources has encouraged many to step out of the darkness of state secrecy and expose war crimes, like the ones we saw in the Collateral Murder video, to expose torture, extrajudicial killings, etc.\u00a0\nYou have to realise that, back in 2006, when WikiLeaks was created, no media organisation was systematically using cryptography to protect sources, not even the most advanced and powerful newsrooms like The New York Times and The Guardian. That was precisely what attracted my interest in 2008, when I first looked at the work that was being done by WikiLeaks, which at that time was a little-known organisation, and had not yet revealed its bombshell scoops like the Collateral Murder video.\u00a0\nI graduated in maths before going into journalism, and to me their use of cryptography was tremendously important, because they not only provided a shield to those blowing the whistle in public interest, they also attracted sources with unique talents and professional experiences, potentially sources with access to important information. After all, back then, who could really appreciate a tool as complex and unusual as encryption? Those who had studied it, or who worked in the field of computer science or intelligence. The technologically advanced structure of WikiLeaks appealed to an entire community familiar with the language of science and technology. After WikiLeaks pioneered the use of cryptography to protect whistleblowers and sources, all major news organisations started adopting it. But it took years before they did, and that too only after being inspired by WikiLeaks.\u00a0\nWithout addressing these loopholes, can traditional media presently serve the public interest, or can it even survive while doing what journalists are meant to be doing, that is, revealing secrets being hidden away by powerful interests?\n\nWe live in the age of mass surveillance, and it has become so pervasive that protecting journalistic sources who have access to extremely sensitive information has become almost \"mission impossible.\"\u00a0\nEven Edward Snowden, a former\u00a0NSA contractor who had worked for the CIA (and hence had special training), decided he had to leave his country to meet with Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen McAskill in Hong Kong, to give them access to the top-secret NSA documents. Of course, he was uniquely aware that if he had met with these journalists in the US, he would very likely have been discovered and arrested before he was even done talking to them. That tells you a lot. If even a CIA-trained journalistic source cannot escape his state when he has access to its dirty secrets, how can an ordinary source do so? This fact has immense consequences.\u00a0\nUnless we can protect our sources, no one will talk to us, because investigative journalism develops through confidential sources who talk to us.\u00a0\nHaving worked on many US diplomatic cables and written about them in your book, what do you make of the real \"international order,\" especially in comparison to what people around the world generally understand of it?\nI worked\u00a0on the US diplomatic cables for an entire year, reporting on them for\u00a0my newspaper\u00a0and for\u00a0my book. Even though those documents were published 12 years ago, I have never stopped regularly consulting them, because they still inform the public on the major crises the world is experiencing today, such as the Ukrainian war.\u00a0\nHow did we end up in such a war and in this energy crisis? If you read the 251,287 cables, you gain a tremendous understanding of what was happening behind-the-scenes, and unfortunately you realise how servile US allies have been towards the US military-industrial complex, even in situations where being servile was not in their national interest and was definitely not in the interest of human rights and justice. The cables are not kind to US enemies either. They present a very bleak portrait of Russia, of course from the viewpoint of US diplomacy. And while the portrait of Russia that emerges from the cables is a grim one, that of the US is not particularly uplifting either, not only because of the wars and torture and human rights violations that it committed during the \"war on terror,\" but also because the cables expose the brutal face of US capitalism, backed by the most powerful diplomacy in the world: US diplomacy.\nReferring to you and your book, Daniel Ellsberg, who is famous for releasing the Pentagon Papers, wrote: \"No one conveys better the urgency of averting the extradition and prosecution of Assange, which would demolish First Amendment protection of freedom of the press in America.\" But aside from that, what effects, if any, can it have on journalism around the world?\n\nI wrote my book to make people around the world understand why extraditing Julian Assange to the US and entombing him in a maximum-security prison is not only a monstrous injustice, as the great British film director Ken Loach writes in the foreword to my book, but is also a point of no return for democracy.\u00a0\nIn a democracy, it must be possible for a journalist to reveal war crimes, torture, extrajudicial killings by drones and still sleep peacefully in his bed, rather than sleeping in Britain's harshest prison, Belmarsh. This is precisely the difference between a democracy and an authoritarian state. In dictatorships and authoritarian societies, journalists cannot reveal such facts without being killed or incarcerated.\u00a0\nSo, the destiny of Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks journalists is the destiny of our democracies. What path are we embarking on? Are we defending the public's freedom to know about state criminality at the highest level, or are we willing to lose this freedom and go authoritarian? Are we defending a society in which war criminals are accountable to the law and will go to jail for their atrocities, or a society in which war criminals and torturers are safe and free, and the journalists and people\u00a0who have the conscience and courage\u00a0to expose them rot in a high-security prison?\n",

        "full_article": "We are utterly disappointed that the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, enacted 12 years ago, has not had the desired impact due to a lack of proper enforcement and in the absence of necessary institutional support for victims. According to a report published in this daily, victims and survivors of domestic violence in the country can hardly access shelters, psycho-social counselling and medical services, let alone seek any legal redress for the crimes committed against them. In the absence of a proper support mechanism, a majority of the victims are being forced to live with their abusers.\nReportedly, we currently have only around 36 shelters in the country \u2013 15 of them run by NGOs \u2013 for over 80 million women and over 64 million children. Most of these shelters are located in the metropolitan areas, which is difficult for women from the grassroots level to access. In addition, the process of admission to a shelter is very complicated, as victims need police referrals or court orders to get access to Victim Support Centres or One-Stop Crisis Centres being run by the state agencies. But most victims of domestic violence are unable to immediately file cases with police or go to courts. As a result, when women want to get out of an abusive relationship or want to leave their abusive in-laws' houses, they often face the threat of homelessness. More often than not, they are forced to stay back or keep enduring torture.\nAnother factor that hinders women from seeking justice or getting out of an abusive relationship is the social stigma surrounding domestic violence, and the age-old practice of regarding these psychological and physical abuses as one's \"personal matters\" that should not be talked about. A joint study by Action Aid Bangladesh and Jatiyo Nari Nirjaton Protirodh Forum in 2018 found that 72 percent of women who faced intimate partner violence never disclosed it to anyone. It is alarming that such a large number of women are being subjected to torture in their own homes and are denied their right to a safe and dignified life on a daily basis.\nThe law has some very important provisions to support abused women and children, including protection orders for women, right to reside in the marital home, temporary custody of children, and recovery of personal assets and assets acquired during the marriage. However, it is the state's responsibility to address the loopholes in its implementation and enforce the law effectively. To begin with, it must dramatically increase the number of shelters (in partnership with NGOs if necessary), and build their capacity to provide survivors with the help and guidance they need, including psycho-social counselling and economic support. The process of accessing these services must also be made easier \u2013 we must provide the victims shelter first, and ask questions later.\n",

        "full_article": "The refinancing programme recently announced by the Bangladesh Bank (BB) could be singled out for its thrust on a critical issue --- greening of entrepreneurship. Clearly, the central bank's initiative has been prompted by the global tendency to go green in every sector of life, including that of industries and technology-based agriculture. As reported in the media, the BB has put its refinancing package's monetary value at Tk 50 billion. The sum is aimed at promoting green industry in the export and production sectors. The essence of the BB's refinancing carries a universal appeal and a timeless significance as well. Under the scheme, the so-called green entrepreneurs in the country will be entitled to get loans at a 5.0 per cent interest, a BB circular says. Globally, the thrust is on making the production units green. Bangladesh, albeit in a small way, has been taking initiatives in that direction. Its readymade garment sector has now 117 US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED)-certified green factories. The number is the highest in the world. These green units have lower operational cost, though their building cost is higher than that of conventional factories. The green factories help cut down energy use by around 40 per cent and water consumption by more than 30 per cent. They also release less carbon dioxide. In order to supplement its refinancing scheme, the Bangladesh Bank created a similar fund titled Green Transformation Fund worth US$200 million in 2016. The size of the fund became bigger through the addition of 200m euros in 2020. Ostensibly, it's a back-up of the main scheme. The fund is designed to finance procurement of capital machinery and related paraphernalia meant for putting into effect green industrialisation. It's a hard truth that disbursement from the above funds, however, has been slow. In line with the fast approaching small and large climate disasters, weathermen are unanimous on the point: the world, the poorer countries in particular, cannot afford to undermine the green issue. It's also true the multi-pronged struggles to attain an all-round greening require large amounts of money at national levels. It's only after the local initiatives, can the world dream of a global camaraderie in attaining success in its green mission.These are, indeed, the signs of new times that humanity lately has not been confined to its day-to-day activities to go green. They have also included different other sectors related to their hazard-free survival. Those include efficient use of water expanses, water conservation and management, waste management, resource efficiency and recycling, renewable energy, heat and temperature management and many other localised areas. In the fast expanding sphere of the greening efforts, the industrial sector doesn't lag behind. Following their peers in the developed countries, entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, too, have lately focused on making their industrial production processes environment-friendly. They love to call these products green. Ranging from textile production, RMG in particular, to that of the automated ones, the country's entrepreneurs are apparently eager to go green. The BB's refinancing scheme will go a long way in helping Bangladesh realise its green dream.",

        "full_article": "A fringe group that believes in conspiracy theory and want to take their country back to pre-World War II era, more specifically, to the time of Second Reich in 1871, did hatch a plot to overthrow the modern democratic German Republic. The German police on Wednesday (December 7) conducted the biggest ever operation against the members of the far-right elements belonging to the so-called Reichsb\u00fcrger movement (Citizens of the Reich) at 130 sites in 11 states out of Germany's 16 states and arrested some 25 suspects. But who are these anti-democracy, anti-modernity and anti-establishment people out to take their country centuries back? They are disparate groups of people who deny the post-WWII existence of Germany as a Federal Republic. In their view, German state as it is now is an administrative construct still under the occupation of the Western powers, especially, the US, the UK and France. They believe the 1937 border of the German Empire is still valid. The members of these diverse groups and individuals are mostly found in the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria. As they do not recognise the present German authority, they show their allegiance to their own 'national territories' which they also term 'Second German Empire', or the 'Free State of Prussia', or the 'Principality of Germania'. At the same time, they refuse to pay tax to the government and carry out disruptive activities like flooding the local administrative offices with abusive mail. One of these disparate groups, which identifies itself as K\u00f6nigreich Deutschland (Kingdom of Germany), even bought lands in Saxony where it dreams of establishing its kingdom. Together they print their own currency, identity cards, passports, and driver's licences. They openly carry out their campaign against the Federal Republic of Germany on their website. Actually, this motley collection of people who deny the legitimacy of the present-day Germany and so want to overthrow it has, of late, become a platform of every form of extremist idea including racism, anti-semitism, as well as anti-immigrant narratives. Add to these the recent conspiracy theories like QAnon. The adherents of QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory which holds that Satan-worshiping paedophiles are controlling the government, business and media (the mythical 'deep state'), were also reportedly involved in the said plot to occupy the Reichstag. This conspiracy theory originated in the US in 2017. The followers of this theory believe their hero, former US president Donald Trump, champions the war against those evil forces. Notably, the storming of the Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021 was the work of this diverse group. Evidently, among other countries, QAnon has its followers also in Germany. The activity of the Reichsb\u00fcrger movement, though it started long before the pandemic, gained more support during the pandemic when the online disinformation campaign against the vaccine claimed that it (the vaccine) was a weapon to control people. It may be recalled that a mob of anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers had tried to attack the Bundestag in August 2020. Interestingly, the QAnon supporters had been holding street protests alongside the Reichsb\u00fcrger activists when that incident took place.But that was not the first instance of their engaging in violence acts. The attempt to kidnap German health minister in April is suspected to have connection with the movement of the Covid deniers. Gradually, they and the so-called Telegram group related to Reichsb\u00fcrger movement appear to have been showing interest in the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 and its vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control the population. Meanwhile, the high energy bill due to the Ukraine war and the pressure of the refugees from Ukraine have obviously further fuelled the propaganda of these conspiracy theorists. Germany's Justice Minister, March Buschmann said in a tweet that there was a plot to carry out armed attack on constitutional bodies including Bundestag and install a new government there. The leader of the group has been reported to be a septuagenarian German aristocrat, Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss. He would become the head of the future state if the plot to topple the present government was successful. German Federal prosecutors say, Heinrich XIII is one of the two ring leaders of the plot. The other suspect, Ruediger v.P., would become the head of the new German army once the coup plotters were in power.Some of those arrested appear to be former military personnel and they were learnt to be trying to contact the Russian government, an allegation that Russia dismissed out of hand.But these violent elements with apparently ridiculous political or cultist views are but the surface of a still bigger force with sinister designs to thwart democratic systems. The rising unrest in Europe and other parts of the world is due to growing economic disparity in society. It has been providing a fertile ground for the far right narratives and the conspiracy theory. The conflicts and wars in different parts of the world have been dislodging millions from their hearth and home in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. These people are trying to enter Europe in the hope of a better life as economic immigrants. Europe also needs the service of this cheap workforce from abroad. But this situation has also been instrumental in stirring up the politics of populism that thrives on the majority's fear of foreigners, immigrants, refugees and the minority. The far right, especially, the neo-Nazis in Germany, are trying to fish in troubled waters. Notably, a far right party AfD (Alternative for Germany), a radical right group holds 78 seats in German parliament. Though this party has denied any involvement in the coup plot, it is still under state surveillance.\nGerman society and politics are yet to completely rid itself of its dark legacy of the past.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Even though it is still Agrahayan --- the last month of the season of Hemanta or late Fall or Autumn --- on the Bangla calendar, the air is ripe with wintry chill. The array of vegetables that bear the stamp of the Winter are already plenty in the market courtesy of enterprising farmers who now have at their disposal agricultural knowledge and technology to produce vegetables well in advance and almost round the year. The way vegetables and fruits have helped develop parallel economies in the country is quite remarkable. For years of losses incurred on account of high cost of or no-loss-no-profit paddy cultivation have taught the smart among farmers to opt for cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers including the exotic ones. Those who can, try to cultivate and harvest the traditional vegetables and fruits earlier than schedule because their produce then fetches them high profit. Yet when a distorted market mechanism is the rule of the day, growers get less than the middlemen who connive with each other of the supply chain to eat the cream. In the peak season, when there is a glut in the market, price drops drastically. The demand-supply theory of the free-market economy is more than exploited depending on the commodities concerned. In case of leafy and other perishable produce, middlemen and wholesalers take advantage of the situation leaving growers at their mercy. In time of economic crises like the one now prevailing, when low-income people and even the middle-class people are desperately struggling to maintain their food intakes, the market volatility fuelled by genuine reasons and also on flimsy pretexts has only caused them financial haemorrhage. Good harvests and abundant supply of vegetables right at this time have at last brought down to some degree the prices of those items. The news is likely to pour honey into the ears of common consumers. But if some varieties of the perishable farm produce show a price decline, other items of daily use show no sign of giving people any relief. In the peak Aman harvesting season, price of the nation's staple has increased, defying the traditional market trend. Contrary to the set pattern, this is for the first time that farmers also have gained some bargaining power instead of disposing of their new harvest at a throw-away price. One of the reasons is farmers' access to information of the latest food grain prices in the market on a daily basis, courtesy of cell phone. This is possible also because of the fact that paddy is not a perishable item and therefore growers do not have to give in to the urgency of disposal as early as possible. That cooking oil, sugar are exorbitantly priced in defiance of the government's fixed prices makes it a field day for sellers including the local corporate businesses and multinational companies. Almost every week, detergents, toiletries and cosmetics register a price gallop and one cannot quite keep pace with the mad rush. The fact is that not every item's price is pushed to an outrageous level for genuine reasons. Businesses are on the lookout to maximise profits beyond reasons, as if they are out to compensate for the market slump during the Covid-time lockdown. Government sources report that oil and sugar are not short in supply. This claim has time and again been corroborated by the mobile court's drives against hoarding. Large quantities of sugar and oil have been recovered from clandestinely stored godowns or other places. Who knows if all such clandestine warehouses could be busted! Creation of artificial crises of commodities in the market has been a common ploy---in the post-Covid period only more so---to make unethical business with the ulterior motive of reaping outrageous profit. In a situation like this the Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection (DNCRP) could have played a significant role provided that it was strengthened and given enough mandate for that purpose. Its tentative intervention in the market has hardly any positive results to show. When the very fundamental principles and spirit of the free market economy are undermined by businesspeople, let the DNCRP be given the power and muscle to take appropriate actions against market manipulators. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

For this purpose, commercial banks often hire contractual employees, who allure people to buy credit cards. But they do not explain the whole truth about mark-ups and other terms and conditions, which are included in a lengthy agreement. As long as customers pay their bills within the due date, there is no problem. Banks normally encourage clients to make the minimum payment to earn mark-ups. The real trouble starts when a client makes a late payment and defaults. Banks charge their credit card holders exorbitantly for late payment. If one fails to pay on time, bank officials behave arrogantly and aggressively with them. They keep calling the customers and visit their offices and homes, and harass them and their families. This is a long ordeal. We request the Bangladesh Bank to look into the problem and resolve it as soon as possible. The central bank should make it mandatory for every commercial bank to clarify to credit card clients all hidden charges as well as terms and conditions before issuing a card. \nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
