Preliminary reports have suggested that terrorists \u2014 their numbers and affiliations are not known immediately \u2014 attacked, in inclement weather, an Army vehicle that was on a counter-insurgency patrol between Bhimber Gali-Poonch in the Rajouri sector. The attack also comes at a time when J&K is working diligently to host a G-20 Tourism Working Group meeting, in May. Separately, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is likely to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Goa next month, which has kindled the possibility of fresh India-Pakistan engagement. The attack raises the question about the management of patrols in sensitive locations in the region which has seen a spike in militant violence in the recent past, including a terror attack on a village on January 1 this year that left seven civilians dead. The fact that the Army vehicle was on an unaccompanied drive and remained unattended immediately after the attack is a matter of serious concern.\rThe images of the Army vehicle on fire and charred bodies have reignited memories of and visuals from the Pulwama attack in 2019. On February 14 that year, a convoy of buses with Central Reserve Police Force jawans was on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway way in Pulwama\u2019s Lethpora area when a suicide bomber in an explosive-laden car managed to breach security. Forty personnel lost their lives in the terror attack that shocked the political class, the military establishment and the country. With Indian intelligence agencies pointing to the role of the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), India sent its fighter jets across the Line of Control to strike JeM training camps in Balakot, Pakistan, inflicting casualties and damaging the terror infrastructure there. India\u2019s strident response to cross-border terror was noticed internationally, and became a topic of campaign during the Lok Sabha election soon after. However, terror emanating from Pakistan has failed to ebb, which is evident from the rising violence in J&K over the past three years, especially after the government decided to end the region\u2019s semi-autonomous status on August 5, 2019. Claims on the subject made recently by the then J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik, in interviews, have brought to the fore fresh questions about the intent behind the political class while approaching the issue of terrorism in the country. Perhaps it is time India reviewed its strategy in Kashmir, including the current freeze on talks with Pakistan.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\nact of terror\n\n/\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\nGoa\n\n/\n\nPulwama attack 2019\n\n/\n\nBalakot Air Strikes\n\n/\n\npolitics",

Muralidhar as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, the Supreme Court collegium has let the Union government, which did not act on the decision for eight months, have its way. One can only conclude that the Centre has been deliberately refraining from acting on the recommendation, presumably to stall the transfer. The Collegium has now decided instead, to propose the name of Justice S.V. Gangapurwala, a judge of the Bombay High Court, as the next Chief Justice of the Madras High Court. The reason appears to be the Collegium\u2019s keenness to have a permanent Chief Justice for the High Court, as the senior-most judge has been acting as Chief Justice for nearly eight months. It was decided in September 2022 that Justice Muralidhar would be shifted from the Orissa High Court to succeed Justice M.N. Bhandari, who retired as head of the Madras High Court. Meanwhile, Justice T. Raja, the senior-most judge in Chennai, was acting as Chief Justice, but it was decided in November 2022 that he would be shifted to the Rajasthan High Court. Justice Raja\u2019s representation that his transfer be reconsidered was rejected by the Collegium. However, the Centre did not notify his transfer too, resulting in his continuance as Acting Chief Justice in the Madras High Court for an unusually long period. He is due to retire on May 24, 2023. As if to underscore its disapproval of the state of affairs, the Collegium resolution reiterated that Justice Raja\u2019s transfer \u201cbe effectuated at the earliest\u201d, and observed that even his continuance as a judge would not be an impediment to the appointment of Justice Gangapurwala as Chief Justice.There are recent instances of the government highlighting the political views of prospective appointees to stall their elevation to the Bench. In most cases, however, inaction is the main means to stall an appointment. A question that arises is whether such deliberate inaction on the Centre\u2019s part will be allowed to be the norm. The last move will, no doubt, embolden the Centre, to exercise a right to veto any appointment or transfer proposed by the Collegium. Notwithstanding the flaws in the Collegium system, the present state of affairs bodes ill for the independence of the judiciary. The system is founded on the premise of judicial primacy, but it now appears that the executive has found a way of circumventing it \u2014 merely by refusing to give effect to the Collegium\u2019s recommendations. In effect, the present regime has upended the legal position that the recommendations are binding on the government if the Collegium reiterates its stand with regard to any appointment.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nChennai\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nMumbai\n\n/\n\nRajasthan",

It is a quirk of quantum computing that for India to prioritise $730 million for the mission is an expensive call, yet for the field of study, a modest fund. In the \u201celite club\u201d of six with public-funded quantum initiatives, China has allocated $15. 3 billion (2021-2025), EU $7. 2 billion and the US $1. 2 billion. China also has the largest share of patents in quantum tech.\nIt is a measure of the mind-bending nature of quantum that the ground-breaking research of 1970s and 1980s into the phenomenon of entanglement, the heart of quantum science, was recognised with a Physics Nobel only in 2022. The Laureates had shown that entangled particles (physically apart yet linked) can ferry information over massive distances. This has far-reaching implications for quantum communications tech (QCT), of key strategic significance to India and one of the four verticals for the mission\u2019s R&D. QCT allows a country to secure its critical infrastructure with quantum cryptography to make it \u201cunhackable\u201d.\nConventional data networks are putty in the face of quantum computing if the latter is applied to organise a cyberattack.\nChallenges to build quantum infra are formidable. The first step is for public-funded research institutes to collaborate with startups and firms to develop the initial intermediate-sized supercomputers. At present, India only has a basic quantum computer Qsim that allows researchers to simulate quantum computation. Hardware aside, talent gap is a bottleneck. In 2021, for 290 quantum tech masters\u2019 grads globally, there were 851 jobs. Barely 16% of the world\u2019s universities offer degrees in the field. This is the ecosystem India is entering. Yet GoI\u2019s commitment to fundamental science and endeavour is a great beginning. NQM could not have come a day sooner. QED.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Earlier this week, EU lawmakers laid the groundwork for the rollout of its proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism from 2026. Essentially a carbon border tax, it is shrouded in green principles of pricing carbon, reducing emissions and preventing carbon leakage to combat global warming. But in reality it is nothing but a tax against emerging economies like India exporting to the EU. True, the European bloc has ambitious climate targets of cutting greenhouse gases by 55% over this decade and seeks to withdraw free carbon allowances for its most polluting industries. However, by targeting imports of carbon-intensive goods such as aluminium, steel, cement, fertilisers and electricity it is imposing European emission standards on emerging economies.\nThis is a clear violation of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities of international climate action. The rich countries of the global northbear historic responsibility for global warming. But after having achieved a high standard of living through centuries of polluting industries, they now want to slam the development door shut on the rest of the world. Further exemplifying this hypocrisy is the fact that when the Ukraine war pushed up energy prices last year, EU nations had no qualms falling back on dirty coal.\nPlus, rich nations have done little to mobilise the targeted $100 billion for climate funding to help developing nations transition to low-carbon pathways. Thus, India is right to object to the EU carbon tax. It should prepare retaliatory measures, including taking the matter to WTO and flagging it as a non-tariff barrier.\n\n",

        "full_article": "With the month of abstinence drawing to an end, the most joyous day for Muslims around the world is upon us.\u00a0\nI find that Ramadan has visited us at an interesting time this year. The first quarter of the year is over, and as we enter the second, the month of Ramadan has left me with nothing but constant introspection.\u00a0\nAnd my, oh my, what a month it has been; putting us through tragic events, most of which left behind a trail of ash.\u00a0\nSpeaking of ash, let us talk about all those fires for a bit, even though by now you must be tired of the statistics, scrolling down to the next post hoping it's a cat doing something funny. Since the start of Ramadan, there have been seven major incidents of fire, the causes of which are yet to be determined. But if we are being honest with ourselves, it's unlikely the real causes will be revealed. In cases of fire of such scale, finding the fire's source is like looking for a needle in a haystack.\u00a0\nThere is an element of irony in these tragedies as well adding to the pathos of the situation.\nWhat were the chances that one of the largest wholesale markets in the country, Bangabazar, would be struck by the most horrible fate at a time when traders were supposed to reap the most profits? The same can be said about the Dhaka New Super Market fire. We saw traders howl, lose their minds, and watch as the fire burnt down all their hopes of a good year.\u00a0\nWe watched in shock but soon gulped back our emotions. And perhaps, this is the other heartbreaking addition to this tragedy, one which is not talked about or confronted as much.\u00a0There's no wall stronger than the collective apathy of citizens in an increasingly restrictive governance system. What cements this wall are the dying hopes, anger, and the genuine curiosity of being \u2013 of citizens who have had enough, but cannot speak of it, or do something about it.\nBehind such walls are systems (which were meant to protect us), straying further from accountability, and even further from ethical ruling. And when this becomes the norm, citizens are left with the options of either evacuating or making their hands dirty.\u00a0\nIf this isn't the case, let me ask you something \u2013 why hasn't any one of us asked for solutions to the fires yet? Why don't we have citizen panels in each ward or municipality where communities can come up and report their problems, so that faulty wires or electric lines from loose poles are mended? Why don't we talk about what a mammoth ask it is to expect our Fire Service heroes to put out a fire in Dhaka city, where almost every open waterbody in sight has either been dried up or polluted.\nAnd most importantly, why is it that, after so many incidents of fire, our authorities get away with vague statements such as \"long-term measures will be taken to tackle fire in the city\", without ever elaborating on what these \"long-term measures\" should be or how long citizens will have to wait to see these measures come into effect.\u00a0\nI guess it's hard to ask so many questions in this heat. But speaking of, what's being done about that too?\u00a0\nLast I checked, everyone in Dhaka is either blaming it on a severely stretched apocalypse theory or the climate change, the latter being the killer of all things good these days.But the problem with big issues like climate change is that the blame and the solution is always shifted to the powers beyond, far, far beyond our boundary. And to double down on this, our local institutions get away with doing absolutely nothing. What they could've done at this time is probably raise the percentage of green space the city has and go on drives to ensure that even for the sake of beautification, some trees get planted.\u00a0\nBut if they are asked why no initiatives have been taken, they'll tell you something about the manpower crisis or a lack of funding as obstacles to getting their jobs done.\u00a0\nIt's a tale as old as time. And yet it's a tale that we seem to never get tired of.\nEven when Pahela Baishakh arrives with promises to give everyone respite from such tragic events, to start anew and to come together as Bangalees, we end up scrutinising how and why people celebrate this day at all. Compartmentalisation has never been our strong suit \u2026or maybe it is and we do it exceptionally well so we don't have to face the music.\u00a0\nBut this is where I am hoping the celebration of Eid, especially after such trying times will bring a dose of magic, since the day and the days preceding it demands that we showcase the best version of ourselves. That we try to be better and do better than our previous versions. And personally, I've seen that is reflected by the many good souls who actively balance out the bad in this city.\u00a0\nWe've witnessed organisations and communities accumulate money just to feed those in need in their locality. Mosques who have kept their doors open for those who needed respite from the heat. We've seen people buy burnt clothes from Bangabazar and New Super Market, and inviting others to do the same. We've seen traders in the face of ruin, clean up the debris of their shops and start anew.\nWhat this tells me is not that Bangalees as a nation can endure, or be resilient in the face of adversity; because honestly, that bit is a given. But rather these acts communicate that we have no option but to move on, turn the page and start fresh. And when we do, I hope we do it with a vicious hunger \u2013 to be better, to do better and to be a reason for someone else's hope. That, in my opinion, is what we should be reflecting upon this Eid, amid the festivity \u2013 face the bitter realities and tell them, not today.\u00a0\nSo this Eid, I pray for a fresh pair of eyes, and a reason to hope. Or at the very least (once the festivities are over and we return to life as it is) be able to hope for and demand better realities than the ones we've been dealt.\n\u00a0\nNazifa Raidah is a sub-editor at The Daily Star.

The latest victim to have paid a price for expressing an opinion \u2013 a satire, for that matter \u2013 is Salina Akhter Shelley, poet and acting principal of Chattogram Port Authority Women's College. The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) suspended Selina on April 16, alleging that her Facebook status on the Arabic word Ramadan had \"hurt\" religious sentiments, and that such an act was punishable under the Digital Security Act (DSA). Five years since the infamous DSA was passed, we are still at a loss to understand what exactly constitutes \"hurting\" of religious sentiments, who is entitled to have hurt sentiments, and how one can objectively judge such a feeling.\nBy now, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the various ways in which the vague provisions in the DSA have been misused to target human rights defenders, opposition activists, journalists, writers, cartoonists, etc. The list of who can be a target of the DSA \u2013 and the scope of what constitutes an offence \u2013 keeps on increasing by the day, so much so that any slightly critical or creative thought can be (mis)interpreted as offensive. Its broad and ambiguous provisions have created a culture of fear, forcing people to self-censor their opinions. For how long will this draconian law \u2013 which has no place in a country that professes to be democratic \u2013 dictate our thoughts?\nAfter defending the law for the first three years of its enactment, the law minister in December 2021 admitted that it had been \"abused in certain cases\", adding that a six-member team had been formed to address some of the concerns raised nationally and internationally. In February 2022, he claimed that the UN had given some suggestions to the committee, which they were looking into. But then, the relevant UN offices told\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0that no such committee had been in touch with them in the two years since the minister announced its formation. Does it mean that all the talk of addressing concerns about DSA was just a charade?\nOn March 31, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk called for an immediate suspension of the DSA until necessary amendments were made, including repealing two sections and amending eight others. We are alarmed that far from delivering on his lofty promises of reform, the law minister rejected the possibility of repealing the two sections flagged by the OHCHR, and stated in no uncertain terms that the DSA was here to stay.\nThe government's reluctance to amend or repeal the DSA is an ominous sign, particularly as the national elections approach. What's equally concerning is that thought policing, popularised by the DSA, now seems to have spread across the country, with different institutions taking it upon themselves to criminalise diversity of thought, as evidenced by the case against Salina. We urge the authorities to withdraw the suspension against her, and stop criminalisation of freethinking by any means.\n",

Five years since the infamous DSA was passed, we are still at a loss to understand what exactly constitutes \"hurting\" of religious sentiments, who is entitled to have hurt sentiments, and how one can objectively judge such a feeling.\nBy now, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the various ways in which the vague provisions in the DSA have been misused to target human rights defenders, opposition activists, journalists, writers, cartoonists, etc. The list of who can be a target of the DSA \u2013 and the scope of what constitutes an offence \u2013 keeps on increasing by the day, so much so that any slightly critical or creative thought can be (mis)interpreted as offensive. Its broad and ambiguous provisions have created a culture of fear, forcing people to self-censor their opinions. For how long will this draconian law \u2013 which has no place in a country that professes to be democratic \u2013 dictate our thoughts?\nAfter defending the law for the first three years of its enactment, the law minister in December 2021 admitted that it had been \"abused in certain cases\", adding that a six-member team had been formed to address some of the concerns raised nationally and internationally. In February 2022, he claimed that the UN had given some suggestions to the committee, which they were looking into. But then, the relevant UN offices told\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0that no such committee had been in touch with them in the two years since the minister announced its formation. Does it mean that all the talk of addressing concerns about DSA was just a charade?\nOn March 31, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk called for an immediate suspension of the DSA until necessary amendments were made, including repealing two sections and amending eight others. We are alarmed that far from delivering on his lofty promises of reform, the law minister rejected the possibility of repealing the two sections flagged by the OHCHR, and stated in no uncertain terms that the DSA was here to stay.\nThe government's reluctance to amend or repeal the DSA is an ominous sign, particularly as the national elections approach. What's equally concerning is that thought policing, popularised by the DSA, now seems to have spread across the country, with different institutions taking it upon themselves to criminalise diversity of thought, as evidenced by the case against Salina. We urge the authorities to withdraw the suspension against her, and stop criminalisation of freethinking by any means.\n",
