In what will be the third round of litigation in the dispute between the Union government and the Government of the NCT of Delhi, a Constitution Bench will embark on interpreting a couple of phrases in Article 239AA, which confers a unique status for Delhi. It would indeed seem unnecessary for another Constitution Bench after five judges had rendered an authoritative pronouncement in 2018 on various questions that arose from Article 239AA. However, the Chief Justice of India, Justice N.V. Ramana, has made it clear that the reference to a five-member Bench will be strictly limited to the interpretation of a couple of phrases that were not examined by the earlier Bench, and no other point will be reopened. Broadly, the 2018 verdict, through three concurring opinions, had ruled that Delhi was indeed a Union Territory, but the Lieutenant Governor, as the Administrator appointed by the President, should act as per the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, in areas in which legislative power was conferred on Delhi\u2019s Legislative Assembly. Under Article 239AA, except for police, public order and land, the Delhi Assembly can make law on all other matters in the State and Concurrent Lists \u2018insofar as such matter is applicable to Union Territories\u2019. The mandate of the hearing is to declare what this phrase means, and whether it is one more limitation on Delhi\u2019s legislative, and by extension, executive powers.The 2018 ruling limited the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s domain by making it clear that not every decision required his concurrence. It had cautioned against the notion of representative democracy being negated, if legitimate decisions of the Council of Ministers were blocked merely because the Lieutenant Governor had a different view. The Lieutenant Governor\u2019s power to refer \u201cany matter\u201d on which he disagreed with the elected regime did not mean he could raise a dispute on \u201cevery matter\u201d. It is perhaps because of the underlying message that an unelected administrator should not undermine an elected administration that the Centre badly wanted a fresh reference to another Constitution Bench. It is indeed true that a split verdict by a two-judge Bench on the question whether \u2018services\u2019 fell under the Union government\u2019s domain or the NCT government has flagged the absence of a determination in the Constitution Bench verdict on the question whether Entry 41 of the State List (services) is within the NCT\u2019s executive and legislative domain. Entry 41 is not one of the excluded areas of legislation by the Delhi Assembly, but it has been argued that there are no services under the Delhi government and, therefore, it was not a matter applicable to the NCT at all. Settling this remaining question should give a quietus to the endless wrangling between the Modi government at the Centre and the Kejriwal regime in Delhi.",

        "full_article": "Debt servicing has become a rising concern for developing countries in recent times. With sluggish growth worldwide, the havoc caused by Covid-19 over the past three years, and global economic instability due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the revenues of governments in developing countries are sliding down, and the need for them to borrow is rising. As a result, debt repayment (principals and interests), as a ratio of either revenues or gross national income (GNI), has been becoming more and more difficult. For example, with the advent of Covid, the average ratio of external debt to GNI for developing economies (excluding China) jumped by 13 percentage points to 44 percent in 2020, as a result of which, developing countries had to struggle to retain their pre-Covid human development expenditures.\nThe concern for debt servicing has been echoed in the case of Bangladesh too. During the last fiscal year, the debt service to revenue ratio in Bangladesh rocketed to 81 percent, which was 56 percent in the pre-pandemic year. The increased level of debt service to revenue ratio means that today, if the government earns Tk 100 in taxes, it has to spend more than Tk 81 to pay off loans, as opposed to Tk 56 in 2019. This simply implies that because of higher debt servicing payment, there would be less availability of resources for development and other priority expenditures, including those required for post-pandemic economic recovery. This will put pressure on public finance. Resources that could have been spent on essential sectors like health, education or public investment are now being dedicated to interest payments.\nDebt repayment has to be undertaken with regard to domestic debt as well as external debt. In this context, three points are important. First, while domestic debt can be paid in terms of domestic revenue, foreign debt has to be paid in terms of foreign exchange accumulated through export earnings. Second, because of its nature, the government may have more flexibility in managing domestic debt servicing compared to external debt servicing. And third, sometimes, governments put more focus on external debt compared to domestic debt, even though domestic debt may be substantial. In Bangladesh, total public debt stood at USD 148 billion in fiscal year 2021, about 41 percent of GDP. Of this, external debt accounted for USD 62 billion, or 18 percent of GDP.\nAn in-depth look at the debt servicing of Bangladesh raises some structural public debt issues. First, interest payments on debts remain high because of higher rates on national saving certificates, expensive bank borrowing, delay in executing the projects, and irrelevance and overvaluation of projects. For example, the government provides higher rates of interest on national savings certificates due to the fact that people have limited sources for investing their hard-earned money. As a result, they opt to invest in risk-free national savings certificates, leading to a rise in government borrowing from expensive sources.\nSecond, because of revenue constraints, the government has opted to borrow more in recent years, including through non-concessional and hard-term loans from foreign lenders, resulting in higher repayments. The borrowing has been undertaken to finance current expenditures, but also to service existing debts, accounting for the largest part of the expenditure. Sometimes, the government has to borrow to finance big projects, the debt repayment on which is also substantial.\nThird, in many cases, some multilateral and bilateral donors have increased their interest rates and service charges, but have reduced the grace periods. For example, the World Bank, Bangladesh's largest multilateral donor, has reduced the maturity period of its loans from 40 years to 30 years and grace period from 10 years to five to seven years, respectively. The government has also taken some hard loans from bilateral donors like China and Russia. Overall, the country needed to repay its interest and principal amounts simultaneously, resulting in repayment amounts to increase year-to-year.\nFourth, with Bangladesh graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status, borrowing and debt repayment would become harder for Bangladesh in the future. In fact, since 2016, when Bangladesh graduated to a lower middle-income country (LMIC) category, loans started to get costlier. For example, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the second largest multilateral donor of Bangladesh, has enhanced lending from its non-concessional window. Since Bangladesh became a LMIC, the loans from ADB's soft window\u2014the Asian Development Fund\u2014have been decreasing year-on-year. Japan, the largest bilateral donor of Bangladesh, has also made its lending terms harder\u2014as it's been charging 0.10 percent interest rate in recent years against 0.01 percent a few years back.\nFifth, the average revenue mobilisation is quite weak in Bangladesh. In fiscal year 2021, the revenue mobilisation in Bangladesh was around 10 percent of its GDP. It is less than half of that of 25 percent in emerging and developing Asian countries. The revenue-GDP ratio in Nepal is 22 percent, In India, it is 20 percent and, in Pakistan, it is 15 percent. Therefore, Bangladesh has a lot of catching up to do.\nIn the context of the preceding discussion, a crucial question is: Is debt servicing at risk in Bangladesh? The answer is \"no\". Bangladesh's public debt at 41 percent of its GDP is way lower than the risk threshold of 70 percent estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The external debt service to revenue ratio in the country reached 10 percent in 2020, but it is still below the risk threshold of 23 percent. In Bangladesh, all external debt indicators are below their corresponding risk thresholds under the most extreme shock scenario, and the risks of debt distress remains low.\nBut there is no place for complacency. Bangladesh needs to be cautious about its debt and debt servicing. Even though the amount of external debt is still far below the risk threshold, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently directed all concerned authorities to take necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of the country's current position in future, regarding external debt.\nMeasures must be taken both on the revenue and the debt front. On the revenue front, the tax-base of Bangladesh must be expanded. The government had set an annual revenue collection target of 13.5 percent of GDP in 2020. Yet, last year, the actual revenue collection of Bangladesh was 9.4 percent of GDP. The government has expressed its commitment towards automating revenue administration and tax expenditure rationalisation. Thus, widening the tax base would require using technology for tax enforcement, while reducing expenditures on losing state-owned enterprises. The issue of export-diversification is a long-standing issue in Bangladesh. With global growth being sluggish, this is extremely important for Bangladesh if foreign exchange revenue is to be enhanced.\nOn the debt side, Bangladesh should continue seeking concessional financing to the extent that is possible, even though with LDC graduation it may prove to be a major challenge for the country. After graduation, Bangladesh would have to borrow loans at higher rates, which would further increase its debt-repayment amounts in the near future. In that context, the country should also look to attract non-debt creating financial inflows, such as foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, Bangladesh should ensure best use of the costly loans through quality implementation of projects as well as checking misuse and leakage of funds. Domestic borrowing should be further scrutinised, as it costs the economy more because of borrowing at higher commercial rates.\nAs far as the debt servicing of Bangladesh is concerned, right now, there is no need for anyone to panic. However, the country needs to be cautious so that unforeseen future shocks does not create any debt distress.\n\u00a0\nSelim Jahan\u00a0is a former director of the Human Development Report Office and Poverty Division at the UNDP.\n",

        "full_article": "What does one imagine when thinking of a house? A place that is safe and secure, that can provide privacy and, most importantly, protection from extreme climates. For someone belonging to the most vulnerable and marginalised communities of Bangladesh, living in regions plagued by constant natural disasters, the above-mentioned concept of \"a house\" is simply an unobtainable dream. But does that have to be the case?\nBangladesh is a hotspot for natural disasters. About 40 percent of global storm surges have been recorded here. Cyclone Amphan (May 2020) alone caused damages amounting to more than USD 130 million\u2014approximately 10 million people from 19 districts were affected and more than 330,000 houses were destroyed. Annually, there is not one but two cyclone seasons in Bangladesh. Aside from that, the country also experiences a wide selection of other climatic disasters\u2014namely flooding, river bank erosion, flash flood, drought, landslide, tidal surge, and salinity intrusion. In the year 2020, the combined loss from all these natural disasters amounted to a staggering USD 11.3 billion, according to a report by World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThis number alone reflects the desperate need for climate resilient housing, which could be the key to preventing hundreds of millions worth of property damage. The regions most affected by climate change induced disasters are also amongst the poorest in the country, where a huge number of people live in substandard housing. This constant battle with nature not only threatens the lives of these vulnerable people but also dwindles their chances of a prosperous future, as they have to constantly spend whatever little savings they have, in rebuilding their houses and their lives. While moving to the multipurpose cyclone shelters during disasters can save their lives, they may still end up losing all their livestock and belongings. Women risk exposing themselves to physical abuse, harassment and molestation, which are common occurrences in these cyclone shelters. Hence, it doesn't come as a surprise that people sometimes choose to risk their lives in order to save their livestock and protect their family members from abuse. All these could be avoided if they had resilient housing.\nSo, why is this an unobtainable dream? Firstly, there is a lack of awareness about the existence of feasible climate resilient housing. Concepts and designs for such housing are also not available for the general public who can afford them. The simplest of modifications can transform a substandard house into a disaster resilient one. For example, changing the shape of the roof can provide better protection against strong winds in cyclone prone areas; building the base of the house a few feet higher than usual is effective against tidal surges; adding a loft to the house design can help protect valuables during floods. It is just a matter of disseminating the knowledge and techniques to the local population.\nSecondly, financial barrier is a much bigger challenge. Climate resilient houses are more expensive and the poorer population hardly have the means to afford them or access bank loans. Lack of information regarding lending institutions, high interest rate and procedural complexities discourage a big percentage of the rural population from considering such options. Loans are offered mainly for income generating purposes so the people can eventually pay back.\nHowever, this scenario can be changed by popularising the concept of climate resilient housing.\nIf there is high demand for microfinance loan packages for such purpose, the sector will probably reconsider providing one since Brac (the largest organisation working in microfinance in Bangladesh) itself is looking for innovative sustainable solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. A loan which covers 90 percent of the construction cost for a specific resilient house design appropriate for a specific area could be an excellent option. Given these housing designs are fairly feasible, even the poor should be able to pay back the loan. Another loan package idea could be for a single climate resilient room in their regular house. This would be enough to protect the clients and their belongings from disasters. A third option could be a package providing enough fund to make the current house disaster resilient, in which case the lending organisation can also assign an expert for consultation.\nNot only can this help thousands of people, it can also be an incredible business opportunity for lending organisations and developers. If the developers are fixed, building cost estimates will be more accurate and they can further assure that the house is built according to the design so the loan money doesn't get wasted. Additionally, the communities can also benefit from a new income generating source, as the materials and workforce will be local. This also means that the locals can obtain the knowledge and skills to become experts at building climate resilient houses.\nBeing able to live in a house that will protect from climatic disasters is not an unobtainable dream, not even for the most vulnerable and marginalised people. It is just a matter of spreading awareness and organising. So why not work towards this and save hundreds of lives from the next environmental disaster?\n\u00a0\nMahzabeen Mahfuz\u00a0is Research Officer at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).

        "full_article": "The suspension of travelling ticket examiner (TTE) Shafiqul Islam has already been withdrawn.\nRailways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan today admitted that his wife lodged a complaint against the travelling ticket examiner (TTE), who fined three individuals who had been travelling without tickets, claiming to be the minister's relatives. He also confirmed that the three passengers are indeed his relatives. The minister, however, said his wife did not ask the railway authorities to suspend the TTE. She simply lodged a complaint against him. Through all these incidents, the issue has neither been resolved, nor has it reached a conclusion. Instead, some serious issues have been unearthed, which demand that we carefully analyse this string of events.\nTTE Shafiqul Islam fined three passengers who were travelling without tickets. This action prompted the Pakshey Division of Bangladesh Railways (BR) to temporarily suspend him. The punishment was delivered swiftly. So swiftly that Shafiqul had to be informed through a telephone call. Md Nasir Uddin, Pakshey divisional commercial officer (DCO) of the railway, said that the TTE had been suspended due to misbehaving with passengers.\n\nOn behalf of the three passengers, Md Emrul Kayes Pranto filed a complaint with the railway's high officials, accusing the TTE of misbehaving with them. The DCO provided a written statement to The Daily Star's Pabna representative, Ahmed Topu. The Daily Star also talked with Shafiqul. None of the three passengers could be reached for comments. Pranto did not leave his contact details on the complaint; he only included his name and the date.\nLet us start off with the written complaint. He mentioned that he could not collect any tickets from the Ishwardi railway station counter at around 2:15 AM. As the train arrived, he got into the AC compartment in a hurry. The TTE came to check the ticket within 30 minutes. The TTE asked for Tk 1,500 (500 each), but refused to provide a receipt.\nAllegedly, in an irritated tone, he added, \"Does your father own this train?\"\nEmrul Kayes wrote in the complaint that TTE Shafiqul Islam appeared to be intoxicated.\u00a0\nTTE Shafiqul Islam denied the allegations to The Daily Star, saying they were completely untrue. That nothing like that had happened. The three had identified themselves as the railway minister's relatives. But as per the law, Shafiqul collected Tk 1,050 from them, gave them receipts and sent them to the \"Shovon\" class. The TTE also mentioned that other railway officials were present at the scene. According to railway rules, travelling without a ticket is a punishable offence.\nIt is normal for a TTE to check tickets within 30 minutes of the beginning of a train journey. If a passenger gets on the train without a ticket in case of an emergency, the TTE will collect the fare from them, along with a fine. The passenger will be able to continue the journey upon showing the receipt. However, he or she will not be allowed to occupy a seat. If someone tries to exert power and expect special benefits by citing a relationship with the railway minister, it is only natural that a dispute will break out. In such a situation, the possibility of imposing a double fine cannot be written off. TTEs asking for bribes isn't something that will surprise many, either. Such incidents regularly occur on trains. All the allegations deserve to be investigated.\nA three-member investigation committee was formed in order to explore the complaints and the overall incident. But no such investigation took place.\nThe DCO, in his written statement to The Daily Star, has repeated Pranto's statement word-by-word. Pranto alleged that the TTE seemed intoxicated. DCO Nasir wrote, \"The complainers felt that TTE Shafiqul Islam was under the influence of drugs.\" But without conducting an investigation, how could he make such derogatory comments to the media?\nAdditionally, Nasir also mentioned, \"Shafiqul Islam suffers from an inferiority complex. He is also suffering from some kind of mental stigma.\"\nWas his choice of words against his colleague lawful and ethical\u2013and that, too, based on an individual's complaint, one who didn't even leave behind their contact details?\nNo high-ups or the railways minister have so far commented on Nasir's statement.\nIn the last 50 years of Bangladesh Railway's history, such prompt action against an almost \"anonymous tip\" is unprecedented. Our minister, however, thinks such \"prompt\" action a sign of \"progress\"!\nInitially, the minister denied knowing the three individuals. However, later on, he identified and accepted them as his relatives. Did the minister's wife lodge a \"complaint\" or ask for the TTE to be fired during her phone call to the railway officer?\u00a0\nApart from the minister's answer, this is what we have gathered from Ekattor TV reporter Parvez Reza's report:\nPranto's mother, Yasmin Akhter Neepa, told Ekattor TV in a phone call, \"The minister's wife is her\u00a0cousin. She came to visit Ishwardi during the Eid holidays.\" She also mentioned that the minister's wife gave a heads-up to the station manager about her son, Pranto, travelling with two other individuals.\nHowever, after the TTE created a commotion regarding tickets, the minister's wife called him. But the TTE did not pick up the phone. Instead, he fined them and verbally abused them. Later on, the minister's wife called up the DCO and asked him to fire the TTE. Pranto's mother, Yasmin Akhter, was asked whether the minister knew about the incident.\nShe claimed that she had spoken to the railways minister the very next day. Minister Nurul Islam Sujan had told her that he was forced to mention certain things about the incident to assuage the public.\nNeepa also alleged that the minister had asked her to ignore whatever he had mentioned during the press conference.\nSo, how should we summarise the incident?\nWe can detect an attempt to bury the incident by revoking the suspension order of TTE Shafiqul Islam and the railways minister's acceptance of responsibility for his relatives' behaviour.\nThe answer to the question of how a seemingly random individual's (Pranto) complaint and DCO Nasir's statement became identical is no longer unknown. It is also not a mystery whether the minister knew about the decision to suspend TTE Shafiqul Islam or whether he himself ordered the suspension. If the minister did not know about the suspension, are we to believe that the minister's wife simply called a high-ranking officer of a public organisation, based on which, he suspended another officer? Does this mean Bangladesh Railway is a puppet to a minister's spouse's will?\nNow, the railways minister must face a few more questions for the sake of the public:\n1. Why did he initially feign not knowing of the three individuals who tried travelling without tickets?\n2. His wife called the Ishwardi Station Manager to inform him about three of her relatives travelling by train. Did she ask him to set aside tickets for them, or to allow them to travel without tickets?\n3. Did his wife call the railways officer of Pakshey to \"complain\" about TTE Shafiqul Islam, or did she ask him to \"fire\" the person, as claimed by Pranto's mother?\n4. DCO Nasir used derogatory terms like \"intoxicated,\" \"suffering from inferiority complex\" and \"psychological stigma\" while referring to Shafiqul Islam, without conducting any investigation or verification of the facts. What would be the minister's comment regarding this?\n5. Was this the first such call from the railways minister's wife, or is she in the habit of making such calls?\n6. Why did the railways minister \"deny\" knowing the three individuals initially? Can a sworn minister of the cabinet hide the truth or deny it?\n7. If the answer to the above question is \"no,\" what does the constitution tell us about his next steps?\n\u00a0\nGolam Mortoza\u00a0is editor of The Daily Star Bangla.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Today, May 9, we mark Europe Day and commemorate the vision of the then French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, who presented in 1950 a far-sighted blueprint to prevent war from happening again. This is traditionally a time to remember the founding values of the European Union and its evolution since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, including the progressive construction of political and economic links amongst its member states.\nAt present, the European Union (EU) counts 27 Member States and 450 million citizens within its borders. Those citizens are not only citizens of their own nations, but also of the EU, entailing numerous rights and opportunities. The EU has fostered the largest single market in the world, with free movement internally of people, goods, services, and capital.\u00a0 The euro was launched as a currency in 1999 and now stands as the second largest reserve currency in the world. The EU has constructed strong central institutions, including the European Parliament, European Court of Justice, Council and Commission.\u00a0\nThe EU also engages in the wider world and takes its international responsibilities seriously, not least as the largest provider of development and humanitarian assistance worldwide. More than 140 EU Delegations around the world support trade, political, economic and development ties with their host countries.\nHere in Bangladesh, many of the EU's Member States have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of their relations with Bangladesh and the EU itself will do the same next year. Such an important staging post is an opportunity to reflect on how much our ties with Bangladesh have deepened in five decades. This engagement now goes way beyond traditional areas such as trade and development assistance and encompasses policy priorities such as connectivity, climate change, renewable energy, human rights, security and digitalisation. The EU's new Global Gateway strategy\u2014which is designed to deliver investment in sustainable, high quality projects in infrastructure and other linkages\u2014affords new opportunities for EU-Bangladesh relations. As does the EU Indo-Pacific Strategy, which was adopted last year and which foresees deeper engagement with our partners in this region.\nOn the trade front, the EU is the largest destination for Bangladesh's exports, reaching around 20 billion euro annually. There is much potential for increased investment by European businesses, particularly if the business climate can be further improved. Our Team Europe partnerships\u2014bringing together the EU and EU Member States\u2014are delivering cooperation with Bangladesh in new fields, including decent work and the green transition. This complements our longstanding development assistance in areas such as education, food security, governance and support to civil society. As a major provider of humanitarian assistance, we will continue to stand by Bangladesh's endeavours to provide a temporary home to Rohingya refugees and to secure their voluntary and safe return to Myanmar as soon as possible.\nWhilst the European Union has delivered stability and peace within our own borders\u2014recognised in the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU in 2012\u2014the European continent is now again tragically scarred by war. The Russian aggression in Ukraine, with its unfathomable cost in human lives, suffering and economic devastation, has lasted almost three months. It is a violation not only of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also of the UN Charter. It has far-reaching consequences for the whole world.\nFirst, in the chilling message it sends regarding the violability of internationally-recognised borders. This is not only a fight between the Ukrainians and the Russian aggressor. It is also a fight for democracy. For countries' right to self-determination and against recolonisation.\nSecond, in the economic hardship the Russian invasion is inflicting through rising commodity prices, threats to food security and disruption to transport and other modes of connectivity. All this compounds the economic hardship wrought on the globe by the Covid-19 pandemic. The EU and its partners are striving to address this hardship, including through the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) initiative for food security in the most vulnerable countries.\nThird, in the war crimes that have been reported on Ukrainian soil. As the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, so powerfully articulated when she witnessed on April 8 the site of atrocities inflicted on Ukrainian civilians in the small town of Bucha, \"The unthinkable has happened here. We have seen the cruel face of Putin's army. We have seen the recklessness and the cold-heartedness with which they have been occupying the city.\"\nThe EU is doing its utmost to ensure a return to peace and to support the people and democratically elected government of Ukraine in this terrible struggle. As close neighbours, EU Member States have risen to the challenge of providing a safe berth to millions of Ukrainians. More than 11 million people have fled their homes since the conflict began. Over five million have left for neighbouring countries, where ordinary people have opened their homes to provide shelter.\nThe UN estimates that more than 12 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and shelter. The EU and its Member States are delivering massive support to the people of Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance and urgent supplies. Last week Poland and Sweden, along with the European Council and European Commission, convened a High-Level International Donors Conference for Ukraine in Warsaw on 5th May which yielded further pledges of support for Ukraine. The international community's solidarity in support of the suffering Ukrainian people is a ray of hope at a bleak time.\nAs we mark\u00a0 Europe Day 2022 in Dhaka, we will reflect on the bonds that have been forged amongst European nations and the wide-ranging relations that the EU and its Member States are building with Bangladesh. We will also hold the people of Ukraine in our thoughts and hope that peace returns swiftly to our continent.\n\u00a0\nCharles Whiteley\u00a0is Ambassador/Head of Delegation of the EU to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Winnie Estrup Petersen\u00a0is Ambassador of Denmark to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Guillaume Audren de Kerdrel\u00a0is Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires a.i. of France to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Achim Tr\u00f6ster\u00a0is Ambassador of Germany to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Enrico Nunziata\u00a0is Ambassador of Italy to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Anne van Leeuwen\u00a0is Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\u00a0Francisco de As\u00eds Ben\u00edtez Salas is Ambassador of Spain to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and\u00a0Alexandra Berg von Lind\u00a0is Ambassador of Sweden to the People's Republic of Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "The prime minister has made a very significant remark, as reported in this newspaper, regarding the ruling party taking initiatives to get the BNP to participate in the forthcoming elections. She said, criticising some of her party members, that those who were not confident themselves of winning the polls did not want the BNP to join the elections. This is a million-dollar statement, given the fact that, over the last 10 years, particularly during the election time, we saw every ploy being used to make sure that the BNP did not, or could not, participate in the JS elections. And given the incredibly impolitic nature of its raw leadership, the BNP fell hook, line, and sinker for this strategy.\nWe have always stressed that boycotting elections is not a politically wise step. Needless to say,\u00a0 the BNP also rues boycotting the elections. Admittedly, BNP has had to encounter encumbrances in carrying out its political activities, but that is no reason to deprive its supporters from exercising their franchise.\nWe take note of the PM's remarks, but believe that it is not for the ruling party to persuade its political opponent to participate in the polls. However, as the party running the administration, it is the AL's bounden duty to ensure that the playing field is level and that all candidates are able to conduct their political activities without any hindrance. It has been evident that, for the BNP\u2014and for all shades of opposition\u2014the space for organising rallies, criticising government policies, and exercising the right to differ, has become constricted.\nThe only way that a participatory election can be held, and a free and fair poll can be conducted is by allowing the democratic institutions (the EC, in particular), and the agencies that help them to run elections, to work freely without interference from the administration. In fact, it is a good time to delineate the administration from the ruling party\u2014an essential divide that has been almost entirely blurred over the last 10 years. The apron string that ties the police (and other law enforcing agencies) and the civil administration to the ruling party must be released for good, and must work under the direct supervision of the EC during the polls. The EC has to exercise its remit in full and apply the laws and rules without fear. It has a difficult task since much of its credibility has been denuded by the manner in which the previous EC had run elections. We would suggest that the use of EVM without the consensus of all the stakeholders would be ill-advised.\nExpressed intentions must manifest in deeds. For the ruling party, its work is cut out. If it really means what it says, it should desist from using the office to influence the polls, and create confidence in the minds of stakeholders. Then, and only then, can the elections to the JS be participatory.\n",

        "full_article": "The incident involving a travelling ticket examiner (TTE) of Bangladesh Railway has laid bare how difficult it is for government officials to do their job honestly, and how easy it is for people with connections to exploit them or the system in which they work. Shafiqul Islam, the TTE, was suspended a day after he showed the audacity to fine three individuals who claimed to be relatives of the railways minister, after boarding a Dhaka-bound train at the Ishwardi junction without tickets. They were in an AC cabin and wanted to remain there\u00a0but the TTE gave them tickets for a non-AC carriage, which wasn't to their liking. And he was punished for that. Even if their allegation of misconduct is true, the repercussions wouldn't have been as serious or prompt had the aggrieved trio not been linked to the minister.\nCan the minister avoid the responsibility for what had happened in his name? On Sunday, he revised his earlier comments about the identity of the trio, admitting that they are indeed his relatives and that it was his wife who had lodged a complaint against the TTE. He, however, claimed that she didn't ask the railways authorities to suspend him. He also said the suspension order was given \"without following due process\" and so it will be withdrawn, adding that the whole incident was \"embarrassing\" for him. We commend the minister for his frank admissions and the quick decision to right a wrong. But is reinstating the TTE enough to counteract the wrong messages given by earlier acts/decisions? Can it remove the bad taste left by his relatives and eager-to-please officers? Will he do what's necessary to ensure such things are never entertained again, at least in his ministry?\nWe think the incident should be taken as a lesson in what happens when the mechanisms of accountability weaken and public officials become vulnerable to outside influences. This is but a symptom of a larger disease that saw politics corrupt the administrative culture to a point in which only political connections matter. Over the years, we have seen how corruption festered and became the norm of the day as a result. We have seen how honest officials got punished, and how dishonest officials, politicians and their cohorts got rewarded. If the authorities are sincere about not seeing a repeat of the TTE incident, they should make an example of these corrupt influences by holding them accountable, and reward those who still take their jobs seriously so that others may be encouraged.\n",
