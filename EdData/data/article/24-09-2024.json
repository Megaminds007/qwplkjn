        "full_article": "On the face of it, the allegations are rather serious \u2014 the adulteration of ghee (clarified butter) \u2014 used in the making of Tirupati\u2019s famed laddu prasadam \u2014 with \u2018foreign fat\u2019. The charges were made by no less than Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu himself, and his son and Minister Nara Lokesh, on September 18, against his predecessor and Leader of the Opposition, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP). Since then, the issue has snowballed into a free-for-all, with leaders of Mr. Naidu\u2019s central alliance partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking an \u2018independent investigation\u2019. Former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has even sought a Supreme Court-monitored probe. Unsurprisingly, as The Hindu has reported, the adulteration charges do not seem to have deterred devotees from making the arduous journey to the hilltop temple, nor has it slowed down the sale of the laddus. The timing of these charges, close to State elections, where the BJP faces tough challenges to retain power in Haryana and Maharashtra, raises concerns of their being politically motivated, and indeed irresponsible, having been made by a constitutional authority of Andhra Pradesh.In the quality test by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF), in Anand, Gujarat (National Dairy Development Board affiliated) the laddu samples were received on July 9, and the results submitted on July 16. But Mr. Naidu announced its findings in September. Moreover, the analysis mentions a range of what it considers to be \u2018foreign fat\u2019 \u2014 from soybean, olive, sunflower, rapeseed, and cotton seed, to fish oil, palm oil and beef tallow and lard. The extent of the contamination (\u2018foreign fat\u2019) in the ghee which was sent by the Tamil Nadu-based supplier A.R. Dairy in Dindigul, is unclear. The CALF has also added an array of caveats. The apex body for food quality checks is the Ghaziabad-based National Food Laboratory (NFL). So, why did the State government not send the samples to the NFL for final verification? It is to be noted that on July 29, an executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) had said that A.R. Dairy would be blacklisted as its samples had contaminants beyond \u2018vegetable oil\u2019. In the wake of this controversy, the argument from the Hindutva right to remove temple administration, including the TTD, from the state\u2019s purview and return it to \u2018hereditary custodians\u2019, is opportunistic and faulty, as the Supreme Court has upheld the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments laws across States. An issue that must be limited to quality control should not be allowed to metamorphose into one of communal muck-raking.

A crore-plus had queued online for a chance to be at the concert. Price was no bar. So, why do concerts keep drawing legions of fans in an era of online streaming platforms? After all, we are just a click away from being able to listen to our favourite artiste\u2019s latest number.\u00a0\nMore than music | Because concerts are just not about the music. They are an experience. Especially when one is willing to spend tens of thousands to attend one. It\u2019s a show with all the bells and whistles: elaborate stage set-ups, immersive sound systems, and mood atmospherics. Plus, being able to breathe the same air as your musical icon provides the ultimate high. Add to this fellow fans singing along to favourite tunes, and the concert is the perfect setting for innate group behaviour.\u00a0\nBe seen | Then there\u2019s the \u2018I-was-there\u2019 factor. King of Pop Michael Jackson\u2019s one and only concert in India, way back in 1996, is stuff of folklore. The 35,000 who were there have stories \u2013 and bragging rights \u2013 for generations. For the lucky few, on very lucky occasions, concerts can also be the only time fans may have a live interaction with their star. Recall the viral video from an Adele concert last year where the superstar defended a fan who was being harassed by security. For the fan it was like being recognised and touched by divinity.\u00a0\nTwo-way street | For artistes too concerts can be places they can truly connect with fans. During her Eras Tour concert in Singapore earlier this year, Taylor Swift got one of her backup dancers to drop some Singlish, sending local Swifties into raptures. Concerts are unique in many ways. But their biggest USP is that for star devotees, they can create memories for a lifetime.\n\n",

Which makes the scandal of alleged adulteration in TTD\u2019s prasad a highly sensitive matter. Following the allegations made in public, all supplies were reportedly suspended and vendors replaced, including those for ghee. But the adulteration itself needs further scientific probe \u2013 from place of procurement of samples to the period of adulteration. It also needs to be seen what quality checks high footfall places such as Tirupati have in place, how frequent is the food monitoring, and SOP in event of breach. How frequently do state regulators oversee food inspections in places of worship, nationwide?\nEverything needs checking | Adulteration is institutionalised nationwide. Community feeding as a mass activity is common across states, mass distribution of cooked meals is also state activity. The successful mid-day meal scheme is hobbled with cases of adulteration where kids have fallen severely sick. Leave aside fertiliser/ pesticide residue in veggies and fruits, or antibiotics in poultry, or lead and arsenic in water. Spices and cooking mediums remain among the most adulterated items. A recent Stanford University multi-country study of lead chromate that took samples from 17 Indian cities, found 14% of all samples had high levels of the metal. Presence of lead was off the charts in samples from Patna, and high in samples from Guwahati and Chennai. On milk, cooperatives may have powered the industry\u2019s growth, but the unorganised sector still constitutes over half the sector, including for processed products such as ghee. In 2016, Parliament was told 2 in 3 Indians consume milk that has detergent, caustic soda, urea or paint. Last Aug, data shared in Parliament showed over 25% of food samples tested in 2022-2023 had adulterants.\nInadequacy of inspection | Food inspections network is woefully lacking, failing to tackle adulteration with the goal of rooting it out. What typically happens is a rash of raids, seizures and bans follows any instance of adulteration that goes public \u2013 recall the Maggi masala mix case, or recent ethylene oxide scandal \u2013 followed by no-one-quite-knows-what-happened. The alleged Tirupati contamination is breach of people\u2019s trust. But food adulteration everywhere continues apace \u2013 and regulators do not look like they\u2019re winning the battle.\n\n",

        "full_article": "For Bangladesh, the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) holds more significance than usual as this is the first major global summit the country is taking part in following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime. Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus flew out of the capital at around 5:10am on September 23 to attend the UNGA, as well as a number of meetings. Given his international stature, we expect to see opportunities open up for Bangladesh to build meaningful, strategic collaborations that will help with its reform agenda in the short term, and with trade, economic growth and development in the long term.\nThe chief adviser is scheduled to address the UNGA on September 27, where he will present the context of the anti-discrimination student movement that evolved into a mass uprising in the face of state-sponsored violence, ultimately ending the 15-plus years of Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian rule. He is also set to highlight the reform initiatives that his government has undertaken, which we believe is a crucial part of his UNGA agenda. Presenting before the world our people's aspirations for a strong, fair and equitable justice system, impartial state machinery that serves only the people, and a democratic system where no one's voice is suppressed is key to gaining acceptance and cooperation from the international community\u2014both at the government-to-government and people-to-people levels.\nOn the sidelines of the UNGA, the chief adviser is scheduled to meet US President Joe Biden on September 24. This meeting is considered significant as it's the reflection of US support for the interim administration in Bangladesh, according to diplomatic sources in New York. Plus, it's not usual for a US president to hold bilateral meetings during the UNGA. So, we hope to see a new strategic partnership emerge out of this meeting that will strengthen our ties with the US and protect our interests at the same time. Another high-level meeting is set to take place between Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, which we expect to kick-start the process to normalise relations between the neighbouring countries after weeks of tension surrounding Hasina's fall and her being sheltered in India.\nThe chief adviser is also set to hold bilateral meetings with several heads of governments, and some of our strategic and development partners, including the EU. Bangladesh will also host a high-level reception on September 24, marking the 50th anniversary of its UN membership, and will attend a high-level side event on the Rohingya crisis.\nAs it goes through a massive transformation following the events of August 5, Bangladesh has yet to find an even footing. Our economy continues to struggle, our foreign exchange reserve crisis is still concerning, and our export earnings are still not up to the mark. Years of corruption and irregularities have left some lasting wounds, and to heal them, we need help from our partners. We hope the interim government will be able to garner the support needed to smoothen Bangladesh's reforms and aid in its interests moving forward.\n",

        "full_article": "The anti-discrimination student movement has raised many questions and speculations about the causes of the apparently monolithic government's sudden fall and the unexpectedly quick success of the students' movement. Common people, active politicians, and intellectuals are puzzled by the responses of the students, many of whom belong to Gen Z. The issue that frequently comes up in the discussion of the uprising is why Gen Z, despite knowing the fatal consequences of the protest, participated in the revolution. What provoked it to defy the brutal forces exercised by the government? Many people attribute Gen Z's action to its addiction to the virtual world.\nIn his op-ed, Hisham Mohammad Nazer discusses how video games, movies, and TV shows might have influenced the students' participation and course of action in the movement. However, in the formal and informal discussions about the movement, what has largely been overlooked is the students' deployment of time as an instrument of resistance to the oppressive power. As a strategy to keep their movement alive and not to lose momentum, they subverted the Gregorian Calendar by extending the month of July, and thus ensured the continuation of their movement without any break.\nI try to understand the students' appropriation of time to overcome the temporal barrier from a literary and cultural perspective. In Indra Sinha's novel Animal's People, the transnational corporation named Kampani uses what Rob Nixon calls \"strategies of distantiation\u2026to defuse the claims of the afflicted.\" In terms of time, this distantiation refers to disrupting the relationship between the present and the past and extending the temporal distance between them (for example, through procrastination) with a view to obfuscating any causal connection between the events taking place in two different points of time.\u00a0 As a result, the past loses its significance in relation to the present and sinks into the dismal abyss of oblivion; it fails to hold any sway over the present. This temporal distantiation can undermine any movement.\nThe anti-discrimination student movement ran the risk of being affected by temporal distantiation. The protest that started in early July became more intense later in the month because of the brutal killing of a number of students, children, and passersby by the law enforcement authority. The death of innocent people had already made July a month of mourning.\nUnder the circumstances, when the movement entered the month of August, the protesters faced a twofold challenge. First, being a new month, August marked a temporal distance from July, and thus a symbolic rupture in the protest, which had the potential to weaken the struggle. Second, August threatened to erase the memory of July. August was considered the month of mourning to commemorate the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members on August 15, 1975. Observing this month with solemnity would have relegated the loss incurred by the nation in July 2024 to the background. This anxiety of the students finds expression in many Facebook posts that questioned the validity of observing only August as the month of mourning. They asked why July could not be considered a month of mourning, too. \u00a0\nTo deal with this twofold challenge, Gen Z needed to devise a strategy that could counter the potential amnesia brought about by temporal distantiation. It wanted to resist any rupture between the present and the past, between now and then, and hence it appropriated time. Time, as the French philosopher Michel Serres argues, is not linear, but rather \"multidirectional\" and \"mobile.\" Consciously or unconsciously, Gen Z seemed to have capitalised on this fluid nature of time. It disrupted the normative understanding of time by not conforming to the Gregorian calendar and by extending July up to the 36th day when the government eventually fell. This extension of the month of July, on the one hand, prevented temporal distantiation that August could have caused, and on the other hand, it left Gen Z's month of mourning distinct from Awami League endorsed month of mourning. Gen Z demonstrated an innovative and subversive understanding of time that bolstered its movement against authoritarianism and led to its success.\nGen Z's temporal awareness finds expression in its post-revolutionary activity too. Immediately after the successful uprising, it started drawing graffiti on the wall depicting the sacrifices the nation had made and the desire for a better Bangladesh. On the one hand, this graffiti is a constant reminder of the past struggle and the potential of the student-mass collective, and on the other hand, it is a warning for the present and future governments against any kind of oppression and dictatorship. The graffiti is intended to resist temporal distantiation by connecting the present to the past and the future.\nIf Gen Z can disseminate its temporal awareness among the masses and political parties, we can expect positive changes in the country. However, we must wait to see how long Gen Z can resist temporal distantiation and how effectively it can instil temporal awareness in others.\nDr Md. Alamgir Hossain is an assistant professor of English at the University of Rajshahi.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "For Dr Muhammad Yunus, the United Nations is more than just a global platform\u2014it is a \"second home.\" Over the decades, he has been a frequent presence at the UN, advocating for social business, poverty eradication and inclusive development. The UN's endorsement of his work, including his role as a key voice in the fight against global inequality, solidifies his profound connection with this multilateral body. As head of Bangladesh's interim government, his return to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) stage feels like a natural continuation of his lifelong mission, bringing his vision for a more equitable world to the forefront of global diplomacy.\nIn recent years, Bangladesh's diplomatic efforts have often been characterised by symbolic gestures, such as \"hilsa diplomacy,\" where the export of the prized fish to neighboring countries like India served as a goodwill token. Similarly, \"mango diplomacy,\" which involved gifting the country's famous sweet mangoes to foreign dignitaries, aimed to foster friendly ties. While these gestures contribute to soft power, Bangladesh now needs to pivot toward more pragmatic and results-driven trade diplomacy.\nThis UNGA provides a well-timed platform for Bangladesh to rectify the recent borderline diplomatic demarche on alleged \"megaphone diplomacy,\" where public pronouncements have been seen as taking precedence over bilateral diplomatic negotiations. Additionally, strategic engagement on its sidelines offers an opportunity for spot-on bilateral or multilateral discussions as to the emerging \"exile diplomacy\" or \"asylum diplomacy.\" The talks could highlight the involvement of neighbouring power in facilitating exiled leaders to partake in a form of pre-empted \"reverse megaphone diplomacy.\"\nSimilarly, Bangladesh can remain open to \"track II diplomacy\" to address regional conflicts or disputes. It could facilitate more effective negotiations, which are also beneficial to mutual trade, by involving academics, think tanks, and NGOs in discussions with neighbouring countries like India and Myanmar on sensitive topics. Additionally, through \"humanitarian diplomacy,\" particularly by providing critical support during crises like the Rohingya situation\u2014where it has already played a prominent role by hosting refugees and seeking international assistance\u2014Bangladesh strengthens its position on the global stage.\nBangladesh can further promote the sustainable use of ocean resources through \"blue economy diplomacy\" by building partnerships focused on maritime security, sustainable fisheries, and ocean resource management, thus establishing itself as a leader in harnessing the Bay of Bengal's potential while preserving ecological balance. Additionally, through \"green trade diplomacy,\" Bangladesh should strive to lead in sustainable production by implementing green manufacturing practices, especially in the RMG sector, and strengthening collaborations with EU countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, pioneering green technology to enhance its green production capabilities.\nBangladesh's potential to strengthen its international economic position is immense given the global economic shifts and opportunities for near-shoring or friend-shoring and diversified trade relations, albeit its economic landscape is undergoing significant transformation. Just as African nations effectively utilised UN platforms and strategic partnerships to secure and advance the African Continental Free Trade Area, Bangladesh now has a valuable opportunity to similarly leverage the UNGA to invigorate South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, address the longstanding challenges and set the stage for enhanced regional cooperation and economic growth.\nThe recent postponement of EU-Bangladesh partnership agreement negotiations also highlights the need for renewed engagement to resume these stalled discussions. It offers a strategic chance to address outstanding or unresolved issues, such as strengthening current trade relations and negotiating future post-LDC Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+). This is crucial for preserving the competitiveness of Bangladeshi garment products, particularly in light of its impending safeguard measures. Additionally, it offers a scope to help diversify our export basket beyond the RMG sector, which has driven the country's economic growth but also poses risks due to over-reliance.\nThrough sideline meetings, Bangladesh can actively advocate for potential trade deals, such as Free Trade Agreements and Preferential Trade Agreements, to stimulate growth in key sectors like apparel, pharmaceuticals, leather goods, and information technology. Strengthening connections with emerging markets in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East can further enhance these efforts. For instance, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between India and the UAE illustrates how successful collaborations can flourish through diverse dialogue platforms.\nSimilarly, France has established strong trade connections with African nations through initiatives like the Francophonie Summit, while Spain leverages its tourism sector to strengthen trade relations through platforms like FITUR (International Tourism Fair). India's Act East Policy also exemplifies effective enhancement of trade relations with Southeast Asian countries via various bilateral agreements. To further its digital trade capabilities, Bangladesh should pursue e-commerce agreements with leading ASEAN and Nordic countries, to improve its digital infrastructure, strengthen fintech initiatives, and implement robust cybersecurity measures, which would attract foreign investment and boost digital exports.\nThe sidelines of UNGA 2024 offer a crucial opportunity for Bangladesh to enhance its trade diplomacy and safeguard its economic future. By focusing on key sectors, Bangladesh can effectively position itself for a successful transition from LDC status.\nDr Iftekhar Ul Karim\u00a0is adjunct assistant professor at ZNRF University of Management Sciences.

        "full_article": "On the other side of unremitting inflation, a product of no-holds-barred free market economy, is decline in purchasing power of people ---only more so of the low- and fixed-income groups. If shrinking purchasing power is not compensated by corresponding rise in income, the inevitable consequence is deepening poverty. At a time Bangladesh economy was about to witness a turnaround early in the post-Covid-19 period, the Russo-Ukraine war not only halted the process but also threw the prospect of an economic recovery into uncertainty. The main culprit was the sudden price hike of fuel oils for which Bangladesh has to overwhelmingly depend on import. The wind taken out of its sails, the country, like many others with little or no domestic energy sources, discovered itself in a critical situation. Under a system of kleptocracy of the lumpen moneyed and business class unduly served by their bureaucratic cohorts, outrageously unequal wealth distribution only pushed more people to get marginalised.  So when a public meeting held under the title \"Eliminating Poverty and Inequality and Strengthening Social Security\" on Saturday last comes up with the disclosure that poverty rate in the country has gone up to 20.5 per cent from 18.7 per cent over the past two years, there is nothing to be surprised. Add to this, the urban poverty that saw a rise from 14.7 per cent to 20.5 per cent. Read between the lines, this indicates that urban employment and income have either shrunk or remained static for the low-income people who can barely save for the rainy days. Even if income does not fall, families can suffer income erosion when prices of essentials skyrocket. This has been happening for the past two years or so and there is no sign yet market volatility will ease soon. There are two aspects of this reverse journey on the road to economic progress for a significant portion of the population. One is the financial vulnerability of this segment of population to unrelenting inflation often driven by intriguing market players; the other is either such people's failure to raise their income from self-employment or from employers who employ them for a pittance. Exploitation of both opportunities and labour explains the atrocious inequality. Otherwise, the national wealth generated annually should not have widened the economic disparities so grossly. Bhutan is a good example of smaller GDP which has been judiciously used, particularly in ensuring rational distribution of its wealth, for alleviation of its poverty. When businesspeople can make rampant profit and the unduly privileged close to the kleptocratic circle can loot and launder billions of Taka, it tells a different story of deprivation on the one hand, and filthy affluence on the other. Now the deliberation of the Saturday's public meeting aired concern about Bangladesh's attainment of the much hyped Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. It is a genuine concern, no doubt but if the macroeconomic health and wealth creation are taken into account, the country should not miss the target. But if the microeconomic situation in relation to rising poverty comes into consideration, the path may be tortuous but the goals not quite unachievable. The key issue here is economic reform with special emphasis on ensuring greater share of created national wealth for the marginalised in order to ameliorate the lot of the poor during the next six years.",

There is now almost a universal consensus that the state needs to be repaired before a national election is held in order to put the country on the path of a genuinely liberal democratic dispensation. Heeding this popular demand, the chief adviser of the interim government Professor Muhammad Yunus has announced the formation of six commissions- tasked to submit recommendations on reforming six critical domains of the state, viz. the constitution, public administration, the police, judiciary, electoral system, and curbing corruption. Reforming the state is a very complex and difficult task. Besides, there is widespread demand and aspiration for reforms among the masses. However, compromises may have to be made due to the limited time and resources of the interim government, and the impossibility of materialising all aspirations at the same time. Therefore, priorities have to be set at all stages of this upcoming reform exercise. Now, the question arises as to how the government will fix priorities, and what would be the basis or premises for such reforms. Besides, the width, depth, timing and coverage of reforms will also have to be addressed. Decisions will have to be made on whether to undertake procedural reforms only by keeping the structure intact, or to overhaul the whole structure. For this, priorities have to be set through objective and unbiased analysis before execution of reforms. This is not an easy task, as the objectives and interests of various parties may often diverge. Therefore, the concepts and ideas for reforms will have to be clearly spelt out by following an objective methodology, and their width, depth, and boundaries will have to clarified based on major aims and objectives of reforms. Professor Golam Rasul of IUBAT has suggested a framework for undertaking the review exercise for reform. These include: deciding on the fundamental policies cum criteria for reforms, collection of reform proposals and their preliminary screening, analysing the proposals based on their importance and applicability, and then prioritisation of recommended reforms. Determination of major aims and objectives is the first step in the reform process. However, it should not be difficult to arrive at an agreement on these because of the massive support for reforms following a mass upsurge and people's revolution. This agreement can be arrived at through dialogue with all relevant parties and stakeholders, and by reconciling their interests in the light of national priorities. A fundamental criterion will be to establish a discrimination-free state alongside minimising the scope for re-emergence of another autocracy. Apparently, all political parties now seek a liberal democratic system that does not provide room for flourishing of fascism. Another basic criterion for reform should be to endow the state with the capacity to maintain law and order as well as ensure politico-economic stability. It has been observed across the globe that the popularity of interim governments gradually diminishes with the passage of time. Therefore, the time aspect should also be considered during prioritisation of needed reforms. The first among the basic policies and criteria for reforms should be to maintain social order, and safeguard people's lives and properties. The law-and-order situation must be improved, and the security of people should be ensured. Priorities should therefore be attached to those measures that aid in the improvement of law-and-order situation. The second objective should be ensuring politico-economic stability, as politics and economy are intertwined with each other. Priorities should therefore be attached to those reforms that aid in generating people's employment, income and livelihood, removes economic disparity, and reduces inflation.Identification of existing discriminations in the state apparatuses, and their gradual eliminations -so that all citizens irrespective of race, colour or religion get equal opportunities - should also be one of the fundamental priorities in any reform exercise. Consequently, matters related to fundamental rights, social justice, and removal of discriminations must be prioritised. As the masses are seeking a liberal democratic order, priorities should be attached to those reforms that support the strengthening of democratic institutions, and enable those bodies to run independently and efficiently by shunning politicisation, promoting citizens' rights, and ensuring transparency cum accountability. As time is of essence, the likely tenure of the interim government should also be taken into consideration while deciding on the reform package, as popular support may wane with the passage of time. The proposals for reforms must be obtained from all sections of society, as all citizens should own the subsequent implementation. They include all political parties, students and teachers, the civil society, mass media, NGOs, and the working classes. All proposals should be evaluated in the light of aforementioned criteria, and any proposal that does not tally with those should be discarded. The proposals should be evaluated objectively without any bias, and those passing the preliminary test based on basic criteria should then be included in a list of reform priorities based on their importance and conformity with the major reform objectives.In the final stage, the prioritised reforms will have to be implemented phase-wise. This will require proper action-plans, identification of implementation challenges, steps for overcoming those challenges, appropriate measures for implementation, regular monitoring of progress, and making adjustments when needed. The principal task of the interim government is to create a conducive environment for holding a free and fair election, so that a competitive cum participatory polls takes place. It will then have to hand over power to the democratically elected government, so that the elected administration can complete the reform process. Besides, necessary legal cover will also have to be assigned to reforms undertaken by the interim government. Proper selection, prioritisation, and execution of reforms will reassure the stakeholders about the democratisation process in the country. Effective stewardship will be required at all stages of this reform exercise. The country's citizens have high hopes that this will materialise in due course under the pragmatic leadership of Professor Muhammad Yunus. \nDr Helal Uddin Ahmed is a former editor of Bangladesh Quarterly.

        "full_article": "On Friday (September 20), the lead news of a national daily confirmed the fishery adviser's earlier stance that no hilsa would be exported to India this year. However, just the next day, on Saturday (September 21), a statement released by the commerce ministry gave the go-ahead to the export of 3000 tonnes of hilsa to the neighbouring country before the Durga puja festival to begin on October 8. In response to reporters' query, fishery adviser said it (permission to export) was given independently by the commerce ministry. And this was done upon a request on the occasion of Durga puja in India, she added. Interestingly, the permission for hilsa export is usually given by the fishery and livestock ministry.In this connection, the commerce adviser told the media after holding a meeting with the IMF representative that the decision to export hilsa to India was made in the greater interest of the country. Now the question is, did this realisation (that hilsa-export to India is a matter of 'greater national interest') of the commerce adviser occurred suddenly to him? If that is the case, then why the fishery advisers' stance, which she reiterated on several occasions in the past including in an interview with the BBC (the interview was published on September 11), was never challenged by him or other advisers before? There is nothing wrong about the export of hilsa or any other listed commodity to India.According to the nation's export policy (2015-18), hilsa is listed as an exportable commodity where conditions apply. And during the last five years of the past government, export of hilsa to India took place regularly before the Durga puja festivals. NBR data show that during 2019-20 fiscal when hilsa export to India began, only 476 tonnes of hilsa were exported that earned the country USD3.9 million. In the last fiscal (2023-24), hardly above 800 tonnes of the fish was exported to India which fetched USD8 million. The amounts of the country's national fish finally reaching the markets of West Bengal in India was actually far less than that permitted by the government. So, from that perspective, as a foreign exchange earner, hilsa has not contributed much so far to the national exchequer through its export to India. So, the furore created over exporting or not exporting hilsa to India did never made an economic sense.But the question here is about the government's overall policy, say on hilsa export. The hilsa issue gives one the reason to believe that the government has taken an adhocist approach to many issues among which hilsa export is one. Also, it shows that its policy stance is amenable to pressure or request. This may send a wrong signal to the business community who can capitalise on the government's wavering resolve. This also speaks of a lack of coordination among the advisers. The interim government needs to come out of its attitude of tentativeness on issues of serious national importance. Given Bangladesh's dependence on the readymade garment (RMG) as the major export earner, the government needs to look for other potential export earners to diversify its export base. Hilsa, is one aquatic product whose export potential needs to be fully exploited. Though hilsa is caught also in Myanmar and India, Bangladesh is the world's largest producer of this fish and fishermen haul around 600,000 tonnes of hilsa annually, most of them from the sea. This accounts for 12 per cent of the country's total fish production.So, special attention should be given to this unique exportable item from Bangladesh so it may earn more hard currency for the country than it has been doing so far.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

While political bias is not new, district-level discrimination has intensified, with Bogura suffering across nearly every sector just because opposition party's founder hails from the area. The Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogura has not hosted a single match since March 9, 2006, leaving it abandoned and used for grazing cattle. Despite 70 to 80 per cent of the airport's construction being completed, the project was abruptly halted in 2006. Road maintenance is often delayed or overlooked, and essential medical equipment is frequently lacking in local hospitals.Azizul Haque College, fully qualified for promotion to a public university, remains overlooked simply because of its location in Bogura. This disregard for regional educational growth reflects the overall neglect of the district.Discrimination extends to industries and trade as well. Bogura often misses out on government incentives granted to businesses in other districts, deterring investment and hindering economic progress. Local small businesses face greater scrutiny and obstacles than those in neighboring areas, with government contracts rarely awarded to them.Moreover, many government officials from Bogura have been reassigned or dismissed, with new appointments often coming from other regions. This undermines local governance and exacerbates the challenges faced by Bogura's youth, who encounter disproportionately high barriers to government employment. The district has a significantly lower clearance rate for the BCS exam compared to other regions, suggesting a deliberate exclusion of Bogura citizens from civil service positions.Political retribution has pushed Bogura into the shadow of its formar self, with its people enduring systematic and calculated punishment.\nAl MahinShoikotDepartment of Accounting and FinanceNorth South University[email\u00a0protected]",
