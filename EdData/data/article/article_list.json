Newly minted Prime Minister Pushpa Kumar Dahal\u2019s Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre) was part of a six-party alliance led by the Nepali Congress that collectively finished just above the absolute majority mark in the parliamentary elections held in November. The CPN(M-C) won just 11.13% of the votes, getting 32 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives. The party\u2019s poor performance was hardly any disincentive for Mr. Dahal to claim the post of prime minister from his party\u2019s senior partner, the NC. After being denied this, legitimately, in his blatant hunger for power, he immediately took the expedient route of aligning with the leading Opposition party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) led by Khadga Prasad Oli, securing the Prime Minister\u2019s post, for a period of half of the term of the new government. The new coalition led by the UML and the Maoists includes the newcomer Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and five smaller parties. The RSP promised a break in the political wheeling-dealing that has characterised Nepali politics but the fact that it jumped at the first chance to join an opportunist alliance \u2014 its leader Rabi Lamichhane is now Deputy Prime Minister and a Home Minister in the government \u2014 would have belied the hopes of its adherents.The renewal of the alliance between the two \u201cleftist\u201d parties \u2014 barely years after the falling out between the UML faction led by Mr. Oli and the Maoists led to a change of government with the NC aligning with the Maoists and a smaller UML faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal besides other parties \u2014 suggests that the loaves of power, rather than ideology or principle, are what are more tempting for Mr. Oli and Mr. Dahal. The \u201cLeft\u201d alliance had after all broken up due to legitimate grievances with Mr. Oli\u2019s authoritarian attitude and his manoeuvres to hold on to power. For Mr. Dahal to repeat his habit of performing political volte-faces and to join hands with Mr. Oli despite a clear mandate for the pre-election coalition that he was a part of, suggests yet another period of opportunistic political wrangling that would hamper governance in Nepal. Mr. Oli has managed to make the best out of an unfavourable situation for his party by securing nominations to the post of President and Speaker from his party, reportedly as part of the arrangement with Mr. Dahal, besides gaining plum ministerial posts to help with the usual politics of patronage. But by subverting mandates for short-term gains, the Maoists and the UML are only perpetuating instability and lowering the trust of the people in the democratic system in a country that endured two upheavals to become a constitutional republic.. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nNepal\n\n/\n\npolitics",

Even as it helps the team stay on course for a spot in the ICC World Test Championship final next summer, the victory aids in clearing a few clouds that had set over the team after the defeat suffered at the hands of England in the Men\u2019s T20 World Cup last month and the ODI series loss to Bangladesh earlier this December. The third and final ODI in Chattogram \u2014 a dead rubber \u2014 had indeed brought the first whiff of fresh air, with Ishan Kishan smashing the fastest-ever double hundred and providing a glimpse of the exhilaratingly new approach India can adopt in the lead up to the 2023 Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup. The Test series triumph completes that cycle of positivity. There were many individual performances that will ease nerves and warm hearts. Rishabh Pant\u2019s return to his swashbuckling best, Cheteshwar Pujara\u2019s century-making touch, left-arm unorthodox spinner Kuldeep Yadav\u2019s successful reintegration \u2014 his non-selection for the Mirpur Test despite a player-of-the-match performance in the first Test in Chattogram notwithstanding \u2014 Shubman Gill\u2019s maiden hundred and R. Ashwin\u2019s all-round brilliance will boost India ahead of the home series against Australia in February-March.But for all the happiness and delight, there are two discordant notes \u2014 India\u2019s travails against quality spin bowling and the form of Virat Kohli and K.L. Rahul. It is now accepted that the current era of Indian players do not compare favourably with those from the previous generations when it comes to countering spin. With multiple series shoe-horned into the season, top cricketers, especially those who play all three formats, have no time for domestic cricket. It is no surprise that Shreyas Iyer, who grafted his way through the First Class route, is currently the best player on turning tracks, a fact reiterated in the Test series. This malaise has been exacerbated by the overall rough patch Kohli and Rahul are going through. Though Kohli seems to have turned over a new leaf in limited overs cricket, that confidence has not seeped into his Test batting. In 36 innings since his last century at Eden Gardens in November 2019 against Bangladesh, he has totalled just 917 runs at 26.20, with six fifties. Rahul last made a half-century at the start of the year, eight innings ago. There will be a month\u2019s respite from these worries as India shifts focus to the six T20Is and six ODIs at home against Sri Lanka and New Zealand. But the scrutiny will return when Australia comes calling.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncricket\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nBangladesh\n\n/\n\nICC Test Championship\n\n/\n\nTest cricket",

NAI is the central repository of government\u2019s non-classified records but it is riddled with big gaps, including in seminal national events such as the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars and the Green Revolution. Repeated requests to different ministries to transfer non-current files to NAI have fallen on deaf ears. Historian T Raychaudhuri had underlined six decades ago that NAI\u2019s public records can facilitate smooth working of the country\u2019s administration in the same way as memory oils man\u2019s day-to-day life. But an institutional culture of secrecy has put paid to this potential.\nIndia is a far cry from the US where records are automatically declassified after 25 years. NAI is not even seeking timely declassification. Its problem is that the defence ministry has not shared any files since 1960, while multiple other departments including agriculture, rural development, and food and consumer affairs have not shared anything ever. The NAI director general has correctly said that what is at stake is nothing less than \u201closing a large part of our history since Independence\u201d.\nThe British Library is a much smarter resource to study colonial India, but we should at least have atmanirbharta in the postcolonial period. This is not of concern for historians alone. NAI provided invaluable information for the building of the Central Vista. Its cartographic treasures can be similarly useful in foreign policy. A look at older government orders can help improve the newer ones. The beginning has to be a clear directive to all ministries to share files with NAI. State-level archives have to be likewise strengthened. However, archive administrators must also step up strongly. The invitation to reading rooms and online curated tours on the UK\u2019s National Archives home page itself is indicative of its energetic citizen outreach. In India both the moth-balled and bhadralok stereotypes of libraries need to be corrected. Because only a public that feels invested in record-keeping puts pressure on government to improve it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Regulatory approval in October by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee to test GM mustard in field trials was a significant development. The mustard hybrid, DMH-11, was developed by a team from Delhi University. Based on ICAR guidelines, it is undergoing tests for seed production. Furthermore, GoI informed Parliament recently that the effect of GM mustard on honeybees and other pollinators shall be studied under the supervision of ICAR. India\u2019s premier agricultural research institute is at the heart of the regulatory process to ensure that GM mustard meets relevant standards.\nGiven this context, a media statement on GM mustard by ICAR on December 23 is disquieting. It says that any unauthorised opinions on the subject, including by former employees, which are different from \u201cstated documentations and decisions\u201d by regulatory authorities, can trigger action in public interest. It\u2019s a gag order that doesn\u2019t seem to have a legal basis for people not employed by ICAR. For sure, ICAR and the scientific establishment need to call out fake news and scaremongering. However, the statement goes well beyond that. It\u2019s plausible for scientists to differ from the establishment\u2019s \u201cstated documentations\u201d on the basis of their individual assessments. Putting that out in the public domain is part of the system of checks and balances as no one is infallible.\nThis newspaper has consistently supported expanding GM crops beyond cotton once they clear the necessary regulatory process. However, the approach of ICAR is unsupportable. If anything, it can lead to doubts where there should be none. The biggest losers then would be Indian farmers and the scientists who have developed DMH-11. The most effective way to dispel doubts about GM crops is to be transparent. Dubious administrative measures will be counterproductive. ICAR needs to focus on its role in establishing the prescribed safety standards and simultaneously educating people on the technology. Gag orders will only whip up fears. The silver lining in this episode is that ICAR\u2019s media statement also answers some recurring questions on GM mustard. It helps. We need more such answers, not gag orders.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Two incidents of politically connected violence have again brought to light \u2013 for the umpteenth time, one may add \u2013 the link between unchecked power and unchecked violence, both results of the erosion of institutions responsible for preventing such developments. The arbitrary nature of this kind of violence is as alarming as it is revealing. It shows how a macabre sense of impunity is leading random political actors to use violence as a\u00a0first\u00a0resort, almost like a reflex, to whatever end they seek. Because, they know, there will be no consequences.\nIn the first incident, we have the local correspondent of a national newspaper who was brutalised after he sought to collect information on illegal brick kilns at the Rangunia upazila of Chattogram. Reportedly, he was held by a local UP member at gunpoint, and kept hostage for over an hour. He was also beaten repeatedly. Even the local UP chairman, who was clearly in cahoots with the attackers, all using their political identity to protect their parochial interests, threatened over phone that \"nothing will happen\" if a journalist is killed. He was telling the truth, by the way. Nothing, as we know from experience, does happen if you're on the right side of power.\nIn the second incident, we have an even more random encounter in which the attackers and the attacked were not supposed to be in a conflict situation to begin with. It happened in the capital's Shahbagh area on Saturday. M Inamul Haque, convener of the Sharbajan Biplobi Dal party and former director general of River Research Institute, was reportedly distributing anti-government leaflets in support of a planned half-day hartal called by his party. As he was speaking to a reporter, a random ruling party supporter accompanied by others approached him, and slapped him in the face. He was also verbally abused. Although the attacker's identity remains unknown, the casual manner in which he assaulted Haque while being filmed speaks volumes about the situation in which we presently live.\nThese incidents show how political intolerance and lack of accountability for political violence and repression are having a spillover\u00a0effect across the board. One gets the feeling as if violence is being franchised, with anyone with the remotest link to the ruling party feeling entitled to it, regardless of their motive. Working journalists are often either witness to or victims of such violence. But opposition activists and government critics are more at risk, with the political scene getting heated up ahead of the next general election.\nOver the last few months, we have seen how various state apparatuses and institutional tools have been used to intimidate opposition political activists and leaders. Many activists died in clashes with police. Many more were arrested and jailed. The onslaught of the Digital Security Act is ongoing.\nThe environment that has been thus created is decidedly skewed against anyone who speaks up against the powers that be. We cannot help but worry about the long-term destabilising effects of such an environment on the society. This has to stop. We, therefore, urge the higher authorities to consider the gravity of the situation and take steps to stop the vitriolic rhetoric in politics and prevent politically motivated violence, both on and off-line. They must establish intraparty discipline and bring the perpetrators to book, as well as honour people's right to safety and freedoms of expression, organisation, and assembly.\n",

        "full_article": "The ruling Awami League's 22nd council concluded on Saturday, electing Sheikh Hasina as its president for a record 10th consecutive time. Obaidul Quader made a hattrick as the general secretary. The national triennial council ended, as expected \u2013 even before the council \u2013 without any major changes, although the political situation of the country is different this time compared to that of the last two councils.\nThe last two AL councils were held in 2016 and 2019, and they each took place after the national elections in 2014 and 2018, respectively. But this time, the council was held a year before the national election. Another point to note is that the main opposition camp, BNP, appears to have woken up out of a political hibernation, displaying its organisational strength on the streets. So, the new committee of the ruling party is set to face a double challenge \u2013 preparing for election 2023 and politically countering the BNP movement.\nIn the political arena, the popular perception is that the Awami League is more organised, stronger and more successful when it is the opposition. Starting from the Six-Point Movement of the 1960s, which was the precursor to the 1971 Liberation War, to forcing the BNP government to introduce a constitutional caretaker government provision in 1996, the now-ruling Awami League has historically been seen as a strong, formidable, and vocal opposition on the streets.\nBut now the question is whether the AL, as a ruling party, is capable of countering the opposition camp's campaign and preparing for the upcoming election at the same time. This may prove difficult given that the party has become used to smooth sailing and calm waters over its 14 consecutive years in office, during which it has successfully managed to stifle any opposition.\nIt is a well-accepted maxim that parties weaken organisationally with long stints in power. And that holds true for the ruling Awami League. Yes, it is true that the opposition could not put up a strong enough challenge after the January 5, 2014 election and till June of this year. To be more specific, one could even say that it was not the ruling party but the government which was successful in tackling the opposition. That is why we often hear that bureaucrats run the show, not politicians.\nOn the other hand, with the Awami League in office for 14 years, its grassroots leaders and workers enjoyed a free run because of the opposition camp's organisational weakness. They indulged themselves in other matters (particularly rent seeking), because there was hardly anyone from the opposition to challenge them on the field. And it is no secret that the Awami League General Secretary, Obaidul Quader, told his party leaders and workers to \"save the party\" by quitting the practice of \"exchanging money for positions in local-level committees.\"\nAs the AL relied on administration and law enforcers to counter the opposition's campaign on the streets, the party men let loose. So, while the government became stronger, the ruling party did not stay in step. Rather, AL's grassroots leaders and activists have now become more divided. Intra-party conflict has become rampant. Distance between ministers and lawmakers, lawmakers and district leaders and local Awami League leaders have widened.\nIt may sound like an exaggeration, but one need only look at the fact that more than a hundred people were killed centring the union council elections of 2021, with most of them belonging to the ruling party itself, due to intra-party feuds.\nBefore the polls, the party announced that rebel candidates who work against the party would be expelled. And many were expelled but before the council. But it is also said that there was a general amnesty granted to those party men. No doubt, this concession was made keeping in mind the next general election and the opposition's campaign. But, will those who revolted once or defamed Bangabandhu or tarnished the image of the government or the party bring any good for the Awami League? Most importantly, how do the survivors of their rebellion view this general amnesty? Could it further widen the prevailing intra-party rift?\nThe current AL committee is almost unchanged from the previous one, with only a few reshuffles. But when the party, or more appropriately the government, is going through the toughest time of its recent history due to allegations of corruption, the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine war, a grim post-Covid economic situation and the opposition's diligent campaign, would it be able to overcome the crises simply by relying on the old guard?\nAny new council brings some changes to the party in order to reorganise it. But this time, the ruling party appears to want to rely on its old faithfuls to face the upcoming challenges. Of course, only time will tell how far they can go relying on its old stalwarts. One thing is clear: the ruling party is passing through a very critical time on many fronts, and a slip, any slip on any front, would prove very costly indeed.\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n\n",

It was a timely visit to muster military, economic, and political support for a long-term engagement. Apparently, the trip was organised to keep up the \"war momentum,\" as the Republicans are poised to take over the House next year and to counter the waning support for war.\nWhat we have observed is a fruitful \"marketing of war.\" Zelensky got a USD 50 billion package, more ammunition, backing of the US lawmakers, media attention, and support for a protracted war. An unconditional backing from the US gave him the fuel to continue. The event has also brought the US and Nato closer to a larger engagement.\nThe event reminds me of another joint session address by President Ngo Dinh Diem (1957) of South Vietnam before a full-scale Vietnam war. The contents of the speeches of the two leaders resemble each other. Both sought support for a common cause \u2013 \"democracy.\" After 65 years, Vietnam is still a communist country. In fact, arguments for democracy should be evaluated considering a nation's history, geography, and culture. Some cultures inherently favour centralism \u2013 Western-style democracy does not fit.\nTake Russia as an example. The country has been the target of many conquerors because of its vast resources. Its geography has evoked centralised governance and totalitarian regimes. A strong centre has been \"cardinal\" to its survival. Its vulnerability has increased after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Protecting such a large territory with only 145 million people is a serious military challenge for Russia \u2013 any external provocation could instantly trigger their survival instinct. Nuclear umbrella is their built-in defence.\nThe Chinese experience of democracy is very similar. The Republic of China established after the Qing Dynasty by Dr Sun Yat-sen in 1912 lasted until 1927. In 1928, Kuomintang took over the republic under General Chiang Kai-shek. Then in 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC) took over under Mao Zedong. Historically, a centralised \"power sharing system\" has managed China's large population and the integrity of the nation. CPC is upholding the culture. General Kai-shek ruled Taiwan under martial law.\nAfghans decide through \"loya jirga,\" a tribal council that conducts the executive, legislative, and judiciary function in their society. Military decisions of the tribe are also taken by the jirga. This is how they have defeated every invader. Now, they are Muslims, which they were not one thousand years ago. Similarly, the Arabian example of some form of pluralistic rule was the Rashidun Caliphate, 632-661 AD. Then dynasties took over.\nI admire liberalism, freedom, and democratic values. Perhaps, we could not have come this far without democratic institutions and values. But to apply those in every country, culture, and situation goes against the principle of \"cultural relativism.\"\nZelensky's trip has sustained the stalemate in Ukraine. We do not have an effective organisation (sorry, United Nations) that could put pressure on the warring parties to negotiate. Both the US and Russia are actively lobbying for support in different parts of the world for a long-term war. Sanctions are hurting Russia and the world. Lest we forget, a weakened Russia sensing an existential threat could unleash a nuclear war.\nFunding a \"stalemate\" in Ukraine and calling it a \"fight for democracy\" is a debatable narrative in a multicultural world. Our goal should be immediate ceasefire and negotiation. Saving human lives precedes all other statements and strategies.\nPreviously, in another article in The Daily Star (August 3, 2022), I had appealed to the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) for peace. Muslim migrants did stop the infighting among the Arab/Jewish tribes through the Charter of Medina (622). This time I will include the Vatican to my appeal and cite the example of Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended a 30-year war.\nI hope all nations would come forward to establish peace in Ukraine. We should also refrain from any activity that supports the stalemate or the escalation. We should all continue to \"de-market war.\"\nDr Abu NM Waheeduzzaman is a professor of marketing and international business at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.\n",

        "full_article": "The declining reserves of fossil fuels and their detrimental effects on the environment have thrust nuclear power into the limelight. However, the 1986 Chernobyl and 2011 Fukushima accidents involving fission-based nuclear reactors that are in use now have heightened our doubts about nuclear technology's ability to provide a safe way of generating clean power.\nWithin the context of climate change, nuclear fusion is an attractive alternative because it does not produce greenhouse gases (GHG). Besides, unlike fission, fusion has a low burden of long-lasting dangerous radioactive waste. Fusion's by-product is helium, which is a non-toxic, non-radioactive gas used to inflate children's balloons.\nSo what is nuclear fusion? It is a process in which two lighter nuclei, typically isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium and tritium, combine together under extreme conditions to form a heavier nucleus, releasing inexhaustible amounts of energy. A \"fusion reactor\" buried deep in the Sun's interior produces, in one heartbeat, the energy equivalent of 100 billion nuclear bombs.\nMajor challenges: \n\nThe quest to make fusion a viable power generation option has turned out to be extraordinarily difficult.\nYet, since the 1950s, scientists have been working tirelessly to develop a fusion reactor with the following goals in mind: 1) achieve the required temperature of more than 100 million degrees Celsius to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction, 2) contain and control the staggering levels of heat generated in the plasma, which is an ultra-hot soup of gases in which the electrons are completely detached from the atomic nucleus, 3) keep the plasma together at this temperature long enough to get useful amounts of energy out of the reaction, and 4) obtain more energy from the reaction than is used to heat the plasma to the ignition temperature.\nThe breakthroughs: \nIn August 2021, researchers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California were able to ignite a fusion reaction that lasted for a fraction of a second by pumping laser beams into a tiny chamber containing deuterium and tritium. A year later, researchers in South Korea were able to keep the reaction going for 30 seconds at temperatures beyond 100 million degrees Celsius.\nThe energy yield of both the experiments was modest and less than the energy needed to ignite the reaction.\nPhysicists have also devised two competing techniques to control the hot plasma and keep it away from the walls of the container. They are magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The one that is preferred by fusion researchers is a magnetic confinement device called \"tokamak.\" This workhorse of fusion is a doughnut-shaped chamber in which magnetic fields keep the plasma in perpetually looping paths without touching the walls.\n\nThe energy gain breakthrough: \nOn December 13, 2022, the US Department of Energy announced that scientists at the NIF had managed for the first time ever to achieve a \"net energy gain\" \u2013 producing more energy in a fusion reactor than was required to drive the process. In particular, it produced three million joules of energy, with about two million joules going into the reaction. (To put the unit of energy into perspective, the kinetic energy of a one tonne car moving at 100 mph is one million joules.) In the past, the energy input far exceeded the energy output from a fusion reaction.\nSo what does this mean for the possibility of creating effectively unlimited amounts of clean energy? Fusion researchers denote the ratio of output energy to input energy with the letter Q. Although in this experiment Q=1.5, fusion reactors will have to reach a threshold of Q=10 before energy generation can be considered practical for commercial use.\nWhile the amount of energy released in the experiment at the NIF is barely enough to boil water for a few cups of coffee, in some ways, it is a scientific milestone in the sense that scientists and engineers, after \"more than 60 years of research, development, engineering and experimentation,\" achieved a Q-value of greater than one.\nMoreover, once vetted by outside experts, this landmark achievement will be a big step forward towards clean, limitless energy \u2013 at least four million times more energy than is produced by burning coal or oil, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency. More importantly, it promises to stimulate interest in fusion-related research, and possibly leverage funds for building fusion reactors.\n\u00a0\nFuture outlook: \nConsidered to be the holy grail of energy, nuclear fusion has the magic wand that will most certainly solve our lingering energy problem.\nHaving said that, significant challenges still remain. Researchers are now actively working on improving laser technology and reactor design at several laboratories in the US and around the world. But the high cost of research and very expensive hardware limit most of the work to multinational consortia.\nThe 35-nation International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) under construction in Cadarache, France is the world's largest tokamak fusion reactor. Since its inception in 2006, ITER has progressed in fits and starts. It is beset with technical delays, a labyrinthine decision-making process, and cost estimates that have soared from EUR 5 billion to around EUR 20 billion.\nRegardless, ITER will move the world a step closer to creating energy that is inherently safe and clean, using controlled thermonuclear fusion.\nUltimately, though, the achievement of fusion energy production with Q greater than one does not necessarily mean a green energy revolution is imminent. It will probably be years, likely a decade or so, before fusion power bears fruit. And it is also not clear if fusion will ever be cheap enough to radically transform our power grid.\nDr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US. He is also one of the authors of the book \"Nuclear Fusion \u2012 One Noble Goal and a Variety of Scientific and Technological Challenges\" (Intech Open, London, UK, 2019).\n",

        "full_article": "Two incidents of politically connected violence have again brought to light \u2013 for the umpteenth time, one may add \u2013 the link between unchecked power and unchecked violence, both results of the erosion of institutions responsible for preventing such developments. The arbitrary nature of this kind of violence is as alarming as it is revealing. It shows how a macabre sense of impunity is leading random political actors to use violence as a\u00a0first\u00a0resort, almost like a reflex, to whatever end they seek. Because, they know, there will be no consequences.\nIn the first incident, we have the local correspondent of a national newspaper who was brutalised after he sought to collect information on illegal brick kilns at the Rangunia upazila of Chattogram. Reportedly, he was held by a local UP member at gunpoint, and kept hostage for over an hour. He was also beaten repeatedly. Even the local UP chairman, who was clearly in cahoots with the attackers, all using their political identity to protect their parochial interests, threatened over phone that \"nothing will happen\" if a journalist is killed. He was telling the truth, by the way. Nothing, as we know from experience, does happen if you're on the right side of power.\nIn the second incident, we have an even more random encounter in which the attackers and the attacked were not supposed to be in a conflict situation to begin with. It happened in the capital's Shahbagh area on Saturday. M Inamul Haque, convener of the Sharbajan Biplobi Dal party and former director general of River Research Institute, was reportedly distributing anti-government leaflets in support of a planned half-day hartal called by his party. As he was speaking to a reporter, a random ruling party supporter accompanied by others approached him, and slapped him in the face. He was also verbally abused. Although the attacker's identity remains unknown, the casual manner in which he assaulted Haque while being filmed speaks volumes about the situation in which we presently live.\nThese incidents show how political intolerance and lack of accountability for political violence and repression are having a spillover\u00a0effect across the board. One gets the feeling as if violence is being franchised, with anyone with the remotest link to the ruling party feeling entitled to it, regardless of their motive. Working journalists are often either witness to or victims of such violence. But opposition activists and government critics are more at risk, with the political scene getting heated up ahead of the next general election.\nOver the last few months, we have seen how various state apparatuses and institutional tools have been used to intimidate opposition political activists and leaders. Many activists died in clashes with police. Many more were arrested and jailed. The onslaught of the Digital Security Act is ongoing.\nThe environment that has been thus created is decidedly skewed against anyone who speaks up against the powers that be. We cannot help but worry about the long-term destabilising effects of such an environment on the society. This has to stop. We, therefore, urge the higher authorities to consider the gravity of the situation and take steps to stop the vitriolic rhetoric in politics and prevent politically motivated violence, both on and off-line. They must establish intraparty discipline and bring the perpetrators to book, as well as honour people's right to safety and freedoms of expression, organisation, and assembly.\n",

        "full_article": "In a country where the vast majority of ordinary patients \u2013 those with easily diagnosable diseases \u2013 are often deprived of the care and treatment that they deserve, it's easy to overlook the small minority of patients afflicted with rare diseases. But their plight is no less dismal. As well as enduring problems that patients in general do in terms of access, cost and quality of care, those with rare diseases also suffer from misdiagnosis, lack of awareness on the part of doctors, limited treatment options, etc.\nAs a recent report by this daily shows, these factors, coupled with lack of policy response from the health authorities, make this group of patients suffer disproportionally. The report presents a number of cases to illustrate their vulnerability. There is the case of Iraboti Roy, 40, a patient of the rare Myasthenia Gravis disease, who died a day after a doctor used a sedative on her that allegedly caused the death; the case of Jakia Abedin, 36, another Myasthenia Gravis patient, who lost two babies just days after giving birth to them in 2006 and 2014; the case of Anisur Rahman, 9, suspected to be suffering from a premature ageing problem, the treatment of which is not available in his home district; the case of Sumona Monzur, also a Myasthenia Gravis patient, who had to wait for 12 painful years before her condition could be diagnosed.\nMyasthenia Gravis \u2013 a chronic autoimmune, neuromuscular disease \u2013 is one of approximately 7,000 rare diseases said to have been discovered so far. These conditions affect the lives of around 300 million people worldwide, according to an estimate. Being rare, it's understandable that doctors may not always be aware of them, nor is medication to treat them widely available. Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis is another factor, which may lead to potentially dangerous wrong treatment.\nCases examined in our report have shown that patients with rare diseases mostly suffered because of lack of awareness and information. Most rare diseases take more time to be diagnosed and treated, at a comparatively high cost, of course. But delays in detection and treatment \u2013 in a country where out-of-pocket health expenditure is 68.5 percent of the total cost \u2013 only increase the costs further. This makes poor patients like Jakia and Anisur even more vulnerable among their peers. Unfortunately, the policy response to this threat remains woefully inadequate \u2013 with no separate fund for rare diseases, no policy guidelines, no research, no awareness drive for patients and doctors, no change in how medical students are taught to approach symptoms, etc.\nThis lack of response represents a lack of priority in our already stretched healthcare system. But those suffering from rare diseases deserve as much attention and care as ordinary patients. And the onus for that falls squarely on the health authorities, both at the policy level and at the medical college/hospital level. They must combine to form a national policy that addresses the threat of this growing challenge in the country.\n",

        "full_article": "The five-day Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) fair concluded yesterday on a mixed note. The number of prospective buyers of flats and plots visiting the fair at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre was neither overwhelming, as was the case in the past, nor disappointing considering the financial battering the middle class has taken in the post-Covid period. However, the online enquiries by non-resident Bangladeshis was quite encouraging for the realtors. The offer of attractive discounts up to 1.0 million on on-the-spot purchase of flats makes quite a statement about the usefulness of such a housing fair and overall state of business in this sector. Sure enough, the sudden conclusion of the fair at 2:00 pm on Sunday instead of the scheduled 9:00 pm had an adverse impact on the arrival of an unusually high number of visitors such events usually draw late in the day and the last-minute hectic business clinch. The developers and realtors have been showcasing their products ---in this case houses, flats and plots for building houses --- since 2002. This sector has witnessed burgeoning business ever since except for some spasmodic contractions for reasons integral to the country's economy and international developments. Although brick and sand among the building materials can be locally sourced, raw materials for cement and ms (mild steel) rod and paints have to be imported. Thus the housing sector is largely dependent on variables of those materials. Even bricks, now coal-fired, depend on the prices of imported coal. Wherever there is the compulsion for import of certain commodity, there is a chance of exaggerated profit by importers, as has become evident by the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission's analysis of the imported price of coal and the soaring price at which brick kiln owners have to procure it from the domestic market. In this context, the issue of eco-friendly and better-lasting building blocks comes to the fore. Hollow concrete blocks should have been promoted by encouraging the brick manufacturers to shift to the environmentally suitable technology. Brick kilns still use firewood rather clandestinely and there are instances that the kilns came up not long after those had been demolished by the authorities. Such campaigns will not succeed as long as the brick makers will not be given an easy and practicable option. Surely, making of concrete block can be a viable option for them. But this will call for handing over the know-how and technology to the manufacturers of bricks. The REHAB fair had an opportunity of directing focus on the merit of constructing buildings with concrete blocks. Already a number of reputed housing companies are producing the concrete blocks but they mostly do so for building their flats in housing societies. The concrete blocks can be cheaper than bricks and the building built with those are stronger and more durable. Here the government's policy counts most. Instead of just launching of occasional perfunctory drives against illegal brick kilns which are devastating top soil of surrounding lands and damaging the environment, promotion of green technology for housing will richly benefit the nation.",

        "full_article": "Unlike many countries, Bangladesh has no reliable statistics on its workers in the informal sector. It sounds incredible due to the fact that the developing countries are mostly in need of it. The need is prompted by the reality that their governments and the donors find it an imperative while planning numerous labour-related projects and the foreign agencies' preparation of labour welfare programmes. Unfortunately, despite realising the utmost importance of the labour statistics, the successive governments remain habituated to skirting the issue --- which leads the international organisations to shift their normally wide focus from the workers. In the meantime, the ever-deprived informal working class suffers to be followed by the fall in the standard of a particular segment of work.There have been a lot of uproars over protecting the informal workers. As has been seen in many critical sectors, it is the labour rights groups who come forward to uphold the case for the informal workers' sector. Intune with this, the labour rights groups say these workers are deprived of their fundamental rights including wages and workplace protections. Their demand that the informal workers, inclusive of those in the construction sector and their assistants, get sufficient protection by the existing labour law of the country is a timely one. The rights activists also take up the issue of the domestic workers. As they observe, the domestic workers are out ofthe purview of the labour law. At the same time, despite the construction workers being covered by the labour law, they do not enjoy rights such as the right to form trade unions. However, a few large platforms of the informal workers are clearly aware of their right to form trade unions. In fact, the labour sector of the country comprises mostly informal labour. Most of them are engaged in back-breaking work as farm hands, factory workers, porters outside unions at rail stations and launch terminals, drivers of privately owned cars etc, fishing community and workers at ghats. Moreover, there are brick field workers, housemaids, motor workshop mechanics and restaurant workers and many of their kind. Upon being limited to only the construction sector may amount to doing injustice to the others --- on the part of the rights groups. However, they try to be inclusive of all exploited workers.Against this backdrop, the labour rights activists have lately made the demand at a workshop on the findings of the ILO-PRS/STRIDE pilot project: Promoting Decent Work and Women's Rights in the Backdrop of Covid-19. The Workers Resource Centre (WRC) organised the event in the capital. At the function, the WRC noted that although Bangladesh has ratified the ILO conventions 87 and C-98, due to many 'difficulties' in forming unions and collective bargaining issues, workers couldn't enjoy their rights properly. It's natural that the deprived workers have been focused on by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). For the office is the store of all the data regarding the formal and informal workers. According to the Bureau, about 87 per cent of the total workforce is engaged in the informal economy. It's heartening, no doubt. But the data and its explanation also make one depressed. The BBS data says the number of workers employed in the construction sector is about 3.5 million. Among them 10 to15 per cent are women. They instil their hard labour in different types of jobs, otherwise meant for males, from dawn to dusk. The jobs are at the bottom level of manual livelihoods. They include breaking bricks into chips, crushing chunks of stones with hand-held heavy hammers and cutting large and small pieces out of soil etc.Unfortunately, The loosely knit female labourers are unaware of their right to demand proper wages and wage structures. Apparently, most of them have never heard of the cases for solidarity among female workers or demanding rational work hours for them. Of the country's large informal workers engaged in physically unsuitable and hazardous jobs, it is the women and children who comprise the largest segment. Despite the rights activists' presence in every sector employing women informally, they seem to be bewildered by the sheer number of the manipulated lot.Apart from the cases of the womenfolk shouldering the burden of physical labour like that done by their stronger male counterparts, the country's hapless female workforce is found in some other laborious works. In urban areas, a hefty size of women workforce can be found engaged in residences as maids. Unlike in the developed countries, even in some states in India, maid servants in the country are employed without any provision for work hours. Neither can they enjoy weekly holidays or days-long sick leave as they go with the formal jobs of guards, gardeners, drivers and other paid staff. In this country, being born a woman is like being tagged a person with little value in communities. They have to remain bound by the diktats framed by the male social guardians in cahoots with a section of unscrupulous women. Amazingly, Bangladesh has no reliable data on the female house help. Upon performing a guesswork, it can be estimated that approximately 10 million domestic workers are there in the country.Apart from the adult women, the domestic help also include adolescent girls. Even children belong to this group. The topic of the domestic workers being left in the lurch invariably brings to the fore their physical and mental harassments. They lack even the feeble voice to protest against these injustices.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The robbers of Sundarbans seem to have returned to their old profession. The Bagerhat police say they rescued at least 15 fishermen kidnapped between December 13 and 18 by the robbers last week. The police claimed that in the face of their drive, the robbers fled freeing the fishermen they abducted. However, the fishermen said they had to pay ransom for their release. A new group of robbers was reportedly active in the Hormalkhal (canal) and Berirkhal under the Sundarbans' Chandpai range. Fishermen were catching crabs in that area at night on December 15 when the robbers swooped on them and seized a number of crab-catchers as hostage. The released fishermen claimed that some of their members were still held captive in one of their trawlers the pirates had captured. An elite team of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), named Elite Tigers, is learnt to have started its drive last Saturday and mounted patrol at different points including Sharankhola, Joymoni, Baroitola, Andharmanik and Mrigamariagain to free the Sundarbans of robbers.Another team of the elite force, Bengal Tigers, are reportedly put on standby in trawlers to join forces with the Elite Tigers to respond to any emergency. So, it is again the same old story that the country's largest mangrove forest was once notorious for. After the country's independence, the Sundarbans gradually turned into a sanctuary of armed terrorists and gangs of robbers. The people of the locality whose livelihood depended om the forest became the target of these brigands. During the 1980s and the1990s, the entire Sundarbans including the coastal area went under the control of these bandits. The different groups of brigands divided the entire Sundarbans of about 10,000 square kilometres (about 6,000 square kilometres of which belong to Bangladesh) into their respective spheres of influence. They preyed on fishermen and honey and wood collectors. They would snatch the fish caught by the fishermen or hold them to ransom.They would also poach endangered Royal Bengal Tigers, deer and other animals and sell those to traffickers. From the robbers who later surrendered to the law-enforcers, it could be learnt that the different gangs collected around Tk.2 billion annually as toll through their terror tactics. To combat the menace, the government in 2012 formed a task force comprising members of the police, the RAB, the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Coast Guard and the Forest Department. During the period between 1980 and 2015, more than a hundred robbers were killed in encounters with the law-enforcement agencies.At this point, one may recall that on November 1, 2018, the government declared the Sundarbans free of criminal gangs. More than 300 robbers from 32 gangs active in the Sundarbans surrendered with their arms to the law-enforcement agencies in presence of the home minister in Bagerhat. Since then, November 1 is being observed as 'Robber-free Sundrbans day'. The government also undertook a programme to rehabilitate the robbers. The robbers also showed eagerness to return to the mainstream society. But why have the robbers again become active in the Sundarbans? Do these robbers represent a fresh crop of brigands or are they the ones who were amnestied, but ultimately failed to adjust to normal life? Whichever the case, the government will be required to get to the root of the issue. For there were reports that many of the robbers who were trying return to civilian life following the government's amnesty complained that they were finding it hard to get a source of livelihood. The reason is whatever financial support they received from the government for rehabilitation purpose was being spent to fight the criminal cases lodged earlier against them. And if they have finally returned to their previous life as outlaws that would call for revisiting the government's original plan of rehabilitating the Sundarbans robbers. In that case, the latest incidents of robbery in the Sundarbans would prove to be more than a law and order issue. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
