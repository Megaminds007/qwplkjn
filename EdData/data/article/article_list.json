He was last arrested on May 9 in the \u2018Al Qadir\u2019 trust case charge sheet. The latest conviction, which carries a sentence of three years, means that he is now disqualified from Parliament for the next five years, and will not be able to stand for election in polls due by November. Last week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had announced that he would dissolve Parliament on August 9, after which an interim government will step in. It is significant that Mr. Khan\u2019s arrest came days before the transition. The legal battle Mr. Khan faces now is formidable, but he is by no means the first Pakistani Prime Minister to face jail time and disqualification. During his tenure, his government had pursued cases against former Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan and other major Opposition leaders including former President Asif Ali Zardari. The common factor is that all these arrests appear orchestrated not so much by political rivalry, but due to problems with the powerful military. In Mr. Khan\u2019s case, he faced months of house arrest under former Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf, but subsequently came to good terms with the military. His stunning electoral win in 2018 was believed to have been achieved with General Qamar Bajwa\u2019s blessings. However, after they developed differences, Mr. Khan\u2019s political troubles began to mount.The government\u2019s actions are excessive by any measure. The case Mr. Khan has been arrested for is just one amidst about 100 cases he has been charged in ever since he was ousted from office in April 2022. Apart from the litany of legal cases against him and his family, there has been a systematic attempt to prosecute leaders of his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. In addition, cases of terrorism, sedition and blasphemy against Mr. Khan and his colleagues indicate there could be more serious sentences to follow. At the same time, his ouster from power and the cases have not visibly challenged his popularity in Pakistan, going by the by-election results last October, and the anger after his arrest in May. In that sense, the fact that his conviction and arrest in the latest case were not accompanied by similar protests is not an achievement for Pakistan\u2019s government, but demonstrates the effectiveness of its establishment in silencing public expression. None of this augurs well for Pakistan\u2019s democracy.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\narrest\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\ndemocracy",

        "full_article": "Unlike most other developments in the field of condensed-matter physics, every new claim of room-temperature superconductivity will monopolise headlines worldwide and kick up tremendous hype. Late last month, researchers in South Korea announced \u2014 via two preprint papers uploaded to the arXiv repository \u2014 that they had found a material they called LK-99 to be a superconductor at room temperature and ambient pressure. Conventional superconductors (i.e., those whose superconducting abilities can be explained by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory) are distinguished by four features, one of which has implications for industrial, research, and diagnostic applications that are impossible to overstate: they can transport an electric current with zero loss. Scientists have been looking for a material that can superconduct without having to be cooled to very low temperatures and which does not require the application of extreme pressure. According to the new claim, LK-99 fits the bill. It is copper-substituted lead apatite. While there have been quite a few claims in the last century of scientists having discovered room-temperature superconductors, LK-99 has triggered more excitement, presumably because the group\u2019s preprint papers are free to access, include some data pointing in the right direction, and contain instructions to synthesise it and test its properties.In a coincidental irony, \u2018apatite\u2019 is derived from the Greek \u2018to deceive\u2019. All the claims of scientists having found a room-temperature (and ambient pressure) superconductor so far have failed to withstand independent scrutiny. A room-temperature and -pressure superconductor is an immensely valuable thing, attached to significant material as well as scientific prestige. This could prompt scientists to rush to publish their results before proper data verification. Thus, independent verification by qualified scientists becomes crucial \u2014 for which the South Korean group must share all the data. Checking if a material is a superconductor is difficult, requiring sophisticated equipment as well as information about how precisely to create the material in question. For another claim this year, of a material that reportedly superconducts near room temperature and under much less pressure than others of its kind, its originators shared instructions to synthesise it but refused to share samples, claiming they constituted intellectual property. While this may be, their refusal vitiated the proper process of science in the face of such an extraordinary claim. Finally, despite the lucre of a potentially revolutionary technology, and bearing in mind that the margin of error in superconductivity research is very small, non-experts should wait for independent verification, even if it is slow to come, from a qualified research group before making up their mind about it.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nscience and technology\n\n/\n\nsemiconductors and active components\n\n/\n\nSouth Korea",

        "full_article": "Pak trial court\u2019s verdict on Khan seems excessive, and convenient for army. But don\u2019t write him off yet:\nThe hurried judgment passed by a Pakistani trial court against Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case further increases suspicion that the ruling Shehbaz Sharif government and the Pakistani army don\u2019t want the cricketer-turned-politician to be part of the next election, supposed to be held in November. This is what Khan has been alleging all along, alluding to a \u2018London Plan\u2019 to eliminate him from the political process. For, the trial court not only pronounced its verdict in Khan\u2019s absence \u2013 his lawyers allege that they were barred from entering the court \u2013 but also handed him the maximum possible sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment for the charge, disqualifying him from representing the people.\n\nRecall that the Toshakhana case against Khan is that he had withheld details of proceeds he made by illegally buying and selling state gifts during his time as premier. However, Toshakhana records made public earlier this year show that Khan was hardly the only Pakistani official guilty on this score. For example, between 2008 and 2013, Pakistan Peoples Party politicians retained 60 luxury watches from Toshakhana having an assessed value of Pakistani Rs 12.2 million for which they paid a little over Pakistani Rs 2 million.\nTherefore Khan, while certainly guilty of an infraction, cannot be said to have committed a crime grave enough to disqualify him from the political process. Pakistan\u2019s higher judiciary should also look into the subversion of due process and constitutional norms in this case. Besides, Khan remains the most popular politician in Pakistan today. But the Pakistani deep state is working on a \u2018minus-one\u2019 plan. Senior leaders of Khan\u2019s PTI have either deserted him or been put behind bars. The aim appears to be to gradually erode away the PTI or even prop up a split faction in future.\nBut even if Khan is unable to contest the next election, he could still use his popularity to rally support for his chosen candidates. That would complicate matters for an army that doesn\u2019t want to directly usurp power or openly take out Khan. Of course, none of this helps Pakistan\u2019s economic crisis. IMF recently approved a long-awaited $3 billion bailout for Pakistan. But its woes continue as highlighted by its inflation rate reaching 28.3% in July. Plus, Pakistan is again becoming a hotbed of terror activities as shown by terror strikes carried out by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Islamic State Khorasan. With or without Khan, the country will remain in deep crisis.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Haryana govt should take the lead in reassuring migrants that it\u2019s safe to live and work in Gurgaon:\nCommunal clashes that broke out in Nuh, Haryana, a week ago continue to reverberate. Media reports say that migrant workers in Gurgaon have begun to leave, driven away by fear over their safety and in some cases threats by non-state actors. Employers in the area have sought the help of law enforcement to reassure workers, but it\u2019s been inadequate. There\u2019s an important lesson to be learnt. Riots are incompatible with the story of India\u2019s economic rise. In the absence of social peace, the economic environment will not be favourable to investment.\nA promising economic trend is the emergence of India-based global capability centres that handle operations of multinational firms.\n\nGurgaon is one of the focal points of GCCs, which have boosted India\u2019s services exports. Gurgaon, however, faces stiff competition from other Indian cities, particularly the ones in southern states which can leverage prior advantages of being springboards of India\u2019s software boom. It\u2019s hard to gauge the extent to which the fallout of riots, including disruptions in everyday life, has hurt Gurgaon\u2019s reputation as a preferred economic location. However, what can resolve the situation is a series of proactive steps by the Haryana government.\nThe state needs to take a leaf out of Tamil Nadu\u2019s approach following viral fake news in March that Hindi-speaking economic migrants were being attacked. The state government collaborated with industry associations to reassure panicky workers. The political executive took ownership of the effort and even sought the assistance of the Bihar government. Haryana needs to follow the same approach, with chief minister ML Khattar leading from the front. The effort to assuage the fears of workers seeking to exit Gurgaon cannot be left to a handful of police officers. At stake is the state\u2019s economic heft.\n\n",

        "full_article": "News of the troubles in the Indian state of Manipur has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the US. It is no longer a simple issue. But many have been surprised to see that it took the Indian prime minister almost 80 days to share his views on the violence in Manipur. The reason behind this can be hypothesised.\nOut of the 543 seats of the Lok Sabha, Manipur only has two. The northeastern states (eight, including Sikkim) have a total of just 25 seats in the Lok Sabha, which translates to less than five percent voting power, even though these states are home to a couple dozen different peoples. The question is: with so little political power, how can these populations obligate national-level policymakers to address their problems?\nThere are many 'invisible Manipurs' in South and Southeast Asia\nThis is not a problem limited to the northeast of India. Neither is it limited to India itself. Similar situations can be observed all over South and Southeast Asia.\nConsider the Chin state neighbouring Manipur. Out of the 664 seats in Myanmar's bicameral parliament, the Chin state only has 21. Similar realities are faced by the Kachin, Karen, and Rakhine in different states of the country. The country's military and non-military authority has always been strictly under the control of the ethnic majority Bamars. Myanmar is a stark example of what happens when a country of vast ethnic diversity is subjected to the totalitarian dominance of one ethnicity.\nIn Bangladesh's parliament, too, the number of non-Bangalee representatives is very low. Usually, only three or four members out of the 300 are directly elected, and a further one or two get into the 50 seats reserved for women. There is little scope for minority peoples to exert influence on national-level politics.\nIn Sri Lanka, the Tamils are in a similar state. A Tamil being elected as president in the current presidential system is not something the Singhalese are ready to accept easily. In the 225-member parliament, there are only 10 members of the TNA (Tamil National Alliance). Out of the nine states of Sri Lanka, the Tamil have complete control over only one state in the north.\nOut of the 226 seats in Pakistan's national assembly that are filled by direct elections, the Baloch only have 16, whereas Punjab has 141 seats. The logic behind such discrepancy is population variance. But the immediate result of it is that, in policymaking debates and polls, minorities are weakened. Even after 75 years of independence, the Baloch voice has been kept quiet in a systematic way. It is perhaps natural for separatism to take root in a society such as this. In fact, what's unnatural is covering up their sorrow or forcefully stifling its expression.\n\nWhat can these minorities do if the majority in power in these countries are not able to provide durable solutions to their problems? Given the internal political structures, the minorities are not in a situation where they can force the power brokers to listen to them. There are no regional structures, either, through which all ethnic minorities in a country can sit together and voice their issues. Perhaps such a system could have helped the minorities gain more visibility.\nBhutan has been known as a small nation of happy citizens in this region. That is how they have been portrayed. But a large part of the ethnic minority, the Nepali-speaking community in Bhutan, has been driven out of their homes, forced to take refuge elsewhere for long.\nThe question is, how much longer must the Nepalese in Bhutan, the Tamil in Sri Lanka, the Baloch in Pakistan or the ethnic minorities in India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar wait for their problems to be solved?\nThis question can also be framed like so: what can these minorities do if the majority in power in these countries are not able to provide durable solutions to their problems? Given the internal political structures, the minorities are not in a situation where they can force the power brokers to listen to them. There are no regional structures, either, through which all ethnic minorities in a country can sit together and voice their issues. Perhaps such a system could have helped the minorities gain more visibility.\n'Identity politics' is a dark chasm\n\nMany have been asking what the Indian government can do for the Kuki people in Manipur. But the real question should be: can they do anything at all?\nThe answer is both yes and no.\nThe Manipur government and the New Delhi government can definitely increase security for the Kuki. They will certainly try to do that. One reason behind this not being done over the last three months is the lack of cooperation by the Meitei in Manipur. The other reason is the geography of Northeast India.\nThe Kuki now want to break away from Manipur and form their own state. There are major roadblocks to the Indian government accepting this demand. Firstly, the Kuki live in the mountainous regions surrounding Manipur. Its capital, Imphal, is mainly inhabited by the Meitei. So how can this complicated geography be split in a way that would satisfy both parties?\nSecondly, the Naga people from neighbouring Nagaland also have claims upon the Kuki regions. The Naga want the Kuki regions to be included within their desired state of \"Nagalim.\" In their view, those are ancient Naga regions. This claim isn't entirely false. The Naga outnumber Kukis in Manipur. The one common factor between them is that both practise Christianity. Perhaps this is why, in the current conflict between the Hindu Meitei and the Kuki, the Naga people are sympathising with the latter. But in the past, the Naga and Kuki have also been involved in armed struggles, with many killed and wounded on both sides. All of this means that splitting Manipur in two regions, one each for the Meitei and the Kuki, won't really resolve the current issue. Splitting it into two won't be easy, either. But be it today or tomorrow, this will eventually happen. Despite living side-by-side for centuries, the Meitei and Kuki consider each other to be enemies, to such an extent that they can't be kept in the same state under the same administration for long. As a result, the face of Manipur will change.\nIn the past, many states in India have been formed in this way. But that did not result in the expected level of harmony between communities. For example, the mountainous regions of the Khasi, the Jaintia, and the Garo of Assam were once put together to form Meghalaya. In this Bangladesh-adjacent state, the Khasi make up half of the population. Among the rest, the Garo and the Jaintia are the main tribal groups. Now, the Garo want a separate state within Meghalaya. Until that happens, some Garo organisations are demanding that Tura be named the winter capital of the state. The basis of this demand is that the actual capital of the state, Shillong, is mainly a Khasi region. On the other hand, in response to the Garo's demand of making Tura the winter capital for six months each year, the Jaintia have begun demanding that their main city, Jowai, be named the spring capital for a few months every year, too. This chain of demands reveals that even though Assam was split to form the new state of Meghalaya, the ethnic harmony has not been achieved in the region.\nThis is the dark chasm of identity politics. You can keep moving forward, yet never reach the light. But identity politics is a stark reality surrounding us. We all have to face it eventually.\nThis crisis was mainly created during the era of colonial rule. The British took over the lands of many small ethnic groups and abstracted their loyalty to the crown. They kept these regions as \"princely states,\" without compromising their cultural independence. But the British left behind a catastrophic situation when they left after nearly two centuries. Without thinking of future outcomes, they handed over the responsibility of all the ethnic minorities in vast South Asia to the ethnic majorities. But even this could have been a non-issue, had independent Myanmar, India, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka built nations where the cultural, religious, and citizen rights of minorities were protected under the certainty of sovereignty. But this has rarely happened.\nManipur is the symptom of a deep, hidden illness\n\nAfter 1947, the majority elites of the independent countries in this region have always tried to establish centralised states instead of decentralising power. The natural resources of these regions have been handed over to national and foreign businesses through various means. In trying to make this process as \"seamless\" as possible, a tactic of setting one small minority against another was employed. Almost always and everywhere, a group of obedient politicians and intellectuals is created from among the minorities to safeguard the interests of the majority.\nThere are two other procedures that are implemented to create cultural hegemony in these regions. Firstly, there's the prevalence of tourism; the second is encouraging various religious organisations to ramp up their operation. At first glance, these activities may seem innocuous. But these efforts have done a lot to disrupt the peace among the minority communities in South and Southeast Asia. Almost all such regions are now more or less under the hegemony of outsiders, and the culture that these outsiders bring. These invisible interferences have happened in a variety of ways over the last 70-80 years. The counter reaction has been a destructive identity-driven politics, which is hateful and conservative by nature. But every ethnic minority seems to think that this will be their salvation.\nThis is what we have been seeing in Manipur. A lot can be learned from this crisis if it is viewed as a symbolic event in South and Southeast Asia. The Meitei flatlands and the Kuki mountains have been at peace for centuries, and now they are stooping to lows as heinous as stripping women of the other community naked and exhibiting them in public. If we simply criticise New Delhi because of this incident, we won't be able to make progress. Instead, we must try to figure out how these minority communities got here, and how they might get out of this situation.\nThe answer to that is that the majorities living in the political and cultural epicentres of many countries in the world have created this reactionary situation. This was not a problem that materialised in an instant. This has been established through the use of trickery and tactics over decades. The way to freedom from this is an overhaul of the existing state structure, a complete decentralisation of the administration. Dialogue must take place with the minorities. The dominance of cultural and political epicentres that have been around since the colonial era must be dismantled. In reality, South Asia or Southeast Asia is not ready for that. One country looks at another country's 'Manipur' and bathes in secret schadenfreude. But none of them understand one thing: they all suffer from this deep, secret illness.\nTranslated by Azmin Azran.\n\nAltaf Parvez\u00a0is a researcher of history.\n",

        "full_article": "It is unacceptable that despite spending huge amounts of money and making many lofty promises over the years, the government has failed to address Chattogram's waterlogging problem. The situation this year has been so bad, in fact, that the port city has gone under water 10 times in the past seven months. Following the most recent heavy rainfall, at least 40 percent of the city's area has gone under water, affecting at least 15 lakh people. Aside from causing immense suffering for ordinary people, this has also caused massive losses for businesses and farmers.\nAccording to a 2021 study, Tk 463 crore losses were incurred in one year alone around Khatungonj and its nearby areas in Chattogram due to waterlogging. Most recently, unloading of goods from larger vessels at the outer anchorage of Chattogram Port had to be suspended due to rough seas since Friday, while trade at the Khatunganj-Chaktai wholesale hub has dropped significantly. As unloading of goods from bulk carriers at the jetties and delivery of goods have considerably slowed down, at least 25 cargo vessels carrying over 800,000 tonnes of goods have been stranded at the outer anchorage. These vessels are carrying very important goods including wheat, raw sugar, soybean oil, fertilisers, as well as industrial raw materials \u2013 a lot of which might get damaged unless they are brought back on land quickly. Additionally, importers are having to pay huge amounts to shipping companies for the use of their vessels beyond schedule. And all of these losses might soon get transferred over to the consumers, leading to another round of price surges.\nOver the past six years, the government has spent Tk 5,790 crore to address Chattogram's waterlogging problem, but to no avail. Out of the 40 sluice gates it was supposed to construct during this time, only five have so far been complete. The Chattogram Development Authority (CDA), which is implementing a Tk 11,344 crore mega project to mitigate waterlogging, had said before the monsoon that this year's inundation would be less than that of previous years due to digging of many canals to mitigate the problem. Blaming the Chattogram City Corporation (CCC), its chief engineer said that the city's drainage system has become ineffective because the CCC has not been cleaning the drains properly. An official from the CCC, meanwhile, has blamed the CDA's failure to complete and hand over the canals for the waterlogging problem.\nWhile the same blame game that we have seen previously is again being played out, it is the people and businesses that are ultimately losing out. And the fault must fall squarely on the shoulders of the authorities, who have failed to properly coordinate and take responsibility for addressing Chattogram's waterlogging problem over the span of many years. This needs to change. We call upon the government to hold the different organisations entrusted with this responsibility to account, and urgently implement the necessary projects to alleviate the sufferings of the people.\n",

        "full_article": "We are quite frustrated at the lack of efforts from government agencies to prevent the avalanche of road crashes. According to Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, which just released the crash figures of July, 576 people were killed and 1,055 injured in 505 road crashes last month. Reports by other road safety organisations are likely to follow, as they usually do, but there may not be much change in the numbers. These reports, unfortunately, never seem to be taken seriously by those in charge, who for years promised reforms to make our roads safe but never really delivered. Instead, they are often found to be taking decisions in favour of the powerful transport associations and owners who are mostly responsible for today's grim scenario.\nFor instance, the government has recently put on hold an order that set a limit to the economic life of buses and trucks, which, according to transport experts, is essential to ensure road safety \u2013 since old and unfit vehicles are a major reason behind road crashes. What could be the reason behind staying such a directive? Even one day without road limits is one day too many in our present context. Currently, there are over 74,000 registered buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles (as of April) that are past their economic lifespan, according to the limit set by the government in May this year. Just imagine the amount of damage that these and other soon-to-be-expired vehicles can do to us, including by polluting the air and contributing to road crashes.\nPreviously, we have seen how the authorities suspended the implementation of several sections of the Road Transport Act-2018 for months following a strike by transport associations in late 2019, and how they prepared a draft later to amend the act, reducing fines under 11 sections and punishment under four sections. All this is proof of the unchecked power and undue concessions that transport associations continue to enjoy while the authorities turn a blind eye to the woeful state of our road safety situation. This must change.\nWe urge the government to prioritise road safety over the demand of the transport associations. Experts have already identified the areas where work needs to be done. Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, for example, has particularly highlighted several factors \u2013 such as the increasing number of motorcycles, plying of slow-moving vehicles on highways, violation of traffic rules, faulty construction work on highways, dangerous overtaking, etc. \u2013 which must be addressed. Additionally, the importance of taking all unfit vehicles \u2013 and all unskilled/unlicensed drivers \u2013 out of our roads cannot be stressed enough. The authorities must take these steps for the sake of citizens.\n",

The situation this year has been so bad, in fact, that the port city has gone under water 10 times in the past seven months. Following the most recent heavy rainfall, at least 40 percent of the city's area has gone under water, affecting at least 15 lakh people. Aside from causing immense suffering for ordinary people, this has also caused massive losses for businesses and farmers.\nAccording to a 2021 study, Tk 463 crore losses were incurred in one year alone around Khatungonj and its nearby areas in Chattogram due to waterlogging. Most recently, unloading of goods from larger vessels at the outer anchorage of Chattogram Port had to be suspended due to rough seas since Friday, while trade at the Khatunganj-Chaktai wholesale hub has dropped significantly. As unloading of goods from bulk carriers at the jetties and delivery of goods have considerably slowed down, at least 25 cargo vessels carrying over 800,000 tonnes of goods have been stranded at the outer anchorage. These vessels are carrying very important goods including wheat, raw sugar, soybean oil, fertilisers, as well as industrial raw materials \u2013 a lot of which might get damaged unless they are brought back on land quickly. Additionally, importers are having to pay huge amounts to shipping companies for the use of their vessels beyond schedule. And all of these losses might soon get transferred over to the consumers, leading to another round of price surges.\nOver the past six years, the government has spent Tk 5,790 crore to address Chattogram's waterlogging problem, but to no avail. Out of the 40 sluice gates it was supposed to construct during this time, only five have so far been complete. The Chattogram Development Authority (CDA), which is implementing a Tk 11,344 crore mega project to mitigate waterlogging, had said before the monsoon that this year's inundation would be less than that of previous years due to digging of many canals to mitigate the problem. Blaming the Chattogram City Corporation (CCC), its chief engineer said that the city's drainage system has become ineffective because the CCC has not been cleaning the drains properly. An official from the CCC, meanwhile, has blamed the CDA's failure to complete and hand over the canals for the waterlogging problem.\nWhile the same blame game that we have seen previously is again being played out, it is the people and businesses that are ultimately losing out. And the fault must fall squarely on the shoulders of the authorities, who have failed to properly coordinate and take responsibility for addressing Chattogram's waterlogging problem over the span of many years. This needs to change. We call upon the government to hold the different organisations entrusted with this responsibility to account, and urgently implement the necessary projects to alleviate the sufferings of the people.\n",

        "full_article": "We are quite frustrated at the lack of efforts from government agencies to prevent the avalanche of road crashes. According to Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, which just released the crash figures of July, 576 people were killed and 1,055 injured in 505 road crashes last month. Reports by other road safety organisations are likely to follow, as they usually do, but there may not be much change in the numbers. These reports, unfortunately, never seem to be taken seriously by those in charge, who for years promised reforms to make our roads safe but never really delivered. Instead, they are often found to be taking decisions in favour of the powerful transport associations and owners who are mostly responsible for today's grim scenario.\nFor instance, the government has recently put on hold an order that set a limit to the economic life of buses and trucks, which, according to transport experts, is essential to ensure road safety \u2013 since old and unfit vehicles are a major reason behind road crashes. What could be the reason behind staying such a directive? Even one day without road limits is one day too many in our present context. Currently, there are over 74,000 registered buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles (as of April) that are past their economic lifespan, according to the limit set by the government in May this year. Just imagine the amount of damage that these and other soon-to-be-expired vehicles can do to us, including by polluting the air and contributing to road crashes.\nPreviously, we have seen how the authorities suspended the implementation of several sections of the Road Transport Act-2018 for months following a strike by transport associations in late 2019, and how they prepared a draft later to amend the act, reducing fines under 11 sections and punishment under four sections. All this is proof of the unchecked power and undue concessions that transport associations continue to enjoy while the authorities turn a blind eye to the woeful state of our road safety situation. This must change.\nWe urge the government to prioritise road safety over the demand of the transport associations. Experts have already identified the areas where work needs to be done. Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, for example, has particularly highlighted several factors \u2013 such as the increasing number of motorcycles, plying of slow-moving vehicles on highways, violation of traffic rules, faulty construction work on highways, dangerous overtaking, etc. \u2013 which must be addressed. Additionally, the importance of taking all unfit vehicles \u2013 and all unskilled/unlicensed drivers \u2013 out of our roads cannot be stressed enough. The authorities must take these steps for the sake of citizens.\n",

        "full_article": "At a time when readymade garment (RMG) export from Bangladesh to the European Union (EU) market has surpassed that of China in terms of volume, though not in monetary value, the prime minister's office (PMO) directs all concerned to raise income from export of leather and leather goods to $5.0 billion. Right now export proceeds from this sector stand at only $1.7 billion and the PMO office is of the opinion that it should not take more than three to four years to reach the export target. Of the highly potential industrial sectors, leather and pharmaceutical industries stand the greatest chance of rivalling the country's number one export earner RMG and effectively help diversify the export basket. Sadly, the potential of these two sectors are yet to be exploited. In case of leather and leather goods, mishandling of some crucial matters such as inordinate delay in shifting tanneries from Hazaribagh to BSCIC Tannery Industrial Estate located in Hemayetpur, Savar and the fracas over the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) there have proved to be the greatest constraint. In fact, the urgency of upgrading the environmental compliance of tanneries in the industrial estate by making the CETP fully functional was the main subject of deliberations at the meeting presided over by the prime minister's principal secretary at the PMO. All the stakeholders present there were apprised of the task ahead for each of the parties to achieve the intended goal. It appears from media reports from time to time that the Chinese firm responsible for the construction of the CETP botched up with designs or capacity equations. Months ago a local company claimed it could rectify the fault that has rendered the CETP either lame or for most part non-functional. That the government's claim for the CETP's readiness before the tanneries moved from Hazaribagh to Savar actually remained unsubstantiated and when the CETP proved a hotchpotch, the urgency to take care of it has been missing over the past six years.The meeting at the PMO can be termed fruitful if the CETP, the central piece on which mainly depends compliance of the standards of the Leather Working Group (LWG), is refurbished or replaced within a reasonable timeframe. To fully comply with the LWG standards, it is also incumbent on the factories to manage solid waste in an eco-friendly manner. In this connection, at least one factory named Superex Leather, claimed to be the largest tannery in the country with a daily leather processing capacity of 80,000 sq feet, located in Fultola, Khulna has made its own arrangement for effluent treatment plant (ETP) and for solid waste management. Italian machines and technology are its mainstay. Sure enough, if some of the big names in leather and leather goods sector did not have to move to the Savar leather estate, they could install their own ETP and earn the highly cherished LWG certificate. The Superex Leather is expecting a visit of its factory by a LWG team and a certificate soon. This certificate is key to exporting processed leather to world famous brands like Adidas, Puma and Gucci. Local manufacturers of leather goods will also enjoy the right to export to markets that emphasise the environmentally-friendly manufacturing criteria. For the country's own environmental concern too, groundwork by leather units for obtaining the LWG certificate should be given the highest priority. Transfer of pollution from Hazaribagh-Buriganga to Savar-Dhaleswari has already caused irreparable environmental damage.",

        "full_article": "Amid the unabated road accidents across the country, few are inclined to muster up the patience to remember the days-long street demonstrations in 2018 by students to press the demand for safe roads. Except for a few months' relief, the Dhaka roads went back again to their earlier anarchic and unruly state. In just a year, accident-prompted deaths started ruling the roost. Roads and highways have yet to be free of terrible accidents, many being fatal. It seems the spontaneous protests in 2018 had little impact on the reckless transport operators.The reason people not interested to recall the heady days is the lack of effective action in ensuring safe roads by the relevant authorities --- as had been promised. Both the students and members of the public are disillusioned, so are the victims' relatives and the road safety activists. Everybody seems to be blas\u00e9 and is overtaken by despondency when it comes to the state of road safety in the country, especially in Dhaka. Against this backdrop, an FE report has quoted a passenger welfare platform as having said that road accidents killed 39,522 people in the country in the last five years. The reason cited was the government's promise for safer roads had not yet been materialised. The passenger welfare group titled Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity (BJKS) carried out the survey showing at least 28, 299 road accidents had taken place since the year of 2018, in which 58,791 people were injured. Appallingly, of the injured 3, 941 were students. The passenger welfare platform presented an in-depth analysis of its survey at a programme in the capital recently. It marked the 5th anniversary of the students' movement for safe roads after the barbaric killing of two college students by a speeding bus.Dwelling at length on the prevailing situation on road safety, the general secretary of BJKS has said the present government promised safe roads after the largest student movement in the country's history in 2018. The authorities were capable of realising that the time was highly volatile. Mostly in order to pacify the students reeling from the shock of the death of the two students, the government accepted all the demands of the safe road activists. Unfortunately, few of them had been implemented, the BJKS general secretary observed with a note of despair.Roads have long been back to their earlier chaotic state. Nowadays, hardly a day passes that doesn't see a terrible road accident occurring on a road in Dhaka, or a national or regional highway elsewhere in the country. It's worth mentioning that the report of a new analysis published in the media on August 6 says as many as 576 people were killed and 1055 injured in road accidents across the country in last July. The study further says among the vehicles involved in the accidents were 18.74 per cent buses, 22. 84 per cent pick-up vans, covered vans and lorries, 6.83 per cent private cars, jeeps and microbuses, 5.74 per cent CNG-run auto-rickshaws, 25.99 per cent motorbikes, 15.32 per cent battery-run human haulers and 4.51 per cent three-wheelers. Surprisingly, among those killed in road accidents in July, 119 were drivers. Despite the fact that the latest tally presents the view of a single month, in terms of severity it is no less frightful than that of the five years. The inevitable conclusion, thus, is one of continued deterioration in the road traffic scenario. In a general view, apart from the dreadful traffic gridlocks caused by flouting of rules, reckless driving has staged a full-scale comeback. As has been seen before, plying of unfit vehicles continues unabated. Those include ramshackle and improvised vehicles, easy-bikes and battery-powered rickshaws. In the last five years after the students' demonstration, the road traffic authorities have picked the trend of giving the impression that accidents are decreasing. It's true the incidence of road accidents came down noticeably after the road safety movement. But there are reservations. As has been learnt, the new Road Transport Act 2018 was passed hastily in the face of the students' pressure to realise their demands. But due to various kinds of conditions imposed by the transport owners and the powerful drivers' unions, the new Act that emerged was veritably the old one. It could be seen in the obstinate dominance of anarchy that prevails on the country's roads and highways these days.The spectacles of competition between speeding buses to pick more passengers, ride-sharing motorbikes' tendency to overtake one another, the compulsive nature of jaywalking and other irregularities continue to worsen. The highways have long become synonymous with disorderliness of all conceivable kinds. The movement pressing the demand for safe roads appeared to have prompted the different traffic authorities and policy makers to bring the country's roads and highway traffic under a semblance of sharp scrutiny. Following the narrow escape from an imbroglio, the traffic lawmen were found eager to enforce road disciplines stringently. The measure didn't fail to see the desired result. Roads without major accidents and the habitual tendency to break law remained in place for months. The seemingly overhauled situation has prevailed for some time thanks to the sharp vigilance of the authorities, the media and the civil society. But as has been seen in many other sectors, all fresh initiatives eventually get back to square one. Here lies the tragedy. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Looking at the rise in the prices of commodities, essential or not, common sense says, the inflation is not slowing down at the expected rate. In July 2023, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the point-to-point inflation rate was 9.69 per cent, while in the previous month of June, it was 9.74 per cent marking a modest improvement over the previous months. To all appearances, the government effort at combating inflation is not working the way it should. In the post-pandemic stage, inflation surged about everywhere and the reason for it was not hard to understand-the supply chain was disrupted globally. Then the Ukraine war made matters worse by pushing up fuel and food prices in the global markets. But, meanwhile, the volatility of commodity and fuel prices in the international arena has been tamed. Inflation in the advanced economies of Europe and North America is more or less under control. In South Asia, Nepal's inflation rate, which was 7.41 per cent in May 2023, has dropped by 0.58 percentage points to 6.83 per cent in June 2023. India's retail inflation rate, on the other hand, rose to a three-month high of 4.81 per cent in June 2023 from 4.25 per cent in May this year. India's consumer price index was the highest at 7.79 per cent in April 2022. But despite the recent rise, in absolute terms, the inflation rate in India seems to be well within the tolerable limit of the common consumers of that country. Pakistan, whose annual inflation rate was as high as 29.4 per cent in June 2023, could bring the inflation down for the second straight month to 28.3 per cent in July 2023. But the most remarkable feat has been achieved, of all other countries in South Asia, by Sri Lanka whose inflation rate rose year-on-year basis in September 2022 to its historic high at 69.8 per cent. But the country has been able to ease it gradually for the tenth consecutive month to 6.3 per cent in July 2023. So, the inflationary trend in Bangladesh should also improve at a faster rate than it has been doing so far. Seeing the success of some neighbouring countries in dealing with inflationary trends, though they are equally impacted by issues like the fuel and commodity prices in the global market, costlier US dollar and the Ukraine war, one wonders, why the situation in Bangladesh is different. And considering other neighbouring countries' performance, the argument that the inflation in Bangladesh is imported does no longer hold water.Many would like to blame what they term 'syndicates' of importers or wholesalers who artificially distort the supply chain to their advantage to raise prices of goods and services to make super-profit. So, they urge government to crack down on the suspected market manipulators. The government, too, from time to time has been launching drives against businesses suspected of doing the mischief of market manipulation, but with little success. The central bank recently announced a contractionary monetary policy for the first half of the current financial year (FY 2023-24) with a view to tackling inflation as well as the continuing appreciation of US dollar against taka. The key policy rate has also been increased by 50 basis points to 6.50 per cent as part of the contractionary monetary policy to contain inflation. It is still too early to say how the new monetary policy will pan out. But some economists pointed to the government's increased borrowing from the central bank to meet its fiscal deficit as an important driver of the inflation. The government should rather increase its revenue collection effort, especially from the tax-dodging super-rich, to manage fiscal deficit than print money. That would help combat inflation effectively, economists believe.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": " Many teenagers today see smoking as a fashionable trend, which is why one can often find youngsters smoking in public places. According to several studies, two-thirds of smokers in Bangladesh pick up the habit before their 17th birthday. We all know that smoking tobacco can cause serious health issues including mouth cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. But the youngsters do not care about the health consequences and get hooked to tobacco, as they find it easily available and believe they will look more attractive and have more friends through smoking. Social media has been playing an important role in normalising smoking cigarettes. Often teenagers take up the habits of their favourite celebrities or television characters without realising their negative consequences. Everybody knows that smoking kills and it is the enemy of the human body. Nonetheless, there are people who are aware of this and still smoke frequently, even from young age. The World Health Organisation has been repeatedly warning against the dangers and diseases associated with smoking cigarettes. Anti-smoking awareness campaigns are also on in many parts of the world including Bangladesh. The government has taken some steps to restrict the use of tobacco. Pro-tobacco advertisements are banned and cigarette packets have health warnings printed on them to discourage people from smoking. Yet, Bangladesh is the ninth largest consumer of tobacco products in the world. And around 35.3 per cent of our adults use tobacco, according to a new research. What is more alarming is that most of these adults have grown the habit of smoking during their teenage years. We all should intensify our efforts to raise awareness about the health risks of tobacco consumption, especially among our adolescents. \nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
