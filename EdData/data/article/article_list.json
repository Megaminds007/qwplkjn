As the verdict unfolded on June 4, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, which is a far cry from its claims made during the campaign. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which the BJP leads, has, however, won a majority, getting more than 290 seats. The BJP\u2019s individual tally is 240, which is 63 fewer than its 2019 strength of 303. Two NDA partners, the JD(U) in Bihar and the TDP in Andhra Pradesh, which have won 12 and 16 Lok Sabha seats, respectively, will hold significant sway in the Lok Sabha, as will other regional parties in general. The verdict of the people cannot be clearer than this \u2014 it wants the BJP to be more conciliatory and less confrontational towards the political aspirations of various communities and regions of India. The verdict also shows the limits of communal polarisation as a mobilisation strategy, which turned out to be the mainstay of the BJP\u2019s campaign. The outcome holds the BJP accountable, and demands it be more constructive. The BJP must heed that message in a democratic spirit, and reorient itself to the reality of the reemergence of coalition politics after 10 years.The Congress, which nearly doubled its 2019 tally to reach 99 seats, has restored its position as the other pole of Indian politics, though it finished a distant second. It too should respect the verdict, and resist any temptation to attempt any post-poll coalition at this moment. The pre-poll coalition led by the Congress \u2014 INDIA \u2014 has not crossed the halfway mark, while the NDA has. Respect for the people requires all parties to remain steadfast to their pre-poll alliances and positions. The Congress has managed to form and lead an alliance in spite of the many internal contradictions, and its leader, Rahul Gandhi, has elevated himself in the public eye as a challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress organisation, strategy and communication worked for it this time, while the BJP came up short on all three factors when measured against its claims. The party runs a serious key person risk, with its campaign, strategy and thinking all dependent on one person, Narendra Modi. The overwhelming charisma and style of Mr. Modi served the party well in 2014 and 2019, but the same factors were corroding the party\u2019s organisational strengths and withering its regional and local leadership. These factors, and the accumulated anti-incumbency of two terms, caught up with the BJP. Still, that it won a third term, though in alliance, is remarkable. Its ideological agenda has taken deep roots in its strongholds, enabling it to win what it has even amid clamour about inflation, unemployment and other livelihood issues. By winning a seat in Kerala, the BJP breached a fortress, and by defeating the BJD in Odisha, the party has captured the imagination of a new terrain. That said, the people did not take kindly to its strategy of portraying its return to power as an inevitable fate of Indian democracy.The Congress strategy of making livelihood issues and equity questions the core of its campaign seemed to have worked well in its direct contests with the BJP in Karnataka and Rajasthan. Both parties that operate at the national level should learn the right lessons from this verdict. The lifeblood of Indian democracy is its diversity and the BJP has been less than respectful of that in the last 10 years. The new government will be required to deal with two particular questions that are critical to India\u2019s federalism and diversity \u2014 the delimitation of Lok Sabha constituencies after the publication of the first Census after 2026; and the ongoing work of the 16th Finance Commission which is scheduled to submit its report in 2025. Both these call for political wisdom, wide consultations and maturity. The verdict for a coalition government at the Centre underscores the diversity of India, and the role of States and regional political parties in its federalism. Coalitions are not a deficiency in a plural democracy, but quite the opposite. Rather than attempting inorganic and transactional coalitions, both the Congress and the BJP should nurture genuine, organic coalitions with regional parties and social groups. Enforcement of uniformity cannot be the aim of a federal polity, and the people have spoken on this issue loud and clear in 2024. The outcome of 2024 should also put to rest the unnecessary fear mongering about EVMs, though serious and urgent steps are required to reinforce public trust in the electoral process. EVMs have been around for long enough, and until now, have recorded results that align with what campaigners and observers report from the field. Responsible leaders and parties should not amplify conspiracy theories. The Election Commission of India (ECI) faced a lot of flak, largely for justifiable reasons, and the remedy cannot be combative rebuttals but more confidence building. Notwithstanding its shortcomings, the 2024 elections turned out to be proof yet again of the vitality of India\u2019s democracy and its electoral system, and the ECI deserves credit. An issue that requires the attention of the ECI and the government is the function of exit polls. The speculative hysteria that it generates ahead of the actual results is hardly an innocent sport. Exit polls could influence stock markets, for one, and many of the channels have business interests and are heavily invested in the markets. India has once again proved to itself and the world that it is a vibrant, functioning democracy. The new government has a responsibility to live up to the expectations of the people, and they are much more than a voter base. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nLok Sabha\n\n/\n\nNational Democratic Alliance\n\n/\n\nJanata Dal (United)\n\n/\n\nTelugu Desam Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\nOrissa\n\n/\n\nBiju Janata Dal\n\n/\n\nKarnataka\n\n/\n\nRajasthan\n\n/\n\npopulation and census\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nElection Commission of India\n\n/\n\nstock activity\n\n/\n\nfinancial markets\n\n/\n\nIndia",

But the decisive victories achieved by the incumbent parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Arunachal Pradesh and the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in Sikkim, indicate that the electorates in two States, overwhelmingly, preferred continuity over change. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu and his party received a strong mandate, winning 46 out of the 60 seats and increasing the BJP\u2019s tally even further by five seats. Mr. Khandu enjoys the reputation of running a stable government in the State, far from the tumultuous period in 2016 when he took over the reins. With a focus on welfare delivery and infrastructure development that has further connected the State to the rest of the country, Mr. Khandu has earned the confidence of the electorate. The BJP-friendly parties, the National People\u2019s Party and the People\u2019s Party of Arunachal, also registered five and two wins each, while the Opposition Congress\u2019s tally was reduced to just one seat. Supporters of the BJP and its main leader, Mr. Khandu, would celebrate the fact that in 10 out of the 60 seats there was no contest, which limited the chances of any upset. But this does not bode well for the State as a robust contestation of ideas and policies is a must for a functioning democracy.Arunachal Pradesh would do well not to go the Nagaland way where, technically, there is no opposition as all the parties that contested against the BJP-Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party coalition joined the alliance after the elections in 2023. In Sikkim, the SKM, led by Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang won 31 out of the 32 seats, with a lone seat going to the erstwhile dominant Sikkim Democratic Front. The SKM\u2019s victory in a multi-cornered fight was made possible by the regional assertion by the party which mobilised support on the issue of retaining Sikkim\u2019s special status enshrined in Article 371F of the Constitution, on Mr. Tamang\u2019s promises to deliver Scheduled Tribe status to some Nepali-origin communities, and his emphasis on job creation in the State. Sikkim\u2019s ruling party might have fought against the BJP and the latter might have drawn a blank, but the SKM still considers the BJP an ally. Notwithstanding the strong identity based politics in the north-east, voters choose the national party ruling at the Centre or its ally, dependent as these States are on central government funds. The overwhelming mandate in his favour should help Mr. Tamang, who will have to use all of his diplomatic powers to ensure benefits from the Union government.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nSikkim Assembly Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nArunachal Pradesh Assembly Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nSikkim Krantikari Morcha\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nNational People's Party\n\n/\n\nPeople's Party of Arunachal\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nNagaland\n\n/\n\nNationalist Democratic Progressive Party\n\n/\n\nSikkim Democratic Front\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nMizoram\n\n/\n\ngovernment",

        "full_article": "Retro-walking is a fad. It\u2019s also unnerving\nTaking a step back is equal to putting one\u2019s best foot forward. Or so insist, those walking backwards, especially in a park full of people. It\u2019s not exactly a new fitness fad or a social media challenge, but many are getting into it. When they loom in the distance, it takes a while to figure out whether they are walking towards you or away. Also called retro-walking, those practising it look over their shoulders, or from the corner of their eyes.\nFirst-timers give the impression they are walking on eggshells. Veterans walk as if they have eyes on the back of their heads. All have safety on their minds. Irrespective of when they took their first baby steps backward, they all swear by its benefits: strengthening core and leg muscles; improving focus, balance, memory; and even decision-making. Some try it for sheer novelty, having walked straight for years without any tangible change.\n\nThey don\u2019t go to town to talk about its benefits though. But you can make out they have looked up the net for positive evidence. Or heard from a practitioner they first saw in the park, ridiculed him, and quietly followed in his footsteps. Those using the treadmill miss out on the fun parks provide. Some argue older people tend to benefit from walking backward more, and they rightfully mind their steps.\nWhen youngsters take a fancy to it, they become unguided missiles. An occasional family insists on doing a group backward walk. Such a family can\u2019t stay together in public parks because they have to walk one after the other. The smartest member avoids leading the backward procession. Those ahead, or is it, behind, ensure his safety.\n\nWhen everybody is doing similar sets of exercises, walking backward stands out. A stranger can leave you unnerved in a park if he suddenly gets in the mood, appearing to take one long look at you in retreat. Those a little away can\u2019t even be happy to see his back because he\u2019s walking towards them.\nRetro-walk enthusiasts are better served if they choose familiar terrain and daylight. Mortals grown on the staple of ghosts with backward feet are likely to miss a beat or two when they see an aficionado in the dark. Wonder why shoe companies haven\u2019t come up with products suitable for such walking. After all, traditional shoes are meant to take you forward.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Like India\u2019s Congress, ANC\u2019s decline in South Africa shows no dominant party can take its status for granted\nIn a watershed election for Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy, the unchallenged reign of African National Congress (ANC) in South African politics appears to be at an end. ANC only managed to garner around 40% of the vote \u2013 the first time it hit such a low since the post-apartheid election of 1994 \u2013 forcing it to look for coalition partners to form the next govt.\nMilitant past, questionable future: ANC\u2019s anti-apartheid revolutionary moorings had elevated it to an exalted status in the Rainbow nation. It had never secured less than 50% of the vote in elections till now. But this also bred complacency, sclerotic party structures, corruption and an overbearing top brass that failed to provide space to younger, energetic members. Note that ANC was hurt most in the latest polls by former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s MK Party and expelled ANC youth icon Julius Malema\u2019s Economic Freedom Fighters that won around 14% and 9% of the vote, respectively.\n\nFailing to read pulse: ANC\u2019s antiapartheid legacy has also lost much traction among young South Africans. According to World Bank, 55% of the country\u2019s population lives in poverty, unemployment rate is a whopping 33%, and homicide rates are among the highest in the world. Add to this acute water, housing and energy crises. ANC\u2019s failure to address these has led to major disaffection.\nParallels with India\u2019s Congress: This mirrors the fate of India\u2019s Congress that too saw unchallenged political dominance for three decades as the party that secured the country\u2019s Independence.\nHowever, multiple splits, the Gandhi family\u2019s dynastic role, complacency and eroding ground presence saw the party reach a historic low of 44 seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Just as with ANC\u2019s anti-apartheid legacy, Congress\u2019s Nehruvian socialism has little traction today. Both parties\u2019 decline is a story of what happens to once dominant parties that refuse to adapt to changing circumstances. That\u2019s also the beauty of democracy.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The heavy battering that the Sundarbans took while trying to fend off fierce winds and tidal surges that came along with Cyclone Remal is beginning to be clearer. The forest department estimates infrastructural damage worth over Tk 6 crore within the forest. But that may be the tip of the iceberg as the real damage\u2014caused to its biodiversity\u2014is impossible to quantify. The forest floor lies covered with uprooted trees and foliage, with animal carcasses being discovered every day. Experts say it might need 30-40 years to restore its natural balance. What, then, the Sundarbans requires is to be left alone to recuperate, not further assaults from the very people it protects.\nYet, that may be precisely what's in store for the forest, with an alarming rise of resort business surrounding it in recent years. As per a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, resorts are being built close to the Sundarbans, some extending into its rivers, despite environmental laws prohibiting construction or activities detrimental to the forest within 10 kilometres of it. So far, some 14 resorts have been built in Khulna and Satkhira by cutting down trees and filling up canals and low-lying areas, with eight more under construction. These resorts often operate generators and air conditioning systems, causing noise, water, light, and soil pollution, as well as disturbing and even driving away the wildlife.\u00a0\nSince 2021, the number of resorts has increased fourfold to accommodate an ever-growing number of tourists. If the trend holds, experts fear it may not be long before the Sundarbans meets the fate of the heavily degraded Bhawal Forest in Gazipur. It's an irony that while the Sundarbans stands as our first line of defence against natural disasters in coastal regions, we are failing to defend it from our own actions. True, the rise in so-called community-based ecotourism has brought some benefits to local populations. But the lack of environmental scrutiny has meant that it has been totally unsustainable. The risk comes not just from resorts and cottages alone.\nOver the years, we've seen how various development projects, both private and public, have been undertaken leading to deforestation and environmental degradation. Despite this as well as protests from environmentalists, there has been little response from the authorities concerned.\u00a0\nThis is not a healing environment for a forest that just took a heavy hit and will again be expected to do in case of future cyclones. It needs replenishment which can only be done through strict enforcement of the environmental laws. New developments must be halted, and existing resorts should be subjected to rigorous environmental scrutiny, preferably under a new legal framework for ecotourism business as recommended by those involved. We must prevent further degradation of this vital lifeline for Bangladesh at all costs.\n",

        "full_article": "On the night of June 4, 2022, explosions occurred at the Sitakunda container depot in Chittagong, \u00a0resulting in the loss of fifty-one lives. We witnessed the fire and explosions through live-streaming on social media, hearing people crying. What caused this explosion and fire that lasted for three days spreading over several kilometers? The answer lies in the dangerous hydrogen peroxide gas. However, are such events new? Not really. In 1984, in Bhopal, India, our nearest neighbour, the Union Carbide factory released toxic methyl iso-cyanide gas, causing the immediate death of 3,000 to 8,000 people, with a total toll of twenty thousand after the accident.\nAlternatively, we can examine the 2015 explosion at a container depot in China's Tianjin seaport. This explosion, similar to the one in Bangladesh, claimed one hundred and seventy-four lives. There too were stockpiles of ammonium nitrate, along with the presence of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, commonly used in fertiliser manufacturing. Or, let's talk about the biggest non-nuclear explosion in history, that resulted in 218 deaths, 30,000 refugees, and the destruction of 77,000 apartments in Beirut in August 2020 for which 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate stock was also responsible. \u00a0\u00a0\nEach incident shares a similarity: toxic or hazardous chemicals! These substances are essential yet perilous for human life. For example, hydrogen peroxide is used as a cleaner and disinfectant, \u00a0while ammonium nitrate is widely used in agriculture as a nitrogen fertiliser, and methyl iso-cyanide is used as an agricultural pesticide.\nThink, if we had used safe alternative chemicals instead of these dangerous ones, would this loss of life have happened? Certainly not. Hence, before implementing scientific discoveries in human life, awareness of both their benefits and risks is essential.\nHowever, history tells a different tale. For instance, scientist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, credited with discovering fluorine, manganese, barium, and nitrogen, tragically died from exposure to hydrocyanic acid. Humphrey Davy, another notable scientist responsible for the discovery of one-fifth of the elements we know, met his end due to exposure to nitrous oxide. Marie Curie, a Nobel laureate renowned for discovering radioactivity, succumbed to leukaemia after exposure to harmful radiation. Interestingly, her laboratory notebook from 1890 is preserved in a lead box, requiring protective clothing for viewing. Rosalind Franklin, who played a vital role in unravelling the structure of DNA but did not get recognition for her work during her lifetime, also passed away at the age of 37 from exposure to her research device.\nNumerous scientists have lost their lives due to hazardous chemicals. We cannot call them careless because they were enthusiastic about invention and wanted to discover something that could be applied to human welfare. They had no idea at that time that any molecule or compound could be dangerous or poisonous. However, the swift advancement of industrialisation redirected attention towards enhancing productivity. The use of any type of chemical to increase production is augmented. But no one is as concerned about the harmful side of those chemicals. That's where green chemistry comes in. It is a chemical product or process designed in such a way that it eliminates or reduces hazards to humans, plants, and the environment.\nGreen Chemistry aims to reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances by ensuring the safe production, synthesis, and utilisation of various chemical substances or materials. Scientist Paul Anastas, formerly a staff chemist at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coined the term 'green chemistry' in 1989. He is now a Professor and Director of the Center of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering at Yale University. In 1996, Anastas co-authored the pioneering book 'Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice' with his childhood friend and classmate John Warner, earning him the title of the father of green chemistry.\nGreen chemistry, a discipline within chemical engineering, integrates pollution prevention and zero-waste concepts into laboratory and industrial practices while concurrently enhancing economic profitability and productivity. It focuses on reducing or eliminating potential hazards of substances, products, or processes in their initial design phase. The role of organic chemists is to discover new compounds, and green chemistry scrutinises these molecules for potential hazards to safeguard humans, plants, and the environment.\nThe adoption of green chemistry in research and industries worldwide is on the rise. For instance, biofuel is being produced from green algae. These specific algae can convert over 80 percent of photosynthetic carbon into ethanol, leading to a 15-20 percent production increase compared to conventional methods. Biofuel was previously produced from corn. Their skills are equivalent to planting 40 million trees or removing 36,000 cars from the road. Thus, green chemistry is revolutionising the industry. Applying green chemistry can change our world, and ensuring its proper use is essential to make all products and things around us eco-friendly. This approach is crucial for building a safer and habitable world.\nMd Mokarom Hossain, is a scientific officer at the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We frequently read in news that \"X\" achieved brilliant results by writing with legs. We appreciate \"X\" for their academic success, but do we have any idea how challenging and humiliating it can be to write with legs? What happens to those who have none of the limbs for writing? They are merely excluded from educational opportunities, access to information, labour market, voting rights, and other aspects of a citizen's life. If any of them had a prosthetic hand, an AI-operated hand or speech-to-text software\u2014the amazing assistive technologies available today\u2014the situation would be different.\nAssistive Technology (AT) is the application of organised knowledge and skills related to assistive products, including systems and services. AT has a profoundly positive impact on the participation and inclusion of people with disabilities. By offering access to knowledge, AT enables people to learn and stay informed. It is clear from a variety of experiences that AT is more than just a tool; rather, it is a catalyst that helps people overcome barriers and live independent, productive, and meaningful lives.\nFor those with impairments, the elderly, and those with health conditions, access to assistive technology is a human right recognised by international laws. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) obliges states parties to ensure the full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of life. The CRPD has imposed responsibilities upon states parties to promote the use, research, development, production, and distribution of AT, making it affordable and available for anyone who needs it.\nWheelchairs, glasses, crutches, hearing aids, screen readers and a few other assistive products are popular in Bangladesh, while over 40,000 assistive products (AP) are available in the world. According to the global reports on Assistive Technology by WHO and UNICEF, one in three people\u2014or more than 2.5 billion people globally\u2014need at least one assistive product. The significant unmet global need for AT is concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Only 5-15 percent of people who require AT have access to it in LMICs. This huge unmet need not only restricts the participation of people with disabilities in society, but also negatively impact the global and national economy. According to the reports, providing AT to all who need it would yield more than $10 trillion in economic benefits over the next 55 years.\nHow is Bangladesh viewing assistive technology? Right now, no comprehensive policy framework exists in the country to guarantee that AT is available, accessible, affordable, and acceptable to all people with disabilities. We do not yet have a strategy to meet the unmet needs progressively and generate money from it. The available assistive products and services are of poor quality, financially inaccessible, socially unacceptable, and unadaptable. The distribution system is very unsatisfactory, with devices not being available in hard-to-reach areas. The provision is insufficient, as the government provides products and services from 103 support centres, when we need to make them available at the doorsteps. There is no designated authority to monitor the quality of the assistive products and services available. There is a huge crisis with skilled service providers, technicians, and maintenance. AT for persons with hearing and/or visual impairment, psychosocial disabilities and intellectual disabilities are almost unavailable. Last but not least, a lack of awareness and understanding about AT further restricts the access significantly.\nBeing a state party to the CRPD, Bangladesh is under obligation to take measures to ensure AT for people with disabilities. The Rights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2013 and the National Action Plan for the implementation of this law mentioned that the government will undertake measures to increase production, reduce price by tax exemption, encourage human-centric design and research and ensure quality of locally produced and imported mobility aids, but these are yet to be translated into action. Moreover, the law does not speak about the assistive technology for all disability constituencies, which is ultra vires CRPD. The most terrible thing is that in Bangladesh, assistive technology is still viewed from medical perspective, when as a state party to the CRPD, it is mandatory to view AT from human rights perspective as part of a broader strategy for social inclusion. A rights-based perspective focuses on societal change, rather than \"fixing\" individuals through assistive technology, aligning with the principles of the CRPD.\nAgainst this backdrop, the civil society organisations including organisations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) should immediately undertake awareness-raising through advocacy, seminars and events on assistive technology, targeting policymakers, ministries, manufacturers, and distributors of AT.\nInvesting in AT can have a transformative impact on people's well-being, which makes sound economic sense for the government. Investment in the provision of four assistive products\u2014hearing aids, prostheses, eyeglasses, and wheelchairs\u2014results in a return on investment (ROI) of 9:1 (ATscale). Hence, the government should consider allocating sufficient funds for production, import, provision, capacity-building and service delivery systems to unlock the potential of persons with disabilities and thereby enhance the country`s economic growth. The government must ensure meaningful consultation with and participation of AT users, persons with disabilities and their representative organisations in budget planning, formulation, and implementation thereof.\nATscale, the global partnership on AT hosted by UNOPS, and its partners are observing the first-ever World Day for Assistive Technology today (June 4), with the goal to bring attention to the issue and encourage action as part of the Unlock The Everyday campaign. We urge the government to allocate enough money in the upcoming national budget for FY2024-25 to enhance everyone's access to AT.\nRejaul Siddiquee is advocate at the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Transportation of merchandise by sea has become costlier as spot rates (of freight) for containershipping have seen unprecedented hike within the span of a month. Such rise in ocean freight has struck fear among Bangladeshi shippers as the development reminds them of the pandemic time when freight rates had gone up to even 300 per cent due to shortage of containers. Now, freight rates between Chattogram and China has increased by about 100 per cent. As a result, a twenty-foot container would cost around US$1,500 to transport to China, which is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Similarly, the spot rate between Bangladesh and Singapore has gone up by 50 per cent raising the per twenty-foot unit (TEU) transport cost to US$300. Between Bangladesh and Colombo, the rate increased by 15 per cent, pushing up per TEU cargo carrying cost to US$230.The reason for the spot rate hike, according to shipping agents, is the crisis in the Red Sea, a major sea route connecting Asia and Europevia Suez Canal through the Mediterranean Sea. Severe congestions at the major transhipment ports like Singapore have also been shown as another reason for spot rate hike. Now with the Houthi rebels of Yemen blocking entry of all kinds of ships through the Red Sea, the shipping operators have to reroute their cargo vessels around the Cape of Good Hope of South Africa, which adds 3,500 to 4,000 kilometres to the sea route or 14 to 15 extra days of travel time to European ports. Notably, Europe is a major destination of Bangladesh's chief export, apparel products. Against this backdrop, the Western buyers may like to pay lower rates for Bangladesh's apparel and other products because of higher freight charges. To adjust source cost, they may even prefer to look for alternative sources to cut costs. Unfortunately, the higher shipment cost has come at a time when the country's export sector is trying to adjust to the falling demand in the key markets. Despite this challenge, exporters are in a race to manufacture products with an eye to the upcoming summer markets of the West. In sum, as a result of the shipping cost hike, Bangladeshi exporters have found themselves in a tight corner as they will have to meet the supply orders placed by overseas buyers regardless of the risk of lower or even zero profit margin. They cannot under any circumstances afford to lose their overseas buyers. That further strengthens the argument for widening the export market by adding more destinations. In that case, uncertainties of financial or political origin in any particular export market may not badly affect the overall export. However, export is not the only issue that spot rate hike has given rise to. In fact, the crisis has also impacted import cost of goods thereby driving up the inflationary pressure on Bangladesh economy further. However, as container freight hike is a global problem, the government will be required to keep close watch on the developments as well as maintain communication with its major trading partners in order to meet the emerging challenges.At the same time, given the not-so-commendable track record of local traders, particularly those dealing in essential commodities, the common consumers have reason to be concerned. So, the government will have to mount its vigilance, so that traders may not take undue advantage of the rise in shipping cost to make the kitchen market further volatile.",

        "full_article": "Is there a paradox between growth and macro-economic stability? In normal circumstances they are considered complementary-one reinforcing the other; but asking which comes as the foremost priority may lead to answers that would tend to vary from place to place reflecting the various dimensions characterising economies. Is it appropriate to say that while macro-economic stability of a country is the precondition for economic growth, the latter may not necessarily be indicative of the former? The trade-off between the two is not simple enough. Macroeconomic stability can be defined and measured in different dimensions including real, nominal and external stability. To speak of the most important one, real stability is related to sustained and stable growth in economic activity and employment, and is measured by business cycle indicators, such as the unemployment rate or the output gap. Macroeconomic stability is often considered a buffer against currency and interest fluctuations in the global market. Exposure to currency fluctuations, large debt burdens, and unmanaged inflation can cause economic crises and a collapse of GDP. It is here that macro-economic stability features as the foundation of an economy. Economists consider five variables to measure macro-economic stability. These include low and stable inflation, low long-term interest rates, low national debt relative to GDP, low deficits, and currency stability.At a press meet in the capital recently, the issue came up as the main focus of discussion as the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) stressed upon the importance of long-term macroeconomic stability instead of annual GDP growth in the forthcoming national budget in order to ride out the many challenges facing the country. The event was organised as part of the CPD's interim review of the national economy. The think tank also observed that the ongoing macroeconomic instability and consequent policy adjustments, largely influenced by the IMF lending conditionalities, have adversely affected the country's economic growth prospects. CPD's review also suggests that taming inflation and bringing stability of interest and foreign-exchange rates should be the key focus of policymakers in the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2024-25. \"The priority should be given to overall macroeconomic stability, rather than focusing on high growth target, in the coming budget,\" said Golam Moazzem, research director of the CPD, while presenting the findings of the interim review at the media briefing. Referring to the major issues CPD's review states that the country's economy is currently under significant strains stemming from several challenges such as policy weaknesses, poor governance, and inadequate reforms resulting in low revenue collection, reduced fiscal space, increased government borrowing from banks, and a fast declining forex reserve. The think tank also recommends that policymakers implement concrete measures to provide relief to inflation-affected individuals with limited incomes by meaningfully expanding and utilising the existing social safety-net programmes. It observed that the performance of the economy in the first 10 months of FY24 suggests that the remaining months will continue to face ongoing challenges, despite some positive policy measures initiated by the Bangladesh Bank. \"This is because policy outcomes take time to materialise. Moreover, the effectiveness of any policy also relies on complementary measures in other areas,\" the CPD review adds. It also states that in Bangladesh, it is a matter of regret that it has become customary to set targets concerning the macroeconomic framework that are not consistent with ongoing realities. Enhancing fiscal space, prioritising expenditure, and foreign financing ought to guide the public finance management in FY2025, said the review, adding that complementarity between the fiscal and monetary policies must be ensured for positive outcomes of policy measures and improving macroeconomic performance. There is thus a crucial need to address the structural problems such as establishing good governance and strengthening institutions through reforms. In this connection, the CPD review says that a proper revision of Competition Act 2012 should be made to address monopolies by incorporating specific anti-trust clauses and concrete penalties for violators.The reason underlying CPD's emphasis on macro-economic stability over growth can be traced to the global trend of populist campaigns, where GDP growth is unfortunately seen as a misnomer. As a casualty of cheap political maneuvering, GDP growth alone no longer serves as a decisive indicator of an economy's health. Esteemed economists, including Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, have extensively explored the paradoxical relationship between GDP growth and the actual well-being of the masses. Therefore, what truly matters for public well-being is the elimination of uncertainty and instability within the overall economic structure-perhaps sometimes at a cost to growth! This approach underscores the importance of a stable economic environment in fostering sustainable development and ensuring that the benefits of economic progress are widely shared. By prioritising stability, policymakers can aim to create a more resilient economy that can better withstand global and domestic shocks and provide a stronger foundation for long-term prosperity.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Policymakers do not want to hear anything about 'capacity payment'. Yet, capacity payment simply cannot be ignored because it remains the cornerstone of the lop-sided energy sector planning that successive governments have been loath to let go. It falls under 'The Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act 2010' that has earned enough infamy for allowing contracts to build power plants in this country, regardless of fuel/solar energy it is run on. The very opacity of the Act and the mantra based on the principle 'no questions asked' method of awarding contracts leaves little to imagination why such stupendous amounts of public money have been squandered in the name of capacity payment.The ambiguity of the Act allows for neither any transparency of nor accountability, including parliamentary debate, for the terms of these contracts. Apparently, Bangladesh is living in a democratic country where the rule of law ought to reign supreme. Then can one not ask why is it that policymakers refuse to bring back competitive tendering where all parties have a level-playing field to compete and win contracts? Sadly, these questions keep coming up because capacity payment has gone through the roof and power produced today depends on either imported fossil fuels or natural gas - the former is too expensive and the latter is depleting at an alarming rate.Since the government had planned for a number of large gas-fired power plants to join the energy mix, it would have also planned for large-scale exploration of natural gas reserves in the country. The latter was left alone since the policymakers assumed that imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) would always be within reach and the economy would continue to gallop at 6.0 + per cent growth per annum and consequently everything would be great. Unforeseen geopolitical tensions never really factored into the grand scheme of things and today, the economy is left to its own devices to pick up the pieces. A report published in this newspaper says, \"Sources said five new facilities with the total generation capacity of 2,673 megawatt have either completed construction or are nearing completion to initiate test runs and then come into operation. Of the plants, two are owned by the private sector and three by the public sector.\"The very nature of capacity payment means the national exchequer has started to pay capacity charges to private-sector owned power plants from Day 1 of completion, no matter if they cannot go into operation due to shortage of gas. The question is, why weren't these contracts annulled because the economic downturn started back in 2019 with the onset of Covid-19. A brief respite came in 2020 but then the world was turned on its head with the commencement of the Russo-Ukrainian war and prices of food went through the roof. By the government's own admission, billions of dollars had to be spent to procure foodstuffs and with the onset of sustained recession, the major markets (EU, Britain and USA) where Bangladesh sends the bulk of its exports are importing less. It is time the agreements with rental power plants were annulled. Capacity payments are bleeding the country white. The country cannot even pay for the cross-border electricity imports, natural gas produced locally by foreign companies or meet import bills of LNG/fossil fuel. The economy cannot sustain any wasteful payment. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

This year's theme, \"Our Land, Our Future. We are #GenerationRestoration,\" highlights a critical issue: the degradation of land and the urgent need to combat desertification and enhance resilience to drought.Currently, up to 40 per cent of the world's land is degraded, affecting approximately 3.2 billion people globally. Projections indicate that by 2050, over three-quarters of the world's population will be impacted by drought. These alarming statistics underscore the necessity for immediate and sustained action. Human-induced environmental damage is escalating, with serious consequences such as climate change, ecosystem loss, and widespread desertification. As members of the current generation, it is our duty to reverse this damage. We must prioritise restoring our lands to their natural state, not only for the benefit of the environment but also for the well-being of future generations.We are #GenerationRestoration. It is within our power to mitigate the impacts of desertification and drought. By raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, and taking concrete actions to restore degraded lands, we can ensure a sustainable future for all. On the World Environment Day, let's commit ourselves to protecting our environment and restoring our lands. Our collective efforts today will determine the health and viability of our planet for generations to come.\nAsif IslamStudent Jahangirnagar University",
