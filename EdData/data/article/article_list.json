But, what we have instead is polarising campaign rhetoric about Muslims. Modi gave a speech in Banswara, Rajasthan, on Sunday. Congress has gone to EC against it. BJP said Modi called spade a spade. Congress and others also point to the party\u2019s 2024 manifesto and the 2006 Manmohan Singh speech, which Modi referred to. The argument from the other side is that Congress\u2019s manifesto does talk of wealth inequality but doesn\u2019t anywhere refer to wealth being redistributed to anyone, Muslims or otherwise; that Singh\u2019s speech referred to many groups that need special policy attention, SC/STs, OBCs, women, children, minorities including Muslims; and that Singh hadn\u2019t said only Muslims have the first claim on resources.\n\nIn one part of his Monday campaign speech in Aligarh, Modi seemed to have come back to a more familiar BJP line \u2013 that the likes of Congress and SP practise \u201cappeasement politics\u201d vis a vis Muslims while his party works for \u201cuplift\u201d of the community. And BJP strategists now are also pointing to a Rahul Gandhi campaign speech that talked about a \u201cwealth survey\u201d. In that speech, Rahul had said post a census on caste and minority numbers, wealth, jobs, welfare will be distributed per every group\u2019s share in population. Politics, on all sides, is about taking your opponent\u2019s words and spinning those to your advantage.\nThe larger point is India doesn\u2019t need rhetoric from any party on resource distribution that gets embroiled in identity politics. Once such links are made, politics around it can acquire a life of its own, far removed from real issues. What is the real issue? Benefits of India\u2019s brisk growth, for a long time, have been unevenly distributed. This is true across regions and communities, irrespective of who\u2019s in office where and when. The process was pretty much coterminous with reforms, happening under Congress and BJP govts. Not enough industrial jobs were created. GOI\u2019s current emphasis on PLI factories is good but not adequate given the scale of the problem. So, the shift from farm to factories on a scale required didn\u2019t happen, and isn\u2019t happening. That\u2019s why every political party is out to promise so many welfare schemes. Netas know all of this \u2013 they just don\u2019t talk about it.\n\n",

But selling out to China won\u2019t help Maldives\nMaldivian President Mohamed Muizzu\u2019s People\u2019s National Congress securing a two-thirds majority in the archipelago nation\u2019s parliament may further complicate New DelhiMale ties. Muizzu has made no secret about his anti-India and pro-China stance since he assumed office last year. With the legislature solidly in his pocket, there\u2019s little to stop him from tilting fully towards Beijing. However, this won\u2019t be the first time Maldives has tried to play off India and China.\n\nChequered past\u00a0| India has been first-responder for Maldives by dint of geography. From Operation Cactus in 1988 to the 2014 Maldives water crisis, New Delhi has promptly aided Male when requested. However, former Maldivian president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom started the game of leveraging China over India in the 1990s in response to Maldives\u2019 growing democratic movement. This provided an entry-point for Beijing.\nGrowing Chinese presence\u00a0| Having gained access to infra projects in Maldives, in subsequent years China would slowly expand its footprint. Even during perceived pro-India president Mohamed Nasheed\u2019s tenure, a Sino-Maldivian agreement on Chinese supply of military hardware and training had surfaced. The pro-China momentum was further consolidated under the presidencies of Mohammed Waheed and Abdullah Yameen.\nDivided polity\u00a0| Maldivian politics today is split down the middle between those who favour better ties with India and those who seek greater Chinese assistance. True, much of this may be political posturing as Muizzu\u2019s \u2018India Out\u2019 campaign suggests. But Male is walking a dangerous line.\nStrategic landmines\u00a0| It\u2019s one thing for Muizzu to order Indian troops engaged in rescue and rehabilitation missions out, quite another to allow a Chinese spy ship to dock in Maldives as happened in Feb. China wants to strategically encircle India. Male shouldn\u2019t play along. Becoming a Chinese vassal will eventually undermine Maldivian sovereignty. Or ensnare it in debt trap. Look at Cambodia and Sri Lanka for examples. Is Muizzu selling out to Beijing?\n\n",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh Bank (BB)'s policy of tightening money supply to combat inflation has been instrumental in pushing up commercial banks' interest rates. The BB has allowed commercial banks to add 3.5 per cent margin to the benchmark rate, the so-called SMART. Notably, the BB in July las year, removed the 9.0 per cent lending cap rate leading to the rise in interest rate spread. Left to the market, banks are charging higher rates of interest against loans. As rural borrowers cannot afford such costly loans, banks have been shifting their investments to the urban centres in increasing volumes. As a consequence, the cottage, micro, small and medium enterprises (CMSMEs) have reportedly been hit hard because with the rise in the cost of credit, the goods they produce are getting costlier and thus losing competitiveness in the market. Small wonder that cheaper imported goods are replacing them gradually. This is bad news for the CMSMEs, which are a major source of rural employment. In fact, rising cost of fund is affecting every sector of business and economy. But unlike in the urban context, the demand for credit is dropping faster in the rural economy forcing banks to scale down their rural credit operation. According to BB data, the share of the commercial banks' rural investment has declined from 12.02 per cent (in June 2023) to 8.05 per cent by December 2023. In absolute terms, within just six months, banks' investments in the rural areas have shrunk by Tk 0.5 trillion or Tk 500 billion (from Tk1.74 trillion to Tk1.24 trillion). This is because of withdrawal of financial resources on a massive scale from the rural economy. The money has gone to the urban areas. What is further concerning is that, as reported on Monday last in this paper, rural deposit rates, too, have declined substantially in recent months. However, this may have to do with the rising cost of living induced by high inflation. The trend is unsettling. From June 2023 till the year end, going by the BB, the share of rural bank deposits declined from 21.27 per cent to 15.23 per cent, or in other words, by 5.04 percentage points. Clearly, this indicates an increasing rate of rural pauperisation.The government should intervene by way of increasing its financial support for rural communities. Moreover, the development goes against the spirit of bridging the financial inclusion gap between the urban and the underprivileged rural communities. Early this year, though, this paper carried a report (January 17), which showed a significant surge in rural deposits --- six times higher than urban ones. The credit for that was given to agent banking, an alternative channel to expand financial inclusion of the least privileged in the rural communities. But if the latest BB report is to go by, the enthusiasm that stimulated higher rates of rural deposits seems to have ebbed and the opposite trend has set in. This has to be stopped. Further intensification of agent banking can do this. Hopefully, the central bank, which introduced agent banking more than a decade back, would further strengthen and expand the service system to help rural communities ride out the ongoing inflationary shock. Also the bankers who work in rural setting should be more sensitive to the needs of the rural entrepreneurs and ensure their access to bank credit without much hassle.",

        "full_article": "Reports say that banks' corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending dropped by 38 per cent in July-December period of 2023 compared with that in the previous six months. For CSR purposes, 53 scheduled banks spent Tk 3.53 billion in July-December of 2023 against Tk 5.71 billion in January-June of 2023 and Tk 5.14 billion in July-December of 2022, according to Bangladesh Bank data.Liquidity crisis coupled with high distress assets reportedly forced them to curtail their CSR spending. According to central bank data, the amount of excess liquidity in banks dropped to Tk 1.5 trillion in February from Tk 1.6 trillion in January.Of the total CSR expenses in July-December of 2023, the highest Tk 729 million, was spent on education sector, followed by Tk 723 million on health sector. According to the BB report, CSR spending by banks declined massively on education, health and disaster management in July-December period compared to the previous six months.No doubt, this is bad news for CSR activities in the country. It is the state-owned enterprises and commercial banks that are believed to be responsible for dishing out funds for CSR undertakings. There is thus the debate whether these organisations, banks particularly, are doing their job right in delivering what should have been the most unblemished of services to society at large.Questions raised on banks' CSR spending are many, ranging from how and where the money is being spent, to the most pointed of the queries - why. However, if the money went in the right direction with sustainable impact on the fields it was spent, the disbursing banks should be felicitated. In order to examine the actual situation, there is the need to put the array of activities under scrutiny by the Bangladesh Bank. Reports say that the BB is currently at work on this. Most observers believe that a thorough scrutiny would reveal a good deal of irregularities, even gross malpractices.It has been learnt that the central bank has formulated an indicative guideline for banks' CSR spending. As per the guideline, banks and NBFIs will henceforth have to spend 2.5 per cent of their net profits on CSR activities. However, losing concerns would be exempted from the spending. The guideline, reportedly, has also specified areas for CSR expenditure and imposed a ceiling on sectoral allocations, with the highest share of 30 per cent going to education each year.In order to render the guideline comprehensive, it is important that it incorporate other priority areas where activities under the CSR funding would be able to address a host of existing as well as emerging socio-economic issues in a sustainable manner. Needless to mention, a good deal of success of the activities will depend on how effectively these are monitored, and in so doing, taking the stakeholders on board would hopefully yield better results.Although Bangladesh has been practising CSR for some time now, it is clear that its method and target are both narrowed down to financial allocations by state-owned enterprises and banks for socio-economic well-being of the masses in critically vulnerable situations. However, CSR activities can be best practised in the work culture of businesses that in other words means millions of employees are directly benefited under the broad facilitating ambit of corporate welfare. It is in this context that CSR is a self-regulating business model that helps a company to be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders and the public. By practising corporate social responsibility, also called corporate citizenship, companies can be conscious of the kind of impact they are having on all aspects of society including economic, social, and environmental. To engage in CSR means that in the normal course of business, a company is operating in ways that benefit society and the environment. This means prohibiting unfair treatment and allowing a work culture based on recognising the needs of the workers, the clientele community and society at large constitute the basic principle of CSR.CSR activities are gradually being integrated into international business practices and hence are becoming the determining factors for market access. Thus a focus on CSR in Bangladesh would be useful not only for improving corporate governance, labour rights, work place safety, fair treatment of workers, community development and environment management, but also for industrialisation and ensuring global market access.The fact that globally CSR is widely pervasive in a range of business activities is becoming increasingly evident. Bangladesh's exports had to suffer due to its failings and inadequacies in recent times in maintaining some of the basics of corporate business culture, particularly in respect of employer-employee relations, labour rights, environment issues, wage structure and so on. Companies, however, are now more careful than before to ensure that businesses do not suffer. But how far have our firms risen to address the corporate responsibility issues remains a question.CSR is, thus, not just about targeting some social and economic backwardness in society but because of the wide-ranging objective of welfare and social responsibility, it is more about fair play, even-handedness and justice. It is time we looked at this broad aspect of CSR as an instrument of greater social welfare. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The national board of revenue (NBR) is slated to overhaul the individual income tax regime in the upcoming national budget. According to a report published in this newspaper, it is understood that the government is to introduce higher rate of taxation ---up to 30 per cent from the current rate of 25 per cent--- to be levied on individuals having income over Tk 1.6 million. Needless to say, this will more than ruffle the feathers of the richest in society, should the current plan holds.One can understand why the NBR is going back to its earlier decision, given that revenue generation has fallen to a record low at a time of economic uncertainties. Economists however do not believe this measure will do much to significantly raise government earnings because in their opinion, NBR ought to be concentrating its efforts on widening the tax net (rather than raising the tax rate). To put it in layman's terms, it makes more sense to have more tax-payable individuals under the tax net with tax rates remaining at a more moderate level - instead of taxing higher the small percentage of high-income individuals.While there is some justification that a higher tax rate can help reduce the income inequality in society, it still leaves the government in a fix. Because the number of rich people in the country is not infinite, whereas by government's own estimates, millions of citizens do not pay income tax. While progressive taxation does make sense and it has widely been adopted by scores of countries around the world, the situation in Bangladesh where vast numbers of people can and do get away without paying any individual income tax is mind-boggling. Direct income tax remains a primary source of revenue collection for any government in the world - this is a proven fact.The \"country's tax base is still poor as many people are still not paying taxes or submitting zero-tax returns,\" says Dr Razzaque, chairman of Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID) and Research Director of Policy Research Institute (PRI).\" The problem of levying heavy tax on existing taxpayers is likely to have a boomerang effect whereby people will be less incentivised to pay taxes in the first place. Despite claims that with digitisation financial information is more readily available to financial authorities, there will always be loopholes that people will resort to, to avoid paying taxes.One of the prime examples of this situation can be highlighted when land registration costs were increased by an unheard-of 100 per cent by the last minister of finance during his tenure. People were still buying / selling immovable property but registration of the same went down significantly. Deeds were signed, money exchanged between buyer and seller but the formal handover of property was delayed. Government revenue from this very lucrative sector fell drastically. Although the decision has been reversed somewhat, people are yet to return to the previous years when the land registration fee was around 2.0 per cent and this is something that government needs to consider very, very seriously. While it is easier for the NBR to track salaried-individuals, since their paycheck goes to the bank, what is there to stop companies from paying partial salaries in cash and rest in to the bank to avoid this increase in taxation? Efforts should be made to bring the untaxed under the tax net instead of raising taxes for existing tax payers. This policy would serve the state much better in revenue mobilisation from a sustainable point of view.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

This element now poses a significant threat to the country's homeless, elderly, and children, who anxiously anticipate relief from the scorching temperatures and the possibility of rainfall. Yet, despite forecasts from the Meteorological Office predicting rain, the much-desired relief has not come. Already, numerous cases have emerged of elderly individuals and children falling ill, even succumbing to heatstroke.This relentless heat has intensified sufferings of people working in the open. To the various challenges they face, the heat wave has now added an extra burden, disrupting their regular activities. Crop destruction, electricity shortages, and water scarcity have become prevalent. If the effects of the heat wave persist, the death toll may rise, necessitating a declaration of a state of emergency. Such a situation would impede the country's progress.Experts recommend that individuals carry water, umbrellas, hats, and other essentials to mitigate the risk of heatstroke during this time. Additionally, cooling centres, such as flood shelters, should be established in urban areas to assist the vulnerable, elderly, and children. Efforts must also be taken to address deforestation, the primary cause of exposure to sun. Immediate initiatives, whether from government or private entities, should prioritise tree plantation. Rooftop gardens and plantation of trees along roadsides, riverbanks, canal banks, home and office yards, and fields can be of help. Moreover, water sources should be augmented across the country. Ultimately, we bear responsibility for environmental degradation. Neglecting the environment in pursuit of luxury will only lead to further disregard for Nature. Maintaining environmental balance is essential for our own well-being, as failure to do so will result in natural calamities. Public awareness campaigns should be launched to underscore the importance of environmental stewardship.\nMd.
