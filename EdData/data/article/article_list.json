        "full_article": "That the wrong remedy could exacerbate an ailment and not cure it is a well understood adage. This holds true for the Union government\u2019s (Department of Personnel & Training \u2013 DoPT) proposals to amend Rule 6 related to deputation of cadre officers of the IAS (Cadre) Rules 1954. Reports have shown that the deputation from States to the Union government has been uneven. Some States have not nominated officers for deputation adequately to work with the Union government; in this, West Bengal (11 out of the 280 officers are on central deputation), Rajasthan (13 out of 247) and Telangana (7 out of an authorised strength of 208) stand out. This has led to vacancies across Union government ministries. Numbers accessed by The Hindu show that actual deputation as a percentage of the mandated reserves fell from 69% (2014) to 30% (2021), suggesting that there is merit in the DoPT\u2019s identification of shortages in deputation being an issue. But does this necessitate the rule changes proposed by the DoPT, which include acquiring overriding powers for the Union government that will do away with seeking approval from the States for transferring IAS and IPS officers?Two of the rules are particularly problematic \u2014 in case of any disagreement between the Union and State governments, the States shall give effect to the former\u2019s decision \u201cwithin a specified time\u201d. And in some \u201cspecific situations\u201d, States would have to depute certain cadres whose services are sought by the Union government. These changes amount to arm-twisting States and unwilling bureaucrats to be deputed to serve the Union government and also presenting a fait accompli to States for \u201cspecific situations\u201d which have not been defined and prone to misinterpretation and politicisation. These proposed changes have unsurprisingly raised the hackles of State governments. As governance responsibilities during the pandemic have shown, States are quite dependent upon the bureaucracy, and deputation to the Union government should not be done at the cost of State requirements. Also, the Union government must address the key question of the reluctance of capable civil servants to be deputed away from the States. Reports have indicated that civil servants have found the top-down culture in Union government offices to be stifling and prefer the relative autonomy at the State level. There is clearly a need for a more qualitative approach that tackles such work culture issues. Besides, a State-by-State look at deputation that disincentivises those States which depute officers much below the mandated numbers to the Union government by adjusting future cadre strength reviews by the Union Public Service Commission should also address the shortage problem. These steps are better than any rule changes that amount to fiats striking at federalism.",

Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat\u2019s attempt to bring the four shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri as well as other temples under one board ended with the 2019 Act being withdrawn in November 2021, after continued opposition from priests. The new Chief Minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, who in July 2021 replaced Tirath Singh Rawat, who had replaced Mr. Trivendra Singh Rawat in March of the same year, carried out a review. Mr. Dhami said while the decision to constitute the board may have been taken with good intentions, it had been rolled back after discussion within the Government. Going into the elections, everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to local leaders in the BJP have touted the redevelopment of Kedarnath as among the achievements of what they call the \u201cdouble engine\u201d government in the Centre and Uttarakhand. In December, Mr. Modi inaugurated the start of the Lakhwar multipurpose project and \u20b98,700 crore-worth of road projects. With the Government backing major infrastructure projects, Mr. Modi termed this the decade of Uttarakhand. While environmentalists have raised concerns over rules being broken for the large infrastructure projects, major parties have not yet raised the environmental concerns.Issues of national security and the welfare of ex-service members are also dominating the campaign. With a large population of retired soldiers, Uttarakhand politics has always witnessed some grandstanding on issues that appeal to them. The brother of the late Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, Col. (retd.) Vijay Rawat, joined the BJP this week. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has projected another retired colonel, Ajay Kothiyal, as its chief ministerial candidate and promised government jobs to all ex-service members in the State. Mr. Dhami has spoken as the \u201cson of a soldier\u201d and said the BJP alone respects the forces. The BJP is trying to fight anti-incumbency and the impression that it is a divided house, having changed two Chief Ministers within months in 2021. The Congress is hoping to wrest back power, after having lost it in 2017. Infighting and tussles over ticket distribution within the party have come out into the open, with former Chief Minister Harish Rawat being one of the claimants to the leadership position. AAP has joined the race with the promise of development, replicating the Delhi model, and an end to the \u201cpower sharing\u201d between the BJP and the Congress. A raft of promises, from free water and electricity to better schools, is being made. What is lacking is an informed debate on a development model that is suitable to the ecologically fragile place that Uttarakhand is.",

        "full_article": "Can the flapping of a butterfly's wings here cause a storm elsewhere? The vice-chancellor of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), who is experiencing a version of chaos theory, will tell you it sure can. Students of his university have come alive to participate in the \"woke\" culture, to take him off of a pedestal, and to \"cancel\" him over an alleged misdemeanour of one of his colleagues, who dismissed the grievances of her students allegedly in a derogatory manner. What started as a simple protest over the quality of food in a dormitory has now morphed into a fast-unto-death movement for the removal of the vice-chancellor.\nIt all began on January 13, 2022, when the resident students of Begum Sirajunnesa Chowdhury Hall requested their provost to come over to sample the meal. A host of other issues plaguing the dormitory was raised at the same time, including food offered in the nearby cafeteria at a lower price, Wi-Fi speed, lack of safe water, allowing guardians to attend their sick wards, cleanliness of toilets, and setting the number of students in each room. All fair demands, but they did not receive a sympathetic hearing. Students were provoked to storm out of their dorm, and they gathered in front of the VC's residence around eight in the wintry evening demanding immediate resignation of the provost. The VC reportedly came out at three in the morning, asking the students to return to their rooms and lodge a formal complaint during office hours. Fair enough, but why take so long to point out the obvious?\nThe next day, when the students met with the VC with a formal petition, he categorically told them that the issues raised would be solved within a month. The demand for the provost's resignation, however, was uncalled for, he said. Again, why give an instant verdict without formally investigating the events of the night before?\nProtests grew as ordinary students demanded a change in the system. The students corralled the VC in one of the office buildings and blocked the main access road to the campus. The campus became paralysed. Sensing a shift in power, members of the pro-government student wing infiltrated the mob and tried to forcibly disperse the gathering. The surgical operation to remove the student growth not only failed, but also caused the toxicity to spread at a rapid pace. The provost in question resigned citing personal reasons\u2014a move too late. The fulcrum has shifted, and the \"woke\" students now have one demand: \"cancel\" the VC.\nStranded in the office building for hours, the university administration probably called for police intervention. I say probably because no one is claiming credit for this decision, now that it has proven disastrous. And theoretically, as per the university ordinance, police cannot enter/act on campus without prior permission of the university authority.\nThe angry mob reacted to the police presence, and the armed force acted on \"self-defence,\" charging batons, firing rubber bullets, and hurling sound grenades. The disproportionate use of force left many students injured and hospitalised. Force was applied when restraints were required. The mighty uniformed force simply intensified the ongoing crisis. Scores of students started a hunger strike demanding unconditional resignation of the VC. They are not even willing to engage in any dialogue.\nProf Farid Uddin Ahmed, who was credited for bringing positive change to the academic culture of SUST in his first term, suddenly finds himself facing mass public shaming. Social media is rife with his academic deficiency of not having a PhD. He is facing public backlash after social media users unearthed sexist jokes he had allegedly made in the past. Referring to female students of Jahangirnagar University (JU) seen walking around the campus after dark, in an audio clip Prof Ahmed is heard saying, \"Do you want to be like JU students whom no one wants to marry?\" Not surprisingly, the JU Teachers' Association condemned the comment, and many others highlighted the liberal culture in which a female university student should thrive to become a productive citizen, and not necessarily a wedding product.\nThings are not looking bright for Prof Ahmed as the protesters remain adamant on their one-point, fast-unto-death demand for his removal. The only silver line for him is that the government still thinks there is not enough ground to dismiss him vis-a-vis student agitation. The age-old formula of phasing out is now being tried. The public is keenly observing the stare game to see who blinks first. The trend so far: the government does not publicly yield to any external pressure that might create a precedence. Even the JU teachers who have signed the protest letter know it very well from their own experience of dealing with the vices of their VC.\nIf you review the sequence of events originating from a regular complaint, you will notice an absolute lack of professionalism among all concerned. I can say it with confidence as a former student of a public university who knows about the abysmal quality of food served in the dorms that allow different stakeholders to cash in from the surrounding cafeteria network. As a former journalist who had to observe various twists and turns of a brewing student agitation, I can see how things have unfurled out of control. As a university teacher, I can understand the thin line that separates the faculty members from the students, and the campus power dynamics that are never addressed. I can understand the frustration out of which a teacher can say, \"We are not peasants or scumbags that students could speak to us in such abusive manners.\" No matter how politically incorrect she might sound in articulating her frustrations, the fact remains: the language of protest does not necessarily conform to any civility and polity. Students do use hurtful comments in the heat of the moment, which we are supposed to ignore. As a university administrator, I know how the SUST colleagues allowed the tension to simmer and reach its boiling point. As an ordinary citizen of Bangladesh, I know nothing is what it seems. Somehow, the Zen thinking is deeply ingrained in our culture where we are quick to see through layers.\nThe antibody against an \"imported\" VC, the local/non-local calculus in a regional campus, the untimely discourse on his academic qualifications, and the second term are all signature ingredients in teachers' politics. The muddy current in which the students are whirling will allow a deft angler to find his fish once the water is cleared. We are not strangers to such fishy intrigues. So, going forward, may I suggest the following:\n1. Appoint vice-chancellors with impeccable academic and administrative track records, so that it does not compromise the leadership of an institution. By the same token, politicisation and regionalism should not have anything to do with anointing an academic leader.\n2. Establish the right protocol for a grievance policy: aggrieved students must know when and how to express their grievances. Insisting on a spot visit by the provost after her office hours is inappropriate. The same students who will join the workforce in a year or two will learn it the hard way. Why don't we introduce them to the ways of the world? Why don't we establish a line authority, where the cafeteria manager knows how to record the concerns of the students and raise the issue before the appropriate body? Then again, a provost must establish a rapport with the residential students to earn their confidence and cooperation. She cannot simply shoo her students away, saying, \"What's the urgency? Is anyone dying? Go out if you want. Where will you go?\" These are completely unprofessional remarks\u2014the flapping of the butterfly wings\u2014that caused the storm in the VC's office. Faculty members are not trained to become administrators. We expect them to perform administrative duties without any formal orientation.\n3. The student wing of a political party must stop acting like a rescue operation unit for the administration. They are a student wing and should primarily work for the betterment of the campus culture.\n4. An academic campus is a highly sensitive area where the armed forces must act and perform with utmost diligence and sensitivity. The armed gear itself acts as a sign of provocation. Police should have specially trained campus units to deal with student agitation.\nWe can all see how the butterfly is flapping its wings at SUST. We must try to discern what's causing the flapping, and why.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts\u00a0Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "The sudden approval of a draft Election Commission law by the cabinet certainly gives the government and the ruling party a powerful public relation tool, as they can claim they have done what no other party even attempted in the last 50 years. Why wouldn't they? It was, after all, portrayed by some eminent civil society voices as the most important necessity to restore trust in our election management system.\nQuite a good number of political parties also demanded a legal instrument for the formation of the next Election Commission. However, it has to be noted here that most of these parties either have been or still are in partnership with the Awami League. And, regrettably, these parties have never raised any urgency for such a law before in their 13-year-long partnership in running the country. It seems that they have regained their conscience only after the outside world\u2014the Biden administration, in particular\u2014started exerting visible pressure for restoration of democracy in Bangladesh.\nThere is no doubt that a legal framework for constituting an Election Commission and making them independent and sufficiently empowered is quite crucial. But in absence of a broader political consensus, especially in the present composition of parliament, no legislation can bring an end to the ongoing political crisis stemming from mutual distrust and hatred among two major contenders of power. In reality, there are only seven representatives from the ruling party's real rival, the BNP, whose critical voices are almost lost in the crowd. No one needs a reminder that the official opposition in Jatiya Sangsad, the Jatiya Party, had a seat-sharing arrangement with the Awami League in the last election and wanted to be in the government, but was forced to roleplay in the opposition bench. Besides, there's the Damocles' Sword: Article 70 of the constitution makes it impossible for any member of parliament to act according to his/her conscience or the will of their constituents.\nThere is no alternative to extended and exhaustive consultations and intense debate for a good piece of legislation. However, records of our parliament show exactly the opposite. Who can forget the passing of the Digital Security Act (DSA), ignoring all suggestions, demands and opposition, despite the promises made to the Editors' Council by three ministers that their concerns would be addressed? Now, the government admits that there have been abuses and misuses of the DSA, and a revision of it is being considered. Had those concerns about repressive provisions been redressed beforehand, writer Mushtaq Ahmed might be alive today. The DSA is not an exception; ignoring critical opinions in formulating legislations and policies has become a trademark of the current government.\nHence, there's apprehension that the new law on Election Commission would be a mere formalisation of the practice that was followed in formation of the previous two commissions. Some critics predict even worse. Though the government is yet to make the draft law public, it has been reported in the media that one provision in the draft grants blanket immunity from future legal challenges against the formations of commissions led by Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmed and KM Nurul Huda. It clearly reflects a political motive behind the government's unanticipated U-turn on the issue. We were told by the law minister recently that his government had no wish to make any law unilaterally. He said, \"The law should be acceptable to all the parties to make it universal, and not to just one party.\" Is a universal law possible without any dialogue and agreement with the main challenger of the ruling party, the BNP? And can it be done in a forum which is ridiculously overwhelmed by the ruling party and its allies?\nIn our 50-year history, the best elections that we have had, and that were recognised both at home and abroad, were the ones based on political consensus. That consensus about the composition of the caretaker government provided the basis of independence and neutrality of the election commissions. Problems with the Election Commission were by and large a sideshow of the conflict over the caretaker government. Unless the issue of the governance during the electioneering is resolved, no law can guarantee the required independence of the commission as an institution, and restore peoples' trust in the electoral process.\nAccording to news reports, the proposed draft is limited in its scope within the process of recruiting a chief and commissioners of the Election Commission, but nothing about its size, powers and independence. It is, therefore, appropriately described by a former election commissioner, Sakhawat Hossain, as not being about an Election Commission, but for a search committee.\nThe draft proposes formation of a six-member Search Committee headed by a judge of the Appellate Division, nominated by the chief justice. The other members will include a judge of the High Court, the comptroller and auditor general, chairman of the Public Service Commission, and two eminent persons nominated by the president. Given the state of partisan politicisation of every state institution, it is hard to comprehend how such a Search Committee would be able to nominate independent-minded and non-partisan members capable of earning the trust and respect of all stakeholders. Under the existing constitution, can our president nominate anyone for the Search Committee without the advice of the prime minister?\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist and writes from the UK.

        "full_article": "The Rigveda describes the emergence of Virata, the cosmic colossus from which everything has been manifested. This constellation of gigantic qualities was well reflected in the captaincy of Virat Kohli, despite the series loss in South Africa that has book-ended his reign. In victory and in defeat, Kaptaan Kohli was a blockbuster. His single-minded intensity took India from a dismal seventh in the rankings to the first place in the world. In contrast to his predecessor, he was straightforward regarding his desire to excel in the game's longest and oldest format. Kohli's premium on Test cricket, coupled with his theory of aggression and fearless intent, permeated the philosophy of his team and his country. His give-it-back attitude reflected India's changing priorities, and gave its youth a figurehead after which they could model their own vast ambitions.\nA material accounting of the Kohli era undergirds the point. While others had their home fortresses, Kohli's India became an impregnable arena for visiting teams. In the 11 series between 2015 and 2021, visitors were ground to dust across the length of the country. Kohli will end his Test captaincy having never lost a home series. Opposition drubbings have become so regular that fans take India's enviable home record for granted.\nKohli's decoration as India's best Test captain is owed to his revolutionary approach to overseas series. Three features of his tenure stand out: consistently selecting five bowlers, enforcing a culture of team fitness, and the flourishing of express pace. With Kohli leading from the front, India became fitter, fiercer, and mentally tougher than nearly every other national side in the past seven years. This cricketing architecture led to victories in Sri Lanka and the West Indies, and culminated in epochal series wins in Australia in 2019 and 2021.\nVirat realised early on that 20 wickets were needed for a Test match triumph. As a bowler's captain, he elevated the performance of his veteran pacers Sharma, Yadav, and Shami, while nurturing a crop of future stars in Bumrah, Siraj, and Thakur. Under Kohli, Indian bowlers have averaged 25.02 at a strike rate of 51.8, replete with 56 five-wicket hauls\u2014far and away the best numbers from any Indian captain since 1990. Fans now look forward to watching the team field rather than bat, both in anticipation of Virat's electric antics and to watch the bowling attack operate in lethal tandem. Like Melville's Ahab, Captain Kohli was a fanatical huntsman in pursuit of the big kill. Few will be able to replicate his talents for bowler rotation or his natural strangle over a match in tense equipoise.\nKohli's ascendancy to the captaincy coincided with the coming-of-age of a generation of Indian fans, unburdened by the weight of past failures. In his first match as captain, twin centuries in Adelaide infused his calls for reinvention with the spectacle of brimstone and glory. He took Australia to the sword, giving birth to an India willing to risk losses for wins\u2014one that would never again accept a draw in satisfaction. Kohli taught us to reject meekness and to celebrate dramatic passion for our work. Authenticity became the utmost virtue\u2014it was better to play and lose in your genuine fashion, than to win in the way of another.\nThrough zealous fist pumps and the flash of his bat's blade, Kohli entreated India to fall in love again with Test cricket. Despite high praise, neither Kohli the man nor Kohli the captain were perfect creatures. For all his tactical acumen on the field, blind selection blunders over the years cost India winnable matches overseas. His persona garnered him incessant critics too, especially when the runs stopped flowing. Older Indians found him arrogant and non-deferential, with his trimmed beard and tribal tattoos. He was outspoken and was eventually outmanoeuvred by BCCI boardroom politics, leading to his captaincy ouster in all three formats within the span of mere months.\nStill, let's celebrate the maestro, and the man. He performed with unbridled enthusiasm, well cognisant of the thrills he elicited in his captive audience. Virat Kohli has been a true Delhiite: he swore freely, danced easily, and made fired-up, defiant belief his ultimate mantra. He was also loyal to his teammates, respectful of the opposition, and courageous in his duties as captain and a citizen. As he enters the pantheon alongside Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh, and Clive Lloyd, long years will pass before Test cricket is blessed with another captain of the entertaining stature like Virat Kohli.\n\u00a0\nAnvesh Jain\u00a0is a law student and cricket enthusiast based in Toronto, Canada.\n",

        "full_article": "What waited for nearly 50 years is now being implemented with super speed. Why? Until recently, the government said that there was no chance of an Election Commission law being passed in this session of parliament. So why the sudden change of mind and the incredible hurry?\nThe Awami League government drafted it, had it approved by the cabinet, and informed the president about it during its dialogue with him\u2014who welcomed it. Now, the Awami League government will place it in parliament, and the Awami League-dominated parliament will, in all likelihood, pass it in this session. And then, of course, the ruling party will congratulate the government for taking a timely action on something that everyone wanted, and then the Awami League will probably hold a nationwide celebration (maybe not due to Covid-19) for finally giving the nation an Election Commission law.\nHello, is there anyone else in the country?\nAccording to the law minister, a bill will be placed in parliament on January 23, 2022. No public discussion, no discussion with other political parties who are the main participants in the process, no sharing through public announcement, no invitation to stakeholders, no exchange of views with constitutional or election law experts, no discussion in the media, in fact no discussion with anyone except perhaps the government's inner core\u2014and yet, it is set to be placed in parliament as a bill. Of course, the bill will go through a process in which some form of hearing will probably take place, in which a hand-picked set of outsiders will be called in to testify. However, elaborate as this process may be, it will be a far cry from the type of discussion necessary to build the mass support essential for such a major step forward\u2014especially if the aim is to gather wide acceptability.\nYes, most of the political parties wanted an EC law, but definitely not a \"Search Committee law\" masquerading as an EC law. Our constitution mandates a law for the formation of the Election Commission. We never got it. Blame the military or military-led governments for not enacting such a law, but what about the democratic governments who have been ruling us since 1991? In the last 31 years, neither the BNP nor the Awami League bothered to make any law that would have highly strengthened this vital institution, kept it above so much criticism and denigration, and saved us from rotten elections that gradually eroded all meaning from the process of election.\nIn the meantime, we instituted a caretaker system to ensure free and fair elections, continued it for 15 years (1996-2011), and then abolished it. And yet, we found no time to go for the easier option of enacting an EC law with sufficient independence and guaranteed legal and moral structure and stature\u2014as it exists in other countries holding elections for decades. There was a reason for it: no ruling party of the day ever wants to lose control of the election process in which the EC plays a pivotal role, and as such, lose control over that vital institution. And what better way to control it than by determining who runs it? That was the reason why we didn't have any EC law for the last five decades. Has that mindset changed?\nIf one is of the view that something is better than nothing, then of course the Search Committee law is something to cheer about. But if that something is quite different, and if it is likely to confuse the issue further, rather than resolve it, then maybe instead of cheering, we should be concerned.\nIn a nutshell, here is what's happening. We needed a law for the formation of the Election Commission, as mandated in the constitution. Now we are being offered a law for the formation of a Search Committee, which is not asked for in the constitution. So why, instead of fulfilling a constitutional mandate, are we fulfilling something which is not?\nGiven our history of election manipulation, questions naturally arise as to what lies behind this move.\nThe government's response is that we are not seeing the real point. Instead of praising them for initiating something that did not happen for nearly 50 years, we are nit-picking and blaming them for taking the first step in that direction. The idea is that a Search Committee will recommend suitable candidates to the president, who will then appoint the new Election Commission. Isn't it much better than what we have?\nFrom what information is available in the media, the Search Committee will be headed by a serving judge of the Appellate Division, nominated by the chief justice. Another member will be a High Court judge. The chair of Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC) and the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) will be ex-officio members. Finally, there will be two nominees by the president to complete the six-member committee.\nWithout the slightest prejudice to the venerable people suggested, and with the highest respect for their professionalism and competence, it can be said that all of them are from a realm outside of politics and of dealing with people on a mass scale. Holding elections is a massive public affair\u2014perhaps the biggest\u2014which is not a bureaucrat's or official's cup of tea. These highly competent people\u2014as, at the apex of their lives, they are already habituated to doing things within \"channels\" and \"specifics of procedures,\" and are steeped in either legalism or bureaucratic maze\u2014are not trained to handle messy public affairs. As such, they will be more comfortable with people of their backgrounds and end up choosing others of the same ilk. The supreme task of the body they are tasked to form, towards which they have neither experience nor proclivity, cannot produce the type of Election Commission that will enjoy public confidence. Judges establish the rule of law, and both the BPSC chair and the CAG run offices under meticulously laid out procedures. None of them have to deal with political acceptability, public perception, and the ability to bring divergent groups together to bring about convergence, if not consensus. Judges don't negotiate, they pronounce\u2014hardly suitable for selecting people for a highly sensitive political institution.\nThis group will be a square peg in a round hole.\nThen, there are the issues of their process of functioning. How independent will they be? How openly and transparently will they be able to function? Even if they are totally open to the public eye, how will their final recommendations play out? Will it be submitted secretly? We think that the list of names given by a Search Committee should be made public with reasons given as to why the listed people were chosen. Otherwise, we will never know the choices of the committee and who were replaced and why in the final selection.\nWhen the recommendations reach the presidential palace, a whole new range of issues will arise. The president is bound by the constitution to act only on the advice of the prime minister on everything, save the well-known two issues. \"In the exercise of all his functions, save only that of appointing the prime minister pursuant to Clause 3 of Article 56 and the chief justice pursuant to Clause 1 of Article 95, the president shall act in accordance with the advice of the prime minister,\" according to Clause 3 of Article 48 of Bangladesh Constitution. So, when making the final selection of the Election Commission, the president doesn't actually have the power to choose and can act only on the advice of the prime minister. So, whatever may be the process, the decision ultimately comes from the prime minister. How she will use it is her choice, but her constitutional power exists.\nPost-script: Indemnifying the past through laws with retrospective effect is a bad legal practice, usually used by military dictators or autocrats who give legal cover for their past misdeeds. Have the past ECs done things that need to be indemnified? Were illegalities committed that need legal cover? Please, don't go in that direction. It sets very bad precedents.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Shortage of gas supply has become a daily reality for many households and industries in Dhaka and adjacent areas, according to a report by this daily on January 20, 2022. Residents of Mohammadpur, Jatrabari, Rajabazar, Jigatola, Mirpur and many other areas have reported facing this crisis for two months now. And it has become acute in recent weeks. Industries adjacent to Dhaka are suffering production losses as a result. Earlier this month, the Titas Gas authorities informed consumers that there could be low gas pressure in Titas-affiliated areas from January 12 to January 21 due to technical reasons. However, we still don't know if there has been any progress in addressing the crisis.\nReportedly, a number of factors have led to the gas shortage in the capital. First, one of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the country is having some technical problems, for which gas supply has been reduced by 400 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), according to the Titas Gas authorities. Then, a well in the Bibiyana gas field is going through renovation work\u2014another reason for the shortage. Gas pressure also usually remains low during winter, leading to disruption in the supply chain. Therefore, while the current demand for gas in the country is more than 3,800 mmcfd, the distributors are supplying only 2,600-2,700 mmcfd.\nIn such circumstances, we urge the authorities to complete the renovation work of Bibiyana gas field as soon as possible, and fix the technical problems at the LNG terminal on a priority basis. The government's decision to keep CNG filling stations closed for four hours every day is also a step in the right direction. If needed, these filling stations can be kept closed for a few more hours.\nWe have learnt that the government has a plan to import expensive LNG to address the gas crisis. We are not against it, but will the government supply the imported gas at an affordable price to the consumers? And to avoid any future crisis, the government should explore new gas fields, but more importantly, it should start looking into better, cleaner alternatives to cooking gas\u2014like low-cost induction stoves.\n",

        "full_article": "We commend the law minister for reiterating his commitment to stop the misuse and abuse of the Digital Security Act (DSA), and for instructing deputy commissioners across Bangladesh to follow suit. At a meeting with reporters on the final day of the annual DC conference, Anisul Huq also confirmed that he had asked the home ministry to not accept DSA cases immediately after they are filed, and to not arrest journalists right away.\nThe minister has further assured that the act was formulated to combat cybercrime, not curb press freedom. While we appreciate the directives to various stakeholders to stop the abuse of the law, we want to point out\u2014as we have repeatedly done since the law's enactment in 2018\u2014that such misuse is actually built into the law. As such, the law itself must be amended if our constitutional rights of freedom of expression and freedom of the press are to be protected\u2014unless we are to believe that the law is subject to the will of the administrators or the executive branch, and that they can exempt anyone from abuse if they so want.\nIn this regard, it is encouraging that the minister is ready to hold discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and \"bring amendment to the act if necessary.\" We urge the government to also engage with the media and civil society groups in the country who have documented and long criticised the vague and overly broad definitions in the act, which have not only allowed, but also made inevitable, the misapplication of the law. A cosmetic change to the law will simply not do. The detailed criticisms of the DSA, as highlighted by the Editors' Council, need to be addressed urgently. We need a law that ensures people's privacy and security in cyberspace, not one that infringes upon them. \u00a0\nFurthermore, while we welcome the assurance from the minister that police stations have been asked not to arrest any journalist immediately after a case is filed against him or her, we urge the government to extend the same to\u00a0all\u00a0citizens of the country, as, in the eyes of the law, we are all equal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",
