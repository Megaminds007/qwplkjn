The Court had on May 10 ordered the State to proceed with the elections without OBC quotas. The Court has since then reassured itself that the State has met the \u2018triple test\u2019 criteria it had established in 2010 for OBC reservation in local bodies \u2014 a commission that undertook contemporaneous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness in the context of local bodies, break-up of the reservation local body-wise, and adherence to the 50% ceiling on quotas. Madhya Pradesh had already provided for reservation for women besides Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and its proposed quota for OBCs is 14%, to keep the aggregate within the 50% ceiling. The State has convinced the Court that it had indeed met the triple test, but the validity and accuracy of the commission report remain open to further judicial scrutiny. The Madhya Pradesh government and the Bharatiya Janata Party have welcomed the order which they publicise as their success; the Opposition Congress has said OBCs deserve 27% reservation, and blames the BJP government for its failure to impress upon the Court, on the quantum.Madhya Pradesh and Odisha are also facing judicial scrutiny of their plans for OBC reservation in local bodies, and this remains a controversial question on which the law is still evolving and public opinion is fractious. The Court has held that the criteria for reservation in job and education, which is social and educational backwardness, need not be applied for reservation in local bodies. Backwardness to be established for political reservation can be of a different nature, it had held. OBCs collectively form more than half the population of India and many communities want to be included in the category. The politics of the country is largely litigated among this segment, and suggestions and demands are raised on a regular basis. There is demand for removing the 50% ceiling on quotas, a caste-based census that the Centre is opposing but clamour for which is growing, and reservation in the private sector. While quotas have proven to be an effective instrument of empowerment and justice, competitive politics around them often leads to a paralysis of politics and governance. Making the reservation regime fair, objective, and empirical is a major governance challenge, and the Court\u2019s attempts in that direction is welcome. Political parties and governments must act in tandem with the judiciary so that reservation programmes do not turn divisive but serve a development purpose.",

But human casualties in accidents caused at such sites due to greed-induced exploitation, violation of safety and operational norms, and collusion with regulators, involve an element of culpability. The death of three workers at the privately owned Venkateshwara Stone Crusher Unit, at Adaimithippaankulam in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Tirunelveli district, bears tragic testimony to this. Here, a falling boulder trapped six workers and their heavy vehicles under debris in a 300-feet deep stone quarry on Saturday night. The management, according to the State Director of Mining and Geology, was served a closure notice last month and instructed to suspend operations, after violations. Yet, the operations went on illegally until the fateful night, which brought officials, politicians and rescuers to the site. Perhaps, a random inspection in the interregnum could have prevented the loss of lives. The preliminary inquiry suggests the crusher unit, which has facilities for the manufacture of M-Sand and blue metal, had compromised safety along the vehicle path. The breach in the mandated 10 feet distance between the upper vehicle path and the immediate lower path is believed to have caused the falling boulder to plunge deeper into the quarry, aggravating the tragedy.The Revenue Secretary has announced a comprehensive safety audit exercise in all stone quarries. Given that a political nexus, quarry operations and the grant of licences are inseparable, such crackdowns have rarely been effective. The plundering of natural resources including in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats due to excessive blasting and mining has been well documented by committees, either appointed by the government or by the courts. For instance, former IAS officer U. Sagayam, as the Madras High Court-appointed Legal Commissioner, had estimated \u20b916,000 crore loss to the exchequer due to illegal granite mining in the Madurai region alone. There has been a mushrooming of unlicensed quarries too. Just last year the High Court had ordered the closure of 64 unlicensed stone quarries in Tiruppur district, based on the findings of an advocate-commissioner. The revenue loss aside, it is impossible to fix a cost to the resultant irretrievable damage to the environment and risk exposure to humans. The big sharks have been targeted mostly when a ruling party has an axe to grind. There is now a spurt in the quarrying volume in the Tirunelveli-Kanniyakumari region to meet the huge demand from Kerala, where an estimated 80% of quarried materials is transported. It calls for the enforcement of restrictions on such inter-State transport of minerals. Immediate responses to tragedies usually have a short life. Only a genuine administrative will to sustain the enforcement of rules in quarries is of real consequence.",

        "full_article": "With the numerous laws that already exist to regulate\u2014or better still, suppress\u2014the media, and the diligence with which new ones are being prepared, one would think that of all the areas that need fixing, our government expects the journalists to be \"fixed\" first. But why? Why is there never an acceptance that independent media is the lifeblood of democracy, good governance, rule of law and accountability? Why is there no recognition of the fact that countries that advance into the rank of \"developing countries\" do so not only with higher GDP, but also with higher levels of human rights and all sorts of freedoms? Development cannot be just in economy, it must also be in society. It must be holistic to be meaningful.\nLast Saturday, in a belated observation of the World Press Freedom Day, all the apex bodies of journalists, and those representing the owners and editors, jointly expressed concerns about the state of the free press in Bangladesh, and the challenges before the industry as a whole.\nWorking journalists highlighted the issue of surveillance which has reached dangerous levels with the acquisition of latest listening and tracking devices by state agencies. Some of our district correspondents suffer a greater degree of surveillance than those in the cities\u2014more direct and crude. They are sometimes told point-blank not to see some people and are called within minutes of their meeting with an opposition politician wanting to know what transpired. Sometimes, sources are called and warned against meeting certain reporters not in the good books of officials.\nThe occasional leaks in the public domain of personal telephone conversations of people that the authorities want to embarrass, or whose reputation they want to damage, prove the wide net of telephone tapping that goes on. During Prothom Alo reporter Rozina Islam's detention by police, a telephone conversation between one of her female colleagues and the latter's father became public. It was meant to show Rozina in a bad light, proving that both Rozina and her colleague's phones were tapped. The question is, how many journalists' phones are monitored? We assume that many editors' phones are monitored, too. Is this operation authorised by anyone? If yes, then, by whom? Under what law? By what criteria are those under surveillance chosen? Or is it left to the whims of the officers concerned? What about privacy? What about the misuse of this practice? Is there any accountability? People in power now enjoy the fruits of this. When things turn around, they become its worst victims.\nHere is a brief list of laws that directly or indirectly affect journalism: i) The Penal Code 1960 (Section 499\u2014Defamation); ii) The Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (sections 99, 108, 144); iii) The Official Secrets Act 1923; iv) The Contempt of Court Act 2013; v) The Printing Press and Publication (Declaration and Registration) Act, 1973; vi) The Press Council Act, 1974; vii) The Newspaper Employees (Condition of Service) Act, 1974; viii) Information and Communication Technology Act, 2006; ix) The Digital Security Act, 2018; x) The (Draft) Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms, 2021; xi) The (Draft) Over The Top (OTT) Content-Based Service Providing and Operation Policy, 2021 (by ICT Division); and xii) The (Draft) Mass Media Employees (Services Conditions) Act 2022.\nThe defamation law is not only among the most frequently used but also one that is most abused. The law clearly states that only the person defamed can lodge a case, and that not more than one case can be lodged. In practice, literally anybody can lodge such a case claiming that, \"I have been defamed because my leader was defamed\", or some such pleas. The tragedy is that the lower courts accept it, and also in more than one instance. Thus, journalists and/or editors are seen attending court hearings in all parts of the country and seeking bail. Thankfully, instances of defamation cases have reduced. However, only the day before yesterday, Bhorer Kagoj editor and publisher was subjected to a dubious defamation case.\nMuch has been written about the Digital Security Act and its devastating impact on the free media. Its harmful effects are becoming clearer on a daily basis, forcing our journalists and editors to practice self-censorship in order to survive. After relentless complaints and many reports by the international media bodies, our foreign minister admitted that \"some excesses\" could have occurred. More to the point, our law minister said that no journalist will be directly arrested under DSA and that they will be summoned first. We welcomed the proposal, as a first step, and expected that this would be followed by a directive from the home minister to every police station to that effect. To the best of our knowledge, no move has been forthcoming.\nAt the moment, three draft laws are in the pipeline\u2014one deals with data protection, the second with OTT platforms, and the third with the service conditions of media employees.\nThe draft law for data protection has many good aspects, but the dangerous part is that law enforcement agencies have been exempted, with the result that they are free to use personal data in any way they want, flouting all the rights to privacy.\nThe draft law for OTT platforms is designed to put serious restrictions on artistic creativity and freedoms of thought and expression.\nThe draft law meant to ameliorate the service condition of media workers ends up doing the exact opposite. As for service conditions, it basically repeats what already exists, like the wage board, etc. However, much to our concern, it introduces hitherto non-existent media courts to be set up in every district. They will be added to by media appeals courts at higher levels. The function and purpose of such courts remain totally unclear. We in the media feel\u2014and here the editors, owners and working journalists' unions are all in unison\u2014that this law is a \"medicine more harmful than the ailment\", and will entangle the media into complex and intricate legal battles. There are numerous provisions for enhancing bureaucratic interference in the operation of media houses through obligatory reporting, which is totally contrary to the operation of industries in the private sector.\nThe time has come for a total change of mindset\u2014instead of always looking at the media as the \"enemy\" that needs to be controlled, or at least kept under surveillance, it should be seen as an \"ally\" in the democratic and development journey that Bangladesh is well embarked on.\nI want to conclude by quoting Manzurul Ahsan Bulbul, a senior journalist and union leader, who recently said, \"Doing journalism in Bangladesh today is like swimming in a pond full of crocodiles\". We may be able to swim around them for a while, but when any one of them will devour us, we don't know.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "On \u00a0May 20, 1921, around 3,000 tea labourers were waiting at Chandpur railway station. The last train had left at around 10:30pm. The stranded workers and their families went to sleep after having a scanty meal supplied by the local people. At the dead of the night, in the presence of the commissioner, the magistrate and the railway officials, after the lights were put out, after all the outsiders were turned out of the station yard, the infamous Gurkha troops were let loose upon these tea labourers.\nThat unprovoked and brutal attack has another parallel in the history of South Asia: The Jallianwala Bagh massacre led by Col Reginald Dyer on April 13, 1919 in India's Amritsar. Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das (CR Das), who visited Chandpur immediately after the event, pointed out in his testimony that the officials admitted they had wanted to \"create 'an impression' on the coolies very much the same way in which Dyer had created 'an impression' in Amritsar.\"\nWhat was that impression? Dyer, by his own admission, had sought to \"teach a lesson\" to the \"wicked Indians\" and create a \"wide impression\" of the costs of defying lawful authority by killing hundreds of people in cold blood. In the case of Chandpur attack, the British government, in collusion with tea estate owners, tried to teach the sanctity of capital and profits by suppressing a revolt by the tea workers, who abandoned en masse the tea estates in Chargola and Longlai valleys (in Sylhet) and marched towards their home of origin to escape serfdom (with the slogan \"Mulluk Cholo\" or \"return to homeland\").\nBut the tea workers won the day. The exodus created a political tumult for nearly three months (May 3-August 3, 1921). An economic struggle in the beginning, the sporadic strikes culminated into a mass political action, as Amalendu Guha commented in his book \"Planter Raj to Swaraj\" (1977).\nThe widespread strike of tea workers was immediately followed by the equally famous Assam Bengal Railways and Inland Steamer Navigation workers' strikes. Various groups of professionals and workers joined the strikes in protest against the brutal police firing on tea garden workers. Almost the entire East Bengal cheerfully undertook sacrifice to support the cause of tea labourers. The British government was forced to make arrangements for the tea workers to return to their home states.\nAlthough the massive strike and sacrifice of the tea workers \"laid the foundation of Swaraj,\" as termed by Chittaranjan Das, the situation in the tea plantation estates didn't change much. The British Raj ended in 1947. Unfortunately, the tea labourers' struggle didn't end. The governments of the natives weren't any less brutal or unmindful to the woes of the tea labourers. Tea workers in Bangladesh again valiantly fought against the Pakistani hoarders in 1971. Has independence brought any change to their lives?\nTea workers are one of the least paid labourers in the country. Recently, the Minimum Wage Board finalised the draft of a wage recommendation for tea workers, fixing a ridiculous figure of Tk 117-120 as daily wage. It seems the tea garden owners have hijacked the wage board. Tea workers also don't enjoy the rights of workers as stipulated in the country's labour law. For example, after working all their lives in the tea gardens they don't get gratuity at the end of their services.\nHowever, the sufferings of tea workers are not limited to the wage and labour issues. They are one of the most excluded and marginalised sections of society. The old colonial and racist system is still deeply entrenched in the estates. Tea labourers are kept isolated from the mainstream communities. They are tied to the tea gardens. They don't possess any land inside or outside the gardens. They have to live in labour lines (residential areas of the workers). Therefore, when they demand gratuity upon retirement, they are threatened with eviction from their residence. A family member replaces the retiree to continue to live in the same small plot of land, and thus the exploitation perpetuates for generations. They have little access to government services. You will hardly find the \"developmental state\" there, except when there is a law-and-order problem.\nChittaranjas Das made a pertinent point in his testimony regarding the tea workers' march and subsequent attack on those workers in Chandpur. \"I assert with all the emphasis I can command that these strikes are not labour strikes. They are not political either. They are national. They have sprung from the same spirit with which the battle of Swaraj is being fought all over the country, and is part of the general non-cooperation movement,\" he said. I think the government should learn from the insight of this great leader of undivided Bengal. The problem of tea workers is a national problem. In a modern, civilised nation, you can't continue a colonial production system and the extreme exploitation of labourers involved in the process.\nGlobally, the plantation system has undergone substantial changes. Previous plantation colonies such as the Caribbean Islands and Mauritius are now ruled by the descendants of those who were taken there as slaves and indentured labourers. The wage and living conditions of tea workers in neighbouring India are far better than those of Bangladeshi tea labourers. In India, for example, an unskilled worker gets a minimum wage of 331 rupees per day, which is more than double in comparison to a Bangladeshi skilled worker.\nAlong with the tea workers, we must raise our voice for restructuring the tea plantation system in Bangladesh. Not out of sympathy for their woes, but in solidarity with their fight for their rights. If we continue to maintain silence in the face of such injustice, we will only perpetuate the oppression of capital and its subservient state apparatus.\n\u00a0\nShamsuddoza Sajen is a journalist and researcher.\n",

        "full_article": "We've been talking to a black screen for over an hour now. Paramie Jayakody, a Colombo-based journalist, is on the other end of the call. We haven't been able to actually see each other yet, but with the wavering internet connection and frequent power outages she's been facing, having to keep her video switched off is the least of her concerns.\n\"People have switched over to only one meal a day because they just can't afford it,\" Paramie says. Not only does this reduce the amount they need to spend on the exorbitantly priced food supplies in Sri Lanka, but it also helps them avoid waking up at odd hours to prepare meals due to the inconsistent power supply. Life revolves around these power cuts, with no escape from the brutal summer heat. Even travelling beyond a radius of three kilometres proves to be taxing, as one either needs to stand in extremely long fuel queues or shell out for the increased public transport fare.\nWith the economic crisis in Sri Lanka fuelling these deplorable conditions, a widespread protest movement has emerged across the island nation. The target of these protests is the ruling party\u2014particularly President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. From our interactions with Sri Lankans, it appears that they are unwilling to forgive the president and believe any reform will take place only after all the Rajapaksas are stripped of their powers. As Sahan, a 27-year-old protester from Colombo, elaborates, \"Other countries have funded Sri Lanka, and we have internal bonds piling up to be released in emergencies, but they [the Rajpaksas] are living a luxurious lifestyle, built on this and taxpayers' money.\" Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president's brother, has already been forced to step down, but the president himself overcame a no-confidence motion put forth by the opposition.\nThe appointment of the new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been considered a victory by many Sri Lankans. However, according to Paramie, a lot of protesters are also perceiving it as a \"way to ignore the people's primary demand that the president must resign.\" The transparency shown by the new prime minister with regard to the economic crisis, the solutions he has offered, such as privatising the Sri Lankan airlines, as well as his international ties have led to him gaining mainstream public support. But his appointment is also viewed by his critics as a mutually beneficial relationship of power and protection, which further adds to the uncertainty.\nDue to this uncertainty, many protesters have not surrendered their original demands. The long-drawn-out quest to make the president resign has taken numerous forms. Perhaps the most notable one is GoGotaGama (Go Gota Village), a protest site right in the heart of Colombo. The vibrance of the village is evident through the sheer number of participants, estimated by Sahan to be at least 100,000 at any given point in time. Although most small businesses can't openly support the protests, many of them, such as local bakeries, help out in whatever way they can. Another iteration of the village, HoruGoGama (Thieves Go Village), has been set up directly in front of the parliament.\nHowever, the sheer strength of the protests does not seem to have daunted the government. On May 9, supporters of the ruling party attacked GoGotaGama, triggering a wave of violent clashes across the country. Paramie recalled the police doing nothing and simply watching as the mob entered barricaded areas and attacked women and children, forcing men to abandon tents which were then set on fire. Huge parts of the protest site were destroyed, and although the protesters managed to recover a few tents, most of the creative displays were demolished.\nBut despite the curfew that was imposed, people are rebuilding the village. The site was in complete disarray when Paramie reached it, and she realised a lot of supplies were required, so she got together with a few friends and found many people willing to donate for the cause. It took around half a day for people to just try and understand what was needed at the site, and by the time they left to procure the supplies, others were offering aid, donating resources, and putting up tents. Now, Paramie and her friends regularly visit the protest site, and activities such as poetry readings have slowly gone back to normal.\nAuthority errs when it underestimates the power of the people and tries to suppress legitimate protests. This is quite evident in Sri Lanka today. Despite the lack of adequate response from the ruling party, and the increasing contempt they seem to show towards citizens in these desperate situations, the spirit of the Sri Lankan youth still seems to be strong and unwavering.\n\u00a0\nAdnan Abbasi, Tejashree Murugan and Vaishnavi Chandrasekar\u00a0are writing fellows with the Fellowship for Freedom in India.\n",

        "full_article": "PK Halder, the former MD of a bank and a notorious embezzler, siphoned off and laundered about Tk 10,000-11,000 crore out of Bangladesh. That's equivalent to the combined yearly budget of 51 public universities of the country, which is Tk 10,515.71 crore.\nTake a moment to grasp the enormity of this reality. One man embezzled such a huge amount of money and laundered it out of Bangladesh to India, Canada and other countries. He didn't do it overnight. There was no way for him to use the banking channel. How did he manage this extraordinary feat, then?\nThe money was siphoned off to a place where no one asks about your source of wealth. Dubai is such a place where illegally transferred money can be kept in banks, legally. Many Bangladeshi businessmen and politicians have bought houses and set up businesses there. Some of them are now permanent residents. They can move in and out of Dubai to any destination as they wish. I met a couple of such people in Bangkok about three years ago. They told me they could not return to Bangladesh due to political reasons, and were running their own business in Dubai. One of them regularly visited Thailand for medical treatment. The other said that although he was settled in Dubai now, he spent most of his time in London. He, too, was in Bangkok for treatment. It's not that these two particular individuals were loan defaulters or embezzlers. But they did illegally launder money from Bangladesh. As far as I know, they also bought houses in Canada and London. However, they transferred the money from Dubai through legal channels.\nIt is quite easy to transfer money from Dubai to other countries. This process is popular among Bangladeshis who engage in loan-defaulting or embezzlement. The same can be said for India, too. However, if the amount is too big, it's impossible to keep it in an Indian bank. PK Halder managed to smuggle a large part of his illegally amassed wealth to India. Did he take the money directly to India, or did he channel it through a third country's banking system? These questions must be looked into urgently.\nIf the government is sincere about this issue, PK Halder can be easily brought back to Bangladesh from India, where he was arrested a few days ago. It's not difficult to find out how he embezzled and laundered the money. But the question is: Will the government walk that path? Are there any roadblocks ahead?\nGenerally speaking, the government should not have any problem with moving ahead with the investigation. But if one looks closely, there may be one major roadblock. PK Halder embezzled and laundered money over a long period of time, from several banks and financial institutions. It was Bangladesh Bank's responsibility to detect what he was doing, and to prevent this from happening. It is speculated that the high-ups in the Bangladesh Bank knew about it, but did nothing to stop PK Halder. They allegedly even helped him. Two such individuals are former Deputy Governor SK Sur and former Executive Director Shah Alam. Allegedly, they aided many other embezzlers along with PK Halder in exchange for a share of the bounty. They were ousted from their positions and questioned by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), but it is still unclear as to how the government plans to deal with them.\nQuestioning the government's position regarding embezzlers and launderers is nothing new. However, in 2020, a message from the foreign minister gave us hope for a change.\n\"You, the media men, often write about Begum Para in Canada\u2026 that many Bangladeshis have purchased luxurious houses there. Unofficially, we have collected information. This is not verified. An expatriate has given us some information about this issue. We were shocked. We thought that it might be politicians who purchased these houses. But we have information that most of these houses have been purchased by government officials,\" the foreign minister told The Daily Star in November 2020.\nNo information about any ongoing investigation in this regard has been revealed since then. A few days after the foreign minister's comment, the finance minister said during a parliamentary session, \"I don't know who launders money.\" He also asked the opposition to provide a list of money launderers.\nThere is clearly a disconnect between these vital ministries and between what we think should happen and the reality.\nRuling party lawmaker from Natore Shafiqul Islam Shimul bought a house in Scarborough, Canada under his wife Sultana Jannati's name, spending 1.46 million Canadian dollars. A report revealed this specific piece of information, yet no relevant government bodies ran any investigation. Two brothers from Faridpur, both Awami League leaders, were arrested for laundering at least Tk 2,000 crore.\nAnother Bangladeshi lawmaker from Lakshmipur, Mohammad Shahid Islam alias Papul, is already serving in a jail in Kuwait for human trafficking and money laundering. A Bangladeshi businessman procured a number of five-star hotels in Singapore, which the country's media reported. The ill-famed Sikder group bought properties in Thailand and a few other countries and ran business as well.\nThese are just a few examples of the vast amount of money that is laundered out of Bangladesh every year. Apart from this, traders launder at least Tk 70,000 crore every year through import-export price manipulation. The Washington-based think tank Global Financial Integrity (GFI) has reported on this phenomenon several times. The government is yet to take their findings under consideration.\nPK Halder's arrest in India has brought the issue of money laundering to the fore once again. Another new topic may emerge in a few days, burying this issue again.\nDoes that mean our fate is sealed, and our money will continue to be embezzled and laundered?\n(The article was translated from Bangla by Mohammed Ishtiaque Khan.)\n\n\u00a0\nGolam Mortoza\u00a0is the editor of The Daily Star Bangla.\n",

        "full_article": "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has rightly called for a global coalition to speed up the deployment of battery technology, and urged countries to ease intellectual property restrictions to hasten the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. His call comes in light of a report released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which found that four key climate change indicators\u2014greenhouse gas concentrations, sea-level rise, ocean heat and acidification\u2014set new records in 2021. These are some extremely alarming findings. And we concur with the UN secretary-general that the report illustrates \"a dismal litany of humanity's failure to tackle climate disruption.\"\nAccording to the WMO, the last seven years were the warmest on record. Given the current trend, it is only a matter of time before even that record gets shattered. This has prompted the UN secretary-general to outline a five-point plan for the world to get back on track for a renewable energy revolution. Among them is a proposal for investment in the renewable energy sector to be tripled to USD 4 trillion per year, and for renewable energy to be treated as a \"global public good,\" rather than intellectual property to be monetised.\nDespite considerable amounts of resources being poured into the shift to renewable energy, solar and wind still account for just eight percent of global electricity generation, while other types of renewables, such as hydropower, bring the total up to 30 percent. In order to increase their share, Guterres called on countries, manufacturers, technology firms and financiers to join forces to fast-track the deployment of batteries, removing red tapes and intellectual property constraints. Since the issue of climate change concerns everyone, there is no reason why advanced countries and companies shouldn't look to involve all stakeholders. In fact, they should be looking forward to sharing these technologies with others so that newer breakthroughs can be made, and the world can adopt them on a larger scale before temperatures rise beyond our control.\nWhile most governments\u2014particularly in developed countries that are most responsible for global carbon emissions\u2014have not lived up to their own promises as per various international agreements, the ongoing effects of climate change continue to show why this issue is among the most important when it comes to the long-term survival of human civilisation. Therefore, the latest warning from the UN chief should not only be taken seriously by governments around the world, but also by the private sector, whose involvement in this project might be just as vital.\n",

        "full_article": "We're deeply worried about the deteriorating flood situation in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh as water from the upstream and heavy rainfall sent floodwaters surging into many villages and towns. Two districts, Sylhet and Sunamganj, have been particularly affected, with the Surma and Kushiyara rivers flowing above danger level for over a week. Reports from the region paint a grim picture: a vast number of roads, houses and croplands inundated, people either trapped in water or taking shelter in the flood centres, poor access to food and other basic necessities, schools closed or converted into shelters, and no electricity in many flood-hit areas. The suffering that all this has caused is hard to describe.\nIt's an emergency made worse by both natural and manmade causes. Ponds, canals and haors, which once dotted these areas and traditionally served as reservoirs holding the excess water from floods, have all but vanished in recent decades, thanks to mindless development, urbanisation and flawed government policies. Many of the rivers have also been encroached, and consequently dry up during the summer and overflow after above-average rainfall. During a visit on Wednesday, the foreign minister, a lawmaker from the Sylhet-1 constituency, spoke of plans to dredge the rivers to restore their navigability. This is not reassuring, given the experience of previous dredging initiatives that rarely delivered results.\nWhile we hope the authorities will put their heads together to better tackle floods, which are growing in frequency and intensity because of climate change, the immediate challenge is to deliver relief and medicine and restore normal life in the flood-hit areas. We're told that in Sylhet, where about 13 upazilas including the Sadar city were hit, about 150,000 people are living in the dark after several power stations were inundated. About 675 educational institutions were reportedly closed. Meanwhile, although traders have earlier said that there were adequate supplies of food and other essentials in the market, many shops and warehouses remain under water and the supply line disrupted, which may create a food crisis soon. The situation in the remote villages is reported to be particularly dire.\nWe, therefore, urge the government to take urgent measures to tackle the aftermath of the flood. Expecting that the water will soon recede automatically, as the foreign minister has said, is not enough. What we need is concrete action, starting with ensuring that help reaches the most affected immediately. Relief and medical teams should be sent out to all flood-hit locations and shelters with adequate supplies, and power should be restored as soon as possible. The government should also address the bigger issues affecting the flood situation in the long run.\n",
