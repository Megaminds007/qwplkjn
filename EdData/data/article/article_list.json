With the Union government repeatedly postponing the decennial Census \u2014 it has not been conducted for the first time in a decade since 1881 \u2014 there is no direct evidence to support this statement. It is evident that India is now the most populous country, but the Sample Registration System statistical report in 2020 and the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) have shown that the total fertility rate (TFR) in India has fallen to 2 overall, with only a few States \u2014 Bihar (2.98), Meghalaya (2.91), Uttar Pradesh (2.35), Jharkhand (2.26) and Manipur (2.17) \u2014 having a TFR above 2.1. Clearly, the high population growth of the kind seen in the 20th century has been largely arrested \u2014 the TFR fell from 5.7 in 1950 to 2 in 2020, albeit differentially across regions. The population share of the southern States, reduced to 21% in 2011 from 26% in 1951, largely a consequence of a rapid reduction in TFR due to better socio-economic outcomes and education, and despite higher migration to these States. While the surveys mentioned are robust and necessary, they are no substitute for the comprehensive Census; the continued delay in its implementation reflects poorly on the Union Home Ministry that is motivated by other priorities rather than executing a vital programme of Indian governance.The demographic shift in India and rising life expectancy have resulted in challenges and opportunities. The much touted demographic dividend \u2014 the relatively high proportion of the working age population in the developing world \u2014 is meaningful only if there are sufficient jobs and if they enjoy some degree of social security that will help them when they age. With high unemployment and the creation of non-farm jobs, which will increase productivity and cater to skilled employment, relatively slack in the last few years, there is the possibility of the country squandering this dividend. The \u201chigh-powered\u201d committee will be performing a crucial role if it engages meaningfully in addressing questions related to jobs and social security and the challenges citizens face due to rapid urbanisation and mechanisation of work. However, if the committee focuses on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s pet bogies of looking at population issues through the lens of religion and immigration, it will only distract governance from making use of the fast eroding democratic dividend in the country.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\ndemography\n\n/\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\nMeghalaya\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nJharkhand\n\n/\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\npopulation and census\n\n/\n\nsocial security\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nreligion and belief\n\n/\n\nmigration\n\n/\n\neducation",

        "full_article": "British Foreign Secretary David Cameron\u2019s remarks that the United Kingdom is considering recognising the Palestine state signals a change in the thinking of at least a section of the British government towards the Palestine question after the Israel-Hamas war of October 7. The comment triggered criticism within Conservative Party circles, with Downing Street stating later that the British government\u2019s policy towards the issue had not changed. Yet, the debate, which included reports in the American media that the State Department is reviewing options for possible recognition of the Palestine state, suggests that the Palestine question is back at the centre of the political parleys of the major powers. Before October 7, Israel, its Arab partners and western allies thought they could ignore the Palestine question and go ahead building a new West Asia. Hamas attacks and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza show that finding a solution to the Palestine question is an imperative for peace and stability in a strife-stricken West Asia. And, one of the globally recognised and practical pathways to peace is a two-state solution \u2014 a viable, independent, sovereign Palestine state created with international recognition.Britain has a historical responsibility to push for a solution. The British government was the first major power that recognised the Zionists\u2019 claim to the land of Ottoman Palestine. In 1917, during the First World War, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, supporting the creation of \u201ca homeland\u201d for the Jewish people \u201cin Palestine\u201d. The declaration gave a major boost to the Zionist movement, promoting Jewish migration from Europe and the building of settlement communities in historical Palestine (Ottoman and British), culminating in the creation of Israel in 1948. At least from the Oslo process of the early 1990s, there were multiple diplomatic attempts in finding a mutually acceptable two-state solution, but which were futile as Palestine remained under occupation. Today, there are roughly 7,00,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem; and Gaza is being destroyed by Israel. Israeli leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, have repeatedly rejected the two-state solution, while the far-right settlers are pushing for the control of the whole of Palestinian territories. This is an unsustainable scenario, producing cycles of violence and instability. The two-state proposal is already on its deathbed, given the mushrooming of settlements, growing violence, and the rise of far-right extremists in Israel and Islamist militants in Palestinian territories. If the British government realises its historical responsibility, does a reality check of its current policy and becomes ready to offer a political horizon to the Palestinians, it would be a welcome step.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nPalestine\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\nhistory\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war",

        "full_article": "Politically savvy and fiscally prudent, budget bets on India Inc investing more. Will that happen?\nBudgets are embedded in a political context. The salient political message in Modi\u2019s government\u2019s last budget before the Lok Sabha election is unmistakable. They are confident.\n\nConfidence in vote |\u00a0FM stuck to convention while presenting her sixth budget. It was a vote-on-account, which is what an interim budget is meant to be. In a similar situation in 2019, the interim budget not only introduced an income support scheme for farmers, income tax benefits were also announced. The 2024 vote-on-account avoided change, signalling Modi is confident of returning to power.\n\nBut surprise in store |\u00a0Tucked in the budget speech was the announcement that a high-powered committee would be set up to conduct a detailed study on the challenges arising from demographic changes. The uneven pace of a fall in fertility rates across states is a potential stress point on the federal architecture. Whether this is the only objective or there are other considerations in play will be clearer once the committee is set up.\n\n\nFiscal pullback |\u00a0Modi\u2019s second term saw deficits and debt surge after the pandemic\u2019s outbreak. In its last year, Modi government began to pull back from the high levels of debt and deficit. In revised estimate (RE) of 2023-24, led by both a scaledown in expenditure and tax revenue that beat expectations, fiscal deficit was brought down. It was 5.8% of GDP, 0.10 percentage point lower than the budget estimate (BE) last year.\n\nCapex questions |\u00a0A highlight of budgets since 2020-21 was a huge ramp up in public investment. Effective capital expenditure increased from \u20b96.4 lakh crore that year to \u20b912.7 lakh crore in 2023-24. Revised estimates raise the question if there\u2019s sufficient capacity to absorb capital expenditure at this pace. The fiscal pullback in 2023-24 was helped by reduction in capital expenditure. It was \u20b912.7 lakh crore in RE 2023-24, lower by almost \u20b91 lakh crore than BE.\n\nTax buoyancy |\u00a0Tax revenue trend over the last three years has been positive. Gross tax revenue as a proportion of GDP in RE 2023-24 was 11.6%, almost at the level it reached in 2007-08. Importantly, the level has been stable over three years and has been driven mainly by income tax collections. Among taxes, income tax has emerged as the single largest source of tax, which signifies the tax system has become fairer.\n\nDisputes remain unresolved |\u00a0The missing reform in tax system is a measure to cap rising amounts under dispute. In 2022-23 it was \u20b912.21 lakh crore, almost 40% of gross tax revenues. This budget proposed to withdraw tax demand on small sums. There needs to be a solution for larger amounts.\n\nPointers for the future |\u00a0Modi government\u2019s fiscal plan is to bank on tax buoyancy, slash subsidies but keep up capital spending in order to lower gross borrowing in BE 2024-25 by 8% to \u20b914.1 lakh crore. This is a necessary condition to encourage private sector investment. The big question is \u2013 will private sector respond? Interim budget has done all it could to roll out the red carpet. The ball is in India Inc\u2019s court.\n\n",

        "full_article": "There\u2019s optimism about Indian economy. Growth remains resilient, with comfort on core inflation as it slips below 4%. External account remains manageable with likely CAD at 1.3% of GDP and Rupee putting up an orderly performance. This comes against global risks of war and elevated, though correcting, inflation. Interim budget delivered on balancing fiscal austerity with growth. Six takes.\n\nGoodbye Keynes |\u00a0Pandemic years saw a global return of Keynesian flexibility in fiscal policy. It\u2019s wise now to undo this flexibility gradually. Towards this, GOI pegged FY25 fiscal deficit to GDP ratio at 5.1%, and overdelivered on its FY24 target of 5.9% by 10 bps. Marking a consolidation of 410 bps from fiscal deficit peak of 9.2% in FY21, target for FY25 also allows a near-linear downwards move towards a 4.5% fiscal deficit aim for FY26 well within reach.\n\nSound math |\u00a070 bps of fiscal consolidation envisaged between FY24 and FY25 has been laid out on realistic revenue assumptions (revenue receipts to grow by 11.2% FY25), subdued increase in revenue expenditure (3.2% Y-o-Y) accompanied by modest increase in capex (16.9% Y-o-Y) compared to recent past (30% avg growth over past 4 years). Two potential deviants could be:\n\u25cf FY25 disinvestment proceeds pegged at \u20b9500 bn, given FY24\u2019s poor track record, and a shorter timeline of 9 months after Lok Sabha election.\n\u25cf Downside in subsidy burden that may be at risk if global fertiliser prices remain high.\nNotwithstanding risks, fiscal math appears reasonable, along with 10.5% assumption of nominal GDP growth in FY25.\n\n\nMore pvt play |\u00a0While pace of capex is set to moderate, GOI\u2019s capex thrust remains intact with capex to GDP ratio expected to rise from 3.2% in FY24 to 3.4% in FY25. While meaningful fiscal compression did warrant government to take its foot off capex accelerator partially in FY25, it was also somewhat more necessary to not \u2018crowd-out\u2019 resources for private sector \u2013 a point FM alluded to in her speech.\nHealthy corporate sector balance sheets, comfort on input costs and a sizeable upturn in capacity utilisation should allow for meaningful turnaround in private sector capex in FY25, once poll-related uncertainty subsides. This, with household investment in capex remaining healthy \u2013 nearly 40% of total capex \u2013 should allow for a broad-based upturn in capex cycle.\n\nSame\u2019s the game |\u00a0Budget was devoid of new schemes that could be inflationary. Successful policy outcomes of last decade were reinforced with promise of continuity via rural housing, extension of tax benefits to start-ups, and \u20b9750 bn to states as long-term interest-free loans.\n\n\nHello world |\u00a0GOI seeks to lower gross borrowing to \u20b914.13 tn in FY25, from \u20b915.43 tn in FY24. Comfort on supply, juxtaposed against potential increase in demand from global investors given India\u2019s impending inclusion in Emerging Markets (EM) Bond Indices, is right mix to free resources for private sector. Global investor concerns were put to rest by GOI\u2019s fiscal rectitude.\n\nDon\u2019t bet on debt |\u00a0India doesn\u2019t face a \u2018fiscal problem\u2019, but may seem to have a \u2018debt problem\u2019. While GOI\u2019s been fiscally conservative in last 3 years, total general government debt continues to remain northwards of 80% of GDP. This indeed is higher when compared to average debt level of about 55-60% for other similar-rated EM peers. One could argue India\u2019s debt level poses low risk, given it is domestically financed and of longer tenure.\nIn FY25, one can expect total debt ratio to nudge lower, given expectations of smaller primary deficit (BE of 1.5% of GDP in FY25 vs 2.3% in FY24) and resilience in GDP growth. In the medium term, strategic investments, inclusive growth and commitment to reforms must accompany fiscal prudence to reduce debt. Interim budget delivered on being minimalist, keeping fiscal machinery rolling until full budget. It did however more than ace fiscal KRAs.\n\n",

        "full_article": "By Ram Krishna Sinha\nTwenty-first century is the age of knowledge economy that relies on intellectual capital. Its main features are education and skills, information and technology infrastructure, research, and innovation system. This economic model produces intangibles like patents, copyrights, proprietary software and knowledge processing, all pointing to the importance of their source \u2013 education and knowledge. In this realm, the power of new ideas and innovation is greater than money.\nIn knowledge economy, Saraswati, goddess of knowledge, creativity, learning and wisdom, rules. Saraswati helps us generate Lakshmi, wealth and prosperity. Modern knowledge of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, internet of things is transformative, creating enormous value and boosting economic growth. Such knowledge-based activities increase our living standards by augmenting the quantity and quality of output and supplying innovative products and services. Though money is needed to fund some capital-intensive industries, and research and development, it is subservient to ideas, creativity and innovation, which primarily drive business and research.\n\nYet, to sustain this knowledge economy, and make it a model for serving the larger social good and humanity, we need not only knowledge but wisdom as well. Even the standard and purpose of knowledge should elevate, so that it does not become simply an information-gathering exercise or a job-seeking pursuit.\nIn an age swamped by information from multiple sources, our ability to distinguish between noise and signal, real and false, right and wrong, is a critical life-skill, particularly for youth. Here again, guidance and blessings of Saraswati to develop critical thinking and wisdom are of paramount value.\nGoddess Saraswati uses a swan as her vahana, vehicle. It is said that the sacred swan has a sensitive beak that enables it to distinguish milk from a mixture of milk and water. Swan, thus, symbolises the power to discriminate between good and bad, valuable and useless. Further, a swan can also stay and swim in water without getting drenched by it. The use of swan as her vehicle demonstrates the critical need for a strong power of judgment, and that we must apply knowledge with discrimination for the good of self and society, and to swim across the waters of life, detached, to realise the ultimate truth. This is how we can develop critical thinking and wisdom and be deserving of Goddess Saraswati\u2019s blessings. And as they say, where Saraswati resides, Goddess Lakshmi soon arrives.\n\n",

        "full_article": "When plagued by indiscipline, mismanagement, unethical practices including outright plundering of deposit money from banks the banking sector has suffered erosion of public trust in it, its regulator, the Bangladesh Bank (BB), seems to have put its foot down to rescue it from the quagmire. Notably, in order to identify and take early measures aimed at preventing the troubled banks from deteriorating further so far as their financial and operational conditions are concerned, the BB, in line with the Bank Company (amendment) Act, 2023, came up with the so-called Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework in early December last year (2023). Set to come into effect by the end of March next year (2025), the corrective actions for problem-ridden banks, as prescribed in the PCA framework of the BB, would be based on a set of selected parameters/indicators. But what happens when the ailing banks fail to improve their financial health despite adoption of the recovery measures under PCA framework? Merger would be the recipe for underperforming banks. The BB governor during a meeting with the managing directors of different banks on Wednesday expressed his strong commitment to carrying out reforms in the banking sector. Noting that more than one third of the banks are performing poorly, he gave a strong hint that those could be the candidates for merger with other banks.  Merger of banks takes place when the assets, liabilities and operations of two or more banks are consolidated to form a single entity. It can lead to the creation of a new, larger bank or acquisition of an underperforming bank by an existing stronger one. In the exercise of the amended Bank Company Act 2023, the central bank has empowered itself to effect forced merger of a bank if its management or board of directors are found to have been involved in activities that go against the depositors' interest. This is in addition to the remedial measures the banking regulator can take against poorly performing banks including imposition of restriction on receiving fresh deposits from clients, provision of loans and opening of new bank branches. On this score, the executive director of the central bank, as reported, further informed that the banking regulator had provided a new time frame for underperforming banks to address their financial lacunae. With a renewed emphasis on the banking sector reform, the central bank, as a further positive move, likes to direct its attention to reducing the nonperforming loans in the banking sector. Now that the relevant regulator has acquired the ability and the required tools as well as demonstrated the willingness to firmly deal with the troubled banking sector, let the problems of underperforming banks be addressed as appropriately as they deserve. The sooner order and discipline can be restored in the banking sector the better for the country's overall finance. Equipped with an instrument in the form of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) to tag banks with various categories according to their financial health and state of governance is no doubt a positive move. But the point is to act before it is too late.",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh Bank (BB), the country's central bank, has issued new directives to private banks on a host of issues. The instruction essentially calls on banks to stop 'overrated' lending, i.e. \"commercial banks to heed the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework or face the risk of tough actions, as interbank borrowing overshoots interest corridors.\" It would appear that many financial institutions are ignoring BB directives, and that this has been going on for some time now.What the latest regulations state is that either banks follow interest corridors set by the regulator or they run the risk of punitive actions. Actions that may extend to the suspension of opening branches, fresh lending, taking deposits, giving cash or stock dividends. In essence, these measures would mean a death sentence for an errant bank even if a few of those conditions are enforced. This ruling comes as part of the financial sector reform programme that economists have been harping on for years. Things have reached a boiling point. The issue of course will depend on whether or not the central bank will be allowed to enforce this ruling. With powerful interests governing private sector banks, many of whom are people's representatives, the question will always linger as to whether this initiative will fall flat somewhere down the line. But what choice does the finance ministry have? There is a serious liquidity crisis prevailing in the banking sector. Questions have been raised as to why there are so many banks in operation in the first place. Why indeed banking rules have not been amended to reverse the disastrous decision taken a decade ago that allowed banks to become family businesses. Of course, it would be too much to expect that things would change overnight. There is new management in the ministry of finance and the team over there must given some time to prove that it means business. According to a report published in this newspaper, \"Bangladesh Bank (BB) governor Abdur Rouf Talukder issued the binding instructions to top executives of the country's scheduled banks at Wednesday's bankers' meet held at the BB headquarters.\" A lot of good advice has been given, especially one pertaining to bankers' heeding the regulatory body's advice to banks to keep interbank borrowing with the SLF (standing lending facility) rate of 9.50 per cent and keeping to the upper ceiling of the interest rate corridor (IRC). Reportedly, the BB will start implementing the new framework from March 31, 2025 so there is enough time for the financial sector to get its act together. It is interesting to note that the BB has pointed out that banks may face drastic actions like \"mergers and acquisitions\" in case of failure to comply. Extremely strong words coming out of the central bank and surprising too!With regards to NPLs the regulator has opined that banks should make proper use of ADR (alternative dispute resolution) using competent legal experts. This hardly comes as a surprise. The court assigned for financial scams is hugely overburdened with cases and lacks requisite legal manpower to handle the grave situation. One would have thought that given the plight of the financial sector, the government would have done something at this end, but that hasn't happened. Since that hasn't happened, many will question whether this latest initiative is serious or not. Time will tell if ADR will make more headway where legal proceedings have not. Whatever may be the decision of the BB or the finance ministry, recovering NPL has to be the priority issue here. It is inconceivable to everyone that embezzlers are allowed to get away scot-free and the financial sector remains crippled.It is January, 2024 and the framework comes into effect end of March, 2025. Ample time has been provided to banks to get their act together. NPL recovery is a must, it is non-negotiable. Billions have been siphoned off over the last decade or so and if policymakers want some semblance of normalcy to return to the sector, then this is where reforms must start. It is ironic that a bank defaulter has been screaming loud about bigger bank defaulters. Perhaps the gentleman's business operations are being hurt because he cannot open as many letters of credit (LC) as he used to keep his operations going. That is a prime example of how bad things have gotten in this country. The small fish are crying for bigger fish's blood. The smaller fry is just as guilty as the bigger fry. Unfortunately, when it comes to banks, they go after the smaller fry because it is easy to squeeze the living day lights out of small-time defaulters; whereas it takes a lot of guts to go after the high and mighty.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Learning more than one language in addition to the mother tongue is not a luxury at all. It is always a necessary skill that helps expand the horizon of knowledge. English is the second but essential language to learn besides Bangla in the country. Then there are languages like Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish that many, especially youths, are used to learning mainly for academic and career purposes. A few also try to learn for pleasure. Thanks to virtual tools and online tutors, learning these or other languages becomes easier. There are some language learning and training institutions in the country where people can learn their preferred languages methodically. It is interesting to note that a growing number of elementary-level school children are now learning a third language, mostly using online language applications. Middle and high school students watch television dramas and movies in various languages that help them develop some linguistic skills. Korean dramas and films have gained vast popularity in the country over the past few years. Exposure to popular Hindi movies and television channels in Bangladesh also provides an opportunity to learn the language. So, it is not surprising that many in the country have developed essential communication skills in the language. They can easily understand and talk in Hindi, although reading and writing are an altogether different proposition. The skill helps many people in their business and trade when they need to communicate with Indians and even Pakistanis, as Urdu is a sister language of Hindi. The former uses Arabic-Persian script, while the latter uses Devnagri. In some madrasas in Bangladesh, students learn Urdu besides Arabic. Some families also have a long tradition of communicating in Urdu among themselves. A select band of higher educational institutions like the University of Dhaka have Arabic, Urdu and Persian departments offering higher studies in these languages and literatures. Learning Arabic for religious purposes is common in Bangladesh. Madrasas and some schools teach students Arabic. So, many have also developed skills in regular communication, reading and writing in Arabic. A large number of non-resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) living and working in Middle Eastern Arab countries also have a good command of Arabic. They have attained the skill by learning and practising it on the job, mostly without institutional training. It is important to encourage the learning of a third language for various reasons. A large number of people go overseas for their livelihoods. Most of them do not get a chance for basic training in the language of the country or region they land. So, they struggle more to be familiar with a new language, culture and society. Having some primary command of the language makes it helpful to get accustomed to the challenging environment. A strong command of the third language also contributes to expanding trade in various regions. The local language helps explore market potential by communicating better with the local people. Again, a third language also opens an opportunity to guide foreign travellers and tourists from non-English-speaking countries. For instance, many people from China frequently travel to Bangladesh, mostly for business. Having some essential skills in Mandarin allows one to easily communicate with them. It is said that knowing a language means knowing a culture, society and people. In the globalised world, there is no scope to be confined within a limited communication boundary. By developing multilingual skills, one can know what others are doing and how they are advancing. The state needs to patronise development of multilingual skills in a planned manner.[email\u00a0protected]",

Many researchers think that the capital is now becoming uninhabitable as human health is susceptible to various diseases due to environmental factors.According to the air quality index (AQI) monitored by the organisation IQ Air last year, Dhaka ranked as the most polluted capital city, with AQI scores exceeding 300 multiple times. The AQI scores for the first and second days of this year were 244 and 256, respectively. An AQI score between 201 and 300 indicates very unhealthy air quality, with higher scores reflecting more severe pollution levels. \"Very unhealthy\" signifies that the air quality poses significant health risks, potentially leading to serious health issues with prolonged exposure.While specific data on deaths due to air pollution in our country is lacking, researchers, doctors and observers think that the nation's severe air pollution is a leading cause of numerous diseases and fatalities. Public awareness campaigns are crucial to combat these health issues arising out of air pollution. Measures such as reducing fossil fuel consumption, curbing black smoke emissions, promoting afforestation to counter deforestation, preventing littering and tobacco use and minimising dust generation during construction activities are essential steps to improve air quality and public health.Various laws and regulations are being discussed by the government to mitigate and prevent air pollution, but both governmental and private initiatives are crucial in addressing this issue. Ignorance of the people and irregularities of different kinds are a major problem. Urgent action is needed to tackle this pressing issue, otherwise air pollution would become a leading cause of death. It is not solely the responsibility of the government or environmental organizations, citizens must also be proactive in safeguarding the environment.Nahida NishiA conscious citizen, Dhaka",
