According to the Centre, an estimated four million hectares of forest land had been diverted from 1951-75. Under the provisions of the Act, forests could no longer be diverted without adhering to a regulatory mechanism by the Centre. As a measure of its success, the Centre calculates that from 1981-2022, the average annual diversion of forest had reduced to about 22,000 hectares, or about a tenth of what it was from 1951-75. However, the provisions of this piece of legislation largely applied to forest tracts recognised as such by the India Forest Act, or any other State legislation. Illegal timber-felling in Gudalur, Tamil Nadu, triggered the landmark T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad judgment that saw the Court take an expanded view of forest tracts worthy of protection. It also said that forests had to be protected irrespective of how they were classified and who owned them. This brought in the concept of \u2018deemed forests,\u2019 or tracts that were not officially classified as such in government or revenue records. States were asked to constitute expert committees to identify such \u2018deemed forests.\u2019 In the 28 years that have passed since the judgment, only a handful of States have constituted such committees or made public the extent of such \u2018deemed forests\u2019 within their territories.The Centre\u2019s attempt to amend the Forest (Conservation) Act was ostensibly to bring \u201cclarity\u201d as there were large tracts of recorded forest land that had already been put to non-forestry uses, with the permission of State governments. There is apparently, the Centre says, a reluctance among private citizens to cultivate private plantations and orchards, despite their significant ecological benefits, for fear that they would be classified as \u2018forest\u2019 (and thus render their ownership void). India\u2019s ambitions to create a carbon sink of 2.5 billion-3 billion tonnes, to meet its net zero goals have required forest laws to be \u201cdynamic\u201d and, therefore, the rules have sought to remove \u2018deemed forest,\u2019 not already recorded as such, from the ambit of protection. This has triggered a slew of public interest petitions as, on the face of it, the amendments appear as an assault on the Act\u2019s ambition of forest protection. While a final judgment is pending, the Court\u2019s order to the Centre to compile and make public, by April, States\u2019 efforts at recording the extent of deemed forests is welcome. At this point it is mere conjecture on the part of the Centre that India\u2019s carbon sink is being impeded due to insufficient private initiative. Only a dispassionate assessment of ground realities can drive forward this very important debate. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nhabitat (conservation)\n\n/\n\nconservation\n\n/\n\nforests\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nhistory\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu",

        "full_article": "Health is seldom uni-dimensional, and it must not be seen as such. Government policy, particularly, must fathom the entirety of the issue, and assimilate multiple aspects in a field strategy, for optimum realisation of the intended goal. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s announcement during the presentation of the interim Budget that the government plans to encourage vaccination against cervical cancer for girls aged nine to 14, is no doubt a step in the right direction. While the scheme will be fleshed out post elections, it is also time to question if any programme to handle cervical cancer would be wholesome if it did not assimilate a screening aspect. Cancer of the cervix (literally, the neck of the womb) is unique among cancers because almost all the cases (99%, according to the World Health Organization) are linked to infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus transmitted through sexual contact. While most HPV infections resolve spontaneously and the women remain symptom-free, persistent infection can lead to cervical cancer. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in India (over 77,000 annually), and is estimated to be the second most frequent cancer among Indian women between 15 and 44 years. While the good news is couched in the availability of a vaccine, the sobering fact is that the average national prevalence of cervical cancer screening hovers at just under 2% and outcomes depend on the stage of detection.Ironically, cervical cancer can be easily diagnosed in a public health setting with minimal tools \u2014 the human eye, a dilution of white vinegar, and a dab of Lugol\u2019s iodine. These are known as VIA and VILI tests and help look for precancerous lesions and cancer, much before an advanced stage of the disease can be picked up with cytology. A simple, short procedure, cryotherapy, can then be done while the patient is awake, to destroy the abnormal growth. Given that it is easy to prevent, identify and treat cervical cancer, it is unacceptable that so many women are dying of the disease. As the government rolls out its vaccination programme, it must also mandate screening right at the primary health centre, and if abnormalities are identified, offer cryotherapy right then. It is unlikely that vaccination of young girls alone will have a far-reaching impact in the short and medium term. The only way to prevent deaths is to deploy the entire assembly of tools as part of a national cervical cancer control programme, accessible to all women, irrespective of age, education, affordability or social status.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncancer\n\n/\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\nvaccines\n\n/\n\nhealth",

They don\u2019t, as an IIM-Ahmedabad survey on online shopping habits shows.\nLand of dandies\u00a0| Fashion tops the list of stuff women \u2013 and men\u2013 buy online. And it\u2019s men who spend more, in per capita terms, on online shopping. Outspending women by 36%, men also manage to finish their buying in less time than women.\nWhat we don\u2019t know\u00a0| The large gap in per capita spend between women and men should trigger questions. A separate survey carried out by DBS and Crisil on financial independence of women showed that it\u2019s practically non-existent for middle-class women. Does IIM-Ahmedabad\u2019s survey indicate that even technology, which helps people overcome so many other obstacles, can\u2019t quite escape social constraints?\n\nGood times, not for all\u00a0| Recent consumption patterns also point to other constraints. An analysis by TOI of consumer companies\u2019 performance in the Oct-Dec quarter of 2023 was revealing. Rarely have premium products seen such strong demand. Quick service restaurants report brisk sales of gourmet pizzas. However, sales growth of the regular variant hasn\u2019t kept up. Mass market products continue to report lacklustre sales.\nUneven recovery\u00a0| The analysis shows that last couple of years have seen a two track pace of bounce back from Covid. For households with an income between \u20b93-5 lakh a year, discretionary spending has been squeezed by factors such as inflation. For households with an annual income of \u20b910 lakh and more, the pandemic is a distant memory. SUVs and travel are all the rage, leading to happier times for businesses and advertisers.\nMany messages\u00a0| India\u2019s economy runs on consumption. It makes up about 60% of GDP. Consumption patterns provide insights to social changes. Surveys and data from consumer goods firms are corroborated by macro data. Lower-income households haven\u2019t yet joined the party of an economy set to top 7% annual growth for the third straight year.\nIn the Oct-Dec 2023 quarter, the proportion of self-employed in urban jobs increased by a percentage point to 40.6%. Among women, the share employed as unpaid help rose four straight quarters. No surprise then that mass market stuff\u2019s slow moving. For growth to sustain, that\u2019s the market that needs to grow again.\n\n",

Because their state polls are held simultaneously with Lok Sabha\u2019s.\nFriends with Centre\u00a0| It\u2019s exactly this cover of LS elections that\u2019s given Naveen Patnaik an advantage since he assumed office in 2004. Patnaik benefits from stable ties with GOI, whether UPA or NDA. True, BJP or Congress can\u2019t devote full time or resources to a single state during LS campaign. But that doesn\u2019t take away from Patnaik\u2019s achievement. His record of winning a majority of Odisha\u2019s LS seats wasn\u2019t broken even by Modi\u2019s popularity. Modi is no rival to Patnaik. They have good ties. But in Odisha BJP has made inroads into BJD\u2019s votes. So, Patnaik leaves no place for complacency, as was evident in Padampur byelection, where he personally campaigned after BJD lost an earlier bypoll to BJP.\n\nWannabe friends\u00a0| In neighbouring Andhra, heads of both governing and opposition parties want to tie up with BJP. The situation is not peculiar. TDP\u2019s Naidu scraped back to power in 2014 only with BJP\u2019s help. Jagan-led YSRCP\u2019s win in 2019 was a result of a hard-fought and successful campaign. But Naidu\u2019s walking out of NDA ahead of polls had played a role too. Jagan this time must fight both Congress, headed by his sister, and old foe Naidu. Seeking BJP\u2019s backing is insurance. In both Odisha and Andhra, incumbent govts want quid pro quo arrangements with Delhi \u2013 simultaneous LS, assembly polls are a reason. This time, the other reason is that Modi is considered the favourite. So, good vibes with him make sense for CMs seeking return to office.\n\n",

The tragic event that took place on the 21st of February 72 years ago marked a nodal point of the protracted struggle that people of this part of the world had been waging against all forms of subjugation, exploitation and injustice they were subjected to since long. It did not also start just after the creation of Pakistan, whose ruling class tried to foist Urdu as the only state language upon its entire population, though Bangla was the language of the majority. Notably, present-day Bangladesh, then called East Pakistan, was the eastern wing of Pakistan. It would be worthwhile to note here that Urdu was also not the native language of the populations of any of the western provinces of then-Pakistan. In truth, it was a lingua franca that the ruling elite of that part of Pakistan spoke and used for administrative purpose. Even so, it was only the Bangalee people who raised the voice of protest against the Pakistani ruling elite's ill-conceived idea of making Urdu the sole state language. Though the issue of that time centred around the right of recognition of the language that the people of this part of the world spoke as an official language, in the final analysis, it was not the be-all and end-all of the bloody protests that erupted in the streets of Dhaka. In essence, it was an expression of the people's disillusionment with what they inherited as a state following the departure of the British colonial power from the Indian subcontinent, which the local ruling elites would like to call independence. So, the emotion-packed chronicle of the events of that day (the 21st February) is not the whole story of the Shaheed Diibash (the day of martyrdom). But the Bangalee urban middle class has conveniently crafted the history of the language movement to suit their own aspirations of becoming part of the new ruling elite of the post-independence Bangladesh. Hence is the slogan of nationalism, a form of identity politics, being propagated as the sole spirit of the people's struggle against then-Pakistani ruling elite. It is time the call of the day (21st February) is taken out of its narrow trappings of pure nationalism. In fact, the common people have little or no stake in slogans that do not promise them relief from their penury and the endless struggle for survival. Small wonder that practically no participation of the working masses is observed in the various Ekushey February programmes that are held on the day every year. That is why, it is important that the Ekushey is made into a day of the entire nation by recognising the ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversities of the population that makes Bangladesh. At the same time, the primary message of the day, that is, making Bangla the official language of the state, should not be limited to paying only lip service to the cause. On the contrary, it should be observed in its true spirit. Placing floral wreaths at the base of the Shaheed Minar and holding various cultural programmes on the day should be more than a mere ritual.",

        "full_article": "In today's globalised trading environment, the significance of aligning domestic policies with international practices to foster trade cannot be overstated. Domestic policies encompass a wide array of measures aimed at regulating production, consumption, and various activities within a country, ranging from taxation and subsidies to regulatory frameworks. The dismantling of trade barriers since the 1980s and 1990s, particularly among developed nations, has underscored the importance of understanding the international ramifications of domestic policies.While some argue that well-designed domestic policies alone can address a country's trading needs, others emphasise the necessity of aligning domestic policies with international norms and practices to effectively navigate the complex global trading landscape. This latter perspective has gained prominence, with policymakers increasingly focusing on the domestic policies in place during discussions on international trade issues. This shift in focus reflects the recognition that domestic policies affecting areas such as energy, environment, labour markets, and health not only shape domestic outcomes but also influence international trade and investment dynamics, impacting producers and consumers worldwide. That is to say, domestic policies have international repercussions.There is no arguing the importance of effective policies that a country needs to frame and execute to facilitate trade, but the question one cannot ignore is: how far can domestic policies hinge on accommodating trading practices, rules and regulations of other trading partners-big or small? Domestic policies such as competition policy, export-import policy and industrial policy are there to facilitate price stability, fairness in businesses, and also to create the environment for producing more for local consumption as well as exports. This, one must agree, is only one side of the coin. On the flip side, it is the rules and practices of trading partners including the asymmetries in economic strength and capacity that come up as potentially impeding factors. This is the case with most developing and less-developed countries which keep looking for a congenial and level playing field to negotiate trade with partners.This precisely is the reason why countries these days are more eager than ever for tie-ups at regional level, preferably with countries where they can hope to find things less demanding. The logic behind bilateral deals is also strongly backed by this understanding of mutual comfort. Ever since regional and bilateral trade agreements in various shapes and forms began to emerge during the past decades, one of the key factors contracting countries considered motivational was the creation of level playing fields, a scene not in clear sight in the globalised trade environment packaged by the WTO. There can be no denying that regional initiatives are often more encompassing than the focused concerns of the WTO. This is entirely natural, as regional neighbours may share concerns and interests that do not necessarily relate to those further away. There may be more than one agenda for cooperation in similar and sometimes overlapping areas of policy or economic activity.However, there were many regional trade deals where because of asymmetries in the economic standings of the countries, the playing field did not prove to be level enough for all to take part in equitable terms. Interestingly, as against multilateralism which is viewed to promote global trade irrespective of regions, regionalism in trade is pronounced in terms of promoting both trade and cooperation at regional levels.At a juncture when multilateral trading is failing the developing countries, and regional trade deals are providing some reprieve, domestic policies can at their best strengthen a country's supply base as well as take care of much of its weaknesses in product development, adaptation and quality assurance, but not guard against its difficulties in international trade, a good deal of which emerges from policies of stronger trade partners that are anti-trade in character. There are so many instances of such barriers and market access difficulties where domestic policies, however proactive from a country perspective, cannot be expected to rise up to the task.Furthermore, the evolving landscape of international trade underscores the need for continuous adaptation and innovation in domestic policies. As global supply chains become increasingly interconnected and technology-driven, policymakers must remain vigilant enough to address emerging challenges and opportunities. For instance, the rise of e-commerce and digital trade presents both new avenues for growth and regulatory challenges that require agile and forward-thinking domestic policy frameworks. In this context, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among countries becomes paramount. By learning from each other's experiences and best practices, policymakers can refine their domestic policy approaches and enhance their effectiveness in promoting trade and economic development. Looking ahead, the imperative to align domestic policies with international practices will only grow stronger as the global economy continues to evolve and interdependence deepens. Embracing principles of transparency, inclusivity, and mutual benefit in policy formulation and implementation will be essential for building trust and fostering cooperation among trading partners. By working together to create an enabling environment for trade, countries can unlock new opportunities for growth, prosperity, and shared progress in today's interconnected world.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DCCI) recently arranged a seminar on the export readiness of the country in the post-LDC period. The main presentation made by Dr. Selim Raihan, executive director of SANEM, hit the nail on the head when he had stated that \"Bangladesh fetched $823 million from the nine new products in 2021 while Vietnam earned $145billlion, Thailand $6.61 billion and India $6.12 billion respectively\". It is time to face the reality, no matter how much we like to indulge in self-glorification about how the country is No.2 in the global apparel trade. The 15 years period in question (2006-2021) saw continuity of government and a lot of progress has been made in terms of infrastructure development and power generation. Equally important is that the focus had remained on readymade garments (RMG) and the production of basic apparels. Only recently, has the industry started to diversify its product line. The competitors have not been sitting around idly, as one can see from Vietnam's experience. Three other nations have been highlighted i.e. Vietnam, Thailand and India along with Bangladesh in terms of how many items have been added to the export basket over this period. Vietnam leads the pack with 41 followed closely by Thailand 31 and although India trailed both with 16, its number was nearly double that of Bangladesh which had nine.According to a report published in this newspaper earlier this month, RMG exports to the US market had fallen by as much as 25 per cent in the last fiscal. When there's a downturn where people are struggling to pay their mortgages, to eat, meet utility bills, fashion takes a backseat. The high inflation and rising interest rates are indeed, a global phenomenon, and this is reflected by overflowing inventories amongst United States' (US) retailers. The US alone represents the single largest export market for Bangladeshi apparels. So, any downturn in demand over there will have serious consequences here. Official figures from the Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA)'s latest released data of February 8 show RMG exports witnessed a 25.07 per cent drop on year-to year basis. The US market is unique in the sense that the RMG industry never enjoyed GSP facilities over there. The terms put forward by the US to the industry has at least been met halfway thanks to the upgrading of physical safety standards over many years. The labour issue is another matter and it is difficult to determine precisely when it will be addressed, particularly when the industry faces daunting challenges. With more than 80 per cent of annual exports out of Bangladesh coming from this sector, policymakers and industry have wasted more than a decade on two fronts: First, there was no attempt to diversify the economy. All the incentives, or at least the bulk of those went to the RMG sector. Second, as is now amply clear, (and on which RMG leaders also concur) diversification of product portfolio hadn't happened as a matter of concerted marketing strategy. The RMG sector has shown itself to be a resilient one. Unfortunately, it is hamstrung by the policy regime and the overwhelming confidence in itself that it can withstand the downturn is misplaced. While it may be easy for some owners to keep factories shut, what the millions of workers will do to put food on the table? There are no easy answers to such troubling questions.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Middlemen are a double-edged sword in the agricultural landscape of Bangladesh, a nation where approximately 80 per cent of the population is engaged in the agricultural sector. While farmers strive to cultivate crops to meet both domestic needs and international export demands, they are encountering mounting challenges in sustaining their livelihoods. The hurdles they face include escalating expenses of agricultural inputs such as high-yielding seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery.Despite their toil and investment, the compensation they receive for their produce falls short of equitable return. This disparity is primarily attributed to the pervasive influence of middlemen, augmented by the presence of local brokers who operate within the agricultural supply chain.The involvement of these intermediaries comes at a cost, one that burdens farmers and distorts the fair pricing mechanism. By denying a fair price to farmers, these middlemen erode farmers' economic viability. This trend poses a significant economic threat to the nation, as a dwindling interest in farming among its populace would compromise not only food security but also the broader economic stability of the country.Addressing this multifaceted challenge requires concerted efforts from the relevant authorities. Agricultural market dynamics need transformation, ensuring that farmers receive fair and transparent compensation for their produce. Effective measures to mitigate the undue influence of middlemen and empower farmers with better market access and negotiation capabilities are imperative. Only through such interventions can Bangladesh safeguard its agricultural backbone and avert the looming economic peril posed by the marginalisation of its farming communities.\nRasel AhmedStudent, Mass Communication and JournalismDhaka University",
