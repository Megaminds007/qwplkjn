        "full_article": "Though Bangladesh achieved significant economic growth over the last two decades, still it could hardly show matching progress in terms of job creation.\u00a0 To some economists such 'jobless growth' is a puzzle and they held high trade barriers as some of the reasons for such anomaly in the economy.\u00a0 The issues came up nat a\u00a0 recent seminar jointly organised by the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM) and the World Bank, where\u00a0 experts pointed out several reasons for this dichotomy. One is that the fresh graduates coming out of the education system lack the necessary skills to meet the needs of\u00a0 the\u00a0 country's many industrial and commercial establishments. Those include promising sectors like information technology (IT) and the apparels sector, which have been forced to import the requisite skilled manpower from abroad. So, there is greater need for increased investment in human capital and rejuvenating private sector growth \"as key factors for local job creation.\"\nYet, the dearth in human capital remains largely unaddressed. Of late, there has been a realisation at the policy level that technical / vocational training is of great import if the country is to reskill the existing workforce and impart skills for young people coming of age. Yet, not much has happened in either setting up quality institutes nationwide because according to published data, around 800,000 graduates are entering the existing population of the unemployed each year. A full-fledged national skills development plan exists, but is it going about producing tangible results? That remains the billion-dollar question, since the country has an economy worth more than $100 billion a year.\nThe macroeconomic situation hasn't helped matters. There is the question of stubborn inflation and currency devaluation which have had its impact on the job market. While parallels have been drawn with India, the two countries are fundamentally different in some core areas. India had spent nearly the first four decades since independence in developing and honing its institutions and a large portion of its resources went into education. Bangladesh too had a good education system, but for whatever reason, this system has been allowed to wither away and in the absence of real quality control - the products out of the current education system are hopelessly out of touch with what is needed by the economy. Yes, Bangladesh has taken giant strides in reducing poverty and emerged as a global giant in one sector, i.e. RMG. Other sectors like footwear, pharmaceuticals look promising and are beginning to make their mark; but overall, it would be difficult to relish this success in its entirety since nearly a million foreign workers are engaged in key areas of production and management in the vibrant sectors of the economy.\nTrade barriers, notably,\u00a0 are an impediment. Regardless of regional economic unions and associations, non-tariff barriers continue to exist - both in terms of commerce and job opportunities. These have never been fully resolved. It is not possible for the country to address all its multifarious economic problems at once. It can however, revisit the way young people learn in this country. What can be done is to revamp the education system and develop a full-fledged parallel vocational and training sector that will equip the workforce suitably. Presently, the country largely exports \"unskilled\" manpower. It could earn many times more remittance, if the percentage of \"skilled\" manpower increased in the annual economic migrant population. That is where the focus and resources must be given and allocated, if Bangladesh wishes to solve the problem of foreign exchange and help pay for the development it so desires.",

        "full_article": "Despite the apprehension that the Islamic banking industry in the country has fallen into deep trouble, the industry's overall performance last year indicated a positive trend. Many of the key indicators showed that Islamic banks are still on the right track, although some corrective steps are necessary to boost the customers' confidence further. As one-fourth of the country's banking sector now operates under the Islamic mode of finance, it is essential to keep the industry vibrant. Last month, Bangladesh Bank released the quarterly report on Islamic Banking in Bangladesh. It showed that at the end of December 2023, Islamic banks represented 25.35 per cent share in deposits and 28.92 per cent share in investments in the total banking industry. The ratio was 25.81 per cent and 29.20 per cent, respectively, at the end of December 2022. However, the marginal decline in the Islamic banks' share in deposits and investments within a year is not so alarming. This is because both the deposits and investments increased by 8.16 per cent and 9.81 per cent, respectively. Statistics available with the central bank also showed that all exports, imports and remittance mobilisations through the Islamic banking industry increased significantly at the end of 2023 over the same period of 2022. The sector's combined excess liquidity, however, dropped by 13 per cent, showing some weakness in the Islamic banking industry.It is to be noted that at the end of December 2023, there were ten full-fledged Islamic banks in the country operating with 1,670 branches. In addition, 30 Islamic banking branches of 15 conventional commercial banks and 624 Islamic banking windows of 16 conventional commercial banks also provide Islamic financial services. All these together are considered the country's Islamic banking industry or sector, although the full-fledged 10 Islamic banks' share was more than 92 per cent of the total deposits of the sector and 94 per cent of the investments at the end of last year. These banks earned 99 per cent of the total remittance, though they shared around 81 per cent of the total international trade financing of the Islamic banking industry. Islami Bank Bangladesh PLC (IBBL), the oldest and leading Islamic and private commercial bank in the country, holds one-third of all Islamic banks' deposits and investments and 40 per cent of remittance earnings. Al-Arafah Islami Bank PLC, however, had one-third of international trade financing at the end of December last year. Last year, the liquidity crunch in Islamic banks became a serious concern. Five of the ten full-fledged Islamic banks faced persistent liquidity crises and were compelled to seek special liquidity support from the central bank. Many, however, interpreted that these banks were in deep trouble and sought support from Bangladesh Bank. They also argued that internal mismanagement and bad loans have deteriorated the asset quality of some of the Islamic banks, which is reflected in the liquidity crunch. Some even apprehended that depositors have lost confidence, driving massive withdrawals from these banks. All these create panic and misunderstanding about the Islamic banks, further complicating things. Interestingly, all the five Islamic banks regained some liquidity surplus by the end of December signalling the improvement of liquidity situation. It is, however, important to note that the liquidity support by the central bank to commercial banks from time to time is a regular function. When the money market becomes dry due to higher demand of cash, many commercial banks resort to direct and indirect liquidity support from the central bank. In Bangladesh, conventional banks must maintain a 13 per cent Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and a 4 per cent Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) with Bangladesh Bank. CRR is the portion of total deposits that commercial banks must maintain as cash reserves with the central bank. SLR is the minimum percentage of a bank's net demand and time liabilities that it has to maintain in the form of approved government securities. A conventional bank usually maintains the SLR by investing in treasury bonds with different maturities. The bank may use the bond through repo or reverse-repo mechanism to avail necessary liquidity or cash from Bangladesh Bank when required.The SLR for the Islamic banks is 5 per cent instead of 13 per cent and CRR is 4 per cent. However, an Islamic bank cannot invest in treasury bonds or other government securities because these instruments are interest bearing ones and not shariah-complaint. There was no eligible investment option for the Islamic banks to maintain the SLR earlier. To overcome the shortcoming, the Bangladesh Government Islamic Investment Bond (BGIIB) was introduced in 2004. Islamic banks can borrow from this fund in case of liquidity shortage, which is mobilised through the selling of the BGIIB securities based on the mudarabah principle. But, the transaction is thin. In 2020, the government introduced the Sukuk, an Islamic bond, which became a vital instrument for Islamic banks to maintain SLR. The total amount of Sukuk issued stood at BDT 180.00 billion till the end of December 2023. As other commercial banks and financial institutions have also invested in Sukuk, the space for Islamic banks has also been reduced here. This means that even after investing in Sukuk, these banks have idle funds in hand. When demand for cash withdrawal increases, the idle funds are exhausted, and the banks at one stage face a liquidity crunch. The Islamic bank, like the conventional banks, cannot borrow from the call money market as the repayment is subject to interest. In that case, the only option for these banks is to seek the central bank's support. So, it is necessary to float some more Islamic securities or tools so that the Islamic banks can manage the liquidity efficiently. The latest quarterly report of the central bank, however, claimed: \"To make efficient use of excess liquidity of the Islamic banking sector, more innovative Islamic money market and capital market products are introduced. The recent introduction of Sukuk and its huge responses from the investors indicate that it will facilitate smooth liquidity management of Islamic banks which may also help deficit financing of the government budget and promote Islamic capital market in the long run.\"In reality, more work is needed as a number of barriers are there to develop well functioning shariah-complaint financial instruments. Five years ago, a study paper titled 'Liquidity Management Instruments for the Islamic Banks in Bangladesh' identified these and outlined a series of recommendations. Many of these are still relevant.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Subject to the sighting of the moon for the month of Shawwal, the holy month of Ramadan will end and Eid-ul-Fitr will be observed across the country on Wednesday or Thursday. The appearance of the faint and fleeting crescent in the evening sky will be celebrated with a joyous spirit. Congregational prayers will be held in the morning, greetings will be exchanged, and the people, especially children and youth will don their finest dresses as part of the festivity. It's probably the most exciting day of the year for the children, especially. Eid-ul-Fitr, the greatest religious festival for Muslims, marks the end of practising self-restraint and self-purification through fasting and other religious rituals during the holy month of Ramadan. It brings peace and happiness to all Muslims who celebrate it with festivity and religious fervour and also strengthens and unites communities.Eid is seen as an Islamic festival, but it's much more than that. It's a festival for Muslims no doubt, but as a major religious celebration, its horizon is much broader and encompasses an entire society, composed of many different communities. Eid, with its message of peace and brotherhood, unites the people both at intra-communal and inter-communal levels. Apart from the religious rites, there are family-orientated joyful events and festivities that brighten up society as a whole. This year, however, the festival could have been more pleasurable and fun had it not been for some unenthusiastic factors. The holy month of Ramadan specifically instructs Muslims to follow a definite code of conduct both in their personal and social life. It advises devotees to refrain from all wrongdoings and encourages them to practice self-restraint. It flows from these teachings that traders should be fair in their business and refrain from doing unethical transactions. But contrary to the spirit of Ramadan, dishonest sections of the traders use the month to maximise their profit by adopting various unfair means. Most of the transport owners, too, take advantage of the people's need to return to their ancestral homes and be reunited with their families. They squeeze exorbitant fare from them, apparently without feeling any guilt. The combined effect of these factors casts a pall of gloom over the spirit of the holidaymakers. It is due to these depressing factors that the festival would not be as joyful for many as it could be. Besides, Eid had never been nor is it ever likely to be joyful for people crushed under grinding poverty. Islam urges Muslims to share Eid happiness with poorer sections of society. But, regrettably, the tendency to monopolise happiness seems stronger than sharing it. There are no government programmes to make the Eid festival happier for the slum dwellers, street children, and other sections of the destitute. Nor are affluent sections of society coming forward with benevolent objectives. Eid is full of happiness, but seemingly only for a section of society. It is the duty of the government to plan and make Eid meaningful for the poor and destitute members of society. Besides, the well-off sections of society should not forget their social responsibility; they should extend a helping hand to the poor if they really want to establish the basic teachings of Islam in their own life.Let us pray for the day when Eid will be a festival of happiness that embraces all and not have the poor, homeless, and destitute on the outside looking in.Eid Mubarak![email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "As we approach the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan, it's necessary to reflect on the economic landscape that has unfolded during this period, particularly in the realm of imports and price dynamics.At the onset of Ramadan, the influx of imports, particularly of essential commodities such as chickpeas, sugar, dates, and edible oils, painted a picture of abundance and reassurance for consumers. However, as the month progressed, a disconnect emerged between import statistics and retail prices, presenting a perplexing puzzle for businesses and consumers alike.The surge in prices, despite ample imports, can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including the appreciation of the dollar, elevated customs duties, and increased operational costs. This phenomenon has resulted in significant price hikes across various essential items, posing challenges for businesses in managing their bottom lines and for consumers in managing their budgets.Take, for instance, the case of dates, a staple during Ramadan. While imports have been sufficient to meet demand, prices have soared, placing strains on both consumers and retailers. Such discrepancies highlight the need for a closer examination of market forces and regulatory measures to ensure price stability and consumer affordability.To stabilise the market, stakeholders across the supply chain must collaborate and explore avenues for mitigating price volatility and promoting a more sustainable economic environment. This necessitates proactive engagement with regulatory authorities and industry stakeholders to address underlying structural issues and foster a more resilient marketplace.Mahnaz Raihan, StudentNorth South University[email\u00a0protected]",
