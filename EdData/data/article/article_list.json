Hezbollah, which, under Nasrallah\u2019s three-decade long leadership, emerged as a parallel state in Lebanon, has been seen by the Israelis as their most powerful non-state enemy. Viewed by the U.S. as a terror group, it is also a central constituent in Iran\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, through which Iran projects its influence across the region. By killing Nasrallah, Israel has dealt Hezbollah a heavy blow and dented Iran\u2019s influence, but its cross-border attacks have killed and displaced thousands and crossed the brightest of Iran\u2019s red lines. The region has never been this close to an open war between Israel and Iran. When Israel launched its retaliatory war on Gaza after Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Nasrallah opened a second front by firing rockets into northern Israel. He wanted to keep some military pressure on the Israeli Defense Forces when the war on Gaza was killing tens of thousands of Palestinians. Israel played along with limited exchange of fire in return for Hezbollah\u2019s rockets when its focus was on Gaza. But after destroying much of Gaza, Israel turned its attention towards Lebanon, and then dramatically escalated the conflict, targeting Hezbollah\u2019s ground functionaries, its commanders and then Nasrallah.Israel\u2019s declared objective in the north is to enable the over 60,000 people who were displaced by Hezbollah\u2019s rockets to return to their homes. Its strikes have weakened Hezbollah but not destroyed its missile capabilities. This means Israel could launch a ground offensive into Lebanon, seeking to push Hezbollah to the north of the Litani river and carve a buffer on the border. A ground offensive would displace and kill tens of thousands of people in Lebanon, which is reeling under deep economic pains. Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza is yet to meet its declared objectives of destroying Hamas and securing the release of hostages. There is no guarantee that Israel would quickly meet its objectives in Lebanon. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees the crisis as an opportunity for Israel to degrade its non-state rivals even at the cost of triggering an all-out war with Iran. The U.S. publicly calls for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, but these words do not carry any weight as the Biden administration continues to arm Israel. Iran, repeatedly provoked and pushed to the corner, has so far exercised relative restraint while Israel has gone on a blood-thirsty rampage. Iran might be tempted to respond to the Nasrallah killing with force. But Tehran should not give Mr. Netanyahu what he wants \u2014 an excuse to start a wider war in West Asia.

        "full_article": "In July, NASA cancelled its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission to the moon after the development was beset by delays and costs had ballooned. By this time its engineers had fully assembled it and completed some tests, but NASA held its ground. The sudden decision dismayed scientists. VIPER was designed to map the distribution of water-ice in the moon\u2019s south pole region and the soils in which it occurred, over three months. In all, the golf-cart-sized rover was to be launched by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket and deployed using Astrobotic\u2019s \u2018Griffin\u2019 lander, all managed through NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services programme. Landing on the moon is an expensive, time-consuming exercise. NASA\u2019s decision to cancel VIPER at this late stage thus drew the attention of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and of the wider international community, which sees in VIPER\u2019s absence an opportunity for China\u2019s increasingly complex lunar programme to lead the way. The world\u2019s rush back to the moon offers potentially significant commercial and geopolitical gains. VIPER was expected to be a pivotal component of the US-led \u2018lunar axis\u2019 defined by the Artemis Accords, which counts India among its leaders. Yet, India missed a trick when, on September 18, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to begin the second phase of the country\u2019s lunar programme with Chandrayaan-4, a sample-return mission.Moments after the Chandrayaan-3 lander descended on the moon\u2019s surface on August 23, 2023, reports erupted to claim India had yet again admitted itself into a small, elite group of countries that have achieved an autonomous lunar soft-landing. But such proclamations overlook the considerable gaps between these countries\u2019 space agencies from an operations perspective. One pertinent difference is that ISRO is unable to execute multiple flagship missions in parallel. Instead, it follows a \u2018one major mission at a time\u2019 cadence that, in exchange for maximising resource use efficiency, leaves the organisation incapable of manoeuvring rapidly to respond to new opportunities. Had it been able, ISRO could have sought the Cabinet\u2019s approval for the \u2018Lunar Polar Explorer\u2019 mission it is planning with its Japanese counterpart, to land a rover on the moon to perform many of the crucial tasks VIPER was expected to, especially prospecting for large water-ice deposits. Even now, the VIPER incident should remind the Centre that despite an expanding allocation and new funding modes in the offing, the Indian space programme needs more resources to realise its full potential.

So-called because the case, as SC\u2019s questioning clarified yesterday, has moved a distance from the initial allegation the Andhra CM made on Sept 18/19. Chandrababu Naidu had alleged that the Tirupati prasad, the laddoo, had been found to be contaminated. The samples sent for testing were not laddoos, but ghee, for a quality check at the point of supply/delivery. Such tests are also as per temple administration SOP. Yesterday, proceedings in SC made it clear that the allegedly contaminated ghee was never used in the making of laddoos. For the millions of devotees worldwide, the fact established in SC is a first step to restoration of trust. Tirupati is a league apart. Its laddoo has a postal stamp, a GI mark, and a patent. Doubts over the tendering process, supply chain, and oversight, are a taint on the crowning jewel of temples.\u00a0\nThe allegations have also fed the demand for govts to cede control of temples. One of the five petitions riding on the alleged contamination is seeking to \u201cdivest govt/bureaucratic hold over temples\u201d. Calls for private control of Hindu temples have never strayed too far from the judiciary in the last 100 years since Madras enacted the first such law in 1925. On the concurrent list post-Independence, at least 11 states enacted their own laws. HCs see a steady stream of cases seeking private control, or, against alleged malpractices of govt control. As recently as 2023 and 2022, SC refused to entertain pleas on temple control, saying it would be \u201cturning the clock back\u201d.\nIf petitioners\u2019 argument has remained the same \u2013 why only Hindu temples must \u201csuffer\u201d govt control, the counters remain as relevant today as at any time in the past. One, accumulation of wealth, and two, caste. On the first, courts have held that private entities \u201cmanaging/owning\u201d large temples would effectively be the receiver of public largesse, with no accountability to worshippers, or in law. Tirupati, for instance, has a net worth of $36bn. Caste, meanwhile, remains an everyday reality. Exclusionary practices find ever-new manifestations. Caste clashes, denial of access to Dalits on various forums, is as modern as it is hoary. Further, on the relatively simpler matter of adulteration, there is simply no ground to claim that private management will arrest the possibility of any such contamination.\u00a0\n\n",

Most of us who pay minimums every 30 days go deeper into the squishy squelchy mud of debt and we don\u2019t even know what we are paying for. Just the relief of surviving another month, so who reads the breakdown of the extras.\nMy banker friend (some of us do have them) says credit cards are made with one aim in mind\u2026to give bankers a good life. He has no credit cards, only a debit. After ensuring I am not recording him he says credit cards are juicy bait. Why do you think we make them so attractive and give them fancy names and different colours and all those precious metal categories like platinum and uranium, never tin or aluminium. You are the fish we want to hook and feeding your ego is the best way to catch you. And once you are caught you stay caught. Oh you can wriggle and whine but you are not getting away, nosiree, you are ours forever.\u00a0\nJust to make sure you don\u2019t perform the occasional escape we will sell you the illusion of an awesome promotion or let your Y class butt park itself in an airport lounge where you don\u2019t realise you are paying for the access because we have inflated your ego. Imagine swindling you blatantly then adding insult to injury by getting you 5% off on a hotel room.\u00a0\nI ask him how he sleeps at night and he says like a baby, why do you think I can send the kids to college and buy a holiday home and this SUV we are driving in. Yes sir, credit cards are credit-able says he and laughs happily. I am beginning to love to loathe him.\nTalk about big-time suckers, he grins, see how we con you with loyalty programmes (loyalty to the bank) and no annual fees and it never strikes you that, with all the other charges, we don\u2019t need annual fees. The human race, he warbles on, is so na\u00efve, isn\u2019t it lovely.\nWe folks have cards with low-limit value and every time we use them our heart rate increases because we just about expect someone to grab us by the shoulder and say, got you, you imposter. Have you ever stood in a line and handed the card to the teller? She holds it like it was a dead mouse and as she swipes it you palpitate and wait. Then she says with great relish and glee, your card is declined.\n\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Our activity can already turn the moon cold. Colonising it will be truly terrible\nEach of us remembers how much our surroundings were transformed by Covid lockdowns. Even if we didn\u2019t, there are drone videos taken during March-April 2020 to remind us what happened to Indian cities back then. Streets quieted, skies turned pretty shades of blue, landmarks felt unrecognisable without the usual pandemonium. It turns out the impact went much, much further. Scientists from Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad have found evidence that the global lockdowns even affected faraway moon, pushing its temperature down.\u00a0\nThere is something romantic about this. For its entire history, humanity has shared the experience of looking up to our moon, some finding in it a deity, some a muse, others a comforting companion, and still others a compass. Isn\u2019t it nice to know that the feels aren\u2019t all one-sided? But there\u2019s also a grimmer side to human activity having heavy repercussions all the way across space. On earth, it has already changed the climate dangerously, driven species to extinction, turned water bodies into poison. Now that humanity has shifted lunar colonies from the realm of science fiction into far-future reality, whether it will send the moon the way of earth has also become a real concern.\u00a0\nA few years ago, Bezos\u2019s space company Blue Origin circulated a white paper to Nasa leadership and others, making the case for \u201cincentives to the private sector to demonstrate a commercial lunar cargo delivery service\u201d. This is just indicative of how once sci-fi scenes are now legit investment opportunities. A point of no return was the definitive discovery of water on the moon by Chandrayaan-1, which made human habitats much easier to envisage up there. But all the irreparable wreckage of colonisations here on earth must caution us against subjecting our moon to the same. We will always be in a relationship, but let it not be toxic.\n\n",

Reality is painfully behind\nWhile healthcare reach in India leaves a lot to be desired, there is no doubt that everyday more persons have access to life-sustaining treatments than yesterday. But this also means that everyday there are more patients on life support who are \u201cnot expected to benefit\u201d from it. While recent years have seen courts and govt recognise such terminally ill patients\u2019 right to die with dignity, the actual processes to access this right are so gruelling that it largely remains out of reach. The draft GOI guidelines for withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, released for public comment, are intended to increase access to this right. Will they?\nIn a recent case, both Delhi HC and the Supreme Court turned down the plea of aging parents of a patient who has been in a \u201cpermanently vegetative state\u201d for more than a decade, to direct the constitution of a medical board to assess him for passive euthanasia. The courts\u2019 logic was that the patient \u201cdoes not appear to be on life support\u201d. Experts have since pointed out, including on this page, that the courts\u2019 reading of the Ryles tube, inserted into the patient\u2019s stomach through his nose, is neither the consensus medical opinion nor the legal position in most jurisdictions around the world.\u00a0\nA useful clarification provided by the draft guidelines is that \u201cparenteral nutrition\u201d \u2013 nutrients pumped directly into a vein \u2013 is in the same category as mechanical ventilation. They also underline that the judicial officer is only to be notified \u2013 of a decision made by medical professionals in consultation with the family/surrogate and valid Advance Medical Directives. \u201cApproval is not required.\u201d This should help medical boards get over fears of courts. But the medical boards need to exist in the first place. Then they need to step up. Act with gravity, empathy and science.\n\n",

        "full_article": "While people in many districts are still reeling from the fallout of the August floods\u2014deemed by some as the worst in the country since 1988\u2014reports say that recent occurrences of heavy rainfall and onrush of water from upstream have yet again inundated vast tracts of areas in northern districts, marooning over 60,000 people in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram as of Sunday night. Many low-lying areas in Rangpur and Nilphamari have also been flooded. As a result, many of the affected have had to leave their homes, taking shelter on roads and embankments. Moreover, thousands of hectares of croplands, including Aman and vegetable fields, have been submerged. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre has said the situation may improve by Tuesday, but if water does not begin to recede as expected, it may damage early-winter crops. This needs immediate action from the authorities.\nThe question is, how prepared is the government to deal with such frequent floods and the devastations caused by them? Its response to the August flood has been often slow and ineffective, with the rehabilitation programmes for victims yet to begin. The priority now is to provide those stranded in the four northern districts with shelter, food and drinking water, and necessary medicine. They will also require help to protect their livestock and poultry as their livelihoods depend on them. Once floodwaters recede, there will be the gargantuan challenge of rehabilitation, reconstructing their homes and repairing damaged infrastructure, including roads and embankments, etc. The affected, especially those in worst-hit areas, will also need financial support to rebuild.\nThe government's proactive role in these endeavours is crucial. The NGOs and wider society should also come forward to support these endeavours. During the devastating flood of August, we saw how people from all walks of life came forward to support the victims. However, coordination became a big issue in conducting relief operations in remote areas with the local administrations struggling to do their part. Therefore, the government must take lessons from these shortcomings and prepare to efficiently support the victims this time. It also must build a robust flood management and rehabilitation system for dealing with such natural disasters in the future.\n",

        "full_article": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can be utilised in almost all aspects of healthcare, from diagnosis and treatment to streamlining daily administrative work. The US is at the forefront of exploring the potential of AI in healthcare,\u00a0and Cleveland, Houston, and Boston are the\u00a0major cities where new AI-driven technologies are being designed and tested. Other countries like China, the UK, Israel, South Korea, Japan, and Germany\u00a0are also heavily investing in AI tools and applications. In Bangladesh, we must take a proactive approach to adopting AI tools to improve efficiency in our healthcare.\nAI can take a prominent role in operating rooms. In surgical procedures, like knee and hip surgeries, AI-operated robots can perform minimally invasive operations that reduce recovery times, minimise scarring, and lead to overall better health outcomes. Globally,\u00a0 California-based\u00a0Intuitive Surgical's AI-powered robot da Vinci Surgical System, operating \u00a0in about 70 countries, has performed\u00a010 million\u00a0procedures since its release in 2000. The system combines advanced robotics, high-definition 3D visualisation, and equipment that mimics the movement of a surgeon's hand but with greater precision and accuracy. Indeed,\u00a0robotic surgery has already become a major global market, with a projected growth of $83 billion by 2032.\u00a0\u00a0\nAI has also shown remarkable capabilities in diagnosis and personalised treatment. AI technologies now analyse radiological images with accuracy levels that rival or exceed human limits. While it might take a radiologist minutes or longer to analyse\u00a0a single scan, an AI tool takes only seconds to review\u00a0hundreds of scans\u00a0more accurately! AI mechanisms can also discover small fractures and anomalies in medical images that human experts may miss. It can identify conditions like breast cancer and lung diseases more precisely than clinicians.\u00a0 Analysing genetic information, lifestyle factors, and environmental data, AI tools can recommend personalised medication. This precision medicine approach is vital in oncology where tailored treatment is often recommended based on the patient's genetic profile.\nBeyond surgeries and cancer detection, AI algorithms can also provide predictive analysis based on patients' lifestyle, environmental, and behavioural data. For example, an AI algorithm can track a patient's exposure to pollutants, and changes in vital signs, and predict the likelihood of developing conditions like asthma and heart disease. The algorithms can detect early signs of neurological disorders, diabetes, and heart failure, allowing early intervention to prevent illness, emergency department visits, and readmissions.\nAI is also widely used in remote monitoring, telemedicine, and virtual assistance around the clock. Almost all wearable devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors, bio-stickers, and smart rings, have built-in AI applications. These tools\u00a0can perform vital tasks such as tracking patient heart rates, sleep patterns, respiratory rate, activity and stress levels, and send data to providers in real-time. This ease of data collection helps manage chronic diseases and ensure timely response to emergencies. AI-run virtual assistance programmes are often equipped with 24/7 patient counselling, medication reminders, and follow-up check-ins.\nEven though AI-powered devices can revolutionise healthcare, there are significant challenges in implementing its solutions. A major barrier is the integration and interoperability of AI tools into the existing capabilities, infrastructure, and electronic health records (EHR) systems. Currently, Bangladesh is taking only the first steps towards digitising healthcare by incorporating some web-based and mobile applications to make appointments, doctor visits, deliver drugs, and process transactions. Of course, challenges with interoperability can be overcome by training physicians on the usage of AI tools, as well as market-driven competition by technology vendors. Effective use of AI requires that clinicians understand how to interpret AI outputs and integrate them into decision-making processes. Bridging the knowledge gap is an important first step to implementing AI technologies.\u00a0\nHigh-quality data is another critical element for driving AI's efficacy. As application and data go hand in hand, we must ensure safe and secure collection, storage, usage, and exchange of data across AI-powered systems and networks. Inconsistent, incomplete, and inaccurate data can lead to inaccuracies in diagnosis and treatment, putting patients' lives on the line.\nThere are also ethical concerns such as if the data collected by\u00a0AI is secure and private, what if AI algorithms are biased leading to misleading diagnosis and treatment, etc. If AI's database is incomplete, the resulting output will produce biases. In the US, a recent study of AI algorithms has revealed that AI-generated political contents support conservative views more heavily, triggering debates on neutralising its approach. Fortunately, many ethical issues in healthcare can be mitigated through collaboration among ethicists, technologists, and the public.\u00a0\nAI-driven healthcare will only expand as its diverse range of productivity and efficiency far outweighs the risks and costs associated with it. In a rapidly evolving digital world, we must use advanced healthcare technologies, and AI drives this space with continued success and improvement. It, of course, will redefine our healthcare workforce. In the AI environment, physicians will oversee humane aspects of healthcare such as compassion, critical thinking, contextual understanding, and decision-making, and strategically manage these tools with their input and data to drive optimal health results.\u00a0AI mostly handles repetitive data-heavy tasks.\u00a0\nTo conclude, countries worldwide are invested in AI technologies to transform their healthcare, and we must also embrace the power of AI to improve overall care. Technologists, healthcare providers, and regulators must work in tandem to unlock the full potential of AI in our healthcare systems. Failure is not an option.\u00a0\u00a0\nABM Uddin is analyst for the Senate Democratic Office at the Florida Legislature.

        "full_article": "The July uprising claimed the lives of hundreds of people, but resulted in a seismic shift in the history of Bangladesh. The movement was a perfect storm brewed by a number of contributing factors that all seemed to align as if by divine intervention, resulting in the ouster of Sheikh Hasina's tyrannical regime. Thousands of activists took to the streets\u2014students, workers, professionals, and intellectuals alike. Each contributed in their own way. Why, then, is there this search for a \"mastermind\" behind the entire movement?\nThis search for a mastermind cannot be solely blamed on the media or overenthusiastic social media users. Even the interim government's Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus introduced Mahfuj Alam as the brains behind the movement at an international event\u2014although Mahfuj himself refused to be called the mastermind, a fact even the chief adviser alluded to. This reminds me of a quote from Friedrich Hayek, who said that the curious task of economics (or social science) is to show people how little they know about what they think they can design. Hayek was wrong about many things, but one of his ideas has withstood the test of time: the concept of spontaneous order. Following the trend of classical liberal thinkers before him, Hayek believed that order could arise from spontaneity.\n\nMany social norms are established not by the enforcement of explicit rules but spontaneously for the sake of efficiency. I believe social movements follow a similar logic.\nA social movement is shaped by many factors, with a plethora of internal and external actors playing their part. The July uprising was no exception. It is true that there was an organisation providing a backbone to the movement, with stellar leadership initiatives and a distribution of responsibilities that contributed to its success. When one group of leaders was picked up by security forces, another stepped up to guide the movement. The well-defined demands that evolved over time were also crucial in bringing the movement to its one-point conclusion.\nThe formulators of these demands and those who pushed for the final anti-regime stance deserve commendation. But calling them the \"brains behind the movement\" seems like an exaggeration. In fact, most leaders were and still are unknown to the public, aside from the two advisers to the interim government and a few recognisable faces repeatedly shown in the media. Many other leaders worked behind the scenes and deserve credit. But the point of my article is to argue that attributing credit to specific individuals is misguided.\nIn social science research, we often say that there are \"spandrels\"\u2014developments that occur as a byproduct of various factors, including time and context, almost by (sometimes fortunate) accident. These factors cannot be ignored. As many film directors and novelists would say, there are more characters in a story than just protagonists and antagonists. Sometimes, the setting or time itself becomes a character. In a similar manner, I believe the primary actor in the July uprising was not an individual but the city, the moment, and the momentum of that moment. As events unfolded, the movement evolved, and the perfect conditions were created for it to propel forward.\nIf any one individual had not been present at that moment, the movement would not have faltered\u2014others would likely have stepped in to make decisions. We cannot know if those decisions would have been as prudent, but the momentum of the moment demanded nothing less than what transpired. Even if key individuals had been replaced, the outcome would likely have been similar, as the movement had already taken on a life of its own.\nMany people are congratulating and valorising the efforts of the coordinators, who have become national heroes. But other actors also played crucial roles, such as activists of opposing political parties, journalists who risked their lives, and expatriates who helped raise international awareness of the situation in Bangladesh. Their contributions cannot be overlooked. More importantly, the spontaneous order that defined the movement should receive primary credit for its success.\nThousands of people participated in the movement, risking their lives, writing on social media, and demanding the removal of an autocratic regime even before the one-point demand came about. Such widespread enthusiasm cannot be engineered\u2014it can only be sparked by the momentum of the moment, which was the primary factor in the movement's success.\n\nI am not undermining the efforts that the student leaders put in. They deserve credit for stewarding the movement. But can they really be called the masterminds, as if they planned every step and pre-designed the entire movement in their minds? Nobody could predict what would happen the next day as the movement progressed. The decision of the student leaders to launch the one-point programme upon their release from the custody of security forces was certainly pivotal, leading thousands to march to Ganabhaban on August 5. But the moral legitimacy of the Hasina regime\u2014if there was any\u2014had entirely vanished the moment the first bullet was fired at students. The student coordinators had no choice but to declare an all-out movement against the government\u2014it was the demand of the moment, not a pre-designed plan.\nIn fact, I can attest to private conversations with movement leaders who confessed they never imagined the movement would become so massive and succeed in toppling the government during its early days. Hence, attributing the role of masterminds to the leaders is a bit of a stretch. It is natural for us to seek order and reason in historical events that defy explanation, but to claim that there was a mastermind behind the July uprising is to oversimplify a complex and multifaceted movement.\nAnupam Debashis Roy is the editor of Muktipotro and a Phd student at the University of Oxford.

        "full_article": "Syeda Rizwana Hasan, environment, forest and climate as well as water resources adviser of the interim government comes up with her government's plan to create what she calls a 'blue network' with proper use of canals -- both already in existence and to be reclaimed. The adviser might have used the expression 'blue network' to refer to the creation of an extensive network of pollution-free water carrying canals in the capital city. The purpose is to make the capital city liveable through greening, bio-diversity conservation and wetland preservation. On all those counts, there is no doubt about the intention of the staunch environmental campaigner which she exactly is. However, a few questions need to be answered before the environmental agendas she underscores to pursue while she stays in her position. Here are two distinct aspects of serious concern. One is liveability and the other is not just preservation of bio-diversity but also improvement of the overall environment of the city. Involved with healthy liveability are a host of issues including infrastructure, transport systems and even civic sense and routine practice by the urban population. Unplanned growth of concrete structures with little green and open space such as playgrounds, parks and lakes excepting a rare few exclusive zones has turned this city into a veritable sprawling slum. After excavation of drains further deeper, the city cannot flush out accumulated rain waters even after a moderate shower. Its transportation system and transports -- black fume-spewing buses, lagunas, trucks, covered vans and pickups -- are one of the worst in the world. The mayors including the last two have also made tall promises so far as improvement of the city's physical environment is concerned. Reclamation of canals from illegal occupation and revival of their water flows and plantation of trees on their banks formed part of their campaign. Each of them can legitimately claim some credit for accomplishing a few appreciable programmes. The early success in removing the truck stand from Tejgaon, reclamation of a few canals in both north and south city corporations were indeed praiseworthy. But all those fell through because of a lack of a comprehensive plan. Regular monitoring and maintenance are the key to success in case of such public property. So the concern here now is about the tenure of the interim government. Most likely it will not get the time for execution of the envisaged programmes. First, reclamation of canals is not under the jurisdiction of the environment ministry; second, even if the ministry and department concerned cooperate in reclaiming the water bodies, it is a time-consuming matter. Therefore it would be advisable to undertake a cleaning and excavating programme for the reclaimed canals and other existing water bodies. If the water flows in those can be augmented and maintained, the plan for reclamation of other canals can be devised for the next elected government to take up. Sustainable greening of the canal banks, as well as fallow lands on roadsides of the city proper can be started right now.",

        "full_article": "One of the long-term recommendations of the Public Administration Reform Commission (PARC) that submitted its report in 2000 was to establish an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Subsequently, the Government of Bangladesh did establish an Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) in 2004 by doing away with the Bureau of Anti Corruption. But the ACC has proved to be 'same wine in a new bottle', as it is no more independent than its previous incarnation, and the executive branch continues to wield similar direct and indirect control over it.The ACC came into being under the Anti Corruption Commission Act, 2004, which provided a framework to prevent corruption and other corrupt practices in the country, conduct investigation, file cases for specific offences, and deal with other relevant matters related to corruption. It was linked to the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1947 and the Penal Code of 1860 with regard to offences. The former defined corruption as: (i) dishonest or fraudulent misappropriation or otherwise converting for one's own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant, or allowing any other person to do so; (ii) obtaining valuable things or pecuniary advantage by corrupt or illegal means, or by otherwise abusing his position as public servant; (iii) amassing wealth beyond known source of income. Subsequently, the then caretaker government framed the ACC Rules in 2007 to infuse fresh impetus to its anti-corruption drive.In the backdrop mentioned above, the interim government of Bangladesh has recently constituted a commission headed by the eminent corruption-fighter and TIB-chief Dr Iftekharuzzaman to recommend measures for reforming the ACC. Submitting recommendations on such a critical issue within a span of three months will no doubt be a challenging task, but agreeing on an outline at the outset will facilitate the commission's onward journey. The following are some points that may be considered.The first item that may be taken up is the framing of a comprehensive anti-corruption law, as the current law appears to be a fragmented one with linkages to other laws. The second element that should be considered is the formulation of comprehensive rules for making the ACC fully operational through amendment of current rules. And thirdly, a roadmap should be prepared for the management and organizational aspects of the ACC, which may include all management functions and operational roles, as well as how the entity can be turned into an institution from that of a mere organization. This roadmap in turn may be divided into short, medium, and long-term ones. As elaborated by Philip Selznick (1957), the criteria for transformation into an institution are: a distinct identity and unique competence; strong reputation and public legitimacy; and enduring viability through adaptation.Since the 1960s, the anti-corruption agencies of Singapore and Hong Kong have proved to be the most successful ones in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the commission headed by TIB-chief may also review the experiences of those two agencies in curbing corruption over the years, in order to seek suitable ideas for appropriate applications in Bangladesh. The experience of Singapore is briefly discussed below, as its Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) has been hailed as a catalytic force in the emergence of Singapore as one of the most corruption-free states from that of a corruption-prone one.In his famous book 'From Third World to First, The Singapore Story: 1965-2000', the first prime minister and founding father of modern Singapore Lee Kuan Yew (2000: 182-184)wrote: \"We were sickened by the greed, corruption and decadence of many Asian leaders. We had a deep sense of mission to establish a clean and effective government. \u2026 We made sure from the day we took office in June 1959, that every dollar in revenue would be properly accounted for and would reach the beneficiaries at the grassroots as one dollar, without being siphoned off along the way. So, from the very beginning we gave special attention to the areas where discretionary powers had been exploited for personal gain, and sharpened instruments that could prevent, detect or deter such practices.\"The CPIB has been the driving force in making Singapore one of the least corrupt nations from that of a state where corruption was endemic, especially in the police. The organization gradually achieved substantial authority, mandate and legitimacy to investigate any corruption case with support from political leadership. It successfully leveraged preventive, investigative and legal functions and demonstrated a strong alignment between the rationale for its existence and the strategies and practices it deployed. It enjoyed broad backing with robust internal support from employees and external backing from principal stakeholders. The institutionalisation of CPIB and Singapore's exceptional growth rate has remained closely intertwined giving rise to mutually reinforcing outcomes and a virtuous cycle. Its education and communication efforts have helped to turn public opinion against the use of cultural excuses for corruption as a way of life, which was common in the past.CPIB's responsibilities include the investigation of corruption and malpractices, review of administrative weaknesses in the public sector that provide scope for corruption, and the screening of officers for appointment in the civil service. It can also investigate corruption by expatriate Singaporeans, as it has the mandate to investigate corrupt acts in both public and private sectors. Alongside regular training and communication activities for public servants, CPIB officials even attend school classes for explaining the harmful effects of corruption. A critical lever of its authority and centrality is that it reports directly to the prime minister; moreover, it is constitutionally enabled to shift to a reporting structure under the president if the prime minister becomes the object of investigation.The Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA) of 1960 has been the edifice upon which CPIB has been built. It contained aspects that eliminated legislative weaknesses, enhanced legal powers, and increased personnel. The law also bestowed it sweeping investigative powers and stipulated severe penalties for corrupt behaviour. The five most notable features in CPIB's virtuous cycle of institutionalisation have been political will cum support, adequate legislative mandate, clearly defined roles, competitive compensation, and a performance culture.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "When the need for exploiting all sources of renewable energy including that of the tropical sun is being felt more than ever, the number of existing Solar Home Systems (SHSs) that converts solar energy into electricity through a photovoltaic (PV) module in use is declining. A survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) showed that in 2021, 2.25 per cent of the population used SHSs. But by the next two years, the number fell to 1.81 per cent in 2023. Clearly, the SHS which saw its rapid expansion among the population between 2003 and 2013, has halted after grid power became available in the areas where solar power was earlier the only option. That could well be good news because it showed the then-government's ability to bring larger and larger sections of the population under the national power grid. But the approach at the same time was short-sighted, unsustainable and irresponsible. Short-sighted because being a net importer of fossil fuel, Bangladesh cannot continue the practise for long as it does not have enough hard currency to buy fossil fuels like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), furnace oil, coal etc., to fire its power plants. Neither was the government exploring and exploiting existing reserves for gas and coal. Unsustainable because in an era when globally there is a shift from fossil-based energy to renewable one for the dual reason of falling fossil energy reserves everywhere as well as deleterious effect of fossil fuel on the environment, the government chose an opposite path. Irresponsible because knowing full well that such path of national electrification was ill-conceived, the government went ahead with the plan to produce more power than the country needed through setting up new state-owned gas and oil-based power plants, privately-owned rental and quick rental power plants including even import of electricity from India, just to satisfy the tall ego of the head of the government as well as line the pockets of all those involved at the expense of the public exchequer. Notably, according to former state minister for power, energy and mineral resources Nasrul Hamid, during the past fifteen years of the previous government, capacity payments for the rental power stations alone cost the public exchequer Tk.105 billion. Among the highest recipients of the capacity charges were the Summit Group, United Group, Bangla Cat, RPCAL among others. These crony capitalists got the money without supplying any power to the public. The unsustainable success story of covering the country's entire population by the fossil-fuel-based national grid did one thing: it put an early end to the prospect of supplying clean electricity to the people through SHSs and other renewable energy options. According to an estimate, there are some 6 million homes in the country connected to SHSs. The adviser to the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources of the interim government has stated that all projects and agreements implemented under special laws during the previous government will continue. That's understandable. But at the same time, the government should make serious efforts to wean the nation off the dirty habit of using electricity from fossil-fuel-run power plants. To this end, the government should renew its focus on renewable energy including PV modules for households, solar rooftops, solar irrigation, floating solar power projects etc.It may be recalled that providing power through SHSs started by the end of 1990s when most remote areas of the country were not connected to the national grid. People of those areas used kerosene lamps to light their homes in the evening. In 2003, started the World Bank (WB)-financed SHS projects by the Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (IDCOL). The installation of SHSs continued for a decade with ever increasing number of homes getting service. But as noted before, expansion of the national grid stopped the progress of SHS installations. Interim government's energy adviser should have a rethink.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for the people here. However, it is unfortunate that most of the roads in this upazila are dirt roads. Even a small amount of rain renders these roads impassable, making it difficult for vehicles to move and even for people to walk.Moreover, the few paved roads that were once in good condition have now deteriorated, further restricting vehicle movement and hindering the transport of flowers and crops to the market. As a result, many agricultural products go to waste.
