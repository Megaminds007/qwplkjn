Restrictions that hinder the free movement of people and economic activities may no longer be necessary considering that the third wave seems to be truly coming to an end, the Government noted. From less than 7,000 daily fresh cases in the fourth week of December 2021, the number of cases began rising sharply in the last days of 2021 and increased exponentially before peaking on January 20, with over 3,40,000 cases recorded. The decline in daily fresh cases too witnessed a sharp fall after peaking. But relying entirely on daily fresh cases might give a misleading picture as the Government revised the testing strategy on January 10, which makes only those with symptoms and certain at-risk contacts of laboratory confirmed cases eligible for a test. The sale of self-test kits soared in many cities but the reporting of results by their users was poor. In addition, the mild nature of the disease in many fully vaccinated and previously infected people might have led to complacency and a reluctance to get tested. Despite the limitations in the measurement of cases, the sustained decline in the number of cases and in the positivity rate since the third wave peaked does indicate that the third wave is nearing its end. For the first time since the third wave peaked, the seven-day average test positivity rate nationally fell below 5% on February 12; it was 3% on February 16. But 16 States still report a seven-day average test positivity above the national average; it is very high in the Union Territory of Puducherry (28.8%), Mizoram (26.2%), Odisha (19%), and Kerala (18.4%). The true indicator that India has reached the fag end of the third wave is reflected in the reduced number of hospitalisations.The waning of the third wave caused by the extremely infectious Omicron variant should be no reason to lull India into complacency. The notion that India\u2019s enhanced surveillance, manpower and infrastructure can \u201cfight any possible COVID-19 waves in the future\u201d not only reeks of overconfidence but is also dangerous. Viruses continuously evolve and what shade and characteristics the next variant will have and the impact it will have even in a population which has a large proportion of people fully vaccinated and/or naturally infected is unknown. Such bravado a year ago before the deadly second wave driven by the Delta variant resulted in a large-scale loss of lives and badly impacted the livelihood of millions in India. As long as the virus is in wide circulation in a large percentage of the world population, India should not lower its guard even when all restrictions to free movement are removed and economic activity is fully restored.",

From James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia hypothesis \u2014 that posited the inter-connectedness of nature \u2014 to Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen, who warned that chemical effluents were altering the planet\u2019s atmosphere and causing harmful climate change feedback effects, many have made the case that humanity is in the Anthropocene era and is like a geological force that is shaping the planet\u2019s destiny. However, this gives the distorted sense that it is a vaguely defined \u2018planet\u2019 that needs protecting, a notion reinforced by apocalyptic documentaries on melting glaciers.\rThe truth is more complex. Man\u2019s embrace of agriculture, the dominance of wheat and rice as food crops and the clearing of forest tracts caused the first major large-scale changes to global climate though their effects were apparent only over centuries. Atmospheric changes due to the dawn of the Industrial Age and the use of fossil fuels happened, relatively speaking, in a blink of an eye. What is common to both these eras is that those who suffered the most are the poor, or those with the least agency to shield themselves from a perturbed nature. Last year, Uttarakhand saw an avalanche of rock and ice destroy two hydropower projects and cause deaths. The geology of the Himalayas, scientists have long warned, makes the region inhospitable to large mega-engineering projects and the several floods, landslides and earthquakes over the years have underlined this time and again. But while the earth rearranges itself, it does so in a manner that can be destructive and lethal to those least responsible for causing the disequilibrium. Thus, if \u201cfragile\u201d were to mean a brittleness needing care, then it is people and animals that need protection than a vaguely defined \u2018planet\u2019. India\u2019s position of climate justice is that it cannot be denied the right to rely on polluting fossil fuel to ameliorate the living conditions of most Indians who have limited access to reliable energy. Thus, India will continue to fire coal plants, raze forests for industry and build roads in fraught geology \u2014 in other words, put the lives of millions of the vulnerable at climate-risk in the pursuit of economic development. India\u2019s commitment to net-zero is set decades into the future at 2070. Unknown unknowns characterise climate science and India, given its size and population, will be disproportionately vulnerable. It must accelerate and prioritise the transition to energy sources that are minimally perturbing to the natural balance because \u2014 and on this the science is certain \u2014 the planet, which may be in a form incomprehensible at present, will long outlast its current residents.",

        "full_article": "(I thank the Search Committee for inviting me, and apologise for not attending due to Covid-related complications.)\nAt the very outset, the government said there was not enough time to make a law for the formation of an Election Commission (EC), which is mandated by the Constitution of Bangladesh since its adoption in 1972. Then suddenly, the government declared that it had enough time to make such a law. Though it is called a law for the \"Appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners\" (original name is in Bangla, abbreviated translation is ours), what it actually does is spell out the formation of a \"Search Committee,\" which will select and recommend to the president who, in his turn, will form the EC in consultation with the prime minister (The president is bound by the constitution to do so). How and why the \"Search Committee\" idea came to the fore when the need was for a law to form the Election Commission itself has never been satisfactorily explained.\nOn the face of it, the Search Committee is trying to find the right team to form the EC. But the underlying significance of their task is that they are laying the foundations for a free and fair parliamentary election to be held in less than two years\u2014by December 2023.\nHowever hard the ruling party supporters may try to whitewash the events surrounding the last general election, serious doubts persist about its authenticity. Because of faulty elections, the prestige of the elected members of parliament (MPs) took a nose dive\u2014and with it the prestige of the parliament itself. This has also made our democracy questionable\u2014to us as well as outside\u2014and clouded our otherwise stunning success in other fields.\nHere, we may recall that under the Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmed-led Election Commission (February 2012 to February 2017), in the 2014 parliamentary election, 153 MPs out of 300 were elected unopposed. This meant that no election took place in more than half of the constituencies in Bangladesh, with the majority of voters not being able to cast their votes. Of equal significance is the fact that the uncontested seats formed the majority in the House and formed the new government\u2014without getting a single vote. So, former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rakibuddin holds the dubious honour of presiding over perhaps the only election ever held in the world where the majority of voters could not cast their votes, and yet the election was certified as completely free and fair.\nOver the years, the political parties' capacity to manipulate elections have grown. With the work of firms like Cambridge Analytica, in Donald Trump's election in 2016 (there must be many others who operate in the shadows and have not been exposed yet. We have no idea what Israel-produced surveillance software like Pegasus\u2014which we are rumoured to have bought\u2014can do), with their data crunching algorithms powerful enough to discern the deepest prejudices in the voters' subconscious and bring them into play in determining how a voter should cast his or her ballot, elections have become more and more about subtle to crude manipulation of the masses, and not the making of an electoral mandate that it once was.\nThis is further exacerbated by the fact that ruling parties in most countries enjoy far greater advantage in manipulating elections than the opposition. Given its control over state media and their cosy relationships with the \"friendly media,\" the capacity of the parties in power to influence public opinion is a thousand times higher compared to their rivals. This they do in many ways: like inaugurating development projects or making extraordinary grants in electorally vulnerable areas before the elections or by instigating divisive ideologies and exploiting ethnic, religious, and racial fault lines to their advantage. With all major institutions of the state\u2014bureaucracy, police, intelligence, local administration\u2014mostly in their total control, and with an enormous source of funds, the ruling parties all over have reduced to a mockery what was meant to be the expression of \"people's will.\"\nProf Ali Riaz, distinguished professor at Illinois State University in the US, in his highly readable column published in this daily on February 16, 2022, talks about hybrid political regimes\u2014meaning political regimes that combine democratic and authoritarian traits\u2014and how they conduct elections. He highlights that such regimes are of two distinct types: competitive electoral authoritarianism, and hegemonic electoral authoritarianism. The major differences between them, he says, is the way they conduct elections. In the former type, while the entire political process is highly repressive and the media are muzzled, the election does engender a type of \"uncertainty\" through some form\u2014however rudimentary\u2014of competition. But in the latter type, that \"uncertainty\" is removed. He quotes from an essay by Steven Levitsky and Lucan A Way titled \"The Rise of Competitive Authoritarianism,\" that in the hegemonic variety of hybrid regimes, \"election manipulation is institutionalised in a manner that competition is rendered useless and removes the uncertainty. The removal of uncertainty is achieved through various measures, including constitutional changes and electoral changes, but it requires the election commission to become a tool that works in unison with other state apparatuses in favour of the incumbent.\"\nIn addition to the authoritarian nature and tendencies of the present ruling party, the status of our elections has been further affected by the main opposition party's utter failure to reorganise itself and regain any place of consequence in the hearts and minds of our voters. BNP's leadership crisis in the form of Khaleda Zia's illness and Vice-Chairman Tareque Rahman's incompetence have further reduced the prospect of any serious challenge for the incumbent.\nIt is against this backdrop of globally shrinking democratic space, the rising tendency of ruling parties to manipulate elections, and Bangladesh's own prospect of graduating to the status of a developing country by 2026 (Covid pushed it back by two years from 2024), that the Search Committee is selecting possible candidates for an Election Commission that will conduct the next election within 22 months.\nThe last factor is important to remember. Graduating to the developing country status will definitely entail higher governance standards and insistence by the global community for more and more democratic practices in the coming years.\nIt is our hope that the Search Committee sees the totality of their task, and does not deal with it as a technical task of fulfilling certain criteria and legal niceties. Being only correct in procedures and not in substance will amount to missing the forest for a few trees. Far greater than the legal, there is an enormous moral task facing the learnt and experienced Search Committee. We hope they will not forget for a moment that their few weeks of work will either be a boon or a curse for our nation and democracy for the next five significant years.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Renowned novelist Selina Hossain, after retiring as the director of the Bangla Academy, has recently been reappointed as its chairperson. In a conversation with Emran Mahfuz of The Daily Star, she talks about the academy, the Ekushey Book Fair, society, culture and more.\nYou retired as a director of the Bangla Academy, then returned as its chairperson. How do you feel about this transition?\nBangla Academy is quite close to my heart. I am very delighted today. I joined the institution on July 2, 1970. Around the same time, I also got an interview call from the Public Service Commission to join the MC College in Sylhet. There, the salary would have been Tk 450. But I was waiting to get an offer from the Bangla Academy, which I did. As a research assistant, my salary was Tk 250, but the financial aspect was not a concern for me.\nI have always tried to embody my beloved Bangla Academy. I developed my literary perspective after joining this institution. It became my preferred outlet for literary exercises, where I got a lot of opportunities to spend time writing and editing. This is how the academy gave me a sense of fulfilment.\nHow long have you been with the Bangla Academy?\nBefore retiring in 2004, I had worked there for 34 years. After receiving my postgraduate degree from Rajshahi University in 1968, I arrived in Dhaka the following year. I saw a newspaper advertisement and applied for the job at the academy.\nBangla Academy was founded with an objective to intellectually develop and uplift the nation. To what extent do you think this objective has been fulfilled?\nSince its inception in 1955, the Bangla Academy has been working with this objective in mind. The academy's first initiative was the dictionary project. Once that was completed, Muhammad Shahidullah edited the Ancholik Bhashar Abhidhan (dictionary of regional dialects). He compiled words from different districts in it, which helped open up brand new avenues. Subsequent generations are now getting the opportunity of expanding their linguistic knowledge with these dictionaries.\nWhen I was at Bangla Academy previously, I assumed the responsibility of editing Nazrul's work, with Prof Anisuzzaman working as the chief editor. Later on, I took on the responsibility of publishing the science encyclopaedia and biographical dictionary (Charitabhidhan).\nA lot of literary works were published during your tenure, but the flow seems to have slowed down since then. Many legendary works still remain unpublished. What could be the reason behind this?\nMany did not follow in my footsteps at Bangla Academy. In my years at the compilation sub-committee, I would never have allowed the funding to be returned to the ministry in June. My view was that the fund was allocated so that our writers, researchers and publishers could benefit from it. So why should it go back to the ministry? Hence, I would work all year round at formidable speed to ensure that the fund was used up before June. However, many do not hold the same point of view now, which is why the flow of publication has slowed down.\nThe Bangla Academy Awards generate a lot of interest as well as controversy. What is the authors selection criteria for the awards?\nA committee is formed and nomination forms are sent to 30-35 people. They each nominate individuals and from there, the committee decides on its picks. The committee only elects deserving nominees from within the sphere of art and literature, and their choices are ubiquitously accepted by the academy. Bangla Academy is more than a mere building; it is made up of people working together who are spiritually and intellectually connected.\nA part of the Bangla Academy works dedicatedly for the Ekushey Book Fair for two to three months. Do you think relieving them of this task would ensure a higher amount of research and development from them\u2014and for the academy, by extension?\nNo, a month or two is not that significant a length of time. The Ekushey Book Fair is a crucial part of our history and tradition, which we must put effort into. Individuals dedicated to the book fair belong to the relevant department, so they are merely fulfilling their duty. This does not hamper the academy's overall work. In fact, it inspires all of us and is a great way of ushering in new readers.\nThe book fair has strong ties with the month of February, but last year we could not maintain this synchronicity. What are your thoughts about organising the Ekushey Book Fair in February?\nI am absolutely in favour of the book fair being held in February. But it is also a challenge to maintain health guidelines and hold the book fair amid the Covid pandemic. Besides, the need for the public to abide by health guidelines is not something that can be, or should be, ignored.\nLast year, publishers participated in the Ekushey Book Fair and incurred losses. They asked for compensation, but the state's response was lukewarm. What are your thoughts on this?\nSupport from the state in this regard would have been ideal, and it is something which needs to increase in the future. The book fair is an essential part of the nation's art and literature sphere. It is the state's responsibility to support such initiatives, and it would have pleased me if they had done so last year.\nDuring this online era, e-books are in vogue and the number of printed magazines and books are going down as well. What has been your observation regarding this?\nWe are seeing a variation among readers. It is inevitable, because different steps are being taken in different directions and as a whole, society is advancing. We have to evolve to keep up with it.\nEvery year, you publish your own books. Have their sales increased or decreased?\nThe sales have increased a lot. I am happy with the readership of my books.\nLibraries play a vital role in creating new readers. For the last 10 or 15 years, there has been a demand for higher salaries for librarians. Instead, the budget allocated for them has been curtailed.\nLibraries not only create readers; they also enrich their minds. Supporting libraries is part of the government's moral duties. This can create a place for dispensing social values among the people, and avid readers can influence those around them to also take up reading. Thus, funds for libraries should not be curtailed, but should be distributed freely by the state in order to cultivate readers.\nYou have written novels on the Language Movement and the Liberation War. How far do you think we have advanced in terms of socio-cultural aspects?\nWe have come a long way. This advancement has enriched our world of art, literature and culture, and we have secured a distinct position in the global arena. The Bengali nation and Bangla speakers have also advanced accordingly.\nDuring your tenure, three volumes of Abul Mansur Ahmad's complete works were published. What is your evaluation of his literature?\nI liked Abul Mansur Ahmad's work very much. I was awestruck by how, through his writing, he transformed the natural state of society into a transparent and surreal space of knowledge, which aided our generation in bettering itself.\nWhenever we discuss culture, people often point their fingers at women's attire. Does this mean that only women embody culture in their attire? Why is no one equally concerned about men's attire?\nNo, this is not right. Men and women need to uphold our culture collaboratively. We have to keep in mind that society will not advance by any individual's efforts alone.\n\u00a0\nThis interview has been translated from Bangla by Mohammed Ishtiaque Khan.\n",

        "full_article": "Recently, I was chatting with a young friend. She mentioned that, with all the Covid lockdowns (she is in a country much harder hit than Bangladesh), she has learnt to do business online, selling herself as a yoga and meditation instructor. As the conversation continued, she explained that she was making more money doing online work than she previously had working for a major corporation, despite now putting in far fewer hours. \"Everyone should learn to do this,\" she told me. \"People think they need jobs, but this is actually a better way to make money.\" The trick, she explained, was to \"learn to commodify yourself.\"\nI confess, I was horrified. The idea that a bright young woman with many skills and talents would see herself as an object to be sold online was dispiriting and dehumanising. I also found her confidence that others could learn to do the same, and make good money that way, a bit delusional\u2014her failure to recognise just how extremely exceptional she is.\nBoth issues are a problem. It is a problem that we assume that virtually everyone has a tiny entrepreneur inside of them, just waiting for an opportunity to reveal themselves.\nIt is also a problem that people, especially the youth, must now find ways to market themselves, not in terms of finding a regular job\u2014which is growing ever harder in the gig economy\u2014but in becoming something to sell online, like any other product.\nMore recently, I spoke with a young Bangladeshi man. I knew he enjoyed body-building; I assumed it was a passion of his. Well, perhaps it is, but as he explained, there are also possibilities of \"selling himself\" online as a fitness instructor. Like my other young friend, he saw no hope in the job market; the only way to earn money is to find a way to turn yourself into a desirable commodity.\nAlthough it was an awfully long time ago, when I try to remember how I felt about the job market when I was in university or in my early 20s, it feels like the difference is huge and cannot simply be explained by my having been in the US rather than Bangladesh. After all, there, too, people are turning to other ways to earn a living, leaving traditional jobs.\nThen again, perhaps the difference isn't as great as I would like to believe. I am from a generation that still believed in getting hired. We felt free to pursue degrees in the liberal arts or science\u2014not just accounting and business. But\u2014at least as women\u2014we did feel the need, or at least the pressure, to package ourselves into something sufficiently attractive to appeal to both potential bosses and spouses. Our self-worth, as women, was too often defined by our outward appearance, not our inward traits, skills, talents, intelligence or abilities.\nSo yes, as a society, we have failed our young people in terms of creating job opportunities for them. Clearly many of them are finding ways to earn money in new ways by offering goods or services online. Perhaps all of this is natural and inevitable, especially in a world where we don't work to address inequality, where we fail to address the way that the very rich siphon off most of the wealth, and thus much of the population must struggle to get by.\nBut we also continue to fail our young people by sending the message that who you are is less important than how you look.\nAnd when the need to earn money becomes an occasion for seeing yourself as something to offer up for sale, I cannot help but feel that our humanity is being chipped away.\n\u00a0\nDebra Efroymson is the executive director of the Institute of Wellbeing, Bangladesh, and author of \"Beyond Apologies: Defining and Achieving an Economics of Wellbeing.\"\n",

        "full_article": "Inflation in Bangladesh, like the nation itself, is on the rise. The per capita income saw an 11 percent rise to USD 2,591, from an estimated USD 2,554 for 2020-21 fiscal year. But at the same time, inflation spiked from 5.29 percent in December 2020 to 6.05 percent in December 2021, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Non-food inflation reached a six-year high in December 2021, at seven percent, followed by a hike of diesel and kerosene prices in November. The skyrocketing prices of essentials have put the common people\u2014middle-income, lower-middle-income and low-income groups, as well as the new poor\u2014in a tight spot, significantly curtailing their ability to cover their monthly essential expenses.\nIn the midst of an ongoing nightmare for the majority of the population, there are talks of utility prices going up a few notches again, especially in view of rising prices in the international market. Petrobangla has sent a proposal to Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) to increase gas retail prices by nearly 100 percent, while Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd (Bapex) has suggested a 48 percent hike. If the Petrobangla proposal is approved, consumers will have to pay about Tk 20 per cubic metre of gas, as opposed to the current price at Tk 9.80.\nMeanwhile, the Dhaka Wasa recently proposed a 20 percent hike in water tariff to meet the gap between production costs and the price of water. If approved, the hike will be effective from July 1, 2022.\nThe hike of essential prices is a cause for concern, but what is even more worrying is the rise of utility prices, as the impact of these price hikes cascades down to every sphere of life\u2014from basic utility bills one has to pay, to the production cost of locally manufactured goods, to import costs, to prices of food items in the kitchen markets, to transportation costs. They will create a ripple effect across the economy, exacerbating public suffering.\nThe government is also apparently in a dilemma over increasing fertiliser prices, which will have a direct impact on food inflation and the livelihoods of farmers.\nBut how can we wade through this crisis?\n\"In view of the current reality of this commodity price shock hitting us in the midst of a pandemic, there are four aspects to consider,\" said former World Bank lead economist Dr Zahid Hussain, while discussing solutions with this writer. \"First of all, the government needs to assess whether it will pass on the additional expense to the people or finance it itself. Secondly, if the government decides to adjust commodity prices, then we would need to look at how the adjustment would be done: what the formula is and if the adjustment would be in line with the international rates. There should be complete transparency in this. Third, with regards to petroleum prices especially, in the past when fuel price was lower in the international market, the prices were not realigned in Bangladesh, with the justification that the BPC could utilise the opportunity to recover the losses it had shouldered in the past. If that is the case, the BPC should now be in a position to cushion this current shock.\n\"Finally, the government needs to focus on subsidy prioritisation. It needs to look at the areas where subsidy is benefitting the masses, and where subsidy is benefitting certain groups. For instance, at the onset of the pandemic, the government allocated a stimulus package of Tk 40,000 crore for large industries and the service sector, to be disbursed by the commercial banks as working capital loans at nine percent interest rate, of which 4.5 percent was shouldered by the beneficiaries, and the remaining 4.5 percent by the government as subsidy. In the context of the current rebound of the economy, the government can now reassess the impact and necessity of this 4.5 percent subsidy on stimulus packages for the large industries, and if deemed appropriate, channel some of the funds to cover the price increase of commodities,\" he said.\nMoreover, before considering commodity price adjustment, the government needs to address the system losses in the utility sector and root out irregularities that this particular sector is so well-known for. In addition, the government should also look into the power overcapacity problem, which is draining money. According to media reports, in 2020-21, about 60 percent of the installed capacity remained unutilised, leading to an avoidable expense of Tk 13,200 crore, which had to be paid to the rental power plants as capacity charge. If anything, this is an example of reckless mismanagement of public money and resources.\nGiven the current scenario\u2014where the lines are only getting longer in front of the TCB trucks selling essentials at discounted prices\u2014the policymakers, the bureaucrats and the relevant stakeholders, including the economists, need to come together and consider all options possible to make the situation bearable for the common people. We do not want our people to resort to desperate measures to make ends meet.\nThe pandemic has not only claimed lives directly, but has also pushed some to take their own lives in desperation, as they failed to provide for their loved ones. One would remember the case of 26-year-old Khokon Hossain from Rajshahi, who committed suicide in July last year after losing his job during the lockdown. There are many like Khokon Hossain who are finding it increasingly difficult to survive in these trying times. Amid all these, the government cannot and should not make the people more vulnerable by exposing them to higher inflation.\nThis is an issue that the government and policymakers need to take seriously. The people cannot be hung out to dry.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for The Daily Star. Her Twitter handle is\u00a0@tasneem_tayeb\n",

When you have a fire caused by highly flammable substances stored in residential houses, with families living on other floors, it is not an \"accident\"\u2014it's a sure recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, this has been going on for long, and the high-level promise of relocation of chemical stores and plastic factories to a designated place after the Nimtoli fire\u2014which killed at least 124 people on June 3, 2010\u2014remains unmet even after all these years. A survey done in 2019 by Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) identified 1,924 chemical warehouses in Old Dhaka, with 98 percent being \"moderately risky.\"\nClearly, Old Dhaka is sitting on a ticking time bomb. After the 2010 fire, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) drafted a plan on relocating the chemical warehouses. However, the BSCIC took eight years to take up the project. The decision was to shift chemical businesses to the city's outskirts in Keraniganj. However, after another devastating fire in Chawkbazar's Churihatta area in February 2019, which killed 71 people, the authorities decided to shift the project site to Munshiganj's Sirajdikhan area. Reportedly, it was scheduled to be completed by June this year, but it appears that the officials would need an extension of at least one more year.\nOfficials blame delays in selecting the relocation site and land acquisition for this situation. When contacted, the project director said that 70 percent of the project's 310-acre land development is complete. Other important work like the construction of a drainage system, boundary walls, fire station, a Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and two jetties have not started yet. Also, a separate relocation project for plastic industries, also in Munshiganj, has seen only 1.47 percent progress so far. This extremely slow pace of work is distressing, to say the least.\nMeanwhile, the government had a plan to build two temporary sites in Tongi and Shyampur for the warehouses and factories, but it could not be executed either. We urge the government to realise the urgency of relocation on a permanent basis and expedite the work accordingly. There has been enough dilly-dallying with the experiment of temporary sites which, as an environmental expert said, is nothing but \"a mockery with the lives of people.\" The BSCIC's shambolic efforts and foot-dragging in executing the project are inexcusable. Old Dhaka residents deserve better.\n",

        "full_article": "We are worried to notice the upward trend of the prices of Ramadan essentials well ahead of the start of the holy month. According to a report in this daily on February 17, 2022, the prices of Ramadan essentials such as edible oil, chickpea, dried pea, date and sugar have already started to rise in the market, despite being well-supplied. Traders and importers, however, are blaming the high costs of import for the hike. Reportedly, prices of all these commodities have increased in the global market due to lower production in the exporting countries, while the shipping costs have also increased.\nAccording to data from the Chattogram Custom House, between December 2021 and January 2022, the import cost of palm oil, soybean oil, sugar, chickpea and other commodities have significantly increased. However, the data also shows that import of all these items has also increased during this time, except for the edible oil. For instance, between July 2021 and January 2022, about 144,000 tonnes of chickpea and around 305,000 tonnes of dried pea were imported. A year earlier, their imported quantities were 133,000 tonnes and 292,000 tonnes, respectively. The import of sugar also increased by 3.4 percent during this time. This means that there is an ample stock of these items in the wholesale market.\nBecause of the supplies, it is expected that wholesalers will sell their products at fair prices to the retailers, and retailers will not unnecessarily raise the prices during Ramadan. Because doing so would put an extra burden on people, especially those in the lower-income bracket, who already have their backs against the wall. Having failed to sustain their pre-pandemic income level, with lost jobs and steady source of income, many have been forced to compromise on their standard of living. The rising prices of daily essentials\u2014such as rice, oil, lentils, vegetables, meat and fish\u2014have already made their lives difficult. Now, if the prices rise again during Ramadan, how will they survive?\nTherefore, it's time for the government to come up with some pro-people policies to help the low- and fixed-income people survive through this tough time. It needs to ensure market stability by establishing proper monitoring mechanisms. Fixing the prices of daily necessities and hanging up the price chart at every wholesale and retail market can prevent the traders from overcharging the consumers. The government also needs to make sure that unscrupulous syndicates cannot raise prices of food items by hoarding them before and during Ramadan. We believe it is definitely possible for a proactive government to prevent traders from unnecessarily increasing the prices of essentials.\n",
