The trial was shrouded in secrecy, with scant information on the charges and evidence against the former Indian Navy servicemen, arrested in August 2022. Despite pleas from their families and Indian diplomats in Doha, Qatar has not explained why it has not divulged details of the case. Even the judgment has yet to be shared with New Delhi. Leaked reports suggest that the men have been accused of sharing secret information pertaining to the stealth submarine programme they worked on, with a third country, a charge their families have denied. Visits by Indian officials to Qatar to plead for leniency and transparency have been of no avail. While this case has some parallels to the case of former Naval Commander Jadhav, who is on death row too in Pakistan, the difference is that India\u2019s ties with Qatar have been relatively better. Apart from strategic and defence cooperation agreements, India sources 40% of its LNG needs from Qatar. India is also Qatar\u2019s third biggest source of imports, particularly raw materials for construction and fresh food items. Pertinently, these supplies continued despite the Gulf blockade against Qatar in 2017, which should have counted for some goodwill towards India. In addition, 7,00,000 Indian expatriates are an integral part of Qatar\u2019s institutions, industry and workforce. A rift in ties, which a sentence like this is bound to engender, will be to the detriment of both countries, and India must make this clear to Qatar.The government must waste no time in charting the next steps to ensure the Indians are given the best possible support in an appeal. Apart from the legal appeals process and diplomatic legwork, channels to the Qatari leadership should be activated at the highest levels, including the Prime Minister if necessary. A case must be made for clemency and commuting the sentences to jail terms that could even be served out in India if the men are indeed found guilty in the appeals process. Notwithstanding reports that seek to tie the verdict to more geopolitical considerations, including perceived Qatari differences with India over its policy on Israel and Palestine in the current conflict, the government must demonstrate that the lives of the men are indeed a priority for their country and for a government that claims a policy of \u201cno Indian left behind\u201d. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nQatar\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\ndeath penalty policies\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\ndefence equipment\n\n/\n\noil and gas - upstream activities\n\n/\n\nlabour\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi",

        "full_article": "Six years ago, Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and three-time Prime Minister, was ousted from power after he fell out with the powerful military establishment. In the subsequent election, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of Imran Khan, then a \u201cdarling\u201d of the establishment, was voted to power. Mr. Sharif was disqualified and jailed while his party accused the military of rigging the election in favour of the PTI. In 2019, he went into exile in London. Four years later, the situation has changed dramatically. Mr. Khan, who was ousted from power last year, is now in jail and a critic of the military, and Mr. Sharif, once a foe of the generals, returned last week amid fanfare, with thousands of his supporters chanting at a rally, \u2018Take charge again, save Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif.\u2019 Pakistan is no stranger to such political somersaults, where politicians join hands with the generals to tackle their opponents and make their path to power smoother, only to be laid down by the military. Mr. Sharif himself has done this thrice. So, Pakistan is back to the past when Mr. Sharif returns to the country, probably in an understanding with the generals, ahead of the general elections. He wants power and the generals want to sideline their new foe, Mr. Khan, and dismantle his party. It is a marriage of convenience.After his ouster, Mr. Khan launched a frontal attack on the PML-N and the military. The establishment, along with the post-Khan coalition government that was headed by Mr. Sharif\u2019s younger brother Shehbaz Sharif, responded with a massive crackdown on the PTI. But the military\u2019s witch-hunt has only made Mr. Khan more popular. On the other side, the PML-N, Mr. Khan\u2019s main political rival, was grappling with internal divisions and external challenges. The party now hopes that the charismatic elder Sharif, who is popular among its conservative base and influential among Punjab\u2019s wealthy business establishment, revives the PML-N ahead of the elections. For Mr. Sharif, the support of the generals is necessary to vacate the cases he faces and have his disqualification lifted. But the road ahead is tough. There is a groundswell of anger against the PML-N under whose watch the economic situation has deteriorated, with hyperinflation, joblessness, a tanking rupee and a looming balance of payment crisis. To overcome these challenges and defeat Imran Khan, Mr. Sharif would need the blessings of, if not active support from, the generals, which in turn would weaken the civilian institutions and strengthen the hands of the military. And his own record suggests that Mr. Sharif does not get along with the generals after the honeymoon period. This is the cyclical tragedy Pakistan finds itself within. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\narrest\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nunemployment\n\n/\n\nbusiness (general)",

        "full_article": "A Qatari court handing down the death sentence to eight former Indian navy personnel is a huge foreign policy challenge for India. More so, because the verdict, after in-camera trial, comes at a delicate geopolitical moment in the Middle East. The precise nature of the charges against the Indian nationals remains unknown: various news reports suggest that they were arrested for allegedly leaking classified information related to a high-value Qatari submarine project. The Indians were associated with a defence services company working with the Qatari navy. There is also speculation in some news reports that the receiver of the classified information was Israel. That the whole trial was held in secrecy and that the precise nature of charges is not yet known make the death sentence appear very dubious.\n\nThis is a particularly tricky case for India not only because of the possibility that Qataris have levelled espionage charges against its citizens but also because this is happening in a Gulf state where India has invested a lot to improve bilateral relations, which have been on the upswingover the last two decades. The upgrade in India-Qatar relations has virtually coincided with Doha\u2019s own growing ambitions in the Middle East and India\u2019s greater engagement with other Gulf states. Qatar punches well above its weight in regional stakes, as was exemplified by its resilience during the Saudi Arabia-led blockade against it between 2017-21. Qatar also hosts a plethora of opposition and militant movement leaders from the Islamic world, including from Palestinian Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, and Taliban. It houses American and Turkish militarybases and simultaneously has a working relationship with Iran. In government-owned Al Jazeera broadcaster, Doha has an opinion-influencer in the region. Behind all this is, of course, Doha\u2019s gas-fuelled financial muscle. India is one of the largest importers of Qatari gas, and 800,000 Indians live and work in Qatar.\nWhat this means is that New Delhi has to tread very carefully as it tries to help the ex-navy personnel. The added complication is regional intrigue between Gulf states, including different approaches to Israel. This may make India\u2019s outreach even more knotty.\n\n",

He has been identified as a US army reservist suffering mental health issues and a firearms instructor who had threatened to \u2018shoot up\u2019 a National Guard base. He should not have had access to guns. But in the state of Maine, gun rights advocates are a powerful political force who veto all gun control. The more America has debated this, the more gun lobbyists in Maine have dug their heels in. So, carrying concealed weapons without a permit is allowed in a state that just witnessed a mass shooting.\n\nGuns are the leading cause of death among American children and teens. That there is still an acute Republican-Democrat divide on this issue speaks to a larger dysfunction in US politics. This is happening in rich and poor countries across the world. Choosing a side in a policy debate has become like choosing a side in a war, with compromise impossible, facts buried by \u2018loyalty\u2019. Political parties feed the \u2018us vs them\u2019 tribalism.\nThe core of polarisation is demonisation of opponents. That kills all efforts at intelligent compromise, through which most political solutions are found. Conversations laced with ad hominem attacks crowd out non-extreme voices. A Turkey survey found that seven out of 10 people do not want their child to play with the child of someone who votes for the \u2018other\u2019 party or to do business with such a person. Any polity riven by such personalised political differences has a deeply impaired capacity to act in its rational, collective selfinterest. Top political leaderships can most directly dial back this destructive acrimony. Unfortunately, they have mostly excelled at destroying common grounds so far, weakening various democratic guardrails and institutions. The dead bodies in Maine are just the latest ghastly image of how much such runaway polarisation is costing countries and citizens.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Though the Chinese market for mango and other tropical fruits from Bangladesh is an emerging one, yet the growth of especially mango export saw a sharp rise from a mere 310 tonnes in FY 2018-19 to 1,757 tonnes in FY 2021-22. But this highly potential farm-product market of Bangladesh is also facing risks as Beijing has reportedly asked Dhaka to take urgent measures to remove pests from mangoes before exporting those to China. As Bangladesh's exports are in desperate need to diversify, the government agencies concerned should be very proactive in responding to any query or complaint about the items for export coming from the prospective importing country in question. It is more so, given the highly competitive market. But to all appearances, the expected alacrity is not being demonstrated by the Bangladesh side. It may be recalled in this connection that in 2021 the General Administration of China Customs (GACC), the Chinese customs authority, gave the green signal that it would import six agricultural products including mango, jackfruit, guava, potato, soya meal and aromatic rice from Bangladesh. As required by the GACC, in 2022, Bangladesh's diplomatic mission in that country also submitted to it (GACC), a report prepared by the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) on Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) for mango. Notably, in its feedback on the PRA from DAE, the GACC did indicate some 13 types of pest that could enter China along with the exported mango. Needless to say, it was a matter of high priority on the part of DAE to take prompt measures to free the mangoes from the pests as noted by GACC before their export to China. The Bangladesh mission in China did also send a letter to this effect pointing out the urgency of the issue to the DAE. Though the DAE's prompt response in this regard is crucial for obtaining the necessary clearance from the Chinese authority concerned for exporting mango there, it has not been forthcoming so far. This is unfortunate. For it is not just about only a single exportable, but here is at stake a whole range of farm products from Bangladesh that China had earlier showed eagerness to import. The local exporters or responsible government bodies need to be extra-sensitive about any inquiry or critical input coming from that market. It would be worthwhile to recall that in 2020, China banned the import of fishery products such as live crab and eel from Bangladesh as those contained harmful bacteria. That was undoubtedly embarrassing for Bangladesh as it has long and warm diplomatic relations with China. It is also not the only instance of such laxity or delinquency on the part of a section of exporters from Bangladesh. Moreover, it is also due to such wrongful business practice that in the past Bangladesh lost its overseas shrimp market. In that case, any repeat of any unprofessionalism or lackadaisical attitude from responsible government agencies or delinquency of exporters may leave an irreversibly negative impact on the prospect of accessing potential emerging markets for Bangladeshi products abroad. So, the government's agricultural research body concerned should waste no further time in responding to the queries from Chinese importing authorities about the presence of pests in mango and other farm products from Bangladesh. A prompt step is vital for increasing Bangladesh's export to China, if only for reducing the ever-widening trade gap with that country.",

        "full_article": "The World Food Programme (WFP) carried out a survey on food security over a four-month period (May - August, 2023) titled 'Remote Household Food Security Survey' to find out the impact of the monsoon season on food supplies and the findings are rather alarming. It has found that food security has been adversely affected by recurrent natural disasters during the monsoon season. Indeed, food security varies across divisions, population and climate hotspots. It is concerning that about 24 per cent households were found to be food-insecure on an average in August. The impact of El Nino was felt throughout the country with delayed rainfall and more heat waves in Chattogram and Sylhet divisions. There were heat waves in Rajshahi and across the country, natural disasters like cyclones and landslides occurred.The worse affected were female-headed households with disabilities, generally constituting the lower income group. The survey revealed the 47 per cent of this group was food-insecure compared to 9.0 per cent in medium-income households and less than 3.0 per cent in high-income households. The biggest shock came from high food prices, impact of disasters and loss of income. Seventy-one per cent of households surveyed expressed anxiety over sustained high food prices.These shocks have resulted in many households living on credit for the purpose of purchasing food and other essential items. Their number increased to 46 per cent in August compared with 32 per cent of households in May. Naturally lower-income group suffered the most from food insecurity. A look at the division-wise data shows that Chattogram suffered the most with 58 per cent, Sylhet division with 53 per cent where low-income households took the brunt of the impact.Looking at the broader picture, three out 10 households (30 per cent) were hard pressed to provide adequate diets to family members. On an average, 70 per cent of households across eight divisions had \"acceptable diet\". Again, 74 per cent of households also stated that they were buying small quantities of food and generally avoiding expensive food from the market. Overall, micronutrient-rich food decreased for all households over the last quarter. What is of concern is that a large percentage of households from high and middle-income group households relied on emergency coping mechanisms that included \"purchasing food on credit, selling productive asset lands, and spending savings. Negative coping has been observed for a long time spiking in April and increasing until August.\" Income instability has had a big impact on food-based coping strategies to varying degrees but the hardest hit naturally were low-income groups in society.Food inflation is at an all time high. Month-on-month prices of essential food commodities like lentils, wheat, poultry, egg, chili, garlic have taken the wind out of consumers over the last six months. Households have complained about loss of income / employment and rise in health expenditure - both of which have negatively impacted food intake. Expenditures by poor households increased across most divisions, especially for food, health and education coupled with reported loss of employment (31 per cent). Over the March-August period, 45 respondents reported a fall in income and only six per cent stated an increase. Low-income group members who are overly dependent on agriculture and petty trading were the hardest hit. Bangladesh is not an island. The present global hunger and malnutrition problems have been compounded by multiple factors. The WFP estimates that more than 345 million in 79 countries \"are facing acute levels of food insecurity in 2023, and do not know where their next meal is coming from. That is more than double the number in 2020. This constitutes a staggering rise of 200 million people compared to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels.\" Climate shocks that have happened globally, including Bangladesh, leave behind destroyed crops and livelihoods which inevitably undercut people's ability to feed themselves. As with all natural disasters, agricultural activities are always severely impacted. There is a need to bolster early warning systems and increasing community trust in such systems. Data show that only half the populace recognises its vulnerability to floods and only a third receives timely alerts. Mitigation tactics, such as elevated households need to be promoted as viable resilient housing. Looking beyond physical safety, there is also the question of financial challenges. Resilience in this area points to developing diverse livelihood strategies. This is easier said than done of course. The manner in which the populace has been pummelled by skyrocketing prices has been relentless and most punishing. The administration needs to work out better delivery mechanisms to ensure that food and cash packages reach the affected low-income groups.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Compensating damage or loss is not always possible by providing cash to the victims. Some injuries are irreparable, and some losses are non-compensable. It is not possible to compensate for the loss of life caused by the carelessness of some agency or the irresponsibility of some authority. Nevertheless, there is a practice of paying some compensation to the immediate family members of any such victim. In many cases, governments in Bangladesh and many other countries of the world are accustomed to spending some money as compensation for persons who died or were injured in different accidents in factories or workplaces or some other incidents. Victims of road accidents are a new addition to the list in Bangladesh. From now on, victims of road accidents will get a tiny amount of monetary compensation. Initially, some 162 road accident victims or their families will receive a total compensation of Tk 70.8 million. If a person is killed due to reckless or negligent driving on the road, his or her family is entitled to get Tk 0.50 million. Those who have lost a limb or suffered other forms of life-changing injuries will receive Tk 0.30 million each. Accident victims likely to recover and return to normal life are also eligible to receive Tk 0.10 million.The compensation package and mechanism are being determined under the Road Transport Act-2018. However, it took five years for the authorities to devise the method where a 12-member trustee board is responsible for determining the compensation amount. To get compensation, the victims or their family members must apply to the board within 30 days of the accident. After receiving the applications, a probe committee will be formed in 10 days, and the committee has to submit its report within the next 30 days. Based on the report, the trustee board will decide whether to pay any compensation or not.The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has also created a compensation fund. So far, the government hasn't contributed to the fund, and there is no provision in the budget in this regard. Currently, the authority collects subscriptions from the transport owners to issue and re-issue driving licences and route permits. Around Tk 1.0 billion has already been collected by the BRTA in this connection. A portion of money collected by the police and executive magistrates as a penalty under the road safety act is yet to be deposited to the fund. Again, neither the transport owners' nor the transport workers' associations pay any amount as their due contribution to the fund.Thus, arranging and managing the compensation fund becomes a big challenge for the authorities. If the government and other stakeholders do not contribute adequately, the existing fund will dry up soon. It isn't easy to understand why the government is not contributing to the fund and asking the transport owners' and workers' associations to pay their dues. An estimate showed that it required at least Tk 4.0 billion to compensate all the victims of road accidents that took place in the country last year. According to the BRTA, some 4,638 people died and 4,648 were injured due to road accidents last year. The current size of the fund is around Tk 1.50 billion, which is well short of paying the compensation to all. The authority may, however, think that all the victims will not seek compensation and there is also no assurance that all those who apply get compensation. This may happen because of ignorance on the part of deserving claimants or non-cooperation from the authority. So, organisations working for road safety and passengers' welfare need to step up and assist the victims and their families to claim the financial support. The authorities also need to extend adequate assistance in this regard. Though the amount of compensation is paltry, as an introductory measure, it is welcome. The government, however, needs to review the whole thing after having feedbacks from different stakeholders and enhance the amount. Moreover, introduction of road accident insurance-coverage in the near future should be considered.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
