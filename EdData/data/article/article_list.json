Andrej Babis, the millionaire Czech Prime Minister, had expressed his desire to create a business environment in the country where \"entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.\" Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018 had told the BBC, \"Every public servant's assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask, what is legitimate?... If you can't explain yourself, including myself, then I have a case to answer.\"\nThese same leaders are now at the centre of the Pandora Papers scandal.\nSo, how come these prominent world leaders\u2014many of whom have advocated for stricter tax rules and punishment for tax dodgers\u2014find themselves embroiled in a scam like this? The answer perhaps lies in the fact that these leaders themselves are involved in the making of such laws.\nPandora Papers could be the largest such revelation, but it is not the first one. There had been LuxLeaks in 2014, Panama Papers in 2016, Paradise Papers in 2017 and FinCen files in 2020. While there have been some positive result of these exposures connecting influential national leaders, politicians, businesspersons and celebrities with the shadow economy\u2014former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had been disqualified from office by a Supreme Court verdict in the aftermath of the Panama Papers leak\u2014the shadow economy continues to operate smoothly with the blessings of its beneficiaries.\nThe reason being, the people who are responsible for safeguarding the money of the common people are making personal gains at their expense. These people hire expert tax lawyers who are well versed in manipulating the loopholes in the existing system and allow their clients to circumvent the rules\u2014all at the expense of the common people's interest.\nFor instance, Tony Blair and his wife brought a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company, through which they became owners of a Victorian building worth USD 8.8 million. This enabled the couple to evade paying a property tax of more than USD 400,000. The building currently houses the law firm of Tony Blair's wife.\nSimilarly, while on the one hand the Lebanese people are struggling to cope with one of the worst economic meltdowns in recent history\u2014with stores shutting down and people not being able to buy the daily essentials because of a sharp spike in inflation\u2014the current Lebanese Prime Minister, his predecessor, the country's former minister of state and the chairman of\u00a0 Al Mawarid Bank, have all been linked to offshore wealth.\nOn the one hand, these revelations expose the sheer apathy of the politicians towards the interests of the common people who elect them to power. On the other, they also raise questions about the system that allows these individuals to get away with amassing illegal wealth while the people suffer. And they can do it because they have the money and the means to access expensive lawyers and their unethical services.\nThese revelations have become a norm now\u2014more like a leitmotif in a drama. It is the same plot, the same cast, the same act and the same scenes playing out again and again with no result.\nWhen the revelations of the global shadow economy began to unfold in 2014, governments around the world promised to take strong measures to stop the practice of hiding disclosed wealth by the rich and the influential though offshore investment mechanisms. Unfortunately, not much has changed today.\nWhile offshore investment is not illegal itself, using this mechanism to hide illegally amassed wealth and or evade taxation is. But this practice continues\u2014the repeated failed attempts by journalists and investigators to break this system only reveal the strength of the underground economy that is growing in size. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimate, the volume of money laundering every year is around two to five percent of the global economy\u2014or about 800 billion to two trillion in US dollars.\nAnd the volume of this will increase, unless world leaders see the folly of their actions and acknowledge their role in nurturing it. Those who are involved in illegal offshore financial transactions should acknowledge their misdeeds and step down.\nThe Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an inter-government body with 39 members, responsible for developing standards for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT); and United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) should be empowered and strengthened so that they can continue to fight against the financial crimes of the political elites by formulating policies and standards to make money laundering more difficult.\nThe US banks and financial institutions also have a major role to play here, since the majority of these transactions are carried out in US dollars. \"Because of the US dollar's status as the de facto global currency, most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations\", the ICIJ report mentioned.\nWhile the US has over the years coerced other banks, especially the Swiss banks, to disclose the names of US nationals involved in wealth hiding through offshore accounts, the US itself is rather unwilling to share \"information about money moving through US bank accounts, companies and trusts\u2026 The US has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions, including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners' assets,\" the ICIJ report added.\nThis attitude of the US is also a hindrance in addressing the issue of illegal offshore investments. Many US States, including South Dakota and Nevada, have emerged as major destinations for hiding illegal wealth\u2014in South Dakota alone, assets in trusts have increased four times to USD 360 billion in the last 10 years, according to ICIJ. This is hurting the global economy and in the long-run will be harmful for the US economy itself.\nBy dismantling this system, the US can contribute significantly in curbing the illicit flow of money through offshore account transactions, and as an international power, it should prioritise global interests over national gains though illegal means.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the international community together has a role to play in curbing illegal offshore investments, the common people should also wake up to the stark reality of the corruption and financial crimes of their leaders and raise their voices for justice. They must also create pressure from the bottom to end this economic and social injustice that continues to plague economies. In the long-run, this will yield disastrous consequences for both the culprits and the victims. Such an outcome would not be palatable for any party involved.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star. Her Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "At the end of this month, the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), under the presidency of the United Kingdom, will begin. This time round, expectations are high that something must be done to improve on the commitments made by governments at Paris COP21 in 2015.\u00a0\nOn September 28, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg threw down the gauntlet to world leaders and the media in her opening speech to the Youth4Climate summit in Milan: \"We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah blah blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action.\"\nClimate action optimists welcome US President Biden's commitment to double US aid to developing countries on climate action. Chinese President Xi agreed to stop financing new coal projects abroad. This week, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam promised in her Policy Address to spend USD 30.8 billion and create a Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality Office to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. For Hong Kong to finally address climate threats is welcome news. \u00a0\nClimate pessimists like Greta Thunberg are justifiably disillusioned by more green talk and less real deliverables. They feel betrayed by public leaders who repeat electoral promises that result in widening social inequalities, growing debt and planetary damage that coming generations have to clean up. They see businesses pushing consumerism that ends up destroying the planet through more carbon emission, pollution and biodiversity loss. At long last, more corporate leaders have moved from the denial phase to greenwashing their corporate strategies through Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting. Funeral directors at least see calamities and deaths as profit opportunities.\nUnder lockdown during the pandemic, I zoomed with six experts who have deep experience in epidemiology, finance, complexity science, urban planning, water and food disciplines to collectively think through how we can help the young tackle the looming climate change crisis. Coming from different disciplines enabled us to cut through the silos in thinking, arrive at less technical jargon and move from theory towards a practical approach to speeding up real Climate Action.\u00a0\nThe 2021 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC6) published recently basically signalled that time is running out. If no serious action is taken by 2030, the world would witness temperatures rising more than two degrees Celsius, with the poorer countries bearing the brunt of the losses. The faster the planet heats up, the greater the losses, the less time to mitigate and adapt to worsening conditions. Climate damage has moved from crisis to catastrophic proportions, with melting of Arctic permafrost, loss of Amazonian rainforests, and rising sea levels. By 2040, 700 million people are likely to face droughts of at least six months duration, double the historical average. The world would have another 1.4 billion people to feed.\nOur group therefore focused on \"Buying Time for Climate Action\", a forthcoming book to map out the key barriers to climate action and think through how to act. Given the complexity of climate change at different geographies and national and local conditions, there is no silver bullet or one-size fit all solution. Complex problems do not always have simple solutions, but the general principles to tackle these complex problems must be simply understood simply for effective implementation. God takes care of elegant principles, but the devil is in the details.\u00a0\nFinding human solutions under complexity and uncertainty is therefore less about theory and all about experimentation and practice through diversity, exactly how Nature copes with profound change.\nWe must learn to live with Nature and fight less with each other.\u00a0\nThe worst pandemic in a century required mobilisation at all levels of government and society. There may be more disasters and conflicts to come. Thus, we must move out of war against each other to mobilisation like a war on climate action. Everyone, especially the young, should be motivated to change their consumption patterns and behaviour.\u00a0\nThe stumbling blocks to action that we identified\u2014finance, talent, vested interests, bureaucracy and political will\u2014can be overcome. Many climate activists complain that money and talent are in short supply. Ironically, central banks were able to print USD 9 trillion in 2020 alone, whilst there are millions of young who are willing to work passionately to innovate our way towards a green and inclusive future. We simply need to build the social media platforms that are able to deliver the necessary technical know-how and resources (crowd-funded if needs be) to the thousands of projects and programmes at the grass-root level to help deliver change.\u00a0\nThe vested interests that stand to lose from change are resisting action, whereas bureaucracies designed for status quo are reluctant to change. Change cannot come without political will and public support. Brexit and the pandemic showed that scientific solutions are not enough when a significant proportion of the population react emotionally to oppose change.\u00a0\nIn short, technology, science and knowhow exist for technical climate solutions. Money is also available, but not channelled to where it is needed, because as economists say, climate change creates market failures. The state needs to work with markets, namely businesses and the community, in a whole-of-society effort. Getting the political will and support therefore is a mindset barrier.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis book's conclusion is that we should think globally within the concept of OneEarth, but act locally NOW. We must act locally because climate mitigation and adaptation projects are only implemented at the local level, but they may need national technical assistance and resource allocation, supplemented by global aid.\u00a0\nThe British Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees, who gave the keynote and opening chapter to the book, understood well that \"we can be technological optimists, but the intractable politics and sociology engender pessimism.\" The young will not wait for fatalistic pessimism. They want action today.\u00a0\nGreta Thunberg is right. No more time for blah, blah, blah. Up to leaders like Biden, Xi and Lam to prove that she is wrong, fast.\n\u00a0\nAndrew Sheng is adjunct professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing and University of Malaya.

        "full_article": "Humans are social creatures. While all animals have a need to communicate, none have quite the same ability or need to organise themselves into communities the way humans do. This ability, besides material needs, feeds off of the human being's need to belong, to feel connected. The need for connection is possibly as basic as food, shelter and clothing. An MIT study, published in November 2020, found that the region of our brains that makes us crave food is the same as that which makes us crave interactions, leading to the conclusion that connection is as important and as basic for humans as food.\nOver the last couple of years, with the onset of the Covid-19 virus, we have been forced to think about just how important the need for connection is for us. With strict guidelines of maintaining six feet distance, touch has all but disappeared from a lot of our lives. And while we were being stripped of of this basic human need, the release of oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin had been replaced by adrenaline released by the activation of the fear centres of our brain. Fear kicked in, in slow motion, activating a fight or flight response releasing adrenaline. In ancient humans, this rush of adrenaline could be channelled into running (away from potential threats), but here we were, modern day humans, stuck in our homes, unable to do little but let fear slowly engulf us. The fear of loss\u2014loss of life, loss of a loved one, loss of freedom, loss of security and loss of connection.\nA cross sectional study on the impact of the pandemic on mental health among the general Bangladeshi population (Das, Hasan, Daria, Islam, 2020) found the prevalence of loneliness to be a staggering 71 percent. Other issues reported in the study included depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance. Although chronic loneliness itself is categorised as a mental illness, studies have also found a direct correlation between loneliness and other psychological disorders such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and other types of personality disorders. The same study reports that amongst the elderly, loneliness is associated with more than two fold risk of dementia, since it is related to the loss of cognition in old age. In fact, some authors have signalled it as prodromal stage of dementia. When someone suffers from loneliness, they experience a more rapid decline in global cognition, semantic memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has rightly identified the increased demand for mental health services. Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or aggravating existing ones. As a result of the pandemic, many people may be undergoing increased levels of drug use, insomnia, and anxiety. Meanwhile, Covid-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.\nI suppose, one positive outcome of the pandemic is that the need for mental health services has been brought to the forefront. WHO has previously highlighted the chronic underfunding of mental health related programmes. Prior to the pandemic, countries were spending less than two percent of their national health budgets on mental health, and struggling to meet their populations' needs. In Bangladesh, the last revision of the mental health plan was done in 2006. While the mental health plan is incorporated into the policy, strategy and action plan for surveillance and prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCD) as well as the strategy and work plan for community based activities in mental health in Bangladesh, it was only last year that some of the goals identified in the last mental health plan were reached.\nThis, I suspect, occurred due to the pandemic forcing us to acknowledge the importance of our mental well-being. With the onset of the pandemic, what used to be an issue that was surrounded by silence and stigma, has slowly taken the spotlight as a result of growing awareness. Service providers have emerged with innovative solutions such as affordable, tele counselling provided by homegrown, often non-profit, organisations.\u00a0\nThere is a gap, however. The services as well as the advocacy around mental health are mostly targeted towards the youth. While, at the beginning of the pandemic, there was an understanding of how the physical health aspect of Covid disproportionately affects the elderly, the same has not been true for the mental health aspect. There may be reasons for this\u2014i.e. multiple studies showing that older adults may be less negatively affected by mental health outcomes than other age groups, the elderly reportedly have better coping skills, etc. What remains a fact, at least for our part of the world, is that the elderly have obviously suffered more from the loss of connection. While the youth have had technology to keep them connected, the elderly who relied on neighbourly visits and hugs from their children and grandchildren, have felt a definite adverse effect on their sense of well-being.\nAdditionally, while the youth have been able to teach themselves to talk about mental health without fear of stigma or repercussion, the same is hardly true for older people. They are far less likely to ask for professional help if they suffer from feelings of loneliness or depression. And since they are unwilling and unlikely to rely on professional help, without technological access to help them, they are likely to suffer in silence, further eroding their physical health. This, then, has a compound effect owing to the downside of connection; that as we connect, we feel responsible for those we connect with. The younger ones then, suffer from feelings of guilt, shame, and inadequacy, as a result of an inability to care for older people, once again leading to anxiety and depressive disorders.\nI don't necessarily have a solution to the problem. I do have an acute awareness of one fact, though. Connection is important, and connection is important for most humans. And maybe in our quest to build healthier societies, we should consider taking an inclusive approach to the elderly as well.\n\u00a0\nShagufe Hossain is a freelance consultant and the founder of Leaping Boundaries.\n",

        "full_article": "Recently, while I was driving to my office, an SUV full of security men whooshed past me on the wrong side. I slowed down and let the car come to my lane near Ganabhaban. It took me a while to realise that there was a small motorcade behind. There was no flag stand or any other insignia to indicate the protocol or the commercial barometer of the \"private\" caravan.\nWhen I got on to Mirpur Road, I indicated to move to the right lane as I needed to turn near the Residential Model College. The pilot SUV, flashing emergency lights, suddenly veered right and came in front of me. The other two of the fleet wanted to overtake from behind. I was in no mood to give them room for a second time. They would go straight, yet they came to the first lane to block me. The cars behind started honking, and one of the drivers started yelling. I guess my formal attire and shades did not allow their words to turn into invectives. But judging from their testosterone levels, I guess they were short by a minor notch. I had to tell the guy, \"If you are going straight, why do you have to block the right lane?\"\nThose who drive in Dhaka would find my logic banal and my retorts insane. It's not only a private security team, but also a CNG-run autorickshaw or a city bus that could have \"sided\" me without any warning. Then why am I expressing my frustration over such a trivial issue? Having studied psychoanalysis for my academic training, I can locate my repressed frustrations in the unconscious from where they were trying to make a return. My attempt to talk back to security men was foolish, and can perhaps be explained in Freudian terms. The father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, has told us how the feelings and emotions that we cannot process or negotiate get transferred to the unknown territory of our mind. They remain deposited there, but can make a return in displaced or transformed form\u2014like in an outburst or in a dream or a creative outpouring.\nFor a split second, I had the fallacy of having equal rights to the road. I am a tax-paying, law-abiding member of society. I have every right to be on the road without the infringement of any other force, as long as I am not violating the traffic rules. The reality is something else, however, and not acknowledging that reality could be lethal. Then why, on a sane mind, did I react? Did I really have control over that momentary lapse of reason? This is where Freud's psychoanalysis comes in.\nMy conscious act to defy the \"unknown\" authority was conditioned by a series of interactions that took place during my short drive from Banani to Mohammadpur. I was stuck near the newly designed U-loop at Mohakhali, as the extended funnel narrowed the thoroughfare. Any chance to widen the road and to have all four lanes for the incoming traffic from Uttara has been snapped by the construction of some government offices, including that of the roads and bridges authority. On the other side of the road, there is a market dangerously close to the rail track, which has created a similar effect of a bottleneck.\nThen you come to the flyover only to find that some flag-bearing or insignia-ridden vehicles are blocking the approach road under the watchful eyes of traffic sergeants. Anyone without a badge is, however, punished. You get down from the flyover and hit the congestion near the Old Airport as some provosts are making sure that their bosses get priority treatment. Once you enter the link road, you have to negotiate motorbikes coming from the wrong sides, buses stopping mindlessly to pick and drop passengers, potholes and puddles, clueless pedestrians, ambulances, speeding over-takers, and angry flashes of lights from the vehicles of uniformed men to finally reach the BNCC crossing.\nAnd then you encounter two extra lanes of incoming vehicles from the wrong side, most featuring some signs of authority. Even common men who have the platform to unite and create nuisances, such as the ride-sharing service motorcycles or the CNG autorickshaws, are there\u2014all nonchalantly waiting for the signal to be cleared. Their body language is simple: if I can't travel from this side of the road, how dare you move freely on the other side? A game of patience is initiated. We wait because they wait. We will pass, only when they can pass. What does it tell us about a nation? Is there any sociological study of Dhakaites who own the city without any ownership?\nBy the time I reached the side alley of the Ganabhaban complex, there was a wave of pent-up anger in me. I was frustrated by the irresponsibility of my fellow citizens. The power nudge of the motorcade, thus, made me react without thinking of any consequence. And I was lucky to have none.\nWasn't there an incident where a lawmaker's son got into trouble for getting into street rancour? The battle of the four wheels and two wheels ran a full course. Epic! When I was a student at a public university, our bus driver used to drive like a Formula 1 driver in Dhaka. We used to feel like the kings of the streets. I heard one day that one of my university's bus drivers got into an altercation with a microbus belonging to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). This was in the 90s. The microbus driver bragged, \"Can't you see the sign of my office?\" The other one quipped, \"You work for one prime minister. In my bus, everyone is a potential prime minister.\" Ah, democracy. It is nice to know about such an egalitarian theory.\nIt is nice to hum Tagore, for instance, \"We all rule as kings in the kingdom of our King. Why else would we join hands with him?\" But how many of us can internalise such principles, let alone practise them?\nI will end with an incident that took place about two weeks ago. A driver of a ride-sharing motorbike set fire to his own vehicle when a traffic sergeant was about to fine him for wrong parking. The man could not take it anymore. He had had enough of the daily routine of systemic abuses. The smothered fire in him came out as a return of the repressed, and in that momentary lapse of reason, he destroyed the very vehicle that he depended on for his livelihood. The police later quizzed him to learn that the man was already at a tipping point as he was under huge debt.\nSpeaking of which, I must return to my viewing of Squid Game on Netflix, the Korean survival drama on class disparity. Sometimes, illusions are the only way to handle reality. They are the therapeutic antidotes to momentary lapses of reason.

        "full_article": "We are deeply saddened to hear of the suicide bomb attack at a Shia mosque in the Afghan city of Kunduz that killed at least 55 people on Friday. Many more were also wounded in what is being called the bloodiest assault within Afghanistan since the exit of US forces, and for which the Islamic State (IS) group has already claimed responsibility.\nEver since the takeover by the Taliban, there have been widespread concerns over the rights of women and minority communities within the country. This is especially because of the Taliban's terrible track record with Hazara Shias, who were one of the most persecuted groups when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan and faced mass killings, torture and executions. On top of that, there have been predictions of an impending conflict between the Taliban and IS that will further destabilise the already conflict-ridden nation. This latest attack from IS only confirms these fears.\u00a0\nAnd it seems, regardless of whether it is the Taliban or IS, the victims are always ordinary Afghans, especially Shia Muslims, who have suffered some of the most violent assaults in Afghanistan. Even in May this year, a series of bombings outside a school in the capital killed at least 85 people from the Hazara community\u2014mostly young girls. Such attempts to stir up sectarian violence in Sunni-majority Afghanistan is part of an age-old strategy of Sunni extremists\u2014the revival of which should cause the entire region much concern.\nRenewed insecurity and greater instability within Afghanistan is not only against the interests of the region, but of the recently-established Taliban government as well, since it is yet to convince its neighbours and major donors and trading partners of its ability to govern effectively and peacefully. Although the initial tone taken by the Taliban seemed reconciliatory, they have already taken huge steps backwards by violating the rights to work and to receive an education of Afghan girls and women. When the Afghan government's ability to deal with an impending humanitarian and economic crisis is already in doubt, the last thing it needs is a resurgence of these disturbingly familiar patterns of violence.\nThe international community must not abandon the Afghan people in this great time of need. Simply making open-ended statements is not enough, there must be a serious push to ensure that the Taliban government holds terrorist groups like the IS to account and prevents them from operating within Afghanistan's borders. Failure to do so may lead to an escalation of violence that may ultimately cost them their seat of power. If IS is allowed to operate in Afghanistan, the repercussions for Pakistan, India and even Bangladesh can also be huge. We must be vigilant and ensure that the far-reaching arms of sectarian violence do not leave an impression within our borders as well.\n\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "We are disappointed to learn of yet another concession made by the authorities to transport associations in the form of late fine waiver for vehicles and drivers without updated documents. According to a report by this daily, the government, apparently under pressure from transport owners' associations, has waived the fines for failing to update necessary documents in time. This is the fourth time that it has announced such waivers since January 2020. Although the benefit would extend to all motor vehicles, private or commercial, it is the latter\u2014buses, trucks and lorries\u2014that have the most to gain from this as, according to insiders, a good number of the 450,000 commercial vehicles (and their drivers) don't have proper documents. The documents include a vehicle's fitness certificate, tax token, route permit, driver's licence, etc.\nThe threat that unfit vehicles and unlicensed drivers pose to road safety is not lost on us. The question is: Why would the government agree to such waivers? The chairman of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has brushed aside the allegation of concessions and defended the decision, saying it would give vehicle owners who could not update their papers because of the Covid-19 lockdown a chance to do so now. But what makes it highly suspect is its timing, coming as it does mere weeks after a two-day transport strike organised to press home a 15-point demand, including the waiver of late fines. The repeated nature of waiver decisions\u2014such periods of remission were also announced several times between 2015 and 2020\u2014also shows that there is more to it than meets the eye.\nExperts say the latest waiver decision cannot be seen in isolation from past concessions made to transport owners and workers, notably the inordinate delay in the implementation of the Road Transport Act, 2018, which remains ineffective even after three years. The law stipulated hefty fines on vehicles with outdated papers, among other punitive measures meant to bring discipline in the transport sector and curb road accidents. Its non-execution and the continued attempts to amend its more stringent provisions are proof of the enormous power exercised by transport owners and lobbyists, many of whom are directly linked to the ruling party. In essence, what we are witnessing is a helpless surrender to the transport associations at the expense of public interests.\nIt's worth recalling that it is largely because of noncompliant owners and drivers that the country witnessed a 40 percent rise in road accidents and deaths till July this year, compared to the same period last year, according to police data. As many as 3,095 people were killed in 3,259 road accidents in the first six months of this year alone. The numbers of accidents and deaths were 2,609 and 2,635, respectively, in 2018. The numbers rose to 4,198 and 3,918, respectively, last year. If the government continues to pander to the transport owners, allowing unfit vehicles to ply the roads and their drivers to get off scot-free, the number of casualties will only increase. We must not allow this to happen. The government must protect public interests, stop giving concessions to transport businessmen, and bring discipline in the sector.\n",
