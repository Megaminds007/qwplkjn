Purported flags of imaginary Khalistan were put up on the gate of the complex, and slogans scrawled on the walls. The State police chief has set up a special investigation team and ordered heightened vigil at the borders. On the same day, the police in Punjab said they had averted a terror attack after arresting two men, said to be Khalistani sympathisers, with explosives in Tarn Taran district. A U.S.-based Khalistani separatist has been charged in Himachal Pradesh under the UAPA and the Indian Penal Code. Opposition parties in the State, the Congress and AAP, have used the incident to make a case against the ruling BJP, months ahead of the Assembly election. Comparable rhetoric had shadowed the recent election in Punjab, where political opponents accused one another of being sympathetic to separatists. That was avoidable loose talk on a sensitive topic. Sikh separatism, and the accompanying terrorism supported by Pakistan, was snuffed out by the Indian state decades ago, but at a huge human and political cost. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated and the sectarian violence against the Sikh community that followed in different places deepened the fault lines. Those wounds continue to fester, and care must be taken by the state, political actors and community leaders to ensure that history does not repeat itself as yet another tragedy.A separatist plan to hold a referendum on Khalistan in Himachal Pradesh is laughable, but vigilance is essential. The groups that call for Khalistan are based abroad, and command little respect in the Sikh mainstream at the moment. They campaign among the Sikh diaspora, alleging mistreatment of the community by the Indian state. They have a favourable environment though. Domestic divisions in India, exacerbated by the politics and policy of the ruling BJP, are echoing among the diaspora in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Religious minorities and Dalits have been disconnected from the diaspora mobilisation of the Indian government. Hindutva affiliates helm Indian diaspora politics. This provides an opening for India\u2019s enemies to inflame passions. Fortunately for India, there are not many takers for such propaganda among the Sikh community. But thoughtless comments and campaigns against the community, particularly when they are led by powerful political actors, can trigger serious reactions. In its desperation to delegitimise the farm agitation, the BJP tacitly supported campaigns that portrayed Sikh protestors as anti-nationals inspired by foreign countries. Though isolated and feeble, Sikh separatism continues to flicker. It must serve as a constant reminder for social cohesion and impartial state policy.",

While the carefully drafted statement avoided any reference to \u2018war\u2019, \u2018invasion\u2019 or \u2018conflict\u2019, the fact that the 15 members of the Council, including Russia which has veto power, unanimously agreed to the call for peace shows that all sides are feeling the heat of the conflict. Going by the votes in the UN General Assembly, international public opinion is heavily against the war and the UNSC is expected to do more to bring the violence to an end. The statement was issued a week after Mr. Guterres held talks with Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, in Moscow and Kyiv, respectively. But his mission would be successful only if the parties concerned showed seriousness in ending the war. As of now, neither exists beyond statements. For example, Russia stepped up attacks in Ukraine after the UNSC statement was issued. On Sunday, 60 people were killed in Luhansk. On Monday, Mr. Putin, in his Victory Day address marking the Soviet triumph over German Nazis, claimed that the Russian troops were \u201cdefending the motherland\u201d, indicating that the war will grind on.When he ordered the \u2018special military operation\u2019 for what he called the \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u2019 of Ukraine, Mr. Putin must have expected a quick victory. But Ukraine\u2019s resistance did not only deny the Russians this but also galvanised western support. When western financial and military aid hardened the Ukrainian resistance, the Russian troops, despite their incremental territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, appeared to have got stuck in the battlefield. The stalemate has increased the risks of a wider conflict. The U.S. now seems determined to \u201cweaken Russia\u201d, as Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said. Russia, with its back against the wall, is warning of a third world war with nuclear weapons. The possibility of a direct Russia-West confrontation makes it the most dangerous moment in global politics since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. If both sides still believe in rational policymaking, they should immediately look for an offramp. Russia cannot ask for dialogue and peace when continuing to pound Ukrainian cities. Its war machine has slowed down and it is already facing economic and political isolation in Europe. Escalating this conflict, bringing the whole world into danger, does not serve anybody\u2019s interest. Instead, Moscow should immediately end the attacks and support the UN Secretary General\u2019s mission of finding a peaceful solution that could address the security concerns of both Ukraine and Russia.",

        "full_article": "French sociologist Emile Durkheim described social cohesion as organic solidarity arising from peoples' dependence on each other in a modern society. But is social cohesion\u2014i.e., fostering solidarity, mutual trust, shared aspirations and acceptance of diversity in society\u2014a matter of concern? Does education have a role in building social cohesion?\nThree major parallel streams of education in Bangladesh divide the nation, entrench social and economic disparities, and stand in the way of building an equitable, inclusive and united nation.\nEducation Minister Dipu Moni, and Dean of General Education at Brac University, Samia Huq, have raised the curtain on the problem in a recent article (\"Social Cohesion through Education,\" Whiteboard, March 2022): \"In Bangladesh, different streams of educational institutions have emerged with particular histories and purposes,\" they write. \"The class selection and characteristics of each type of institution turn the students into different types of citizens.\"\nThe mainstream Bangla-medium, government and government-assisted schools enrol the majority of Bangladeshi school-going students. The madrasa system, with one stream receiving government support and the other being an independent Qawmi stream, serves a substantial minority of students. A small elite section of society sends their children to English-medium proprietary schools.\nOne aspect of unfairness is the low quality of schools for the majority of children. This majority includes madrasa students (both in Alia and Qawmi madrasas), and most students in mainstream Bangla schools (excepting an elite enclave of special institutions such as cadet colleges and the highly-selective private Bangla schools). Students in the mushrooming low-quality, commercial English-medium \"kindergartens\" (which often include secondary level classes) are also among the deprived.\nThe three different streams also prevent building a common foundation of knowledge, shared experience and cultivation of common values among young people. Children study and live in different worlds from each other. Opportunities and life prospects disproportionately favour children attending English-medium schools and the elite enclave of Bangla-medium schools.\nSchools cannot remedy all social divisions, but they can help mitigate them using a shared curriculum. At present, schools reinforce these divisions and extend them to the next generation.\nPost-independence, the education policy report of the Qudrat-e-Khuda Commission envisioned a unified school system with a common core curriculum in a Bangla-medium public system. English-medium private schools and madrasas would be exceptions.\nMadrasa education was to follow the common curriculum at the primary stage and then become a vocational stream. The aim of madrasas would be to prepare people for religion-related occupations, rather than being a parallel system till university.\nThe Qudrat-e-Khuda Commission report was ignored by the military rulers after 1975. Madrasas\u2014both Alia and Qawmi\u2014grew rapidly in the 1980s, as did the proprietary English-medium schools. Both enjoyed government patronage and encouragement. Post-1990 democratic governments, both the BNP-led and the Awami League-led coalitions, found it difficult or undesirable to try reversing the trend.\nThe 2010 National Education Policy espoused the goal of the Qudrat-e-Khuda Commission of a unified public education system with equity and excellence. But it did not lay out specific guidelines for the major structural reform the system required to undo the three-way division that had become entrenched by then. Such a reversal called for major steps in financing, governance, curriculum development, pedagogy, teacher preparation and student assessment in the school system. An initiative of this scope and scale has not been taken.\nThe three major streams of education clearly parallel the larger divisions in society. The elite\u2014representing business, political higher-ups, higher bureaucracy, and the higher echelons of the armed forces\u2014patronise private English-medium schools. The middle and lower-middle mainstream send their children to government or government-supported Bangla-medium schools. The poor enrol their children in the Alia or Qawmi madrasas for reasons of affordability and/or due to religious motivation.\nThis structure has suited the political and economic elite and, consequently, there has been little interest in rocking the boat.\nWhen religion becomes a central tenet of the political agenda\u2014as in Pakistan, and increasingly in India\u2014it does not augur well for nation-building or creating an equitable and inclusive education system to serve the nation's aspirations.\nFor example, the \"saffronisation\" drive symbolising the Hindutva ideology of the current ruling regime in India has led to dropping the history of the Mughal period from the curriculum of secondary schools under the Central Secondary Education Board. Hindu mythology has been invoked to glorify the ancient scientific achievements of India.\nIn Bangladesh, we witnessed attempts to select and exclude literature and language content in school textbooks as a way of appeasing some religious groups, which was seen as an expedient in the electoral calculus. The growth of the two streams of madrasa as parallel systems rivalling the mainstream remains an intractable social cohesion challenge.\nThe questions raised are difficult and complex. The vision of the Qudrat-e-Khuda commission, with Bangabandhu's support, was to design an education system for independent Bangladesh guided by the pillars of the nation's constitution\u2014democracy, nationalism, socialism, and secularism. This aim was derailed in 1975 and the pillars have become contested concepts in the last five decades.\nThe education minister and her co-writer have to be commended for flagging the challenge. And for posing the question: \"How will teachers and learners engage with one another to live in pluralistic ways?\"\nThe challenge for the policymakers and the citizenry is to reclaim the pillars of national ideology, render them a humane, progressive and contemporary meaning, and work on re-formulating educational purposes and practices based on these principles.\n\u00a0\nDr Manzoor Ahmed\u00a0is professor emeritus at Brac University, chair of Bangladesh ECD Network (BEN), and vice-chair of Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE).

        "full_article": "Everywhere I go I hear the same maxim: sustainability is the only word forward for the fashion industry. Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) issues are at the forefront of investors' minds. I am not sure about that, as I think sometimes investors don't have the requisite knowledge to know what sustainability means when it comes to clothing production. That said, when the investment community begins to discuss these issues on a regular basis, we\u2014as suppliers\u2014must sit up and take notice.\nIs sustainable clothing production even achievable? I certainly think it is possible to produce clothing with less environmental and social impact.\nBut what do we mean by the phrase \"sustainable clothing production\"? I'd like to explore what I believe this means and outline my own vision for how Bangladesh could become a blueprint for sustainable fashion value chains.\nFirst, sustainable means more environmentally benign, in terms of our direct impact on the environment. This includes negative externalities, including the effluent our factories release. Is our effluent being treated properly before being released into the environment? Huge technological advances have been made in regards to effluent treatment in recent years, and many have been implemented in Bangladesh. But there is always more we can do, and there is no reason why every single garment factory in Bangladesh should not be integrated with state-of-the-art effluent treatment processes.\nThe second area for Bangladesh to pioneer in is direct production processes. The use of dyes and chemicals has historically been linked with high environmental load in garment supply chains. But there's no need for this. The past few years have seen huge advancements in the development and use of safer, less toxic dyes and chemicals, and the use of completely natural dyes.\nAs always, cost is an issue. Safer, cleaner dyes and chemicals are often more expensive. I am generalising here, but the point is that when a new, best-in-class range is launched, it is often charged at a premium. But to achieve cleaner supply chains, we must invest in these areas.\nThe third area is energy and water saving techniques. Bangladesh has yet to shift to renewable energy to any great degree in garment production. For our garment industry to shift to renewable energy, we need infrastructural investment at the national level. While renewable energy in Bangladesh is slowly picking up pace, its share in the total energy mix remains negligible. A recent report showed that, for 2020, wind and solar account for just three percent of the local electricity production.\nWe can and must change this picture. ESG investors are heavily focused on green investment. This has huge ramifications for fashion supply chains, and renewable energy is an integral part of this. So, our government and energy companies need to now be setting the most ambitious targets possible to boost renewable energy's share in our overall energy mix.\nBangladesh can also lead the way in terms of the actual clothing we produce. For every major fashion retailer, recycling and circularity are the main goals right now. How can we support our customers on this journey? For this, Bangladesh needs to invest in textile recycling. Why can't we aim to become a global hub for new textile recycling technologies? Clothing is our lifeblood. And since we already have so much manufacturing infrastructure in place, why not take advantage of it to move more heavily into textile recycling\u2014before a competitor does?\nQuality and durability will likely become key issues in clothing production moving forward. There is an argument that our industry should focus on quality, not quantity, if it wishes to improve its environmental footprint. We have heavily focused on cotton clothing throughout the history of our garment industry, but perhaps we need to broaden the amount of other fibres used in clothing, including viscose, wool and other fibres.\nFinally, the other side of sustainability is a social one. As well as becoming a leader on environmental issues, Bangladesh can show the world that working in a garment factory does not have to be a job with poverty pay, carried out in poor conditions with no career prospects. We should be aspiring to do much more for garment workers. There is still a huge room for improvement in garment pay and conditions, and supply chain costs would not have to increase hugely to accommodate these gains.\nWe've spent two decades talking about garment worker pay, yet progress has been painfully slow. Bangladesh can lead the way here, with factory owners, unions, rights groups and workers implementing a process of continuous improvement.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "Debt servicing has become a rising concern for developing countries in recent times. With sluggish growth worldwide, the havoc caused by Covid-19 over the past three years, and global economic instability due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the revenues of governments in developing countries are sliding down, and the need for them to borrow is rising. As a result, debt repayment (principals and interests), as a ratio of either revenues or gross national income (GNI), has been becoming more and more difficult. For example, with the advent of Covid, the average ratio of external debt to GNI for developing economies (excluding China) jumped by 13 percentage points to 44 percent in 2020, as a result of which, developing countries had to struggle to retain their pre-Covid human development expenditures.\nThe concern for debt servicing has been echoed in the case of Bangladesh too. During the last fiscal year, the debt service to revenue ratio in Bangladesh rocketed to 81 percent, which was 56 percent in the pre-pandemic year. The increased level of debt service to revenue ratio means that today, if the government earns Tk 100 in taxes, it has to spend more than Tk 81 to pay off loans, as opposed to Tk 56 in 2019. This simply implies that because of higher debt servicing payment, there would be less availability of resources for development and other priority expenditures, including those required for post-pandemic economic recovery. This will put pressure on public finance. Resources that could have been spent on essential sectors like health, education or public investment are now being dedicated to interest payments.\nDebt repayment has to be undertaken with regard to domestic debt as well as external debt. In this context, three points are important. First, while domestic debt can be paid in terms of domestic revenue, foreign debt has to be paid in terms of foreign exchange accumulated through export earnings. Second, because of its nature, the government may have more flexibility in managing domestic debt servicing compared to external debt servicing. And third, sometimes, governments put more focus on external debt compared to domestic debt, even though domestic debt may be substantial. In Bangladesh, total public debt stood at USD 148 billion in fiscal year 2021, about 41 percent of GDP. Of this, external debt accounted for USD 62 billion, or 18 percent of GDP.\nAn in-depth look at the debt servicing of Bangladesh raises some structural public debt issues. First, interest payments on debts remain high because of higher rates on national saving certificates, expensive bank borrowing, delay in executing the projects, and irrelevance and overvaluation of projects. For example, the government provides higher rates of interest on national savings certificates due to the fact that people have limited sources for investing their hard-earned money. As a result, they opt to invest in risk-free national savings certificates, leading to a rise in government borrowing from expensive sources.\nSecond, because of revenue constraints, the government has opted to borrow more in recent years, including through non-concessional and hard-term loans from foreign lenders, resulting in higher repayments. The borrowing has been undertaken to finance current expenditures, but also to service existing debts, accounting for the largest part of the expenditure. Sometimes, the government has to borrow to finance big projects, the debt repayment on which is also substantial.\nThird, in many cases, some multilateral and bilateral donors have increased their interest rates and service charges, but have reduced the grace periods. For example, the World Bank, Bangladesh's largest multilateral donor, has reduced the maturity period of its loans from 40 years to 30 years and grace period from 10 years to five to seven years, respectively. The government has also taken some hard loans from bilateral donors like China and Russia. Overall, the country needed to repay its interest and principal amounts simultaneously, resulting in repayment amounts to increase year-to-year.\nFourth, with Bangladesh graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status, borrowing and debt repayment would become harder for Bangladesh in the future. In fact, since 2016, when Bangladesh graduated to a lower middle-income country (LMIC) category, loans started to get costlier. For example, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the second largest multilateral donor of Bangladesh, has enhanced lending from its non-concessional window. Since Bangladesh became a LMIC, the loans from ADB's soft window\u2014the Asian Development Fund\u2014have been decreasing year-on-year. Japan, the largest bilateral donor of Bangladesh, has also made its lending terms harder\u2014as it's been charging 0.10 percent interest rate in recent years against 0.01 percent a few years back.\nFifth, the average revenue mobilisation is quite weak in Bangladesh. In fiscal year 2021, the revenue mobilisation in Bangladesh was around 10 percent of its GDP. It is less than half of that of 25 percent in emerging and developing Asian countries. The revenue-GDP ratio in Nepal is 22 percent, In India, it is 20 percent and, in Pakistan, it is 15 percent. Therefore, Bangladesh has a lot of catching up to do.\nIn the context of the preceding discussion, a crucial question is: Is debt servicing at risk in Bangladesh? The answer is \"no\". Bangladesh's public debt at 41 percent of its GDP is way lower than the risk threshold of 70 percent estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The external debt service to revenue ratio in the country reached 10 percent in 2020, but it is still below the risk threshold of 23 percent. In Bangladesh, all external debt indicators are below their corresponding risk thresholds under the most extreme shock scenario, and the risks of debt distress remains low.\nBut there is no place for complacency. Bangladesh needs to be cautious about its debt and debt servicing. Even though the amount of external debt is still far below the risk threshold, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently directed all concerned authorities to take necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of the country's current position in future, regarding external debt.\nMeasures must be taken both on the revenue and the debt front. On the revenue front, the tax-base of Bangladesh must be expanded. The government had set an annual revenue collection target of 13.5 percent of GDP in 2020. Yet, last year, the actual revenue collection of Bangladesh was 9.4 percent of GDP. The government has expressed its commitment towards automating revenue administration and tax expenditure rationalisation. Thus, widening the tax base would require using technology for tax enforcement, while reducing expenditures on losing state-owned enterprises. The issue of export-diversification is a long-standing issue in Bangladesh. With global growth being sluggish, this is extremely important for Bangladesh if foreign exchange revenue is to be enhanced.\nOn the debt side, Bangladesh should continue seeking concessional financing to the extent that is possible, even though with LDC graduation it may prove to be a major challenge for the country. After graduation, Bangladesh would have to borrow loans at higher rates, which would further increase its debt-repayment amounts in the near future. In that context, the country should also look to attract non-debt creating financial inflows, such as foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, Bangladesh should ensure best use of the costly loans through quality implementation of projects as well as checking misuse and leakage of funds. Domestic borrowing should be further scrutinised, as it costs the economy more because of borrowing at higher commercial rates.\nAs far as the debt servicing of Bangladesh is concerned, right now, there is no need for anyone to panic. However, the country needs to be cautious so that unforeseen future shocks does not create any debt distress.\n\u00a0\nSelim Jahan\u00a0is a former director of the Human Development Report Office and Poverty Division at the UNDP.\n",

        "full_article": "What does one imagine when thinking of a house? A place that is safe and secure, that can provide privacy and, most importantly, protection from extreme climates. For someone belonging to the most vulnerable and marginalised communities of Bangladesh, living in regions plagued by constant natural disasters, the above-mentioned concept of \"a house\" is simply an unobtainable dream. But does that have to be the case?\nBangladesh is a hotspot for natural disasters. About 40 percent of global storm surges have been recorded here. Cyclone Amphan (May 2020) alone caused damages amounting to more than USD 130 million\u2014approximately 10 million people from 19 districts were affected and more than 330,000 houses were destroyed. Annually, there is not one but two cyclone seasons in Bangladesh. Aside from that, the country also experiences a wide selection of other climatic disasters\u2014namely flooding, river bank erosion, flash flood, drought, landslide, tidal surge, and salinity intrusion. In the year 2020, the combined loss from all these natural disasters amounted to a staggering USD 11.3 billion, according to a report by World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThis number alone reflects the desperate need for climate resilient housing, which could be the key to preventing hundreds of millions worth of property damage. The regions most affected by climate change induced disasters are also amongst the poorest in the country, where a huge number of people live in substandard housing. This constant battle with nature not only threatens the lives of these vulnerable people but also dwindles their chances of a prosperous future, as they have to constantly spend whatever little savings they have, in rebuilding their houses and their lives. While moving to the multipurpose cyclone shelters during disasters can save their lives, they may still end up losing all their livestock and belongings. Women risk exposing themselves to physical abuse, harassment and molestation, which are common occurrences in these cyclone shelters. Hence, it doesn't come as a surprise that people sometimes choose to risk their lives in order to save their livestock and protect their family members from abuse. All these could be avoided if they had resilient housing.\nSo, why is this an unobtainable dream? Firstly, there is a lack of awareness about the existence of feasible climate resilient housing. Concepts and designs for such housing are also not available for the general public who can afford them. The simplest of modifications can transform a substandard house into a disaster resilient one. For example, changing the shape of the roof can provide better protection against strong winds in cyclone prone areas; building the base of the house a few feet higher than usual is effective against tidal surges; adding a loft to the house design can help protect valuables during floods. It is just a matter of disseminating the knowledge and techniques to the local population.\nSecondly, financial barrier is a much bigger challenge. Climate resilient houses are more expensive and the poorer population hardly have the means to afford them or access bank loans. Lack of information regarding lending institutions, high interest rate and procedural complexities discourage a big percentage of the rural population from considering such options. Loans are offered mainly for income generating purposes so the people can eventually pay back.\nHowever, this scenario can be changed by popularising the concept of climate resilient housing.\nIf there is high demand for microfinance loan packages for such purpose, the sector will probably reconsider providing one since Brac (the largest organisation working in microfinance in Bangladesh) itself is looking for innovative sustainable solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. A loan which covers 90 percent of the construction cost for a specific resilient house design appropriate for a specific area could be an excellent option. Given these housing designs are fairly feasible, even the poor should be able to pay back the loan. Another loan package idea could be for a single climate resilient room in their regular house. This would be enough to protect the clients and their belongings from disasters. A third option could be a package providing enough fund to make the current house disaster resilient, in which case the lending organisation can also assign an expert for consultation.\nNot only can this help thousands of people, it can also be an incredible business opportunity for lending organisations and developers. If the developers are fixed, building cost estimates will be more accurate and they can further assure that the house is built according to the design so the loan money doesn't get wasted. Additionally, the communities can also benefit from a new income generating source, as the materials and workforce will be local. This also means that the locals can obtain the knowledge and skills to become experts at building climate resilient houses.\nBeing able to live in a house that will protect from climatic disasters is not an unobtainable dream, not even for the most vulnerable and marginalised people. It is just a matter of spreading awareness and organising. So why not work towards this and save hundreds of lives from the next environmental disaster?\n\u00a0\nMahzabeen Mahfuz\u00a0is Research Officer at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).

        "full_article": "The condition which the residents of East Jurain, under Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), have been living in for years is unbelievable. According to a report by this daily, round the year, waterlogging, mosquito infestation, dust pollution during dry season, unplanned urbanisation and the lack of a waste management system have made this area literally unliveable for its residents.\nWhile many roads and houses of East Jurain remain submerged under filthy sewage water throughout the year\u2014even without rain\u2014dengue fever never leaves the neighbourhood as the waterlogged streets and abandoned homes have become the breeding ground of Aedes mosquitos. And while thick bouts of dust from uncontrolled construction works have made the air of the area unbreathable, the open drains have made it particularly risky for children, who have to play in the streets for lack of an open space or playground.\nReportedly, the waterlogging problem in the area started more than 20 years ago, but the authorities concerned did nothing to solve the problem. Rather, unplanned road construction and clogged sewerage systems have made the situation worse. According to East Jurain residents, DSCC has regularly been increasing the heights of the roads without considering the heights of the adjacent houses. While the residents believe that this is causing more waterlogging, the DSCC authorities claim that they have to do this to prevent runoff water from the nearby highways from flooding the area, as the main roads in the area are much higher than the roads going through this particular neighbourhood.\nEast Jurain is a classic example of what happens when unplanned urbanisation overtakes an area. Apparently, the entire neighbourhood has been developed by filling up many canals and low-lying floodplains adjacent to the DND embankment, which is the main reason for such persistent waterlogging. Without well-thought-out measures, these longstanding problems cannot be solved. And the responsibility to solve them falls primarily on DSCC authorities.\nThe DSCC, with help from other relevant authorities, must find a sustainable solution to the problems facing East Jurain. If the waterlogging problem can be solved, it will naturally eradicate the mosquito menace. And if the unnecessary road restoration work can be stopped, it will definitely lessen the air pollution in the area. Additionally, the DSCC must develop a proper waste management system and cover up the open drains. The residents of East Jurain are paying regular taxes to the DSCC; they definitely deserve a liveable neighbourhood in return.\n",

        "full_article": "As the government makes its final preparations for the upcoming budget, we would like to remind the authorities of the unique challenges that it needs to address utilising the next budget. As the country recovers from the pandemic-induced losses, inflation has become a major challenge due to various external and perhaps also internal factors. However, it appears that the government is planning to formulate its next budget with the same mindset that it did prior to the pandemic.\nDuring the past two fiscal years, the budget size grew only in single digit, which was a departure from what had previously become the norm. This time around, the government is looking to return to a budgetary growth of double digits. According to a finance ministry report, the budget will seek to bring inflation under control, attract investment, complete the implementation of the 28 stimulus packages, boost agricultural productivity particularly by incentivising farm mechanisation and enhance social security for the poor and the vulnerable. Although we agree with all of these goals, we cannot help but remain sceptical as to how they would be achieved\u2014particularly in light of past government failures, despite lofty promises.\nFor example, the government stimulus packages introduced for small and medium enterprises have largely failed to achieve their goals. Small and medium businesses struggled to access the benefits of these government schemes throughout the whole pandemic. As for the social security programmes for the poor, time and again we have seen corruption eat away at them\u2014resulting in influential and people close to power benefitting from them, rather than the poor who really needed them.\nMoreover, it would not be wrong to say that the country has not yet fully recovered from the damage done by the pandemic. As huge numbers of people lost their jobs and education had literally come to a halt, the budget should focus on generating more employment\u2014which the government was struggling to do even before the pandemic\u2014and budgetary allocation for education has to be substantial. Due to various external circumstances, the government's foreign exchange reserve has dwindled in recent times, and there are some concerns in terms of the growing national debt\u2014and the high cost of servicing them. Therefore, the government needs to utilise whatever resources it has at its disposal more prudently\u2014something that the government, again, has failed at in the past.\nAs highlighted by experts, it would be best for the government to remain cautious when it comes to budgetary allocations. When it comes to human development related expenses, the government should spend more. However, it should cut back on unnecessary spending such as foreign tours by government officials and car imports for government officials in order to lower the pressure on the country's reserves. The traditional procedure of wasting valuable funds needs to be abandoned. More focus should instead be placed at effectively implementing essential government programmes, rather than creating lofty plans that the government does not have the capacity to follow through with.\n",
