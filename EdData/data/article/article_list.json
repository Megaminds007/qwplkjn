Everyone wears a selector\u2019s hat ahead of selectors\u2019 picking the India cricket XI. Similarly, come Lok Sabha elections, Indians turn psephologists \u2013 with much flair, and abundant political \u2018insight\u2019, not infrequently free of fact.\nWhy they vote\u00a0| Knowhow hangs heavy, as hot as the air \u2013 in living rooms and workplaces, in college canteens and academic deep-dives, among random surveyors and reporters, local party workers, cabbies and autowallahs, and of course the chatterati, who may not necessarily be the voterati. This year\u2019s Big Questions? Why are turnouts low? And whatever could it mean? In 2019, which saw the highest turnout ever at 67.4%, CSDS-Lokniti surveys suggested urban middle-classes were mobilised to vote too. But, the josh seem smissing this year, it\u2019s said. Hat doffed to aam voters, who ensure every election is nothing like the earlier one.\n\nWhy they don\u2019t vote\u00a0| This year, there\u2019s an overdrive to get the voter out. Is the relentless pressure to vote off-putting? Is there too much song and dance about your \u2018duty\u2019 to vote? Could low quality political discourse be a deterrent? With elections drawn out over 44 days, is there poll fatigue? Does heat play a role? Do unprincipled politicians switching parties at a record clip dampen enthusiasm? Is trust wavering in the process of voting? Is the telly tamasha soul-sapping? Are candidate profiles weak? Are there too many criminals and crooks, with just enough clout to stay out of jail?\nLow vote?\u00a0| There are very many strands to why voters vote. Famously for caste, creed, and religion too, of late. If 2014 was pitted as the call for \u2018development\u2019, 2019\u2019s turnout was an inspired mobilisation of voters. This year so far, political parties and EC are tearing their hair out to get more people to polling booths. The electorate is more polarised than ever. Many seem deeply and loudly political. Support for parties and protests have continued apace. And yet, seemingly, fewer people are voting.\nBut is even that a fact? The size of the electorate is bigger: 968.8m compared to 896m in 2019 \u2013 up by 72.8m electors. Which begs the question whether turnout in the neighbourhood of 60% can, in truth, be termed \u2018low\u2019? That is perhaps the only question we need to ask at this point.\n\n",

        "full_article": "This year the May Day is likely to provide an insight into the growing hostility from elements the toiling masses will continue to encounter the world over on account of climate change. When millions of workers in South and South East Asia are struggling under a blistering sun, their counterparts in large swathes in Pakistan, China and Kenya have been forced to take shelter in temporary relief camps. As the most vulnerable segment of society, the working class becomes the first casualty of natural calamities. In this context, the theme Bangladesh has chosen for this year's May Day celebration is 'Sramik-Malik Gorbo Desh, Smart Hobey Bangladesh' (As workers and owners, shall we build the country, it'll be a smart Bangladesh) is quite contextual. But whether it will materialise is a different issue. The May Day, also known as International Workers' Day, is observed as the triumph of workers against exploitation and injustice. Celebration of the day began in 1889 by the International Federation of Socialist Groups and trade unions in commemoration of the Hay Market tragedy on May 4 following the rally for eight-hour working day on May 1, 1886 all across the USA. The May Day is celebrated in many countries across the world to express solidarity with the workers. The day serves as a reminder to pay attention to the workers' concerns, ensure their well-being, and recognise their invaluable contributions to society, economy and nation-building.In Bangladesh, the success story of the readymade garment (RMG) industry, which accounts for about 85 per cent of the country's export earnings, is largely woven by the sweat of the brow of about four million workers in this sector. Ensuring garment workers' rights and well-being has always been a contentious issue. Since the RMG sector has to navigate the complex trajectory of international trade, ensuring workers' rights and well-being is not a choice for the industry stakeholders, but a necessity. Of late, the issue of giving workers greater freedom to form unions so that they can voice their demands has been a global concern. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the Labour Ministry has come up with amendments to the labour law to give greater freedom of association to workers. The proposed revisions to the labour law are slated for introduction during the forthcoming budget session of parliament and are expected to tackle the concerns raised by the country's trading partners and the International Labour Organisation (ILO).While there has been a paradigm shift in workplace safety in the apparel industry, the issues of fair wages, stable jobs and the right to association remain as pressing as ever. Society cannot be stable if jobs are unstable and workers are not treated well. Formation of union is not only workers' right, but it is also a stabilising factor in running an industry. It is, therefore, hoped that the government will get all relevant agencies and stakeholders on board for adoption of measures aimed at protecting and promoting workers' rights in all productive sectors. All business establishments and factories should implement foolproof safety measures. Additionally, other labour rights issues such as job security, minimum wage and enhancing workers' productivity levels through training should also be taken seriously.",

        "full_article": "There is, no doubt, an increasing focus these days on the social safety net programmes (SSNPs) --- not only within the scope of the government's poverty alleviation exercise but also in the public discourse. Despite the many odds stacked against smooth execution of the programmes, the government is pretty upbeat about SSNPs' success in bringing the poverty graph on a downward curve and helping out some sector-specific activities.The government is reportedly going to expand its social safety net programmes (SSNPs) by increasing the number of beneficiaries by around four hundred thousand. The decision to bring in new beneficiaries came following a cabinet committee meeting last week. However, the money currently being given will remain unchanged. The finance ministry, meanwhile, has issued two circulars to bring all safety net programmes under a new structure in order to reduce leakage, misuse, and corruption.It has been learnt that inclusion of fresh beneficiaries will take place under two major SSN schemes for elderly people and widows, deserted, or destitute women. The government's allocation for the Old age Allowance programme in the current fiscal is Tk 4,205 crore. Men above the age of 65 and women aged more than 62 with an average annual income of less than Tk 10,000 are eligible. Eligible elder citizens are currently getting the benefit in 262 upazilas under the exising programme. Around 58.01 lakh elderly people are getting Tk 600 per month in the ongoing fiscal. The allocation for the widow, deserted, or destitute women programme is Tk 1,711 crores. Around 25.75 lakh women are currently beneficiaries of the scheme. Under the programme, women aged 18 and above and with an annual average income below Tk 12,000 are getting allowances of Tk 550 per month. The increase in the number of both the categories will be two hundred thousand each. Presently, the government runs well over a hundred programmes under the SSNPs, and the allocation for FY24 is Tk 126,000 crore. The major SSNPs can be grouped under four broad categories: (i) employment generation programmes; (ii) programmes to cope with natural disasters and other shocks; (iii) incentives provided to parents for their children's education; and (iv) incentives provided to families to improve their health status. Given that the programme is growing, though very slowly, corruption and misuse of funds are the most commonly alleged practices plaguing the operations. Moreover, although the allocation has increased over the years, it has been found to be still far less than what it should have been in terms of standard practices followed elsewhere. Analysts opine that Bangladesh has been spending less than half of what other countries spend as a percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP). Most middle income countries spend between 6.0 to 8.0 per cent of the GDP on social safety net programmes as against little over 2.0 per cent of GDP in Bangladesh. The country currently has no less than forty million people living below the poverty line, but the number may shoot up twice as many in foreseeable future if the SSN allocations are not substantially raised and efforts taken to avoid abuse of funds. As for the execution and efficacy of the programmes, one important finding, according to analysts, is the overlapping nature of the programmes under various ministries. Around 140 SSN programmes are currently being implemented by 23 ministries, a large number of which suffer from overlapping in various forms. Besides, due to the lack of coordination and monitoring of progress in a proper manner, transparency and accountability are the major casualties.At a roundtable held recently speakers came up with some lacunas that they believe do not allow the social safety net schemes work in a desirable way. A good deal of these is policy related. For example, inclusion of retired government employees as beneficiaries of the SSNPs does not strike the right chord in alleviating poverty of the really needy people. Some 27 per cent of the SSN allocations go as pension to the government employees. One may argue whether to treat such allocations as truly SSN allocations given the state of the people who deserve these more than any other groups. Targeting the right groups is crucial as it is believed that wrong targeting may result in increasing poverty gaps instead of reducing it. For, not all in need of SSN protection live in similar geographies and socio-economic conditions. There is thus a critical need to look into area-specific and other related factors in determining the level of poverty. The government should prepare a detailed database of the number of people living below the poverty line, which will help the stakeholders involved in understanding the needs of different target groups and strategise result-orientated plans. Improved management of the schemes, along with an efficient use of resources and plugging the loopholes in the distribution process is important in making the social safety nets more effective. It is also important to strengthen the monitoring and supervision system relating to the implementation process to make the schemes more accountable.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "City residents had to put up with a lot of hassle in terms of dust, pollution and dug-out roads or overlapping barricaded medians while the first metro rail (MRT-6) was being built. There long delays and the project had dragged on for years, but residents put up with all the problems associated with it in the hope that one day they would ride on this advanced mode of transportation. It promised to be fast, clean and comfortable. In that regard the metro rail service has delivered. To popularise the service, the government made travel by metro rail (MRT) VAT-free. While users of all other modes of public transportation must pay variable rates of Value-Added-Tax (VAT), MRT was exempt from it. It has become more than simply a rail service---a pride of the city. The national board of revenue (NBR) has decided, in principle that the grace period is now over and intends to levy VAT on MRT fares from 2025, i.e. from next fiscal year. There has been a lot of talk against this but there are arguments for and against this proposed move. People in general are already under tremendous pressure of inflation and cost of everything has gone through the roof and stayed there. The metro service provided much reprieve to the people who had previously had to suffer hours of gridlock on the streets of the MRT-6 route.That changed with the introduction of the MRT which provided a train every 10 minutes and with fares ranging from Tk20.00 - Tk100.00 have been heaven sent. No more pollution, no more sitting in non-air-conditioned modes of transportation. All this carries a price tag of course. Getting back to the subject of VAT, the NBR has made it clear that all other modes of air-conditioned public transportation are subjected to VAT payment and MRT should not be an exemption. The government for its part has kept the service VAT-free for a year and now intends to levy the same type of VAT it has imposed on other public modes of transportation, on land, water or air.The VAT law exempted passengers from paying any VAT till June 30, 2024 and this policy is being reviewed. However, given the massive popularity MRT has earned, the revenue authorities should rethink the rate of VAT imposition. According to a report published in this newspaper, it would be more prudent to impose VAT at a staggered pace. Although VAT experts have pointed out that even a 15 per cent imposition would not have a huge impact at passenger level. A Tk20.00 ticket would end up costing Tk23.00 and the highest-value ticket presently costing Tk100.00 would cost Tk115.00 What is perhaps not being talked about much is the fact that the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) has been giving incentive to passengers to procure their own travel passes that carry 10-year validity and is tied to their national ID (NID). These travel cards are pre-paid and can be topped up any time. More importantly, DMTCL gives a 10 per cent discount to passengers who have registered and procured these passes. Hence, if the government truly believes it must impose VAT at all costs, it should make more effort to popularise travel passes and the only way that can be done is by phasing out ticket vending machines gradually so that people get used to the idea of utilising travel passes. One should not forget that daily usage of the MRT since introduction in December 2022 now averages 300,000 passengers. Hence, any sudden and dramatic change to ticket price should be avoided.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The rise of the gig economy has ignited discussions surrounding workers' rights, labour laws, and economic stability in today's rapidly evolving landscape. With more individuals turning to freelance work and short-term contracts, it's imperative to explore how we can harmonise the flexibility inherent in gig work with the need to ensure fair treatment and financial security for workers. The gig economy, epitomised by platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Upwork, empowers people to work on their own terms, determining when, where, and how much they work. This flexibility is particularly enticing to those seeking to enhance their work-life balance or supplement their income. However, critics point out that gig workers often lack access to essential benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and job security.The challenges of regulating the gig economy have come to the fore through recent legal and legislative actions. Assembly Bill 5, for instance, aimed to reclassify numerous gig workers as employees rather than independent contractors, thereby granting them access to benefits and protections. Yet, this sparked controversy and faced legal challenges from gig-based enterprises, leading to the introduction of Proposition 22, which exempted certain gig companies from AB5's mandates. The impact of the gig economy extends beyond individual workers; it reverberates throughout entire economic sectors. While gig platforms drive innovation and job creation, they also raise concerns regarding income inequality, labour market dynamics, and the erosion of traditional employment structures.To navigate these challenges and safeguard workers' rights and well-being while preserving the benefits of gig work, collaboration among legislators, corporations, and labour advocates is essential. This may entail implementing portable benefits systems, exploring hybrid employment models, and fostering stakeholder dialogue to identify a common ground. Furthermore, companies operating in the gig economy must uphold ethical labour standards and ensure transparency in their dealings with workers. By prioritising fair compensation, support systems, and avenues for growth, these companies can foster sustainability and trust among gig workers.In conclusion, effectively managing the gig economy requires a nuanced approach that balances the flexibility valued by workers with the imperative for robust labour laws and stable economic conditions. By tackling these issues head-on, we can cultivate an equitable and inclusive economy that benefits all stakeholders.\nFarzana Jaman Sultana SadiaStudentNorth South University, Dhaka[email\u00a0protected]",
