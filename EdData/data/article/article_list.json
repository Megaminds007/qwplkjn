Mr. Assange is the first journalist to have been charged under the First World War era Act. Ironically, during the tenure of Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama (U.S. President Joe Biden was the Vice-President then) the Justice Department had concluded that it would not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as it would pose grave threats to the country\u2019s press freedom laws, particularly the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees freedom of expression. The cables and documents published by WikiLeaks reveal the severe abuse of international and humanitarian law, war excesses and crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. government among others, besides shining a light on the inner workings of the elite in democracies and autocracies across the world. The diplomatic cables in particular, initially released after careful redaction by media organisations, and other documents went on to form the bulwark of a large repertoire of investigative journalism. In a rational world, the perpetrators of the excesses revealed by WikiLeaks would have been pursued for justice while Mr. Assange would have been released from his harsh and extended stay in a British prison.Yet, the dogged pursuit of Mr. Assange has been renewed by the Biden administration. The only guarantee that it has provided is that it will not hold him in a maximum security prison, which has strict confinement rules, and that if convicted, he could serve his sentence in his native Australia if he requested it. Its position runs counter to its stated aim of bringing the U.S. back to the forefront of world democracies that promote values enshrined in the West as pivotal, such as freedom of expression accorded to the press. Subjecting Mr. Assange to trial will be a blow against media freedom in the U.S. and will also criminalise investigative journalism, particularly one that is pointed at the inner workings of the deep state. Mr. Assange\u2019s representatives have filed an appeal before the British High Court. With the present Labor party-led Australian government \u2014 Mr. Assange remains an Australian citizen \u2014 also expressing its displeasure at the continued pursuit, the onus is on the British judiciary to do right by him.",

        "full_article": "In the June 2017 parliamentary elections, held a few weeks after Emmanuel Macron was first elected President, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s leftist France Unbowed party won just 17 seats. Five years later, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s coalition has emerged as the second largest bloc in the French Parliament with 131 seats, clearly showing a resurgence of the left. Mr. Macron\u2019s party, Renaissance, and its allies won 245 seats, short of the 289 needed for absolute majority in the 577-member National Assembly. The far-right National Rally led by Marine Le Pen came third with 89 seats, a historic high. The results largely endorsed the trend that was visible during the presidential elections earlier this year. In the first round, the two far-right candidates \u2014 Ms. Le Pen and \u00c9ric Zemmour \u2014 and the Left\u2019s Mr. M\u00e9lenchon together polled more than 50% of votes. Mr. Macron secured a comfortable victory in the run-off, but his margin over Ms. Le Pen shrank substantially unlike in 2017 \u2014 an indicator of slow-burning voter resentment. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon read the tea leaves correctly and built a wider leftist platform to fight the parliamentary polls. He forged an alliance with socialists, communists and greens, trying to avoid a split among voters in the left of centre spectrum. Ms. Le Pen doubled down on her anti-immigrant populism. Mr. Macron, faced with a two-flank attack, could not hold his centrist fort.France\u2019s polity, traditionally dominated by the centre-right Conservatives and centre-left Socialists, has undergone structural changes. As the old consensus collapsed, Mr. Macron, a liberal populist, emerged as the guardian of the status quo. With pro-market economic policies and social liberalism, he projected himself as an alternative to the emerging new left and far-right parties. Though it helped him win back-to-back presidential elections, he could not calm rising resentment, which has finally hit his own party. The next five years will be harder for him than his previous term. He will have to stitch an alliance with the conservatives or win support from the left to drive his legislative agenda. What makes matters worse is a relentless cost-of-living crisis that has shaken western economies. France has managed to control fuel and electricity prices, for now, with a cap, but consumer price inflation has hit record levels. With a mushrooming energy crisis in the wake of Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion, France, dependent on energy imports, is facing added pressure. This explains Mr. Macron\u2019s guarded approach towards the conflict. Unlike the U.K., the U.S. or eastern European countries, he has repeatedly called for ending the war through talks. Unless the war ends, he cannot tackle the inflationary pressure effectively. And unless he tackles the cost-of-living crisis, he cannot stop the new left and the far-right from eating into his support base.",

        "full_article": "Well-known civic rights activist Mizanur Rahman's narration of his harrowing experience of being picked up by police and tortured under custody, published in this newspaper's online version on June 15, gives us some disturbing snapshots of the unlawful actions of our law enforcement agencies. As a keen follower of developments related to human rights, I am reminded of the term used by the Committee Against Torture (CAT) of the United Nations for these kinds of arbitrary and unlawful abductions by members of law enforcing agencies. It's called \"unacknowledged detentions.\" Though Mizanur's four-and-a-half-hours-long unacknowledged detention came to an end to the relief of his family, the pains and psychological distress he suffered would no doubt stay with him forever.\nIs this unacknowledged detention of Mizanur an exception or deviation in policing practices? Unfortunately, recent trends suggest it has become a preferred tactic to bypass the mandatory legal requirement of producing the suspect before a magistrate within 24 hours. People disappear like characters of a fictional thriller and, if luck favours, they reappear, shown arrested just hours before from some strange place and produced before a court with a petition for remand. The UNCAT, in its concluding observation published on August 26, 2019 said, \"The Committee is seriously concerned at numerous, consistent reports that the State party's officials have arbitrarily deprived persons of their liberty, subsequently killed many of them and failed to disclose their whereabouts or fate. Such conduct is defined in international human rights law as enforced disappearance, whether or not the victim is killed or reappears later.\"\nIn Mizanur's case, when police picked him up from Bikrampur Plaza, he was misled into believing that it would be just a normal chat with the Deputy Commissioner. But soon he realised that something was not right and managed to inform his daughter. Soon afterwards, he was surrounded by several other police personnel and huddled into a car. In the car, they started misbehaving with him and snatched away his mobile phone. While his family members contacted the local police station, Shyampur Thana, law enforcement members expressed their ignorance about his detention. Though, at that time, he was either in their custody or was just being handed over to the Detective Branch (DB).\nUnlike other victims of unacknowledged detention, Mizanur gave a vivid description of the demeaning behaviour he was subjected to by a senior officer at the Shyampur police station and the physical torture he had to endure there. In his words, \"At one point, the female officer ordered that I be beaten up. A policeman was standing there with a stick. Once ordered, he beat me hard several times.\" He added, \"I have so far fought a lot to live with self-respect. Being beaten like this was unacceptable to me. Yes, I have been beaten up before on the road while protesting some cause. But being beaten up like this just for saying something really hurt my self-respect. I could hardly speak. I had never felt so helpless. It also enraged me,\" he said. He was not allowed to drink any water and was kept standing the whole time (about an hour) at the police station. He was threatened with the possible arrest of his wife and daughters as they too sometimes stood by him during civic protests.\nAfterwards, Mizanur along with another arrestee were handcuffed, blindfolded and taken in a car to the DB headquarters. His blindfold was only removed after he was taken to a high official's office there. But, there too, he was threatened that he could be falsely implicated in cases such as illegal possession of yaba. Later, after another three hours of mental agony, his family was called in and he was finally let go, most likely as a result of the alarm raised by other social activists and the constant enquiries from the media.\nMany of us, including his family, had felt relieved that he was lucky enough to have been found alive and freed, unlike many other victims of enforced or involuntary disappearances. Thereby, not many voices have sought accountability of the officials responsible for his unlawful abduction or unacknowledged detention and torture under custody. Mizanur's detention was the precise kind that was unacknowledged, as there won't be any official records of police ever picking him up without a warrant, interrogating him without the presence of his lawyer, subjecting him to dehumanising or cruel behaviour and beating him under custody, keeping him blindfolded and hand-cuffed. All these acts are defined as torture under our law.\nIt all happened despite the fact that Mizanur was not a suspect for any criminal acts or named in any cases anywhere in the country. He is, however, famous for his unique protests demanding safe drinking water from the supplying authority, Dhaka Wasa. He is also known to have taken part in other civic protests and for expressing opinions critical of the government and state entities, including the police, for corruption and irregularities.\nWhat Mizanur encountered since he was picked up from Bikrampur Plaza till his release are punishable offences under our own law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, 2013. There are further stipulations by the Supreme Court in implementing the Act due to reported allegations of such violence, particularly in the context of custodial situations where law enforcement agencies seek to obtain confessional statements from the arrestees following arrest or detention. The UNCAT, too, in its final observation, recommended that the government should \"[u]nambiguously affirm at the highest level\u2026 that law enforcement authorities must immediately cease engaging in the practice of unacknowledged detention.\" The Supreme Court's guidelines were issued in 2016, three years before the UNCAT's recommendations.\nWe need an end to unacknowledged detention and custodial torture. And it should begin with an independent investigation into Mizanur's unacknowledged detention. Without accountability of the perpetrators of such unlawful brutality and torture, they won't end.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist and writes from London, UK.

        "full_article": "From a small village-level local government election to the larger parliamentary polls, every election is a learning opportunity \u2013 that's the beauty of a working democracy. The recently concluded Cumilla City Corporation election was no different. Now, it's completely up to the stakeholders \u2013 the Election Commission (EC), the contending political parties, the voters, the observers, etc. \u2013 to decide what they are going to do with these \"lessons\", whether they're going to do anything differently the next time, or make the same mistakes again.\nInterestingly, the only stakeholder that seems to be making decisions based on these lessons are the voters. In the last city corporation polls in Cumilla 10 years ago, over seven out of every 10 voters turned up to vote. This time, the turnout was less than 60 percent.\nAlthough six out of 10 is still quite high in the national context, it is quite low for Cumilla. This decrease could be a reflection of the general voters' fast-depleting trust in the election process. It could be that they don't have confidence in the EC to ensure a level-playing field for all the contestants or that their votes would make any difference in determining the final result.\nIn all fairness, the \"rookie\" commissioners assumed office at a time when the EC's credibility is in ruins. None of the ECs in the past decade has managed to hold free and fair elections, barring a few stray ones. With this massive baggage, the Cumilla city poll was truly the first real test of character for the EC.\nThe EC was turned into a laughing stock when the local ruling party lawmaker blatantly ignored its order to stay out of the city before and during the election, and the EC did absolutely nothing to enforce it. So, we will have to wait and see what the EC does to recover from this embarrassment.\nThe Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said that the EC cannot do anything against a lawmaker if he \"dishonours\" the commission's directives. But that is not true. If the commission thinks that someone's interference can hamper the holding of a free and fair election, the commission can postpone it.\nFormer election commissioner Brigadier General (retd) M Sakhawat Hossain said that during the first election in Cumilla in 2012, when a minister went to the election area, the commission, through the returning officer, sent a message that if the minister did not leave the area within an hour, the election would be postponed. The minister then left the area.\nThe failure by this commission to take such a bold step raises the question: If the EC cannot control one lawmaker, how will it control 300 lawmakers in the next parliamentary polls? The last-minute drama over the announcement of the election result also raised questions over its competency to hold fair polls.\nThe Awami League and BNP also have major takeaways from the election. For the BNP, the lesson is crystal clear: The party cannot afford to lose elections by allowing its local level leaders to \"cannibalise\" each other. For the ruling AL, it's a major wakeup call ahead of next year's national elections. Although the AL barely escaped with a close victory in Cumilla this year because the opposition tent was not united, it's a clear indication that the anti-incumbency factor is very much in effect now.\nAlthough the election was partisan in nature, the ruling AL candidate contested the election with the party symbol, while his main contender, expelled BNP leader Monirul Haque Sakku, contested it with the clock symbol. This gave Rifat an upper hand.\nThe AL candidate got around 38 percent of the total votes cast. Usually, it is estimated that AL has around 40 percent of votes in the country. In that sense, AL's vote bank remained almost intact even after staying in office for the last 13 years at a stretch. But the party could not bag the floating votes, and it is probably because of the anti-incumbency factor. So, AL needs to think about the floating votes if it really wants to compete in the upcoming national elections. Otherwise, it will face a serious setback in the next polls.\nOn the other hand, although BNP boycotted the election, two of its leaders contested the polls and together got around 80,000 votes. The BNP candidates lost as their votes were split. But they bagged around 60 percent of the votes. The BNP's vote bank is estimated to be less than 40 percent. So, the result showed that it got the votes of the floating voters.\nThe lesson for BNP is that if it can choose the proper candidates and remain on the field till the last minute of the polls, it has a good chance in the next elections. But again, a good election is not entirely dependent on the BNP. The election result also showed that AL's votes did not increase \u2013 rather its candidate won the polls by taking advantage of the vote split of the two expelled BNP candidates.\nThe most important factor that drew my attention was the lack of festivity and enthusiasm over voting. In recent times, almost all the local government elections were one-sided. And many of the times, those who were elected won the elections uncontested. Even in Cumilla polls, two ward councillors were elected uncontested. That is perhaps why people have lost trust in the electoral system.\n\u00a0\nMohammad\u00a0Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Years ago, when I was about eight-years-old, I heard a teacher say that a woman's lungs are stronger than a man's. It sounded strange even to my young and untrained ears. When I asked my mother, she first snapped at the absent teacher, but then explained how in our world, a boy child is valued far more than a girl. And it starts at the cradle \u2013 people rush in when a baby boy cries, but not a baby girl. Hence her lungs are stronger because they get more exercise.\nThe explanation still did not make sense. I was yet to understand what being a woman meant. In our country, most girls are raised with the expectation of fairy-tale marriages. A dream is spun for her with hopes of beautiful dresses, jewellery, a loving husband, and children. She is also taught that however educated, she cannot be happy or fulfilled until she is married. It's as though that fairy-tale is meant to compensate for being taught that girls are softer and lesser than boys in every sphere of life.\nAfter marriage, with her dreams of a happy household, the girl suddenly is faced with the politics of her in-laws. In most cases, she needs permission from her husband and in-laws to even visit her parents. She is tested in various ways by her new family members. These tests are mostly demeaning and often abusive. Her life is dictated by the expectations of others in her new family \u2013 including when to have children, whether she can continue her studies, or have a career. However, if she complains about these ordeals, she is told that the happiness of a woman lies in making other people happy, not herself. The definition of \"happily ever after\" suddenly changes \u2013 it was never her happiness that was intended, but that of others \u2013 her husband, her children, and her in-laws. People nod in approval when they find such a selfless woman. In other words, a woman's selfhood must be sacrificed for the welfare of the society. The ideal existence society intends for her is one of self-abnegation.\nWhen I was growing up, I heard people describe my maternal grandmother as a woman of great prowess. She had given birth to fourteen children, including two that died in infancy, and managed her huge household with capable hands. She rose early in the morning before anybody else, and was the last one to go to bed. As a child, I only saw her as a loving nanu who readily fulfilled my wishes. But now when I look back, I also see that she was a woman who was denied her own dreams. Married off at age 12 and unable to fulfil her own desire for higher education, she devoted herself to raising her children to be successful in life. That was the best that she could have.\nMany would say that times have changed now and women have become independent. As I look around, I see that things have become even more difficult when women are working and taking care of the household at the same time. She is continuously urged to be perfect, even more of a goddess than her mother and grandmother. If something goes wrong with her children, it is invariably her fault because she did not give them enough time. Few notice her financial contribution to the family and even condemn her for buying sarees or personal items with her earnings. I have heard educated men make snide remarks like, \"Women work because they are not happy with their husbands' earnings,\" or \"Working women make bad mothers.\"\nTo be successful as a woman means withstanding societal pressure from all quarters, and having to brace themselves for each day as if nothing is wrong. Women are supposedly the weaker sex, but the reality is that to be independent and successful in a patriarchal setting, a woman has to be far stronger than her male counterparts. To establish herself, she has to encounter far more obstacles than a man.\nA strong woman, then, is one who has endured extreme difficulty, even harassment or abuse, and learnt to live with it as best she can. Have you wondered why these women are sometimes referred to as crazy or eccentric? A sane man apparently cannot imagine leading the life of a woman because that life is too restrained and limited. And yet a woman is made to live such a life because she is not a man.\nBy hailing these women as \"strong\" and worthy of admiration, society recognises their suffering with grudging respect, while also endorsing and perpetuating their ordeals: \"She is a strong woman and she can bear anything.\" Just because women have bravely borne ill treatment doesn't mean that it is justified. It is high time to look upon a woman as a full human being, not just as somebody's mother, wife, sister, or daughter who will sacrifice her life and ambitions for the \"greater good\" of society.\n\u00a0\nSohana Manzoor\u00a0is Associate Professor, Department of English & Humanities, ULAB.

        "full_article": "It was pitch-dark when I entered Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital on Saturday afternoon. The ground floor was submerged in knee-high floodwater. I climbed up the stairs to the first floor to find an elderly patient named Ana Miah lying on the floor.\nAs the ground floor of the hospital got flooded that morning, all the patients were moved to the first floor. Ana Miah was struggling to breathe, no oxygen available for him as the central oxygen line had been disconnected, thanks to the power outage that engulfed not just the hospital, but the entire Sylhet district.\nWhile this is the scenario in the city, one can only imagine the suffering the people in the remote areas of Sylhet and Sunamganj have been enduring since Wednesday. Just imagine: Your house is under floodwater, there's no electricity, your phone is out of charge and mobile network, there's no food or any hope of being rescued.\nPeople from outside the flooded region, who have family members and/or friends stranded in the area, are similarly distressed as they can't contact their loved ones. Social media is swamped with posts from worried users seeking any update about their stranded loved ones or any information of rescue attempts.\nAfter several attempts, I managed to establish contact with some remote areas. All I heard was people in distress, pleading to be rescued. Even the shelters in the remote areas are waiting for relief.\nAll means of connectivity are gone. One can hardly find a boat to wade through the flood; the boatmen who are willing to give a ride are asking for an exorbitant amount of fare. Sylhet Deputy Commissioner Md Mozibor Rahman said even the administration is struggling to find boats to extend rescue and relief work to the remote areas. Police, army, navy and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel, as well as the general public, are trying to provide help in any way possible.\nBut what shocks me is the nonchalant attitude of our public representatives. Most of the MPs, upazila and union chairmen, and city and municipality councillors are absent in this moment of crisis. Only a few people, like Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment Minister Imran Ahmed, were seen coming to his constituency to extend humanitarian support to the distressed people.\nAnd I have been seeing a general lacklustre attitude towards flood management for a while. Since the flash floods in 2017 destroyed Boro harvest in the country's northeast region, I have been constantly searching for a concrete explanation as to why floods have been so devastating in the region in recent times.\nThe answer is complex. Experts have tried to explain it in many ways, but it boils down to a combination of climate change, destruction of hills, deforestation, unplanned development work in the wetlands, and the massive loss of navigability in all the rivers in the upper and lower Meghna basin.\nAll of these reasons are the results of human actions.\nHas the government come up with any solutions to manage floods? I see none. After repeated calls from concerned citizens, it is rather disappointing to see the government only focused on infrastructural development, with little to no concern about conserving nature and the environment.\nSeveral concerned organisations and citizens have already urged the authorities to declare the flood-affected areas as a \"disaster zone,\" per the Disaster Management Act, 2012. Doing so will empower the local administrations to work more extensively and ease getting adequate support from all government offices.\nThe flood is just the beginning of the disaster. It will take months to rehabilitate the affected population and rebuild what has been damaged by the calamity. I hope the authorities concerned are preparing for that.\n\u00a0\nDwoha Chowdhury\u00a0is a journalist at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "It's alarming to know the devastating effects of natural disasters, particularly floods, that caused damage worth of Tk 1,79,198.8 crore in the country from 2015 to 2020, as revealed recently by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The BBS report says that loss and damage that households faced increased tenfold during this time, compared to the period of 2009-2014. Of the total loss incurred by the households, flooding alone accounted for 56.4 percent. They were also affected by cyclones and hailstorms.\nWhile people in the lowest-income group lose 97.17 percent of their earnings during the period of a disaster, it's only 9.33 percent for the highest income group, the report adds. We, in fact, do not need much research to know that it is the lowest-income people who are the worst-affected during any kind of natural disaster, including flood, because they're the ones involved in agriculture and other income-generating activities related to nature. In Sylhet and Sunamganj, for example, where millions of people have been affected by the ongoing flood, many have lost all their belongings and are living under the open sky with no food. Needless to say, many were involved in farming before. They cultivated paddy in the hope of a bumper production but are now barely trying to survive. When the flood water recedes \u2013 it might still take some time for that to happen \u2013 it is the farmers and such low-income people who will have to struggle more to get back on their feet again.\nWhile the affected people now need government relief and all kinds of assistance to pass through this difficult time, we have seen how the government has failed to provide them that. Since flood in Bangladesh is a regular phenomenon, there can be no justification for the lack of preparation of the government agencies concerned. We expected a well-planned relief operation from them, but instead were met with frustration. This begs the question: will the government be able to give the affected people necessary support, including for rehabilitation and income opportunities, after the flood water recedes?\nThe government must have special allocations for the flood victims this year under its social protection schemes, while its regular programmes must also continue to support the poor and vulnerable groups affected by past disasters. At the same time, steps must be taken to stop the activities that are harmful to nature \u2013 including unplanned development, earth-filling in water bodies, and destruction of hills. Any development, big or small, in the coastal areas should be planned in line with the government's climate change policy, otherwise it will lead to more disasters like floods and cause higher economic losses, affecting the low-income people even more.\n",

According to a report by\u00a0The Daily Star, the cabinet on June 20 gave its final approval to the draft of the Universal Pension Management Act, 2022, which is now awaiting a nod from the Legislative Division. Reportedly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 can participate in the pension scheme, including expatriate Bangladeshis. Those participating will have to provide a premium for at least 10 years to get pension from the age of 60 until their death. The amount of premium will be determined by a rule under the proposed law. The law further proposes the establishment of a five-member national pension authority headed by a chairman, and also a 15-member governing body with the finance minister at its helm.\nThe main target of the scheme is to bring the growing elderly population of the country under a sustainable social safety net programme, which we are badly missing. As the percentage of elderly people is set to increase from 11 percent in 2017 to 20 percent in 2031, it is high time for the government to set up and introduce such a scheme. However, as is the case with nearly every government scheme in Bangladesh, the effectiveness of the scheme is not guaranteed \u2013 without checking corruption and mismanagement.\nIntroducing the scheme may already prove to be a challenge for the government due to its increased expenditure and low revenue collection. The issue of accountability and good governance, no doubt, will again be at the forefront. As such, designing the institutional and legal framework to check any scope for irregularities now, and in the future, will be key. Proper management of this fund will be crucial. Therefore, the government must ensure the maintenance of proper checks and balances, and nurture the technical ability of those who will be handling such a vital task.\nWhile we congratulate the government for planning to introduce this pro-people scheme, ultimately, the people will only benefit from it if the government can ensure full accountability and transparency in its application. We hope the government remains conscious of its poor record when it comes to the implementation phase of such schemes, and works doubly hard to ensure this scheme can avoid those traditional pitfalls.\n",

        "full_article": "Over 500 trains were cancelled yesterday following protests against Agnipath. The cancellation follows instances of arson and wilful destruction of railway property last week. Yet again, Indian Railways (IR) has been made collateral damage. In the pre-pandemic period, IR carried about 22 million passengers a day, a measure of the scale of its importance. Cancellations not only directly inconvenience millions but undermine the economy as railway rakes transport 3.3 million tons of freight daily, mainly coal. This senseless destruction and related disruption should not be shrugged off.\nIR is the lightning rod of protests primarily because of its importance. Disrupting railway service attracts wide attention. While IR is unconnected to the cause of violence, can it do better in protecting its assets? IR\u2019s security is overseen by its own force, Railway Protection Force (RPF), and backed by central legislation. As trains crisscross states, state governments also come into the picture. Government Railway Police (GRP), funded equally by IR and states but under the administrative control of the local government, and local police assist in safeguarding railway assets and passengers.\nRPF doesn\u2019t lack attention. It\u2019s not only empowered to arrest without a magistrate\u2019s order, in 2019 handpicked personnel were given commando training. If IR\u2019s security performance is still unsatisfactory, it\u2019s because of gaps in coordination with the state police. This was examined in detail in a 2011 CAG performance audit of IR\u2019s security. GRP and state police forces handle security of trains, tracks and railway premises, while RPF protects properties and consignments. The performance of local policing is influenced by a state government\u2019s political signalling. Consequently, the leeway agitations get has a direct impact on IR\u2019s assets.\nIn this unfavourable environment, CAG\u2019s report observed that a unified overseeing arrangement between RPF and state police is missing. In short, there are coordination problems that IR has not addressed. Given last week\u2019s destruction, it\u2019s clear coordination gaps remain unplugged. Their cost will be borne by people who rely on IR. Between FY-2016 and FY-2020, losses on passenger service rose from Rs 36,286 crore to Rs 63,364 crore. Given GoI\u2019s fiscal challenges and limited rail budgets, willy-nilly people dependent on train travel will suffer. RPF, headed by a police officer on deputation, needs to strengthen its coordination protocols with local police. Trains can\u2019t be such easy targets for arsonists.\n\n",

They\u2019re also showcasing a political drama \u2013 centred around CM Nitish Kumar\u2019s dilemmas. State BJP leaders have sharpened their attacks on Nitish, blaming him for poor policing. Nitish\u2019s position on caste census, rewriting history books and population control had earlier discomfited BJP. But, still, the alliance chugs on from one controversy to the next.\nBJP and RJD with 77 and 75 legislators respectively have reduced JD(U)\u2019s 45 MLAs to a small but crucial party in Bihar\u2019s 243-member assembly. Recall JD(U) had 115 legislators in 2010. In office almost continuously since 2005, anti-incumbency is predictably harshest on Nitish. Young male voters who thronged Tejashwi Yadav\u2019s rallies in 2020 were a signal to Nitish to hand over the baton to ally BJP, which effectively targeted women voters with central schemes. It was BJP\u2019s impressive showing that helped NDA cross the finish line, but Nitish walked away with the crown.\nNitish now faces the choice of being an increasingly unhappy ally of BJP and remaining CM or crossing over to RJD, in which case he will almost certainly not be the CM face in next polls. The problem here is that JD(U)\u2019s political future is entirely determined by Nitish\u2019s calculations about his status. Even if it makes sense for JD(U) to switch to RJD again \u2013 the two combined had swept away BJP in 2015 \u2013 Nitish may not take that call. Protecting his place in Bihar politics being the bigger objective. Person over party can be a costly folly, as Gandhis-led Congress has shown.

        "full_article": "Govt can offer 50 per cent posts in technical wings for a few years directly, increase DA, gratuity and insurance cover\nThe government\u2019s recently announced Agnipath scheme for recruitment of youth in the three wings of military\u2014the Army, the Air Force and the Navy\u2014has been met with violent agitation in many parts of the country.\nThe scheme, \u2018a tour of duty,\u2019 usually is a period spent by soldiers in combat or in a hostile environment. This scheme precisely provides this opportunity to the patriotic and motivated youth to serve the defence forces. Many countries allow their youthsto serve for a few years in the Army which brings a feeling of patriotic fervour among them. It also creates reserve combatants at the time of emergency.\nIn India, the government allows a 10-year service, with an option of a four-year extension, as commissioned officers through the short-service commission. Previously\u2014during 1948, 1962 and 1965\u2014officers were recruited under the Emergency Commission to meet the shortage.\nThe Agnipath scheme is a similar scheme for the non-officer cadre with the difference that it would be the only way to enter three Indian defence forces. If implemented properly based on merit and transparency, it will be one of the most forward-looking revolutionary steps taken by the government post-Independence for the modernisation of the defence forces.\nThe scheme will make the Indian military younger: the average age of soldiers, which is 32 years now, will be reduced to 26 year in due course. This will also reduce other expenditures which can be diverted to modernise and make them technologically equipped to fight modern wars, while promoting youngsters to join armed forces for a short period.\nThe question is: why has the scheme become politicised? Youths have taken to the streets, with many indulging in violence and arson. There are institutions and forums to express dissent but of late hooliganism and road blockages have become the norm. Most of the time, such stirs are taken over by external as well as internal anti-national forces. Such protests cause immense hardship for the people.\nThe government to a certain extent must share the blame. Howsoever good a scheme may be, it must be introduced after wide consultations with the stakeholders. Especially after the experience of farmers\u2019 agitation, one would have thought that the government would learn this lesson; for good laws had to be rolled back by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nFor the Agnipath scheme the Ministry of Defence should have invited public comments and then announced it rather than the government now saying 10 per cent vacancies in Central police organisations will be reserved for Agniveers and also increased the upper age to 23.\nA few anti-social elements backed by frustrated leaders are waiting to cash in on such opportunities, as they know they can force a rollback and the police cannot take strong action even if they indulge in arson and violence.\nAs a student of resource management, this writer would like to suggest the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister that the concept of Agnipath is definitely a revolutionary one which needs to be introduced in a gradual manner. We must also be aware about our socio-economic conditions.\nFurther, there is the possibility of the militarisation of youth. Some thought should go to a difficult question: what will happen if the energies of the youth, with four years of military training, are not channelised carefully after their return from the Army.\nThe government should continue to fill up at least 50 per cent posts in technical wings for a few years directly on a regular basis till the efficacy of Agnipath is ensured. Second, there is no provision for Gorkhas of Nepal who are a very vital part of the Indian Army and a shining example of Indo-Nepal ties.\nThird, the caste, religion and region-wise constitutions of regiments must not be abandoned as it has been a big motivational factor. Fourth, it should be possible to have a provision of four years\u2019 extension for the Agniveers without any pension liability. Fifth, the government must suitably enhance its monthly contribution, allow dearness allowance and give a gratuity of 10 lakh in addition to what has been promised.\nSixth, the insurance cover of Rs 44 lakh for a young Agniveer is on a lower side. It should be at least Rs 1 crore.\nLast but not the least, the verbal and executive instructions are pooh-poohed by political leaders and bureaucracy. Therefore, some percentage of posts in police and other uniformed services, both under the Central as well as in states and also in private sector should be reserved for eligible Agniveers by an Act of Parliament. If these suggestions are considered, the scheme may well change the future of Indian defence forces as well as the mindset of our youth.\nAfter all, change is a must and it is inevitable.\nThe writer is Chairman, Centre for Resource Management and Environment",

It is being claimed that the experimental drug Daratumumab, which is required to treat Musharraf\u2019s medical condition, is currently unavailable in Pakistan. The former General\u2019s ailment, known medically as Amyloidosis, is a rare disease that occurs when an abnormal protein builds up in an individual\u2019s organs and interferes with the normal functions. Earlier reports had claimed that the Pakistan military\u2019s ex-military dictator, 78, who is in a UAE hospital for the past three weeks in a critical condition with no possibility of recovery, may be brought back to Pakistan in an air ambulance as the nation\u2019s powerful Army establishment \u201cfully stands behind\u201d its former chief. But the family remains apprehensive and has stated that it has to consider medical, legal as well as security challenges before Musharraf\u2019s return to Pakistan. Musharraf ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008. He came to power in a bloodless coup in 1999, deposing the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, largely because Musharraf\u2019s relations with Nawaz Sharif were not comfortable from the outset.\nHe had to cope with the latter\u2019s penchant for interfering in Army postings. The former Pakistan Army chief was the main architect of the covert, though failed, Kargil war on India in 1999. Four years old during Partition, when his family moved from their Nehar Wali Haveli home in Old Delhi, Musharraf grew up in middle-class environs in Karachi, where his father served as an accountant in the Foreign Ministry and later during the latter\u2019s seven-year posting in Turkey. He studied in Forman Christian College, Lahore, before joining the Army in 1961 and ultimately rose to become the General. Facing impeachment following the elections in 2008, Musharraf was forced to resign as the Pakistan President and soon after went into self-imposed exile in Dubai. Earlier in Pakistan, he was charged with high treason and given a death sentence in 2019 for suspending the Constitution. Later, however, his death sentence was suspended. But there still lingers the threat of Musharraf facing a number of cases if he is brought back to Pakistan, as indicated by the country\u2019s federal minister Javed Latif.",

        "full_article": "Of the many previous reports related to the fast worsening of air pollution in Bangladesh, the latest one is highly alarming. It comprises the shortening of the average life expectancy of Bangladeshis by 6.9 years. The new study calls Bangladesh the world's \"most polluted country\". The results of the analysis blame the non-stop air pollution for the situation. It has found some areas in the country, including Dhaka, being in situations much worse than average. It says this air pollution cuts lives short by nearly nine years in Dhaka, the most polluted city in the country. The depressing piece of news comes from the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute contained in its latest Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). Even four to five decades ago, Dhaka used to be recognised as a city having a tolerably pollution-free atmosphere. And the country as a whole, dependent on agriculture and nestled in a rural sylvan environment, still remained out of reckless urbanisation. In terms of atmospheric purity, it stood in stark contrast to the frenziedly developing India and some of its major cities. In a weird change of course, Bangladesh had to jump on the bandwagon of unplanned industrial development --- and thus opening the floodgate of air and water pollution of varied kinds. Finally, the worst form of the environmental scourge lingered on to plague the lives of people in capital Dhaka. Global surveys couldn't wait longer to declare Dhaka as the most polluted city in the world. The plight of the densely populated and recklessly industrialised Bangladesh capital kept deepening.According to the new study, in Dhaka, air pollution is significantly higher than the national average of 88.9 micrograms per cubic metre. It leads to the Dhaka dwellers losing more than eight years of life expectancy on average. In the second-largest city of Chattogram, residents are losing 6.6 years. The researchers have homed in on hazardous floating particles that damage the lungs. There is, however, an upbeat piece of news. According to it, in no region in the world is the opportunity for improved health and life expectancy greater than in South Asia. The region includes four of the five most polluted countries in the world. The AQLI data show that the average person in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan would live five years longer if pollution levels were cut down to meet the guidelines specified by WHO. It's now clear that South Asia in general has lately occupied the prime focus. Due to the region's high population and pollution concentrations, it accounts for 52 per cent of total life years lost globally due to particulate pollution going past the guideline of World Health Organisation. As has been detected by the revised satellite-supplied PM2.5 data, Bangladesh had pollution concentration of 75.8 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020. It meant 13.1 per cent increase in pollution during a year, when Covid-19 lockdowns were in place. Surprisingly, while during this period the pollution level marked a significant increase over the 2019 level of 67 micrograms per cubic metre, pollution in Bangladesh remained consistently high over the past decade. Given these facts, the data on the increase in air pollution point the finger at Bangladesh. As it explains, while India contains the most polluted air in some of its regions, Bangladesh remains in place as the most polluted country in the world. Conclusions like this come from global pollution watchdogs. Mere ruing will not help. For its unbridled air pollution followed by reduced life expectancy, it's the country itself which has to pay the price by exercising self-restraint.",

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the country's 6th Population and Housing Census on June 15. The week-long national census is set to be concluded on June 21. Being held every 10 years, the population census plays a critical role in charting out national socio-economic policies, plans for facing many a hurdle that stands in the nation's progress --- and fixing the sloppy steps taken in the previous censuses. Be they developed and rich or LDCs, no nation can afford to bypass the state-sponsored massive programme held at intervals. Conducting a successful national census is a massive project, indeed. However, there are flipsides to this nationally important programme. The general people in a few countries, including many educated ones, do not bother much about the population and housing censuses. Bangladesh is one of them. But the bare fact is for Bangladesh a correct population and housing census has lately emerged as a sine qua non of sorts. Experts call it highly critical, as the country has long been putting in its best of efforts to graduate from its LDC status to that of a developing one. An incorrect census might create trouble for Bangladesh, which has embarked on a number of ambitious projects apart from the LDC graduation.However, radical attitudinal changes have taken place since the last Population and Housing Census that took place in 2011. The ongoing edition of the decennial (10-yearly) census was scheduled to be held in 2021. But it was postponed due to the raging corona pandemic and other reasons.The first-ever population census in Bangladesh was held in 1974. Since then the government-funded Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has been conducting the census once in a decade. Accordingly, the later censuses were held countrywide in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. The present one, the 6th national population census --- delayed by one year, began rolling on June 15. That the government is attaching special emphasis to the nationwide project comes clear with the week-long census being carried out this time digitally. According to BBS, a total of 365,697 enumerators have been engaged for the task of collecting population and housing data from every corner of the country. In place of the earlier practice of the analogue system, the data collection for the 6th Population Census will be carried out through the digital system. To make this grand objective fruitful, the young smart enumerators, both male and female, have been equipped with the necessary digital paraphernalia. Each of the members of a team has been given a tab. On the Prime Minister's directive, the BBS has done away with pen/pencil and paper from this year. It is mainly the smart, educated and enthusiastic youths, who have been given the task of completing headcount and collecting other information about the family members, and also their overall living conditions including their earning sources. Under the headcount, floating populations have not been left out. From this year, the trans-genders will also be brought under the survey. Given the heavy load of the assignment, which requires the enumerators to resort to various techniques of eliciting correct information about the respondents, the enumerators' task warrants special state patronage and all-out infrastructural backing. Alongside being stationed in the capital and the other urban areas, teams comprising hardy members, have also been dispatched to villages, some located in remote and veritably inaccessible areas. The Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT) and mid-river Chars are among them. The assignment of an enumerator is nearly daunting, because the members in all such teams have to convince the people of lower and underprivileged classes that the census has nothing to do with eviction from their temporary shelters. The teams have to elaborate on the idea that the population census will help the government identify as to which sections of society are in need of urgent 'state support'. Apart from internal resources, the help may come from the outside --- especially in form of aid and grants. To quote people directly involved with the censuses, and as seen in many countries, the need for creating multi-faceted data bases on a least developed nation's people, their socio-economic condition, future plans for their children constitute the essence of the national project. Ironically, the queries carry little meaning for the lower segments of society. As a strategy, the experts who visualise population censuses, as well as the field-level workers, try to shun the jargons. Using them in censuses proves finally futile. They are needed most at the stage of chalking out complicated macro and micro-level socio-economic projects. While dealing with the rural underprivileged or slum-dwelling people, the pragmatic way is the formulation of a questionnaire which directly addresses their day-to-day life-related facts --- deprivations and dreams. In the cities, many socially aware people are found to be reluctant to talk much about their personal life. Not that they are afraid of the state's interference in their closely guarded privacy. They just do not want to elaborate on any familial matters, especially upon queries from strangers. In cases, even the enumerators' ID cards and other written proofs also do not work.The allegations of flawed population censuses stem chiefly from this trend of not opening up much and maintaining a safe reticence. With the increase in many social complications, including mutual distrusts, suspicions etc., information gaps are feared to keep widening. It is vigorous campaigns on the part of the agencies concerned to impress upon people the benefits of censuses; in the present social context it can ease the isolationist stances, breaking the self-spun cocoons.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Heavy downpour for days together in the Meghalaya and Assam states of India has inundated thousands of villages there. As a result, the major river systems of this region, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, are overflowing. Bangladesh, particularly, its northern and northeastern districts, being situated directly below those rainstorm-hit Indian states, the floodwater from there has flowed downstream into Sylhet and Sunamganj as flash floods. But the torrential rains in those two districts during the last few days have compounded the flood situation further. The two districts, Sylhet and Sunamganj, are literally under water. With the major roads and highways connecting Sunamganj being under water, the district is now virtually an island. More than 4 million people of these two districts, according reports till Sunday, are marooned by floodwater. In fact, the sudden deluge has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the area. However, the extreme flood situation is not limited to only the northeastern districts. Reports coming from Rangpur, Kurigram, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Netrakona, Sherpur and Sirajganj are also worrying as the rivers Brahmaputra, Jamuna and other big and small rivers in those districts have been flowing above danger marks. And as forecast by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB)'s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre and the Met office, the situation may turn for the worse. In truth, Bangladesh is no stranger to floods, rainstorms, cyclones and various other kinds of natural calamities visiting the country regularly. Small wonder that the relevant departments of the government have gained sufficient experience and expertise in meeting the emergencies created by such natural disasters. In the past, in many cases, these departments could effectively come to the aid of the victims of such calamities.But the present flood in Sylhet and Sunamganj seems to have caught the government departments concerned off guard. The flood level in those two northeastern districts have risen so fast that the expected response from either the local population or from the government's department for disaster management has been too slow and inadequate to be of any help to the flood victims.Finally, the military has been deployed to rescue the flood victims. The situation is more or less the same in the inundated Indian states and there, too, troops have been engaged in helping the flood-affected people. But is what the northern and northeastern districts of Bangladesh are faced with at the moment a one-off experience? Or is it a rehearsal of something still worse to come? If one is to believe the climatologists, perhaps, what has been happening at the moment in the northern and northeastern districts of Bangladesh is just a rehearsal of future floods, downpours, heatwaves and droughts. Such vagaries of the weather are actually going to increase in frequency as well as intensity. With these calamities originating in the mainland and in the regions beyond the border in the northeastern India are going to join the cyclones and tidal surges of greater ferocity from the Bay of Bengal in the south. And the most destructive of all is going to be the rise in the sea level leading to the salty seawater gradually engulfing the southern districts of Bangladesh. The United Nations Inter-governmental Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, during a decade or so about 17 per cent of the population of the country's southern part have to be relocated elsewhere. But however frightening it may sound, such a doomsday scenario is unavoidable unless humanity is able to arrest a further rise in global temperature. And without a concerted international effort, the climate-change-related vulnerabilities that Bangladesh is exposed to cannot be effectively addressed. In that case, the only option left before Bangladesh is to increase its level of preparedness against the impending natural disasters of the more destructive kind. And to that end equip itself with the latest knowledge and technology to fight against natural calamities. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

These lifestyle changes can reportedly reduce the risk of problems like stroke. Scientists have recently revealed another aspect of stroke prevention. A team of researchers in Spain claimed that living close to nature greatly reduces the risk of stroke. The research shows that people who live within 300 meters of a forest or dense vegetation have a 16 per cent lower risk of stroke. But why is that? Experts say that the nature's approach helps maintain good physical and mental health in a number of ways. It is especially important to have plants around us. It maintains good mental health and reduces stress. Besides, if there is a garden nearby, people's interest for walking also increases, which keeps us in good health. If we have more green places, we will experience less pollution. Monsoon is here. If we have understood the importance of green trees, we should cut down fewer trees and plant many more of them. \nAshikujaman Syed,Research Assistant,Bioinformatics Research Lab,Center for Research Innovation and Development (CRID),[email\u00a0protected]",
