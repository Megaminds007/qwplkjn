A cynical view will regard this as action done under duress \u2014 between February 2, 2021 and February 28, 2022, Twitter was issued directions to block 1,474 accounts and 175 tweets in India, with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology suggesting in June that it was giving the company a final opportunity to comply with the directions. But a substantive look at the challenge in the court by the company \u2014 39 URLs in specific in its petition \u2014 suggests that Twitter is right to take up the gauntlet. Much of the content in these URLs deemed to be fit for takedowns is either journalistic or of a political nature, or even dissent. For example, some of the tweets were by farmers and others during their agitations against the farm laws. Twitter is also accurate in suggesting that the Government has not complied with rules under the Information Technology (IT) Act which call for a hearing of the author of the content besides the intermediary before any takedown action. The provision of these rules was one of the key reasons why the Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of Section 69A of the IT Act (in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, 2015), which empowers the Government to restrict access to online content in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of the country, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or for public order. It is quite clear that the Union government has used the public order and national security argument in a blanket manner to get Internet platforms such as Twitter to take down content or to seek removal of profiles even if they merely constituted political dissent or were not remotely connected to the reasons proffered by it.The Internet and telecommunications system has become an even greater behemoth than what it was when the IT Act was framed in 2000. To expand the scope of regulations to the new forms of intermediaries that have cropped up since then, the Government most recently came up with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which, besides bringing about obligations for accountability from social media companies and platforms, went on to add onerous requirements such as traceability of online conversations and new oversight functions that are weighted in the Government\u2019s favour. Twitter\u2019s case in the Karnataka High Court should lead to greater scrutiny of the Rules and to a clear legislative debate on how to remake them in a way that they do not impinge on the right to freedom of expression and privacy in the online space.",

Instead, he is peerless in how he absorbs an opponent\u2019s most devastating play, seizes crucial moments and flips the narrative within a blink of an eye. No one in living memory has anticipated, moved and defended a grass court quite like the 35-year-old Serb. On Sunday, he brought to the fore all these facets to clinch his seventh Wimbledon crown \u2014 fourth on the trot \u2014 and a 21st Grand Slam title. Admittedly, the grass at SW19 is slower and the bounce truer than earlier times, helping consummate all-courters like Djokovic. But the run of Nick Kyrgios to the final \u2014 albeit after a walk-over against an in-form but injured Nadal in the semi-final \u2014 was enough evidence that the surface still offers purchase to those willing, and able, to play traditional grass-court tennis. Kyrgios did this for a set, bouncing off the audience\u2019s energy like a showman would in a theatre. Wimbledon, in fact, has come to be his safe space, where he is still loved and not judged despite his boorish behaviour from time to time. Yet Djokovic, the ultimate diffuser, displayed patience and tactical endurance, the lack of which proved Kyrgios\u2019 undoing yet again.For Djokovic, the Australian Open may have brought the most success (record nine titles), but it is Wimbledon that has proved more momentous. Pete Sampras\u2019s maiden triumph in 1993 sparked his interest in tennis and he has now equalled the legendary American\u2019s tally at Wimbledon. Victory in 2018 resurrected his career after a prolonged slump and the latest win is sure to galvanise him again, after the fiasco in Australia over his unvaccinated status and the stinging quarter-final loss to Nadal at Roland-Garros. He has now surpassed Roger Federer in the all-time Major race and is just one behind Nadal. That he has fallen to seventh in the ATP rankings because of the absence of ranking points at this year's competition will be a mere footnote. While Djokovic has been a near constant at Wimbledon, Elena Rybakina was the fifth straight first-time women\u2019s singles winner. The 23-year-old was up against the sentimental favourite in Tunisia\u2019s Ons Jabeur, bidding to become the first Arab and African woman to win a Slam trophy. There was also the awkwardness surrounding her nationality, in light of the All England club\u2019s ban on Russians and Belarusians. Rybakina was born and raised in Russia, but switched to Kazakhstan four years ago in return for funding. But she displayed remarkable mental fortitude, and with a power-packed game felled two Major winners and the World No.2 to secure tennis\u2019s most coveted prize.",

        "full_article": "GoI must follow through on the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion that India needs a comprehensive bail legislation, on the lines of the UK Bail Act. Around 70% of the prison population are undertrials, most of them poor and therefore unable to secure monetary bail. SC took note of CrPC\u2019s colonial biases that continue \u2013 police is quick to arrest citizens, and this puts poor and/or poorly educated citizens at a huge disadvantage as they are unable to take advantage of the legal system, unlike those with education and affluence and/or influence. Only progressive bail reform can blunt this inequity.\nCurrently, provisions related to arrest and interrogation, issue of warrants and summons, execution of bonds and sureties, powers of police and courts, are dispersed across CrPC and various binding SC guidelines. A law collating these in one place can check arbitrariness. But a problem, which SC notes too, is the attitude of judicial officers. SC wondered whether the low rate of conviction tends to make judges adopt a negative attitude towards bail: \u201cCourts tend to think that the possibility of a conviction being nearer to rarity, bail applications will have to be decided strictly, contrary to legal principles.\u201d\nThis is a candid admission of systemic failure. Instead of a punitive approach to bail, SC has now directed that bail applications should be disposed of within two weeks in the normal course. This is a reasonable diktat. Sometimes, bail applications are kept pending for months. Unnecessary arrest coupled with no bail is a double whammy. Inaction on bail happens in high courts too. Appeals by the convicted are pending for decades in some HCs. They deserve bail if appeals are delayed for no fault of theirs.\nSC has reiterated that arrest is a draconian measure to be used sparingly, otherwise the \u201cimpression that it is a police state\u201d will gain ground, which would be a disturbing description of a democracy. SC\u2019s scepticism over the compliance with its 2014 Arnesh Kumar judgment reveals how well-intentioned verdicts are being subverted. The judgment had directed cops to diligently record specific reasons necessitating arrest, and magistrates to grant bail if the reasons don\u2019t make a persuasive case. Disciplinary action against errant officers \u2013 in police, judiciary or executive \u2013 may produce salutary changes. But quick bail is a good corrective against unnecessary arrests.\n\n",

It\u2019s important \u2013 again \u2013 to state the facts. India will overtake China not because it has failed to control its population. It is China\u2019s population growth that has rapidly slowed down over the last decade. In fact, this is a consequence of China\u2019s decades-long one-child policy. Chinese authorities are scrambling to reverse this demographic slump \u2013 couples were allowed to have three children in 2021. Therefore, China should serve as a lesson to our political leaders on downsides of heavy-handed population control measures.\nIndia has seen its population growth decline more steadily. As per the latest NFHS-5 data, the country\u2019s total fertility rate (TFR) has actually fallen below replacement level to 2. Studies indicate that India\u2019s population will peak at 1.5-1.6 billion in the decade between 2040 and 2050. Following that the population will contract and is expected to fall below the billion mark by 2100.\nIndia\u2019s problem is not population, it\u2019s policy. Five states have TFR significantly more than replacement level \u2013 Bihar (2.98), Meghalaya (2.98), UP (2.35), Jharkhand (2.26) and Manipur (2.17). Of these, Bihar and UP are populous states with particularly low levels of education and non-farm employment. It\u2019s only when the young are taught reasonably well, acquire useful skills, and find regular industrial/services employment that a large population becomes a huge dividend. India is failing at all three levels. We need sustained GDP growth of around 7-8% for a decade and education/vocational education policies that work on the basis of empowering local authorities and users of education services.\n\n",

        "full_article": "With the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 11 (to be publicly announced by the Speaker in parliament on July 13), we see another curve in the road for the island nation \u2013 as nothing can be termed a light at the end of the tunnel yet. The political and economic situation in Sri Lanka came to its worst starting this year, when fuel prices began to rise steeply. Since then, the lives of Sri Lankans have deteriorated miserably in quality, as they experience 10-hours-long power cuts daily, a reduction of food intake, a severe scarcity of cash, inability to work even remotely, and an overall collapsed economy. In April, the country defaulted on its USD 51-billion foreign debt and now has very little foreign currency to even import essentials. In June, the country's inflation hit a record high for the ninth consecutive month, as per government data.\u00a0\nIt seems futile to wonder why, even after one Rajapaksa brother resigned from his post of prime minister, the protests by Sri Lankans are still going on. This was never about just fighting off the nepotism practiced by the Rajapaksa dynasty. Citizens protested for months, often at the face of disproportionate response from law enforcement (leading to quite a few protesting lives lost), because they had witnessed in real time how badly the irresponsibility of those in charge had turned their livelihoods upside-down. But while protestors finally seem to have the upper hand, especially since their takeover of the Presidential palace and the burning of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe's private residence, the political crisis is far from being over until those in charge can choose leaders to be elected who will acquire the public nod.\u00a0\nWhat the 22 million people of Sri Lanka are experiencing now is certainly the worst economic crisis the island has witnessed since its independence in 1948. However, the crisis is also a testament to what happens when politicians heading a country become self-serving or want to make a show of development, rather than serving the public. Starting from building infrastructure using borrowed foreign funds to political members of the Rajapaksa family allegedly laundering millions of Sri Lankan rupees, the wrath of the public against this family and their government has been building up for some years now.\u00a0\nWe urge the international community to come to the aid of Sri Lankan citizens by providing anything from food, fuel, medication, etc. Though, given President Rajapaksa's resignation, PM Wickremesinghe is automatically made the country's acting president, it is imperative that the public is allowed to democratically elect a replacement. Most of all, we hope that peace and prosperity will finally prevail in Sri Lanka.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "The world is going through one of the worst energy crises in recent times, even if we compare it to the situation that arose out of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The 2008 economic meltdown and the consequent high oil and food prices were relatively short-lived. The Covid pandemic and then the Russia-Ukraine war have kept all energy prices very high for a long time. The world electricity demand in the second half of 2020 during the Covid lockdown period went down by three percent. Energy demand dipped drastically. In June 2020, the LNG spot price went down to USD 2.05/MMBtu, Newcastle coal was at USD 50/tonne, and oil price hit a negative value on April 20, 2020. As a result, a large number of energy supply operations, especially the small ones, shut down. The larger supply outlets also cut down operations. The world economy started recovering in early 2021 and the energy price rallied back. The economic rebound was sudden. Many of the supply operations in the coal, gas, and oil sectors could not recover at all or scale up to meet the demand. The gas sector was the worst hit and a serious supply shortage peaked the Asian spot LNG price at USD 35/MMBtu in October 2021. The high gas price put pressure on other fuels, especially coal for power production.\nNewcastle thermal coal hit USD 266/tonne at the same time \u2013 a five-time increase. The crude price increase was moderate but product (gasoline, diesel) prices kept on going up due to refinery limitations. Amid this crisis, Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The Asian LNG spot price on February 22 was USD 28/MMbtu, coal on February 25 was USD 237/tonne and Brent on February 23 was USD 99.29/bbl \u2013 all of them were at a higher level than the previous five-year averages. The fear of Russian supply disruption saw a record high price of USD 70/MMBtu and USD 412/tonne of gas and coal price, respectively, in March 2022. Currently, the gas spot price is over USD 40/MMBtu, coal at about USD 160/tonne (some demand destruction took place) and Brent at USD 105/bbl.\nHow is the world facing this challenge?\n\nThis unprecedented long period of high energy prices and supply shortage are exerting tremendous pressure on all economies \u2013 developed, developing, and poor countries are facing a serious cost-of-living challenge. Even the US, which is relatively insulated from global energy prices, is experiencing record inflation. Food supply, shipping space/container shortage, and other supply chain issues along with the energy price are threatening recession in many countries. Russia provided 40 percent of Europe's gas. It also supplies 12 percent of world's crude oil, and half of that went to Europe. The war and the subsequent sanctions have created a partial supply shortage in most European countries. As a result, gas and electricity prices have gone up by 40 percent in Europe. France, Denmark, Germany, England, Spain, the Netherlands, and other countries are paying a direct subsidy to the poorer households. Some of them are putting a price cap on utilities, forcing them to bear the cost. Spain levied a windfall tax on energy companies that made record profits and planned to distribute 2.4 billion euros to the consumers out of that revenue.\nThe high European gas price is dictating prices all over the world. Even the US gas price, which is disconnected from the external supply, is seeing a high price increase. The biggest challenge is faced by the import-dependent developing countries. China and India have reduced their LNG imports by 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Several provinces and cities in China are planning \"orderly\" electricity consumption. India suffered a widespread power outage and Coal India is going to import coal for the first time since 2015. Pakistan reduced its work days to five days a week and is restricting commercial power usage. Currently, it is generating 5,000MW less than its demand. The energy import burden of more than USD 6 billion is creating a crippling effect on its dwindling foreign currency reserves. Sri Lanka depends 60 percent on imported fuel (oil/coal) for its power production. Its mismanaged economy and almost empty foreign currency reserves have put the country into chaos.\nEven the advanced Asia and Oceania countries are facing difficulties. Apart from rate adjustment, Singapore chartered floating vessels for LNG storage to ensure supply. Japan is going for major demand-side management by asking citizens not to use air conditioners. The Australian energy minister has requested the residents of New South Wales province not to use electricity for two hours in the evening. Apart from some oil/coal/gas producing countries, every country is scrambling for austerity measures.\nBangladesh's case\n\nFor not adding generation capacity, Bangladesh faced increasing power outages from 2000 onward. The BNP government came up with oil-based rental power plants to tackle the situation that was picked up by the caretaker government, and the first 10 rental power plants were awarded in 2008. Despite initial opposition, the Awami League government had to add more oil-based rental plants from 2010. There was no other alternative to addressing the severe load-shedding, which was hampering economic growth. In the meantime, the power sector problem shifted from a lack of generation capacity, to a shortage of primary energy. In 2007, the gas shortage started with a 300 mmcfd shortfall that could never be mitigated. Today, the gas deficit is estimated at 1,300 mmcfd. Both the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010 and PSMP 2016 accepted this deficit and, instead of emphasising local exploration (although PSMP 2010 relied 30 percent on its future power generation plan from local coal, which was abandoned in the 2016 plan), depended heavily on imported fuel. Although the government did not follow these plans, fuel import dependency kept on increasing, putting the country at an international price and supply fluctuation risk. The legacy problem of generation got much more attention, putting the primary energy issue on the backburner. Every time the issue of high future energy import bill was raised, the growing economic strength was shown as a solution.\nThe Bapex-only local exploration policy resulted in only one drilling a year in the last 20 years, and despite settling the maritime boundary in 2014, offshore activity was questionable and half-hearted. Petrobangla miserably failed to maintain the production plateau reached during 2016-17. Any hope of local coal development was shut down in 2012. Bangladesh started to move away from energy independence at a much faster rate than was needed in the absence of local exploration and exploitation. For fuel and source diversification, and hence better energy security, the import of LNG and coal was needed and should have been started earlier. Our lack of experience in international energy trading was exposed when we opted for a four-tonne long-term contract for the 7.2-tonne LNG capacity. A large option spot portfolio is never recommended in a perpetual supply deficit situation.\nThe overcapacity dilemma is a trap created by the government. Out of 25,500MW of electricity generation capacity, 3,500MW is off-grid (solar home and captive), while 4,000MW cannot be operational because of forced/unforced shutdown and fuel shortage. Including derated capacity and plant availability, the true grid capacity is about 16,000MW. Unless the government decommissions the idle 3,000MW capacity it is carrying on paper, the overcapacity question will not go away. The other question of capacity payment is more complex. Every power plant is paid a capacity cost varying between Tk 1.25-2.4/kWh. This is part of the generation cost allowing investors to get their money back during the project period. The older long-term projects have a lower charge. If an HFO plant generation cost is Tk 15/kWh, Tk 2 would be the capacity cost and Tk 13 the fuel cost. Similarly, an old CCGT gas generation IPP cost is Tk 3.5/kWh, and Tk 1.25 would be the capacity cost.\nDuring the entire winter season, almost all oil-based power plants are kept on standby, receiving capacity cost. During peak summer, when peak demand increases by 5,000MW now, the majority of them are used. Is there a scope of corruption there? Some corruption definitely happens, but the vast majority of the capacity payment for oil-based plants that is being questioned is the payment during their idle period. Several unnecessary standby capacities are hardly used. They must be scrapped first, but oil-based capacity cannot be discarded entirely now until the larger coal-based base load plants come online.\nWe are paying for our past mistakes. We could easily get a six-tonne long-term LNG contract; we should have parallelly given much more attention to local gas development along with import. We were slow in bringing in the large coal-fired power plants (Rampal is taking almost 12 years from inception) extending the life of the oil plants, etc. One can find many more problems. We made some policy mistakes as well as execution delays/mistakes. None of those can be reversed immediately, but a course correction is essential. All avenues for immediate exploration of both onshore and offshore gas prospects must be undertaken, the land-based LNG regasification plant with assured gas sourcing is needed, and a serious impartial examination of local coal development by a third party is needed before we make a final decision.\nTo secure a more certain supply of power in the immediate future, the government must ensure timely completion of all ongoing coal-based power plants, their coal supply and import infrastructure, and the completion of the necessary transmission lines for power evacuation. We are paying over Tk 100 crore capacity charges per month for over 1.5 years for one unit from the Payra power plant, because the transmission lines are still incomplete. We simply cannot afford to do that for other power plants \u2013 especially our only nuclear power plant.\nOur current energy crisis is unique. The planned load-shedding is perhaps the best way of keeping the tariff at its current level. It will also ease the foreign currency demand, which is the other reason for this measure. Special care should be taken for the most productive sector (industry/agriculture) in allocating both gas and power. Every bit of renewable energy, including rooftop, household, irrigation, streetlights, etc, must be supported through policy and finance. It is expected that due to demand destruction and probable recession in some countries, energy prices will come down soon (except gas). Along with forced saving, citizens need to conserve energy as much as possible.\n\u00a0\nDr M Tamim\u00a0is a professor at the Department of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Engineering in Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet).\n\n",

        "full_article": "Two dates \u2013 May 9 and July 9 \u2013 will remain significant for the Rajapaksa brothers in Sri Lanka. It was on May 9 that Mahinda Rajapaksa, who enjoyed majority in parliament, resigned as the prime minister of Sri Lanka after his supporters clashed with anti-government protesters in the Galle Face Green, resulting in the death of two protesters. Exactly two months later, on July 9, the protesters, who had gathered from all over the country, forced Mahinda's brother and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the presidential house and took it over, in the culmination of what is described as \"aragalaya\"\u00a0or struggle of the masses against a powerful regime.\nOnce the most powerful political family enjoying popular support and winning accolades for bringing peace by eliminating the LTTE, the Rajapaksas are now facing people's ire for corruption, maladministration and what people perceived to be a sense of entitlement \u2013 the manner in which the Rajapaksa family exercised power and enjoyed it with impunity. What started as the Mirihana protest on March 31, with police action against the protesters and later the student protest at Nugegoda and other parts of the country, was only the beginning of the end. Not to be browbeaten by the state power that Rajapaksas wielded, the crowd continued to gather at the Galle Face Green and engaged in peaceful protest with the slogan \"GoGotaGama.\" This slogan captured youth imagination as students, activists, youths and the general public from all walks of life, overcoming the ethnic and religious divide, joined in large numbers spontaneously. Finally, they succeeded in unravelling the unpopular regime.\nNow, the question is: What's next for the\u00a0aragalaya? Both the political and economic roadmaps of Sri Lanka are bumpy. The opposition remains divided, and a consensual candidate to take over and form an interim government is not going to be smooth as the ruling party continues to enjoy a majority. Political instability is going to impact Sri Lanka's negotiation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of much-needed funds.\nThe movement started in April against the unfolding economic crisis in Sri Lanka as the island nation defaulted in its debt repayment. Economic distress was apparent with the fuel crisis, mounting inflation that led to the devaluation of Sri Lankan rupees. Food inflation increased to 80.1 percent in June 2022 from 57.4 percent in May 2022, while non-food inflation increased to 42.4 percent in June 2022 from 30.6 percent in May 2022. Hospitals announced that they did not have the essential medicines to carry out life-saving procedures.\nThis crisis has been in the making for the past few years. Sources of revenue were drying up due to a series of populist measures that the government adopted. For example, VAT was reduced to eight percent from 15 percent, tax-free threshold for turnover for VAT was raised from one million rupees to 25 million rupees. The government also abolished debit tax imposed on banks, capital gains tax, Pay as You Earn tax and debt services tax, while also withholding tax on interests and reducing income tax on the construction industry by half. The tourism industry had already shown signs of distress after the Easter bombing; the pandemic only accentuated the crisis. Remittances also declined as the construction and service industries in the Middle East were affected by the pandemic. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), in 2021, the total external debt service payments as a percentage of the export of goods and services increased from 13.2 percent in 2011 to 30 percent in 10 years, consuming one-third of the foreign currency earned. Moreover, 80 percent of the foreign debt was government debts. There was 33 percent depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar this March, making the import-dependent country more vulnerable. Remittance flow reduced due to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee.\nThe CBSL also admitted that the International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), which Sri Lanka issued to raise finance, were priced at relatively high interest rates compared to the development assistance finances that the country received at concessional rates. The government's decision to finance large infrastructure projects with non-concessional and commercial borrowings resulted in the rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 60 percent.\nLast year, the government's decision to introduce organic farming to save foreign currency resulted in a food crisis. Production of rice, the main staple, reduced by 20 percent. Production of tea, which fetches USD 3 billion annually, and rubber, another important item in the export basket, was affected. Businesses were unable to open a letter of credit due to scarcity of foreign currency. Inevitably, the government announced that it cannot service its USD 52 billion in debt. It started rationing fuel, resorted to load-shedding, announced \"work from home\" for its employees, and advised schools to hold online classes. All this mounted political disaffection. Already categorised as a \"defaulter,\" the country would be moved to the D category if debts remain unpaid after the grace period.\nSri Lanka's economic fate still hangs in the balance. Political instability may be addressed with an all-party interim government and the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 13. It is unlikely that the future government would be in a position to provide economic relief. The process of economic recovery will be long and arduous. Debt restructuring would be an important component of economic reforms. While the conclusion of the ongoing negotiation with the IMF would be an important first step, reforms are going to be unpopular and hurt the people who are still struggling. Taxes have to be imposed and unnecessary expenditure has to be curtailed. These were part of the IMF's USD 1.5 billion bailout package in 2016. Will there be another\u00a0aragalaya\u00a0against economic difficulties that the Lankans have to endure to put their economy back on track?\nSri Lanka's crisis has important lessons for the region. It is politically instructive to note that a powerful regime headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, wielding far-reaching executive powers, who was popularly elected only three years back, was shown the door by the people. It is evident that populist agenda cannot sustain regimes. Mismanagement of the economy, high-level corruption, and short-sighted economic policies steered by regime cronies rather than professional economists are a recipe for political disaster. South Asia has seen many instances of popular uprising against authoritarian and unpopular regimes; however, the Sri Lankan situation remains unparalleled in recent history as it was the economic crisis that underpinned what many describe as the Bastille moment, or its \"Arab Spring,\" that jostled a political awakening.\n\u00a0\nSmruti S Pattanaik\u00a0is a research fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA) in New Delhi, India.\n\n",

First, even though there are legitimate concerns regarding the global energy market, which have led to energy shocks in Bangladesh, the government's mismanagement and poor planning have also contributed to the crisis. And for people to have to suffer from load-shedding till September at least, as a result of that, is totally unacceptable. Secondly, it is doubtful that the crisis will get solved even around September, as experts have warned, should the government continue to make the same mistakes that it still refuses to acknowledge.\nThe government's claim that load-shedding will subside from September is based on the logic that three new coal-based power plants will start operating around that time. Given the government's woeful track record of getting any project finished on time, we cannot help but wonder if they would indeed be operational around September. And it is not just about having those power plants operational, but also about getting the necessary transmission lines in place. Already, the country's two running coal-fired power plants have the capacity to plug shortfalls in power generation. However, they are also suffering from a shortage of coal and lack of transmission lines. And given that the three new power plants will run on imported coal, and the country's forex reserves are dwindling, figuring out the full logistics of things will be no cakewalk.\nMany of the country's power plants are currently not functioning because of a fuel shortage.

Instead of burning through so much cash for idle power plants, the government could have easily invested it on gas exploration, which would have provided some buffer to the country's strategic energy sector. The government should now urgently renegotiate those contracts to save some public funds at this time of crisis.\nAusterity measures in regards to electricity usage is now clearly necessary.

        "full_article": "With the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 11 (to be publicly announced by the Speaker in parliament on July 13), we see another curve in the road for the island nation \u2013 as nothing can be termed a light at the end of the tunnel yet. The political and economic situation in Sri Lanka came to its worst starting this year, when fuel prices began to rise steeply. Since then, the lives of Sri Lankans have deteriorated miserably in quality, as they experience 10-hours-long power cuts daily, a reduction of food intake, a severe scarcity of cash, inability to work even remotely, and an overall collapsed economy. In April, the country defaulted on its USD 51-billion foreign debt and now has very little foreign currency to even import essentials. In June, the country's inflation hit a record high for the ninth consecutive month, as per government data.\u00a0\nIt seems futile to wonder why, even after one Rajapaksa brother resigned from his post of prime minister, the protests by Sri Lankans are still going on. This was never about just fighting off the nepotism practiced by the Rajapaksa dynasty. Citizens protested for months, often at the face of disproportionate response from law enforcement (leading to quite a few protesting lives lost), because they had witnessed in real time how badly the irresponsibility of those in charge had turned their livelihoods upside-down. But while protestors finally seem to have the upper hand, especially since their takeover of the Presidential palace and the burning of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe's private residence, the political crisis is far from being over until those in charge can choose leaders to be elected who will acquire the public nod.\u00a0\nWhat the 22 million people of Sri Lanka are experiencing now is certainly the worst economic crisis the island has witnessed since its independence in 1948. However, the crisis is also a testament to what happens when politicians heading a country become self-serving or want to make a show of development, rather than serving the public. Starting from building infrastructure using borrowed foreign funds to political members of the Rajapaksa family allegedly laundering millions of Sri Lankan rupees, the wrath of the public against this family and their government has been building up for some years now.\u00a0\nWe urge the international community to come to the aid of Sri Lankan citizens by providing anything from food, fuel, medication, etc. Though, given President Rajapaksa's resignation, PM Wickremesinghe is automatically made the country's acting president, it is imperative that the public is allowed to democratically elect a replacement. Most of all, we hope that peace and prosperity will finally prevail in Sri Lanka.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "The Eid-ul-Azha raw hide market appears to be faring better than the previous year. Reports say, at a raw hide hub of the country near the Savar area, raw cowhides measuring 24 sq ft were being sold at Tk 800 per piece, while those of the 20-22 sq ft size, were sold at Tk 600 apiece. Goat skins, on the other hand, were being sold from Tk 10 to Tk 20 per piece. At Posta, another centre of rawhide business in the old part of the city, cowhides of smaller size were seen to be selling between Tk 200 and Tk 250 per piece, while those of medium size were selling between Tk 300 and Tk 750 depending on the quality of the hides. The large-size cowhides, on the other hand, were being sold between Tk 800 and Tk 1150 apiece.This definitely marks an improvement of the rawhide market over the last few years. Even though the rawhide sellers got better price for their goods both within and outside the capital city, the prices at which rawhide has been selling during this Eid-ul-Azha has still been below the rates fixed last week by the commerce ministry during a meeting with representatives of the hide merchants. Notably, at the said meeting, the price of per square foot of salted cowhide was set between Tk 47 and Tk 52 within the capital city, while outside the city it would range from Tk 40 to Tk 44. Similarly, male goat's skin, according to that standard, was to be sold between Tk 18 and Tk 20 per square foot and that of nanny goat's between Tk 12 and Tk 14. The rates of rawhide price so fixed by the government for this time, however, were an increase by Tk 7.0 per square foot for cowhide and Tk 3.0 for every square foot of goat skin. But as it happens more often than not, the rawhide dealers hardly ever get the prices set by the government. Sadly though, it is happening at a time when the nation is witnessing an unprecedented rise in the price of every essential commodity under the sun. The only exception is the post-Eid-ul-Azha rawhide price. One may, at this point, recall the disaster that the rawhide sellers faced three years back (in 2019) when the price of rawhide was so low and unwillingness of the tanners and stockists to buy rawhide was so great that rawhide sellers in different parts of the country had to throw their cargoes (rawhide) into garbage dumps or bury those under the ground. Why was it so? The tannery owners and finished leather merchants have their reasons that sounds cogent. In fact, the big brands of European Union (EU) and the USA are showing reluctance to buy Bangladeshi leather. That is because these overseas buyers think there is a severe pollution problem at the Savar Tannery Industrial Estate at Hemayetpur near Dhaka. Under the circumstances, China, though it pays lower price for leather compared to the EU and the US, has now emerged as the biggest buyer of leather from Bangladesh. Still in FY 22, the export of leather and leather goods increased by 32.25 per cent, adding about US$1.24 billion to the country's foreign exchange reserve. As during the Eid-ul-Azha, half of the country's total animal hide is produced (more than 10 million pieces this time), policymakers need to consider it with the topmost priority. The rawhide dealers must get the highest value for their merchandise.",

        "full_article": "There was a public perception, not long ago, that market scheming and price manoeuvring by syndicates could be largely contained had there been a Competition Law and a designated agency in the country to monitor market situation and enforce measures against unfair market practices. With the Competition Law enacted in 2012 and the Competition Commission set up subsequently, things seemed to be moving in the desired direction. It has been quite a while. Although the Law and the Commission are in place, their presence can hardly be felt. The Competition Commission, though officially launched, is non-functional as of now, and no one seems to know how long it will take to get going. This newspaper published editorials and post-editorials soon after the government decided to set up this highly important organisation -- welcoming the move but not without a note of warning about the preparations required to get along with the task ahead. It got reported in the newspapers that the government at long last has only been able to appoint a chairman of the Commission, but there is no organogram as yet to recruit officials and required support staff. The funds made available to run the organisation is also reportedly meagre. These are clear indications to suggest a lack of understanding of the importance of an entity that, if equipped properly, can bring harmony and coherence in market forces-- to the relief of the consumers. The very idea prompting enactment of competition laws and a commission is one and the same across the globe in that the purpose is to eliminate practices having adverse effect on competition, promote and sustain competition, protect the interests of consumers and ensure freedom of trade in the markets. While curbing syndicated monopoly in times of sudden fluctuation in prices of commodities is a key mandated activity of competition commissions the world over, the main tools required are human and related resources to effectively prevail upon the situation. It is here that the commission assumes the role of a watchdog.The commission is also required to give opinion on competition issues received in reference from other agencies established under law and to undertake competition advocacy, create public awareness and impart training on competition issues. The Indian Supreme Court in response to a civil appeal in 2010 clearly spelt out the role and functions of the Competition Commission in India that may be applicable in most countries, including ours. According to the judgment, the main objective is \"to promote economic efficiency using competition as one of the means of assisting the creation of market responsive to consumer needs and preferences. The advantages of perfect competition are three-fold: allocative efficiency which ensures the effective allocation of resources, productive efficiency which ensures that costs of production are kept at a minimum, and dynamic efficiency which promotes innovative practices.\"In Bangladesh, during the past two decades or so, flagrant violation of basic business ethics in the form of hoarding, black marketing and so on by cartels and notorious syndicates have plagued the marketplace with serious distortions that more than necessitated a legally recognised system to tackle the situation. With the Covid-19 still persistent and the Russia-Ukraine war causing some disruptions to supply chain of some essentials like fuel and wheat, there are clear indications that foul play by unscrupulous elements in the country are at work to cash in on the situation, mostly through hoarding and creating artificial scarcity in consumer product market all over the country. Clearly, the one state agency --Competition Commission -- mandated to prevail on the situation is far from doing the needful. This, it appears, is due mainly to the lack of resources -- human and technical -- coupled with well calculated plans. Mere setting up of the Competition Commission is thus of no use unless it is equipped with the tools and mechanism required for accomplishing what it is meant to do. For its functional purposes, the Commission is required to frame rules, policies, administrative scope and set up mechanisms for conducting enquiries on receipt of complaints, devising procedures for preliminary determination of anti-competitive behaviour and take penal action upon final and conclusive determination through public hearing or whatever is deemed appropriate. For this, one of the key requirements is a group of legal and trade experts. The job is challenging in as much as it entails understanding and forecasting market conditions under different circumstances - domestic as well as global - and the way they tell upon the consumers on the one hand and on the market players, on the other. This calls for, besides effective market monitoring, developing and nurturing relations and interactions with sectoral regulators to ensure smooth alignment of sectoral regulatory laws in strict conformity with the competition law. In pursuing the path, a Commission can be expected to perform competition advocacy and spread information on benefits of competition among all stakeholders to establish and nurture a healthy competition culture in the economy.

The absolute number of these holidaymakers would be much higher than 10 million. Understandably, they go to their ancestral homes in villages and rural towns to celebrate the festivals with their near and dear ones.Newspaper and television reports sometimes justify, sometimes glorify this exodus, comparing it with exploration of ancestral roots of emotional Bangladesh people. Why they go back to villages over and over again taking so much pains of an often risky journey is yet to be explored, sociologically, however.If around 40 per cent of the 170 million people live in cities and towns, why can't the majority of them make their current living space their 'roots'? When villages are being transformed into small towns with electricity supply and road connectivity, why do a massive number of villagers still migrate to urban centres?The way the working class people go to serve the industrial and service sectors in Dhaka and a few other cities and towns is not the whole reality. There are people whose livelihoods are rooted in rural areas but they shift their family members to cities. Groups like government officers, public representatives, contractors, well-off rural families and high-end remittance earners prefer staying in urban areas seeking better education for their children, healthcare facilities, and higher status of being metropolitan citizens.With modernisation spreading all around, a section of half-rural, half-urban minds of moneyed men are also building structures and making facilities in villages, often at the cost of farmland and environment. While wage earners inclusive of some overseas job-holders bring their earnings to villages, a huge sum of money generated through profit, value addition, bribery and extortion in rural areas fly to advanced urban centres like Dhaka. Bangladesh's urban space, especially divisional and major district headquarters, has actually been enriched by steady migration of mufassil talents and in-born entrepreneurs who have constituted a growing urban middle class in the past several decades.These people wanted to become urban gentlemen and bring up their next generations well versed with refined culture. How far that objective has been achieved remains a question as, for example, many of them have not been enlisted as voters with urban constituencies.Thus, most of all these groups fail to find love for the city they live in. The beauty and tranquility of villages where they spent their childhood beckon them to take emotional shelter during the festivals.The reasons why the grown up men and women can't develop their attachment with the areas where they spend most days of the year are not unknown either but people don't want to speak about them.The city which they could have felt proud of living in is often termed unliveable, thanks to frequent traffic congestion, air and noise pollution and lack of recreational facilities.Other than educational institutions and offices/shops/factories, there is hardly any scope of communication with other people. In the absence of a mass transit system and adequate number of popular gathering spots, people don't find new friends.Also, neighbours of urban dwellers are increasingly getting isolated from each other and they fail to receive love and care even in times of crisis.In such an impervious and hostile atmosphere of a big city, human mind turns nostalgic about fond memories of the past and tries to revisit the time gone by and people with whom the emotional attachment is still strong. Till date, the number of these souls is millions who crowd roads, highways and waterways during the festivals.[email\u00a0protected]",

There is an underground museum beneath the Independence Monument (Glass Tower) at the historic Suhrawardy Uddyan. However, only a few people know about the museum due to a lack of publicity. Even many visitors do not notice the museum since there is no billboard or sign that points to the museum. The museum containing 144 glass-framed photographs of the 1971 liberation war opened to the public in 2015. But it hardly sees visitors because of its lack of publicity.
