This will be the first election for J&K since it lost its statehood and Ladakh was carved out as a separate UT without an Assembly in 2019. After a a three-phase poll in J&K and a single-phase one in Haryana, the counting of votes will be on October 4. Curiously, the ECI has said that elections that are due in Maharashtra and Jharkhand will be announced later. In 2019, Haryana and Maharashtra went to the polls together. Security concerns and festivals have been cited as the reason for holding these elections in batches of two each. Falling within the first year of the 2024 general election, these four Assembly elections, and then the one in Delhi, will be notable for the political signals that will emanate. Of import will be the J&K exercise, as a new elected government can be the first step to a durable political process after J&K\u2019s reorganisation five years ago. The enthusiasm that the electorate showed in the general election and the recurring incidents of violent insurgency are two aspects of the situation in Kashmir. Elections could open the possibility of the emergence of new political actors. An election process that is demonstrably fair and transparent is essential for a healthy democracy, and in Kashmir\u2019s case, no less so.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) went in for a changing of the guard in Haryana ahead of the general election to dilute the discontent against the party and its governments at the Centre and the State. The Agnipath short service scheme that was introduced by the Centre is a topic of intense interest in a State where many young people look to the military for a career option. The Congress is hoping to benefit from the double anti-incumbency and a disarray in the non-Jat social coalition that propelled the BJP to the top in 2014. The impact of the Assembly elections will not be limited to the two States/UTs. The general election had loosened the BJP\u2019s grip over the country\u2019s politics and given the Opposition a fresh lease of life. Whether that trend holds or there is a reversal is to be seen. Politics within the BJP, among the National Democratic Alliance partners, between the BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar, and between the BJP and the Opposition, could all be influenced by these elections. The BJP and the Congress both know that the stakes are high, giving this round of elections an added edge.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nHaryana\n\n/\n\nElection Commission of India\n\n/\n\nMaharashtra\n\n/\n\nJharkhand\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\narmed Forces\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nNational Democratic Alliance",

The number of contenders, four more than in 2019, suggests a robust democratic process. There are familiar faces and some surprises. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, traditionally with the United National Party, is running as an independent. At 75, he aims to garner broad support by highlighting the political and economic stability achieved during his two-year tenure, made possible by backing from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. In early 2022, Sri Lanka faced the full effect of an economic meltdown, brought on by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. The central bank announced a debt repayment moratorium amid unsustainable debt and critically low reserves. The Russia-Ukraine conflict further worsened the situation. The Aragalaya movement resulted in the ousting of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022. Since then, Sri Lanka has secured an extended fund facility with the IMF, supported initially by India and now with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d with India and the Paris Club creditors on a debt treatment plan. During the early recovery phase, people faced price hikes. Recently, prices of electricity, fuel, and cooking gas have decreased, but people are still struggling. Earnings from tourism, a major contributor, amounted to around $328 million in July against $219 million a year ago. However, in a move seen as part of electioneering, the government announced a monthly cost of living allowance of LKR 25,000 for public service employees, effective January 2025.Mr. Wickremesinghe faces Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (United People\u2019s Front), Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s son, Namal of the SLPP. Mr. Dissanayake, who visited India in February, hopes to capitalise on public frustration with traditional political parties, a sentiment that fuelled the Aragalaya movement. Other candidates include P. Ariyanethran, a \u201ccommon Tamil candidate\u201d, Sarath Fonseka, former Army Commander, and Nuwan Bopage, a nominee of the Aragalaya activists. The leading candidates should push for the restoration of provincial councils, which represent a measure of autonomy as envisaged in the 13th Amendment. It is a sad commentary on the Sri Lankan political leadership that the councils have been rendered non-functional for years. Whoever is elected by about 17 million voters as President should revive the provincial councils, which are not Tamil-centric but are intended to infuse an element of agency for the people in the running of their affairs. A functional democracy is the first step to fixing the economy.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nSri Lanka\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nSri Lanka Easter bombings\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nJapan\n\n/\n\ngovernment debt\n\n/\n\nprices\n\n/\n\nelectricity production and distribution\n\n/\n\ndiesel fuel\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

        "full_article": "On what Forster got wrong, and also his printer\nOn the last page of an English novel published in 1924, an India-friendly British character nevertheless mocks India\u2019s aspirations to achieve freedom: \u201cIndia a nation!\u201d The Indian character he is closest to retorts: \u201cIf it\u2019s fifty or five hundred years, we shall get rid of you, we shall drive every blasted Englishman into the sea, and then\u2026you and I shall be friends!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, the timeline projected by even this fervent Indian patriot has India attaining freedom in 1974 at the earliest and in 2424 at the latest. But the British printer of the book presumably could not believe what he saw in the manuscript and quietly changed \u201cfifty or five hundred years\u201d to \u201cfifty-five hundred years\u201d \u2013 which would take us virtually to the extinction of Planet Earth at the rate we are going.\u00a0\nThis printing error persisted through scores of reprints for no reader seemed to find much wrong with it! It was corrected only in 1948 after India had in fact become free, which was only 23 years after the novel was published.\nThis novel was A Passage to India by EM Forster, probably the greatest novel about India ever written by a Westerner. He was not the only one to believe what he did. Lord Curzon, who had served two terms as the Viceroy of India and knew the ground reality, also declared in the 1920s that British rule in India would last for another five hundred years. Building their grand new capital in New Delhi on Raisina Hill, the British claimed it would last a thousand years. It well may, but when Lord Irwin became the first occupant in 1931 of Viceroy House, he could not have foreseen how soon afterwards that House would change hands and name.\u00a0\nIn fact, many Indians did not anticipate how soon independence would come. It was only at the annual session of Indian National Congress in Lahore in Dec 1929 that a resolution asking for \u201cPurna Swaraj\u201d was adopted. Indian Liberals did not then support full independence nor did Muslim League.\u00a0\nForster did get one thing right. The first section of his novel is titled \u201cMosque\u201d and the last \u201cTemple\u201d, signalling the enduring communalist tension. He had written on Mohammad Iqbal and it would be Iqbal who would in 1930 be the first to ask for a separate Muslim \u201cState\u201d. Fiction can at times be as strange as truth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "\u2026That every case of assaulted woman is a blow against women\u2019s workforce participation\u00a0\nThere is no possible road to India\u2019s prosperity, which doesn\u2019t run through it becoming a gender fair society. Everyone doesn\u2019t need to march to \u201creclaim the night\u201d. But everyone does need to understand the costs of continued indifference to the security needs of women. As IMF\u2019s Gita Gopinath indicated this weekend, India\u2019s economic aspirations can\u2019t be met without lifting its women\u2019s labour force participation, which in turn depends on actively ensuring women\u2019s safety.\nIt is bad enough that the women\u2019s labour force participation rate in India is about half of, say, Vietnam. What\u2019s much worse is how few Indian women are actually getting paid. A 2023 Azim Premji University report, for example, suggests that only about 17% of urban women are in the paid workforce. Rural women are much worse off. This amounts to women being caught in a vicious cycle. Their unpaid work, be it domestic or agricultural or in family enterprises, has low status. Seeking paid work, or higher education to enable it, is discouraged on account of various factors, very high among which is lack of safety.\nEfforts to ensure their safety often, ironically, involve putting them in a cage. There\u2019s a maze of laws and regulations to curb whether they can work at night or in jobs deemed hazardous or arduous or morally inappropriate. These also end up curbing women\u2019s ability to rise up the ladder. Becoming a top manager means overcoming all the impediments, and also, as Gopinath indicated too, the countless suggestions to just chill, which men just don\u2019t have to contend with. We have no way of knowing how many chains and hurdles the doctor raped and murdered at a Kolkata medical college and hospital on Aug 9, had to break through to be on night duty. But we know that in the press conference that day, her principal said she had been \u201cirresponsible\u201d to go to the seminar hall alone at night. The thing that women know about staying in a cage, though, is that it only gets more and more oppressive, and has a safety rating of zero.\nThis is a complex social problem, no doubt. But there\u2019s no solving it without tough deterrence. CCTVs are everywhere in our cities now. Everyday, police must publicise how it has used these to catch a sexual assailant. Stop telling women where not to go. Start making more transports and destinations assault-free. By swiftly punishing the men who commit the assaults.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Reservations shouldn\u2019t be applicable when recruiting outside talent for short stints in govt\nOpposition parties have charged that GOI\u2019s advertisement for 45 lateral entry posts in the bureaucracy is unmindful of reservation provisions. Jobs advertised include those of joint secretary, director, and deputy secretary in 24 ministries of the central govt. But if the idea here is to recruit talent from outside the civil services system and tap domain expertise, reservations for lateral recruitment make little sense.\u00a0\nEnhancing merit | The whole purpose of lateral recruitment is to try and make the bureaucratic system more efficient. Specifically, lateral recruits are expected to deliver on specific projects and achieve faster implementation of fresh ideas. The purpose of affirmative action is to bypass structural social barriers to opportunities. Thus, the objectives are vastly different. Note that lateral entry posts are temporary in nature, lasting three to five years. Lateral recruitment should, therefore, focus on only getting the best expertise for the job, irrespective of the social background of the candidate.\u00a0\nGlobal experience | Lateral entry in govt isn\u2019t a new idea. In US, a special govt employee category was created by Congress in 1962 to allow the federal govt to take advantage of outside experts. From 2005 to 2014, an average of 2,000 such employees worked every year for various US govt departments. Similarly, Britain has had the system of special advisers assisting ministers for decades.\u00a0\nKeep politics out | It\u2019s also the opposition\u2019s case that lateral entrants may be biased towards the party in govt. But this also holds true for regular, senior bureaucratic appointments, in Centre and in states. Calibre ought to be the only criteria for lateral entrants since they will serve very specific functions for a limited period. For the sake of a nimble bureaucracy, let\u2019s not politicise the idea. \u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Why have we landed ourselves in the current mess involving NEET, JEE, and other high-stakes exams? While India has the potential to lead the world in higher education, we are burdened by the mushrooming of coaching institutions, rampant cheating and a lack of trust in exam bodies, bureaucratisation of higher educational institutions, degradation of the university system, and, most concerningly, stress and mental pressure on our youth.\nOver 35% of recorded suicides in India occur in the 15-24 age group. In 2022, more than 750,000 students also left India to pursue higher education abroad, a 35% increase from the previous year. Projections indicate that Indian households will spend an estimated $70 billion on foreign education by 2025, 14 times the govt\u2019s 2023 higher education budget allocation. These students are leaving not because they cannot find a seat in our institutions but because they seek quality education.\nIndia needs reforms for higher education akin to the sweeping economic reforms of 1991. Three primary issues must be addressed to bring accountability to our educational institutions: faculty quality, financial model and governance issues. Currently, Indian institutions fall into two categories: those that depend on govt for 90% of their sustenance and those that rely on student tuition for 90% of their survival. The over-reliance on govt funds causes major governance and scalability issues in publicly funded institutions, while depending on tuition fees brings quality and trust issues in private institutions. Both models are flawed and perilous. For example, 23 IITs admit roughly 16,000 undergraduate students, and 20 AIIMS admit about 2,000 MBBS students, highlighting the issue with scale. One single large university in the US would admit as many undergraduate students as our 23 IITs put together. Here are three essential reforms that the sector needs:\n1. Improve quality of faculty in Tier-2 institutions and universities: One salient feature of the US system of education is that there is not much difference between their Ivy League universities and their Tier-2 institutions when it comes to quality of instruction at the undergrad level. The same can\u2019t be said here. This often creates a stampede of sorts for admission into a handful of elite institutions in India. The creation of more IITs and AIIMS has inadvertently led to a significant decline in the quality of education in Tier-2 institutions and universities. Faculty recruitments are often mired in legal complications and litigation in govt institutions. Even approval of positions from respective govts can take years, forcing these institutions to hire contract faculty. Faculty recruitments must be based purely on merit. To address this, create a national pool of IIT/AIIMS-grade faculty and mandate these people to teach in Tier-2 colleges and universities. These faculty must be hired centrally with the active participation of IITs/AIIMS, offered IIT/AIIMS faculty pay scales, given a similar teaching load, and provided generous grants to perform high-quality research. It\u2019s important that such a pool helps establish a culture of excellence wherever they work. Even their promotions must be based on standards of performance similar to these elite institutions. Over a period of time, increase this pool of faculty nationally to improve the standards of education outside our elite institutions.\n2. Provide outcome-linked grants to institutions: Linking grants to outcomes can incentivise higher educational institutions to boost student enrolment and encourage faculty to secure competitive research grants. Funds should be linked to student enrolment numbers, research grants generated, patents filed, and IP licensed to industries. This will drive institutions to expand enrolment and increase research productivity. To support higher education sustainably, institutions must diversify their revenue streams. Policies should encourage philanthropy, industry participation, and generous overheads on research grants. Additionally, govt policies should promote the development of substantial endowment funds, similar to those in top US universities. Implementing \u2018study-now-pay-later\u2019 schemes, akin to Australia\u2019s HELP program, can ensure affordability and support diverse career pursuits. These schemes allow students to defer tuition payments, repaying them once their income exceeds a specified threshold. This approach balances the need for immediate educational investment with long-term financial viability, ensuring that higher education remains accessible without placing undue financial strain on students or govt.\n3. Address governance issues: The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasises autonomy for educational institutions. However, excessive bureaucratic interference and controls have caused governance structures in academic institutions to hit a new low. Implementing NEP\u2019s reforms is crucial. Building a strong board and empowering it to make financial, administrative, and academic decisions is essential. With a proper financial model that promotes expansion, excellence, and equity, coupled with administrative autonomy, our higher educational institutions will thrive. It\u2019s imperative we use the recent NEET fiasco as a wake-up call.\nViews expressed are personal.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The poetic tradition in the East, particularly in Greater India, has long been characterised by diverse literary experimentation, significantly influenced by Sanskritic, Arabic, and Persian cosmopolitan traditions. Over time, this tradition also drew substantial inspiration from various aspects of colonial modern aesthetics. Poet Shamsur Rahman\u2014affectionately known as Bacchu among close friends\u2014embodies this cosmopolitan narrative. To critically assess Shamsur Rahman's aesthetic sensibility and modernist tone, we must explore the various trajectories within the framework of multiple modernities.\nIt is also crucial to situate the poet's upbringing, the childhood scenarios depicted in his poetry and memoirs, and his concepts of self and city within the context of the Islamicate, as outlined by M.S. Hodgson. When referring to the Islamicate and Muslim Bengali childhood of old Dhaka, it should not be conflated with an Islamic one. The terms \"Islamicate\" and \"Muslim Bengali\" are secular and worldly, often linked to a social and cultural complex that is distinct from religiosity.\n\nShamsur Rahman developed a stylistic approach that diverged from the Calcutta-based concept of modernity and the European notion of cosmopolitanism. His poetic language was deeply influenced by his Islamicate Muslim childhood, which subtly informed the narrative of his work. \nThe Poetics of Islamicate Childhood\n\nIn the following poems, we will explore the social and psychological atmosphere of Shamsur Rahman's childhood. Among his poetry centred on childhood, he often evokes the multi-faceted, lost memories of his early years. However, our primary focus here is to unpack the cultural dimensions of Bengali Muslim childhood, its worldview, and its ethos. By delving into the poetics of Rahman's childhood and his autobiographical reflections, we gain insight into the upbringing of Bengali Muslims during the late colonial period. As previously indicated, we are making a clear distinction between the Islamic and the Islamicate; when we refer to Muslim Bengali childhood, it must be situated within the Islamicate sphere\u2014undisputedly non-sectarian and all-encompassing, distinct from the religious dimension.\nAn unknown, oft-visited lamplighter with a ladder, usually found in the alleyways at dusk\n\nThe vivid portrayal of the lamplighter of old Dhaka in the early 1930s serves as a representative sample of the poet's early childhood. Through this narrative, Shamsur Rahman retrieves the lost heritage of earlier town planning and the daily life of old Dhaka's alleys. It is important to note that during that time, DESCO, WASA, and WAPDA were not parts of Dhaka's infrastructure, which does not mean that Dhaka had yet to develop into a modern city or become a hub for the bourgeoisie. From an urban studies perspective, Dhaka's lineage as a city can be traced back to the Middle Ages, if not earlier. As we explore Dhaka's contours through Shamsur's poetic narration, the distinctive features of an oriental and Mughal city like Dhaka will become evident.\nThe depiction of the lamplighter's tattered shirt and curly mustache reminds us of the often-marginal characters in the city, celebrated in surrealist discourse, who reveal the tales of the city. This is superbly portrayed in Shamsur's famous poem, Shoishober Bati-ola Amake (Chance encounter with that famed lamplighter of my old town childhood). In this regard, Shamsur's lamplighter, if not a connoisseur of the city, resembles Baudelaire's fl\u00e2neur: both recapture the many lives of a decadent city. The arrival of the lamplighter at dusk, signalling the dazzling glow of night, is one of Shamsur's finest works, creating an iconic character easily identified by readers as the from 46 Mahut-Toli.\nMa is never found in the green room\nThis narrative captures the inner world of Bengali Muslim women in relation to the arts and aesthetics. Unlike their Hindu counterparts, the emergence of Bengali Muslim women in the public sphere took a different path. In his poems and autobiography, Shamsur Rahman reflects on growing up in an environment often devoid of arts and aesthetics, focusing instead on school textbooks, though this was not always the case. He poignantly reveals that he never saw his mother sing, prompting us to consider the predicament of Bengali Muslim women. Shamsur challenges us to confront the question of modernity for Bengali Muslims. This is evident in every line of his work. The poem Kokhono Amar Ma'ke (Ma is never found in the green room) is less concerned with aesthetic judgment and more with meditative reflection on the mother figure within a Freudian narrative, distinct from the typical Oedipus complex.\nManhood & its cracked mirror\nIn the poetic narration of Dussomoyer Mukhomukhi (Manhood reminisces and relives the lost childhood), Shamsur Rahman takes us back to his early childhood, growing up in a typical Bengali Muslim household. This poem vividly depicts the evolving milieu of Bengali Muslim childhood, serving as an archive of a young boy's coming-of-age story. The mosque, with its intricate floral engravings, decorations\u2014a hallmark of Islamicate architecture from the Sultanate era\u2014and the water tank with its fish, all captivated Shamsur. He also recalls his father reciting the Azan during a deadly cyclone to calm the approaching storm. These images not only recapture memories but also serve as a poetic archive of Bengali Muslim childhood, common across the social spectrum.\nTo become more Hindu among Hindus\n\nThe remembrance of things past is beautifully articulated in the esoteric poem Chelebela Theke (From My Childhood). It can be argued that this poem serves as a rare document of partition from a poetic perspective, documenting the secular and non-sectarian upbringing in old Dhaka. Among his friends, Shamsur names Arun, Sunil, Subimal, Surjokishor, Taher, and Ashraf. One fine morning, the poet discovers that all his Hindu classmates, including Subimal and Shisir, have left for India\u2014a decision often attributed to the desire to become \"more Hindu among Hindus\"\u2014a typical narrative of the 1947 partition. His Hindu playmates and non-sectarian Hindu teacher at Pogose School always compelled him, in later days, to reflect on the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. Besides the tale of Hindu-Muslim solidarity and the tragedy of partition, Shamsur also recounts the heartbreaking loss of his sister, Nehar, in the poem. It was on this occasion that the poet wrote his first elegy, in memory of his deceased sister. All these events unfolded in the Islamicate old town, where Shamsur lived as a Muslim among Hindus.\nOne Fine Eid Morning\nIn the poem Das Takar Note Ebong Shoishob (One Fine Eid Morning), Shamsur Rahman reflects on his early childhood, again typical of a Bengali Muslim upbringing. While many poets have written about Durgapuja, Saraswati Puja, and Rathjatra, the world of Bengali Muslim childhood has rarely been explored. Shamsur Rahman ventures into this realm, offering a vivid representation of early Muslim childhood, centring around the Eid festival and the tradition of giving Eid money, known as edyee in the vernacular. He evokes memories of his childhood neighbourhood: the house of Henry, the lamplighter, kulphiwala, and the typical horse stable\u2014a reminiscence of Muslim heritage\u2014with the celebration of Eid at the heart of it.\nThe Soft Stretch of Father's Prayer-Mat\nShamsur Rahman wrote several poems about the liberation war of Bangladesh, with Swadhinota Tumi being the most renowned. In this poem, he creates a surreal image of his father's prayer mat. During his early childhood, Shamsur would often intrude on his father's prayer time, occasionally receiving a gentle scolding for his interruptions. Rather than merely evoking lost time, Shamsur Rahman draws us into a vivid reliving of it, seamlessly blending past and present.\nThe poetic memoire of Shahi Dhaka: the life of an oriental city\n\nWe often hear that poetry serves as a journal and a representation of the everyday. In Shamsur Rahman's work, certain figures and images repeatedly resurface: the Batiwala, Bhakarkhaniwala, Bhistiwala, and horse stable all hint at the city's longstanding Islamicate orientation. Alizan Beyapari, with his pump shoes and his renovation of the seventeenth-century Mirza Mosque\u2014now known as Sitara Mosque, with its colourful, engraved star domes\u2014captivated Shamsur. The poet also explores the worlds of Kawali, Merasin (marginalised women musicians), and the vernacular, including the unknown naive painter Noyeem Mia, with whom he delved into the enigmatic world of painting. Mr. Harney and his son Waisy, along with the neighbourhood populated by Anglo-Indians, Armenian traders, and their places of worship\u2014including churches\u2014feature prominently in his work. Lastly, Shamsur intertwines his persona with the grandeur of Shahi palaces and caravanserais like Choto Katra and Boro Katra. He also depicts the home and world of the Dhakai Nabab, highlighting the divide between them and the unlettered kutti, as well as the native Bengali Muslim. Landmarks in the old town, such as Bahadur Shah Zafar Park and Lalbagh Fort evoke memories of the persecution and execution of soldiers during the First War of Independence in 1857.\nIt is evident from his writing that his family and neighbourhood were deeply rooted in religiosity, though not in a sectarian way. As a child, Shamsur was influenced by both the Karbala and Hindu Vaisnavite traditions, such as Janmashtami. He fondly recalls the evocative memories associated with Dhakeswari and Ramna Temple and participated solemnly in various Pujo celebrations. This should be understood within the framework of a secular, non-sectarian, and Islamicate worldview. One of his most cherished memories relates to Karbala, which holds a central place in Bengali Muslim culture. Notably, he memorised Mir Mosarraf Hossain's Bishad Sindhu while reading it aloud to his grandmother during his early childhood. In several of his poems and some prose written in memoir form, Karbala, Tazia, the Duldul horse, and Hossaini Dalan are recalled with deep reverence.\n\nHis childhood memories serve as a wellspring of inspiration for the development of his unique poetic style. While it may initially appear that he is reliving a colonial and medieval city, it is clear that Shamsur's work must be understood within the broader context of the city's distinctive lineage within the global city narrative. \nThe many facets of fanciful and delirious Dhaka nights are vividly captured in his now-classic poem Ai Matuala Rait (The Delirious Dhaka Night), written after he returned from a tavern at midnight. The poem's distinctive style is apparent in its masterful use of local idioms and the Perso-Arabic vocabulary of the old town.\nThrough these images, Shamsur crafts the narrative of his poetry. His childhood memories serve as a wellspring of inspiration for the development of his unique poetic style. While it may initially appear that he is reliving a colonial and medieval city, it is clear that Shamsur's work must be understood within the broader context of the city's distinctive lineage within the global city narrative.\nIt is often said that Dhaka does not fit the Western concept of a city; rather, it resembles a series of souks, as noted by many anthropologists. The concept of a souk has a different genealogy in the Middle Eastern world, often carrying an Islamicate connotation. The trajectory of an oriental city is markedly different from that of a Western one. It is clear that the genealogy of an oriental city like Dhaka cannot be fully explained by the Western narrative; it must be understood within the framework of multiple, diverse, and alternative modernities. Many sociologists and anthropologists of urban life have emphasised the unique and distinctive character of our city within the global city narrative.\nThe Swadeshi modernity: the lineage of our modern poetics\n\nKavitar Songe Gerosthali (Living together with poetry) is one of Shamsur Rahman's most poignant poems. In this work, we find early signs of his poetic development. Through his creative imagination, Shamsur vividly illustrates his journey to becoming a poet. We also gain insight into his liberal upbringing, guided by his elder brother, who was deeply immersed in the world of Tagore. Shamsur's poetic perspective was influenced by a fortuitous encounter with Tagore's Chayanika, followed by his discovery of Sanchayita in the early 1940s. By the early 1950s, he was drawn to the modernist poets of the 1930s, notably Das, Bose, and Dutt. He also found inspiration in Western modernist and surrealist poets such as Paul \u00c9luard and Louis Aragon. William Radice aptly notes that while Shamsur could craft a perfect sonnet, he preferred a poetic form that allowed freedom and flexibility, yet never appeared uncontrolled.\nAlthough this poem does not explicitly detail his poetic influences, Shamsur elsewhere acknowledges various poets from different traditions, including Islamicate figures like Ghalib, Hafiz, and Rumi, as well as other renowned Persian and cosmopolitan poets. It is noteworthy that, early in his career, he introduced the Multani poet Khwaja Farid to his audience.\nIn 1953, Shamsur delivered a lecture at Shantiniketan, where he clearly differentiated between Islamic revivalist poetry and the secular, Islamicate tradition. The former included poets like Golam Mustafa and Farrukh Ahmad, while the latter comprised poets such as Ahsan Habib and others. Shamsur was committed to advancing the secular tradition. In developing his own style, he regularly drew inspiration from Hafiz, Ghalib, and Neruda, deeply immersing himself in his childhood memories. He frequently highlighted that his early years were enriched by the poetry and epics of Islamic, Persian, and Sanskrit cosmopolitan discourses, all of which shaped the contours of his poetic style.\nAs we often say, Shamsur Rahman, or Bacchu, was the quintessential poet of Dhaka. He vividly portrayed the everyday life of Bangladesh and captured the political events of the century through his poetic vision. In doing so, he developed a stylistic approach that diverged from the Calcutta-based concept of modernity and the European notion of cosmopolitanism. His poetic language was deeply influenced by his Islamicate Muslim childhood, which subtly informed the narrative of his work.\nThe lineage of Shamsur's poetics, both within his poetry and in the context of Dhaka, should not be framed within the parameters of Western modernity. As it is often said, modernity is not singular but plural, encompassing numerous distinct styles. Ultimately, Shamsur Rahman, our Bacchu, represents the essence of Swadeshi modernity\u2014a modernity shaped by our own unique narrative of disenchantment and reflected in the poetics of our world.\nMujib Rahman is a journalist at The Daily Star and also teaches at East West University\n",

        "full_article": "It is disheartening to see the continued suspension of Dhaka metro rail services\u2014now into its second month\u2014despite earlier assurances about services resuming on August 17. On Sunday, the newly appointed adviser of the road transport and bridges ministry expressed hope that the metro rail would be operational within seven days. And an announcement in this regard may come as early as Monday when a reconstituted board of the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL) is set to convene to discuss grievances of the employees refusing to return to work. What all this means for the commuters is a few more days of suffering before things get better.\nThe metro work abstention is but a reflection of the chaos and disruption being witnessed across the civil service after the fall of the Awami League government on August 5. At the Secretariat, for example, there have been frequent processions by civil servants who were previously denied promotions, for political reasons or poor performance, or preferred placements\u2014all seeking personal benefits rather than better public services. Although the closure of metro services since July 18 was initially linked to the vandalism of two stations during the quota reform protests, it later transpired that around 700 DMTCL employees from grades 10 to 20 have been holding a strike since August 6, shutting any chances of prompt resumption.\nAccording to our report, the employees have six demands, including one for salary increase. They argue that those in grades 1 to 9 earn 2.3 times the national pay scale, while those in grades 10 to 20 earn twice the pay scale. They see this as \"discrimination,\" and are demanding that it be rectified. This calls for a comprehensive review of the pay and benefits at DMTCL, which we hope the board will do soon. However, we cannot condone a total work stoppage for something that can be resolved amicably, especially when said stoppage has left thousands of daily commuters struggling with increased travel times, overcrowded roads, and higher transportation costs. The metro was designed to alleviate severe traffic congestion in Dhaka, and its absence is a significant setback.\nResuming its services, therefore, must be a top priority. The interim government's role in this regard is critical. It must ensure that the DMTCL management is supported in meeting the legitimate demands of its employees while also safeguarding the interests of the public. In the long run, the authorities must learn from this experience. Employee grievances should never be allowed to fester to a point where they disrupt essential services. On their part, the protesting employees, too, must understand that they cannot hold the public hostage for their own benefits. It is completely against the spirit of public service.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is a country of around 170 million people, with more than 20 million residing in the capital, Dhaka, alone. Yet, only 151-300 members of parliament representing the ruling party decide our fate in parliament. They are all members of a single party led by one individual: the party leader. There is no distribution of power or checks and balances\u2014there's only consolidation of power. Due to our people's loyalty to two political families, the only two parties to be in power since 1991 have been led by and remained completely dependent on two individuals from those two families, each of whom do everything possible to ensure all power is consolidated within their families.\nAs a result, each party is entirely controlled by one person; the party leader holds immense power over the party based on familial ties and our country's history, making their stance the \"end all, be all\" for all party decisions. On top of this, Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh prohibits members of parliament from voting against their party's decisions. The elected party (primarily its leader) gets to choose a party-affiliated president for the country, who then appoints the party leader as the prime minister.\nThat leads us to this to the party leader, serving as the prime minister, who formally heads the executive branch of government, which includes all ministries, law enforcement, and armed forces.\nAs the party leader, the prime minister also has complete control over the legislative branch, since party members cannot vote against the party, as mentioned above. Therefore, all the decisions of the party ultimately rest with the leader.\nThe president, chosen by the ruling party (primarily at the party leader's discretion), appoints the country's chief justice and other Supreme Court judges, giving the prime minister significant influence over the judiciary.\nSo, our tendency to elect leaders based on familial ties, combined with our country's laws, make it easy for one person to control all three branches of government. Our laws inherently support the creation of a democratic autocracy. With the lack of separation of powers, this enables one person to be able to make our laws, enforce them, and judge us based on them.\nWhen the constitution and laws of a country of 170 million people allow and enable one individual to have complete control over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government, can that country genuinely be considered democratic?\nOn top of this, that one person also gets the power to amend our constitution when their party secures a two-thirds majority in parliament (more than 201 of 300 elected seats). The Awami League-led grand alliance achieved this feat in 2008 with 263 seats. That is the election through which we handed \"supreme power\" to our former prime minister.\nMy question now is: will we repeat the same mistake, just with a different party or leader? We must not let that happen now that we have the scope for reinstating democratic practices.\nHaving so much power in the hands of one person is dangerous and harmful for a country, the results of which we are witnessing today. Going forward, we need to change our laws and elect our government based on merit, not familial ties. In my opinion, our system was never strong enough to be able to protect democracy. That is why almost all political parties have exploited this system one way or another.\nBangladesh needs the distribution, checks and balances of power. Otherwise, we will always be hopelessly dependent on the mercy of the prime minister. The name on that seat may change over time, but the reality for ordinary people will remain the same.\nTaus Noor is an expatriate Bangladeshi software engineer based in Canada.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The recent statement by UN Special Representative on Violence Against Children, Najat Maalla M'jid serves as a stark reminder of the need to address the vulnerabilities of children and youth in legal procedure. As Bangladesh is navigating a period of transition, she called on the new interim government to seize this opportunity to correct systemic flaws and gaps in laws to protect children from all forms of abuse, exploitation and arbitrary detention. The issue of protecting children's rights within the justice delivery system came to the forefront during the recent student-led mass movement, which saw overwhelming participation from children and youth. These young voices highlighted critical issues, but they also paid a steep price. Over 65 children lost their lives, and many more were subjected to violence and arbitrary detention. Children were even seen being led away by police, their wrists in handcuffs.Although the Bangladesh Penal Code of 1860 states that nothing is an offence if done by a child under the age of twelve who has not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of their conduct at that time. For those aged twelve to eighteen, punishments are to be reduced, and they should be tried in a children's court. However, in practice, there is no separate children's court in Bangladesh. Judges from other courts in the districts are assigned additional duties to handle such cases. Moreover, at the police station, children are often falsely shown as adults, depriving them the legal protection they are entitled to. Therefore, Maalla M'jid's call for a full, independent, and transparent investigation into these violent incidents is relevant and timely. The interim government bears the responsibility of ensuring justice for these young victims, which includes immediate cessation of all forms of violence against children and release of those unjustly detained.The creation of a child-friendly justice system is another crucial step that the interim government must prioritise. Independent courts for minors are necessary to ensure that children are treated with the care and understanding they deserve. It is important to understand that children do not commit crimes in the same way adults do-they make mistakes, often driven by a lack of understanding, guidance or opportunity. When children are deprived of essential services such as quality education, healthcare, and emotional support, they become vulnerable to negative influences and exploitation. This is precisely what the country is witnessing today, as more children are forming teen gangs and falling victim to circumstances beyond their control. Criminals often prey on these vulnerable children, using them for their own gain.The state's response to children's mistakes should not be punitive but corrective. The legal system must focus on rehabilitation and education, rather than punishment. There are a few child development centres in the country where juvenile delinquents are kept. Unfortunately, the current conditions in child development centres are not places where children can learn, grow and reform. To truly protect and guide children, the authorities must also overhaul these systems, ensuring that every child has access to a supportive, educational, and rehabilitative environment. Protecting children caught in legal limbo is not only an official obligation but a moral imperative. Doing so will go a long way in breaking the cycle of juvenile delinquency and help children realise their full potential as positive members of society.",

        "full_article": "Considering the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations, the WHO Director-General (DG), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on August 14 declared that it was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The reason for the concern is that the type of mpox named Clade 1 spreading in DRC since the beginning of this year till the end of July has infected more than 1400 people and claimed 450 plus lives. It may be recalled that the other variant of the mpox, Clade 2, that spread to some 100 countries including Asia and Europe in 2022 was a milder variety and not fatal. Symptoms of mpox infection have similarities with those of influenza which include high temperature, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen glands, joint pain, shivering and severe weakness (exhaustion). With the fever erupts rash on the patient's skin. The rash often shows up on the face and then it spreads to other parts of the body, especially on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which is itchy and painful, passes through different phases until it finally forms a scab. Ultimately, the scab falls off leaving scars on the infected areas. The symptoms clear up within two to three weeks. For people with immunodeficiency and children under 15, the infection can be fatal needing anti-mpox jabs. However, older people who are over 40 and inoculated against small pox are thought to be immune from mpox. On this score, it may be recalled that small pox has been phased out from the world four decades ago. So, the possibility is high that people, who are in their 40s and above, had their anti-small pox jabs, as the disease was endemic in this part of this world in those days.Notably, mpox virus belongs to the family of small pox, but is far less virulent. The infection may take place through broken skins, close physical contact such as sex, touching objects used by infected person and talking with an infected person sitting close by. The way mpox spreads has a lot of similarity with coronavirus and so the health protocols to protect against mpox, too, have similarities. Mpox is a zoonotic disease meaning it can spread from animals to humans. Now it is being transmitted among humans. Originally, the disease was endemic in the tropical rain forests of the West and Central Africa. Recently, the highly infectious disease is learnt to have spread to central and East African countries including Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya where the disease was not endemic. Now what concerns scientists is that the Clade 1 variant of the mpox, which, earlier, was confined to DRC over the decades, is now spreading to other parts of Africa and beyond. Reports have it that in this latest wave of mpox's spread, both the number of cases and fatalities from them have increased by 160 per cent and 19 per cent respectively compared to the records of 2023. Recently, outside Africa, the first case of Clade 1 was detected in Sweden in Europe. That was the first ever case detected in that country, said public health agency of Sweden. The person who brought the disease to that country stayed in an African country where that particular variant, Clade 1, had broken out. Interestingly, it happened hours after the WHO DG declared that the outbreak of mpox in parts of Africa was now a PHEIC. But the most concerning part of the story is the arrival of newer and severer form of Clade 1, called Clade 1b, among the people who were infected with Clade 1 variant last year. Clearly, the Clade 1 variant of the mpox is evolving, maybe through genetic mutation. However, experts are yet to fully understand the behaviour of this latest variant of mpox. Even so, it is clear that this deadlier version of mpox spreads faster causing more serious medical conditions in the infected persons.But the mpox is no more the story of an infectious disease that is affecting people in a remote part of the world. From their experience of the Covid-19 pandemic, the public knows how fast such diseases can leap across the continents. Last Friday, Pakistan's health ministry announced the detection of an mpox-infected person in that country. Accordingly, a health alert has been declared there. But there is no such report yet in Bangladesh. Even so, it is commendable that Bangladesh's health ministry on Saturday last issued high alert against mpox. Also, the directorate general of health services (DGHS) has issued a guideline to avoid getting infected by the disease along with providing the public with contact numbers (16263 and 10655) to inform in case someone is found with symptoms of mpox. As part of the measures to protect against importing the disease from abroad, arrangements have been made at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) to screen temperatures of people arriving from foreign land.While welcoming the government's prompt measures against the possible entry of the disease from outside the country, it is worth noting that the vaccines against mpox are in short supply globally. Worse yet, the funds to procure the vaccine, too, are also not readily available with the global agencies responsible for public health. The government will be required to make especial efforts to collect anti-mpox jabs from whatever sources possible, particularly for the immunocompromised section of the population including children. At the same time, research facilities for testing and analysing samples from any mpox-infected person should be made available for researchers to detect if the risky variants like Clade 1 or Clade 1b are entering the country. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The ugly incidents that happened on August 15 in areas around the now torched Bangabandhu Memorial Museum on Road No. 32, Dhanmondi have prompted one of the coordinators of the anti-discrimination movement to condemn those in unequivocal terms. Three other coordinators also denounced the reprehensible acts but one of them in particular went into details explaining how the excesses committed by the activists of the 'resistance week' violated the human rights and contravened the spirit of the movement they have waged. Without going into the merit of the programme arranged to resist a 'counter-revolution', it can be said that intercepting anyone, particularly those with bouquets, passing that area for interrogation is a violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens. What happened on the day went beyond all limits. Senior citizens including women were assaulted, a few of the male members disrobed and even tied with a rope, humiliated by forcing them to do a number of sit-ups holding their ears. Such outrageous acts go against the very principle the anti-discrimination movement seeks to establish in society. Even Bangabir Kader Siddique was not only denied to pay homage to Bangabandhu but also his car was smashed. Journalists were also forced to refrain from taking snaps and some of them were made to delete those they had already taken. August 15 is not August 5, the day when Hasina's government fell and the multitudes of crowd invaded the Ganobhaban and the Jatiya Sangsad, set the Bangabandu Memorial Museum on fire and looted almost everything they could lay their hands on. It was so mean of the invaders. The narratives would like people to believe that it happened on the spur of the moment. This certainly falls short of a logical explanation. Invasion is one thing, looting a completely different act that exposes a mind that is all but suspect. Given the opportunities, the looters could commit far graver crimes. The pictures shown on the television was nauseating and those certainly did not project an enviable image of the nation to the rest of the world. At least, such acts should have been deplored in the strongest of terms by both the coordinators of the movement and the interim government.Had the lawlessness and looting been prevented on that day, the stick and iron rod-wielding youths would not dare what they did on the occasion of Sheikh Mujib's anniversary of death with a small number of people who went there to pay respect to the main architect of Bangladesh's liberation. On August 5, he has been subjected to enough ignominy. There was no need to add insult to injury by following the repugnant acts the deposed ruling party's student wing Chhatra League was notorious for. These are early days of the interim government but still it could prevent this kind of infringement on the fundamental rights of the people. The events of August 5 have shown if left to themselves, crowds are driven by mob mentality and all kinds of untoward things can happen there. If such anarchies continue on the plea that people have tolerated such oppressions for 15 years and they can bear with 15 days' opposite reactions, the movement may get derailed and lose its way in the wilderness. That is in no one's interest. Happily, the coordinators seem to be well aware of this danger. They have not only asked their co-travellers or followers to refrain from similar acts but also made it a point to identify those who acted deplorably on August 15. There are reasons to be optimistic to see that the coordinators have their feet on the ground. The coordinator who held a press conference made it clear that they are a pressure group that will continue to hammer on their main objective of creating a discrimination-free society. They cannot take law into their own hands or do policing but must bring anomalies and injustice to the authorities' notice for redress. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

The court emphasised that Rule 13 of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1979, must be strictly enforced.According to this law, every government employee is required to declare to the government, through the proper authority, any shares, certificates, securities, insurance policies, and ornaments valued at 50,000 taka or more that are owned or held by them or their family members. Additionally, the law mandates that every government employee must submit a statement of any increase or decrease in their assets every five years through the appropriate authority.When elected representatives fail to fulfil their commitments, government officials also neglect their obligation to account for their assets. Years of unchecked accountability have turned public administration into a breeding ground for corruption. The Benazir and Matiur scandals are not isolated incidents; numerous government officials and employees have become symbols of corruption while drawing salaries and allowances from taxpayers' money.To address this situation, it is essential that not only the judiciary but also all public administration departments take responsibility for monitoring their assets.
