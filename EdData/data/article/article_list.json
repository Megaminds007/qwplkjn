The manner in which the violence was captured on camera and circulated, the premeditated nature of the murder itself, and the celebration that followed \u2014 all point to the peak of a communal volcano that India has climbed up through a relentless campaign of political parties and a cohort of pathetically irresponsible television anchors. The Rajasthan police have acted with alacrity and arrested the criminals, whose trial and punishment must be quick and exemplary. The State deserves credit for swift action, although the police should have been alive to the threat faced by Kanhaiya Lal. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot who has noted the deteriorating situation, of communal hostility, in several parts of the country has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to issue an appeal for peace. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on the contrary, has accused the Congress in Rajasthan of appeasement of a community \u2014 in a reference to Muslims, who are at the receiving end of police violence and discriminatory policy at the national level and in many States. The Udaipur killing marks a major turn in the communal situation in India, and could potentially trigger more such violence.No violence can be condoned; sadly, in India, some of the arms of the state are among the perpetrators. The clamour from BJP followers for collective punishment of Muslims \u2014 which the party\u2019s governments in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Assam, for instance, are doing anyway \u2014 has become louder, aided by the party\u2019s official policy, following the Udaipur killing. An uneven application of law has led to serious disenchantment among Muslims. While Hindutva violence is being promoted and protected by the state in several instances, Muslims have been at the receiving end of police highhandedness even when they seek legal remedies for grievances. A significant section of the citizenry losing faith and hope in the rule of law can trigger chaos and anarchy that will self-perpetuate at a huge cost to the nation. Needless to say, enemies of the nation will be waiting in the wings to take advantage. Udaipur must act as a chilling tale of caution. The BJP governments do not seem to see any merit in observing constitutional niceties and equality before the law. But the party must dial down its dangerous communal frenzy \u2014 so that the very nation that it avowedly proclaims to protect does not fall into a cauldron of endemic violence.",

The inherent absurdity of the charge \u2014 that he sought to incite enmity between groups and insult religious feelings by sharing four years ago an image from a 40-year-old film \u2014 and that the complainant is a pseudonymous Twitter handle \u2014 make it clear that this is nothing but the establishment\u2019s vengeance playing out as a criminal case. Mr. Zubair\u2019s arrest is yet another instance of the regime\u2019s characteristic intolerance, and its resentment towards fact-checkers who frequently expose its claims. This reflects its well-demonstrated antipathy to anyone seeking to counter majoritarian bigotry. It is also consistent with the ongoing trend of targeting minority activists, ranging from administrative excesses such as demolition of houses of protesters and imprisonment of activists based on charges conjured up by the police and investigative agencies. Mr. Zubair and his website have been active in highlighting flagrant instances of hate speech, and the genocidal tenor of some rants at anti-minority conclaves. The objective, it appears, is not merely his prosecution for an alleged slur against the Hindu god Hanuman, but to embark on a lengthy spell of persecution.The case itself will be seen in most jurisdictions as a prank rather than a prosecution. The image he had shared is from a film sequence that shows a couple finding to their dismay that \u2018Honeymoon Hotel\u2019 had been revised to \u2018Hanuman Hotel\u2019, apparently conveying a message that it is not open to couples. The idea that this is an insult to Lord Hanuman is breath-taking in its absurdity, as there is no insinuation against the deity. That a magistrate entertained the FIR as well as granted police custody might seem shocking. But in times when even constitutional courts are seen as cooperating with the executive when it comes to restrictions on the freedom of citizens, it would have been a miracle if the magistracy had not followed suit. However, any judicial examination of the FIR would show that neither Section 153A nor Section 295A is attracted. How something said four years ago will incite enmity is beyond anyone\u2019s comprehension. The Supreme Court has laid down that Section 295A punishes only insults to religion that are made with deliberate and malicious intention, and anything said unwittingly or without malice is not an offence. Mr. Zubair\u2019s arrest has invited condemnation even beyond India. It is unfortunate that the Government wants to be seen as protective of free speech and democratic values abroad, but does not mind the odium that the hounding of or crackdown on activists and journalists invites. Instead of perpetuating this travesty of justice, the Government should see reason, drop the spiteful case and release him.",

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, by picking up former Jharkhand governor Draupadi Murmu as its candidate for the July 18 Presidential election, has abided by the inclusive Dharma of democracy.\nThe two successful candidates of the NDA in the past who made to Rashtrapati Bhavan equally emphasised inclusivity and most suitable to hold the top Constitutional post. APJ Abdul Kalam, India\u2019s missile man, not only lived to give the country strategic deterrence but also became a role model for all, particularly youth. His life was a living testimony to the Indian tradition of pursuit of knowledge and humility.\nIn Ram Nath Kovind, India got a President who was most humble and democratic, who opened the doors of Rashtrapati Bhavan for the people while being most courteous in his conduct and discharge of the duty. The political commentators sought to bracket him as the BJP\u2019s Dalit bet, but he eventually proved that he could conduct the Constitutional duties most efficiently.\nMurmu struggled all her life but beat the odds to raise her children, while also becoming a foremost social and political worker. From being a legislator, she proved her mettle in Odisha as a minister and thereafter as the governor of Jharkhand.\nShe would be the first tribal President of India since the NDA has the support of the Biju Janata Dal and the YSR Congress for the July 18 election. The BJP has for long been pursuing an inclusive agenda. Even in 1996, when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government fell in 13 days despite being the single largest party, it had the largest number of the tribal MPs in its ranks. The BJP\u2019s foremost commitment to take all sections of society has been an abiding principle.\nMurmu will be a candidate in the Presidential election at a time when the Narendra Modi-led government has given a new hope to the tribal population in the country by taking his mantra of \u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Viswas aur Sabka Prayas\u2019 to every nook and corner of the country, including the tribal areas in Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. During the rule of the United Progressive Alliance, Leftwing or Maoist extremism was at its peak; people talked about the Red Corridor, connecting the hotbed of Maoist violence in Nepal to the deep forests in Sukma in Chhattisgarh. The violence cost several lives of paramilitary forces.\nThe NDA government set out for course correction right at the outset, and gave hope to the tribal youth that they can see better future in the mainstream of society, as several welfare schemes brought benefits to the people without hassles, without paying bribes. The government\u2019s honesty was visible, and the tribals of the country turned their backs to violence.\nIn the last few years, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Odisha have largely been peaceful, with a decline in Maoist violence.\nWhen Murmu takes the oath of the office as the President of India, the tribal population will see the fulfillment of their political aspirations. They will see that one from among them is the first citizen of India.\nThe Aspirational District programme of the Central government was envisioned with clear objective that the gains of the development must reach the poorest of the poor, in accordance with the true of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.\nThe tribals have seen that they have been brought in the mainstream of the economy with financial inclusion, pucca houses with toilets, pension schemes and so on. They don\u2019t need to fall for the allurements of the evangelists to embrace their religion.\nThe elevation of Murmu to the post of the President of India will be the firm democratic empowerment of the tribal population, as well as women of the country. She has thoroughly been a spiritual person and her association with Brahmakumaris is well known.\nShe was sweeping the floor of a temple a day after her name was announced by the BJP president JP Nadda; people have seen how humble a person she is. She stands for simplicity, spirituality.\nShe is a Constitutionalist, a firm believer in the Indian Constitution\u2019s capacity to fulfill the aspirations of all sections of society. Her life is also a living testimony of perseverance. She never lost hope even when she faced personal losses. In her, India will have a President who will give hope to the vast majority of the people that all hardships can be won over with honesty and patience.\nWhile the Opposition parties were busy in elimination rounds to find a candidate for the Presidential election, the BJP was thinking of national interest. When the BJP named Murmu as its Presidential candidate, even the rivals suggested that the contest has become one-sided. The Opposition candidate, Yashwant Sinha, can save his lost reputation by gracefully withdrawing from the Presidential election to pave way for the unanimous election of Murmu as India\u2019s President.\nThe author is Director, Public Policy Research Centre (@Sumeetbhasin)",

        "full_article": "There\u2019s no merit in demands to lynch anybody without first appreciating the circumstances under which the person may have uttered angry words\nIn the emotional thrust and parrying of viewpoints over Nupur Sharma\u2019s remarks, some fundamental points have been lost sight of. Now that an authentic video of the TV programme is no longer available, we can only go by inferences and deductions and try to answer some fundamental questions based on these. What exactly did Nupur say that sparked this outrage both domestically and in Islamist nations? Indications are that she alluded to some details of the Islamic Prophet\u2019s life. Did she invent these details to malign Islam and mock its followers? If so, she deserves the strongest condemnation and a harsh punishment. If, however, what she mentioned was derived from Islamic sources, then her misdemeanour falls in the category of an unfortunate choice of words or a tactless iteration in the heat of debate. In that case, her immature simplicity was her only sin, quite understandable in somebody in her 30s. And that requires at best a reprimand from her party, the BJP, and an admonition to be more circumspect and to avoid such indiscretions.\nThe veracity of the above scenarios notwithstanding, was the overblown reaction to an off-the-cuff remark on national TV discussion, in response to provocation, proportionate and justifiable? Are the rabid chants of\nsar-tan-se-juda asking for her beheading, in Kanpur and elsewhere, condonable in civilised society? Should it be par for the course for any community to make children hold up posters asking for somebody\u2019s head? And all this when Nupur had already apologised unconditionally?\nSomething forgotten in the present overcharged discourse is what Nupur stated in a video flicker, since gone missing; that she cannot remain silent when her Mahadev is insulted and that she had made the remarks in anger. What did her Muslim interlocutor on the TV debate say about Lord Shiva that she was referring to? And why are his comments muted and lost in the din of her universal condemnation by the secular lobby in India and the Islamist one abroad?\nIn the pan-India protests after Friday prayers, the posters at different locations had an eerie commonality \u2014 of image, banner text. The similarity across distant locations points to coordinated planning and execution. Were the protests orchestrated by vested interests out to undermine the Modi Government by sowing discord between communities? Were these instigators, inimical to Indian national interest, inspired and funded by foreign agencies?\nNow about the protests abroad. Does Qatar have any right to demand a public apology from the Government of India when in 2010 it had given shelter and honorary citizenship to artist MF Husain who, after painting Hindu goddesses in the nude, refused to appear before court and fled the country? Almost every Islamic nation, as well as the 57-member OIC, initially lambasted India for the intemperate remarks by somebody not holding any Government position. The Pakistan press lamented that \u201cthe idea of India was facing an existential crisis\u201d, presumably because the idea was secular, quite forgetting that the country itself is a theocratic State that unabashedly persecutes minorities.\nAn Arab newspaper pointed out that Nupur\u2019s Muslim co-panellist was not blaspheming Ram or Sita when in anger she uttered the offending remarks. While that may well be true, she was instead provoked probably by the worst blasphemy possible for Hindus \u2014 the ritual washing of feet, Vazoo, by Muslim worshippers at Gyanvapi mosque That surely is an offence much greater than a tactless, angry remark.\nWhy was the reaction overblown? The Grand Mufti of Oman exhorted all Muslims to rise as one nation, there were calls in the Gulf countries for boycott of Indian goods, and there were reminders of India\u2019s dependence on the Gulf countries for oil imports and inward remittances.\nUnder Modi, India has tried its best to improve relations with the Gulf countries and obtained significant success. Modi himself has paid several visits to the region, been received warmly and had national honours bestowed on him. Pakistan often invokes the Islamic Ummah for undermining India; it did so this time also, especially with OIC. However, since its credibility is rather low, many Islamic countries did not take long to recover from the initial kneejerk reaction. The Iranian Foreign Minister after his recent visit to New Delhi approved of the Indian Government\u2019s handling of the controversy and its fallout. The Kuwait Government has taken strict action against the anti-India protesters, even deporting some expatriates and banning them from entering the country again.\nDomestically, it was a godsend opportunity for the Opposition to malign Modi and BJP. Though religious figures like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi distanced themselves from the unruly protests and violent rioting, leaders who cultivate the simple, unaware Islamic vote bank played to their gallery and feigned righteous indignation. The fact that major rioting started 10 days after the TV episode lends credence to the allegation that mob anger was built up over time deliberately by leaders like Owaisi. One of the downsides of democracy is that unscrupulous politicians may pander to the rabble\u2019s irrational sentiments for electoral gains at the cost of social cohesion; this episode illustrates it vividly.\n(A former banker, the writer\u2019s love for words and ideas has turned him towards writing columns. The views expressed are personal.)",

GoI yesterday directed the National Investigation Agency to take over the probe, with the search for international links being a key dimension. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot echoed the view. He said the murder was meant to spread terror and the information available indicated the two perpetrators have contacts overseas.\nIt bears mention that the two terrorists, Mohmmad Riyaz Akhtari and Gaus Mohammad, who have freely admitted to murdering Lal, apparently belong to groups that believe that the \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cblasphemy\u201d must be death. Indeed, the most chilling aspect of what Riyaz and Gaus did was the videography, reminiscent of ISIS-style brutality. Clearly, what happened in Udaipur requires a multi-level and multi-agency response.\nA thorough investigation by NIA into Lal\u2019s murder, with the state government cooperating, and quick, definitive results are the best first responses to the act of terrorism. Interminable delays do great harm to the cause of fighting terror, especially when social situations are volatile. The other crucial job for investigators is to figure out whether Riyaz and Gaus are part of a deadly pattern that will emerge over time. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s imperative that agencies are proactive in their response.\nThere\u2019s also the question of the quality of local policing. The victim, Lal, had communicated a threat to his life in a formal complaint. For sure, the state has suspended an assistant sub inspector in Udaipur for negligence. But this horrifying incident shows the cost of states\u2019 reluctance to implement even most basic police reforms. In state after state, and in incident after incident, local police forces have been found wanting even when clear indications of threats have been available. And finally, all political parties must keep an eye on groups and individuals who can say or do things that aggravate an already volatile situation.\n\n",

SC has followed precedent and upheld the sanctity of the floor test, offering no room for any further delays, forcing Uddhav Thackeray to quit as chief minister. The long window it earlier granted until July 12 to 16 Shiv Sena rebels to reply to disqualification notices was unnecessary. It had raised worries of the floor test getting delayed. Trust motions have served well over the years in gleaning actual legislative strengths amid the fog of claims and counterclaims. Shiv Sena\u2019s internal drama has dragged on for ten days now. No public interest could have been served by prolonging the confusion. Only more unrest and chaos would have ensued with delays.\nThe pending disqualification notices against 16 MLAs didn\u2019t stall the trust vote as was feared. In 2020, SC had ruled that the pendency of disqualification proceedings against Jyotiraditya Scindia\u2019s MLAs who had resigned their MP assembly membership cannot delay the floor test. Meanwhile, Constitution\u2019s Tenth Schedule (Para 4) allows a breakaway faction comprising two-thirds of a political party to stay in the original party or merge with another political party or a new party without facing disqualification.\nIf it is proven that Eknath Shinde has at least 37 Shiv Sena MLAs with him, the Uddhav faction faces a tough road ahead. Uddhav\u2019s hopes had rested on mollifying some rebels after their return to Mumbai. But despite his placatory stances, there was no sign of detente, which has now culminated in his resignation. It remains to be seen how Shiv Sena politics plays out in the days ahead: After proving his mettle, will Shinde go back to playing second fiddle to Thackeray? The MVA experiment is most likely over. Alternatively, can Shiv Sena and BJP rebuild their old partnership? There are no easy answers to these questions. With the BMC, Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli civic polls coming up, Maharashtra politics will be in great ferment for the foreseeable future.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n",

The draft law provides for a Tk 10 lakh fine for participating in \"illegal activities.\"\nApparently, the idea has been in the works since 2016, and the 1974 statute has to be amended to fit in such a draconian provision. For good reasons, not all members of the BPC are in accord with the suggested amendments. From reports in the print media, it appears that the draft was formulated and subsequent action was taken in a furtive manner. Some of the members were not aware of the proposal, and the necessary procedures, they feel, had not been followed before placing such a proposal to the Cabinet. Certainly, the journalist community had not been consulted either as a group or as members of the Council representing it.\nThe proposed punitive provisions would do anything but preserve the freedom of the press. The defining clause of the provision is ambiguous and lends itself to interpretation by the agencies involved in the process of law and order. For one thing, what is \"illegal activity\"? There are existing laws that lay down actions against anyone involved in \"illegal activities\". Why do we need to have a separate law to govern journalists? Left to the administration and its agencies, the possibility of interpreting the law to suit the circumstances cannot be dismissed out of hand. The DSA is a case in point. The worst sufferers of this very abominable legislation are the journalists. Who defines what constitutes \"harm\" to the image of the country and how? Is, for example, reporting extrajudicial killings, or instances of gross monetary irregularity or corruption in high places, \"harming the state or its freedom or harming the image of the country\"?\nMore often than not, the ruling party or the government has been equated with the state as several cases under the DSA exemplifies, and one cannot be blamed for thinking that the same inclination would work on the psyche of the administration when it comes to the application of the proposed amendment. On the contrary, we believe, withholding such information, in fact, is not only harmful to the image of the country, keeping it from public domain is patently anti-state. After all, corruption, or abridgments of the right to life not only abnegates the country's constitution, it puts the country's interest at stake too.\nThere is a raft of laws, namely, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the DSA, the draft Data Protection Act, and the draft Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms (draft BTRC regulations). One wonders whether the proposed amendment betrays an element of fear or uncertainty of the ruling party and the current government. Why should a government, if it has been duly elected in a fair and free election, and claims to have the support of the majority, be so eager to add another ring in the shackles that bind the media today?\nIt seems that journalists and their \"welfare\" are occupying the mind of the administration. Not only the proposed law which, some say, is designed to sort out \"errant\" journalists or those who do not fall in line (with the exception of a few most have), the government is also contemplating, reportedly, to make a separate database of journalists, according to the information minister, to \"restore discipline in journalism\".\nThere is for good reason that the press (there was only the print media then) was dubbed as the \"fourth estate\". But since the time British politician Edmund Burke made the reference (in more of an apprehensive rather than a deferential tone), the Fourth Estate has become a metaphor for the power of the media that empowers it to hold the government and the political party, which the people have chosen by free will to run their affairs, to account, if the policies of the government run contrary to the interest of the public. But regrettably, in recent times, the media has come to be described as the \"enemy of the people\" by the president [now former president] of a country that holds the First Amendment to its constitution as sacred as the scripture. And in the world's largest democracy, the country's historically free press has been hijacked, according to one commentator, to do the biddings of the ruling party. In our country, too, the DSA is the sword of Damocles.\nAdmittedly, every institution must be guided by some rules and follow certain principles of functioning. But the administration, instead of being an enabler of free flow of information for public good, should not become a hinderer. Admittedly too, the media has not been able to acquit itself properly, but that is not because of lack of intent, but perhaps due to lack of capability in most cases.\nThe amendment to the existing law would also need another amendment, since the proposed punishment and the 1974 Act does not contain any punitive clause, and would alter the very underlying purpose of the commission. The preamble to the Act states, \"[I]t is expedient to establish a Press Council for the purpose of preserving the freedom of the Press and maintaining and improving the standard of newspapers and news agencies in Bangladesh.\" And in fulfilling that particular objective of helping newspapers and news agencies to maintain their freedom, the Council, apart from its other tasks, has the duty \"to keep under review any development likely to restrict the supply and dissemination of information of public interest and importance.\" This and the ambiguous amendment are mutually exclusive.\n\u00a0\nBrig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan, ndc, psc (retd) is a former associate editor of The Daily Star.\n",

As we wake up from the nightmare of COVID-19 pandemic, is the former world really the one we want to return to? The widespread disruption of our lives as a result of the coronavirus pandemic compels us to rethink the flaws in our social and economic systems while comprehending the magnitude of a crisis that waded through national and international borders.\nGovernments and policymakers all around the world are examining ways to deal with the pandemic-inflicted devastation, considering recovery measures, and probing for different means to return to normalcy. However, failing to take the existing design flaws seriously and returning to the old ways should no longer be an option. The prevalent paradigm of our era with its sole focus on perpetual growth disregards many aspects of the human condition and the limitations of our biosphere. It now depends on us whether this once-in-a-century pandemic will be a once-in-a-generation juncture for a concrete shift from our flawed economic ideals.\nThe current dominant narrative linking perpetual growth with prosperity is deeply rooted as a foundational idea in the mindsets of our policymakers. From finance ministries to central banks, and think tanks to policy institutes, the primary focus remains on economic expansion with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being the yardstick for measurement. The concept of economic growth is not irrelevant for a country but when we unduly focus on only one yardstick to assess our complex and intertwined society, we lose perspective of what the yardstick is supposed to measure. Growth is only supposed to be a means to an end, and not the end itself.\u00a0\nEven though the growth approach has played a role in improving quality of life and alleviating poverty, it does not signify that this method is the best one or that all the successes in poverty reduction can be attributed to economic growth policies. In the article titled, \"How Poverty Ends: The Many Paths to Progress \u2013 and Why They Might Not Continue,\" the 2019 Economics Nobel prize-winning duo, Esther Duflo and Abhijeet Banerjee write, \"Looking back, it is clear that many of the important successes of the last few decades were the result not of economic growth but of a direct focus on improving particular outcomes, even in countries that were and have remained very poor.\"\nCreating targeted intervention with measurable objectives and focusing on precise aspects such as health, education, equality of opportunity, sustainability, innovation, and freedom of speech can go a long way in improving well-being without compromising other areas of societal development. Duflo and Banerjee conclude, \"In the absence of a magic potion for development, the best way to profoundly transform millions of lives is not to try in vain to boost growth. It is to focus squarely on the thing that growth is supposed to improve: the well-being of the poor.\"\nIn the calculation of GDP, environmental degradation, standard of living, or inequality are not taken into account, as methods of measurement solely focus on output, expenditure, and income. GDP only conveys the average income and that is not a reflection of what the majority is earning or how they are living. A few outliers and even one person, with a massive paycheck, can skew the GDP showing a high per capita income. GDP is also blind to the state of our natural world. The Guardian's economic correspondent, Richard Partington, discusses this in his article by pointing out, \"After the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989, the oil spill showed up as a net economic gain because the money spent on the clean-up effort boosted US GDP \u2013 despite the damage to Alaska's waters.\" The true costs of such events, which are harming the social and economic health of a nation, are not reflected in GDP.\nThe shallowness of perpetual economic growth as the primary objective of our economies has long been unearthed. And yet, alternative frameworks for progress are not pursued due to intellectual inertia coupled with a lack of political ambition. In their report \"Mismeasuring Our Lives: Why GDP Doesn't Add Up\", a commission of three renowned economists, Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, remark, \"Those attempting to guide the economy are like pilots steering a course without a reliable compass\" When policy decisions are based on an ill-designed metric for economic performance and progress, the outcomes are often detrimental.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, what possible alternative approach can countries pursue to assess progress and development? A single measure that summarises the economic performance and social progress would be great, but according to Stiglitz, \"too much valuable information is lost when we form an aggregate.\" And therefore, the commission concludes, \"each nation needs a dashboard \u2013 a set of numbers that would convey essential diagnostics of its society and economy and help steer them.\" Policymakers and civil society need to move away from \"GDP thinking\" and pay attention to quality-of-life indicators such as health, education, equality of opportunity, environment, physical security, and economic protection.\nIt is now a societal imperative that we look beyond the narrow lens provided to us by mainstream policy discourse and seriously consider progress metrics that are more inclusive than the simplistic measure of GDP. We can no longer undermine the effects of our actions on the ecology, and neither can we continue disregarding the massive disparities in our society. As the first step to moving forward, we need to recognise the fault lines in our societal priorities. And as the next, we need to modify our current ways to value the end that is well-being over the means that is perpetual growth. The future now depends on how we address the pandemic recovery, and whether we choose to settle on band-aid solutions or permanently change the rules.\n\u00a0\nTarannum Sahar\u00a0is a Cornell University graduate and an incoming Public Policy student at UC Berkeley.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's struggle with smuggling is not a new phenomenon \u2013 gold, drugs, humans, money, fuel, and now edible oil. In February, a lighter vessel, Tanisha Enterprise, was seized on the Karnaphuli river by Chattogram zone river police, which was carrying 11,000 litres of smuggled unrefined edible oil for sale in the open market. The value of the seized edible oil is estimated to be around Tk 8.80 lakh. The unrefined edible oil had been transferred to the lighter vessel from a mother vessel at the outer anchorage, which was carrying shipment for an edible oil company. Twelve people had been arrested during the drive for failing to produce any valid documents. The lighter vessel belonged to Harunur Rashid, a Jubo League leader in Ward-39 EPZ area of Chattogram, who also happens to be one of the leaders of the smuggling syndicate and its mastermind, as reported by the media. Although he was initially implicated in the case, no action has somehow been taken against him, and he is walking the streets and even attending political events as if he was a responsible, law-abiding citizen.\nThis incident has once again brought to the fore the problem of smuggling of imported goods from the ports. In December last year, in Pashur river, Mongla, another such drive exposed the smuggling of diesel from a mother vessel. The coast guard seized 2,760 litres of diesel in a trawler and held some of the smugglers. Unfortunately, it was not the first time oil was being smuggled. The harbour authorities of the Mongla port had informed the media that every month 80 to 90 local and foreign ships arrive at the port with goods and commodities from abroad, and leveraging this opportunity, a strong syndicate of criminals smuggles goods and commodities from the ships.\nThe same thing happened in Chattogram port. And there as well, on a regular basis, imported goods and commodities are smuggled from ships. What is baffling is that, although these are \"known\" facts, the authorities have done little to catch the smugglers and dismantle the syndicates. Perhaps that is because the smugglers are powerful people operating under the patronage of influential quarters. Take the case of Harunur Rashid, for example. Although the ship belonged to him and was being operated by him, he was not arrested in the case. According to reports, he got bail.\nThis not the first time that smuggled goods have been seized from Tanisha Enterprise. In August last year, in the estuary of the Karnaphuli river, 13,000 litres of unrefined palm oil had been seized from the same vessel by officials of the Coast Guard East Zone. Later, when the case was handed over to customs, no action was taken. Apart from this, Harun stands accused in at least four cases filed with the Patenga and EPZ police stations \u2013 this daily reported citing police sources.\nNow, the questions is, if Harun is such a big shot criminal, donned with so many cases, how is he allowed to get away with his crimes scot-free? Why is he not behind bars, or being interrogated to unveil the bigger picture about the smuggling syndicate he operates?\nMoreover, the Directorate General of Shipping issued licence for Tanisha Enterprise as a sand barge. Then why are food items, oil and other goods being shipped using Tanisha? Did they not check its license? Perhaps they did, but let it continue its operations because of the political patronage its owner enjoys.\nAnd this is only one aspect of it. Selling of smuggled goods in the open market is a different kind of problem altogether. Take the case of edible oil, for example. The market for commodities, especially edible oil, has been volatile for the last few months due to the ongoing international crises. And the common people are having to bear the brunt of it, because of a lack of supply of edible oil in the market and its subsequent spiralling prices. The business syndicates are being accused of hoarding edible oil to manipulate its prices, and police have seized thousands of litres of edible oil in multiple drives across the country. The smuggling of imported unrefined edible oil creates additional layers of impediment in the supply chain, which is likely to push prices further up. Moreover, when goods are brought into the country through customs, the NBR is able to generate revenue from them in the form of applicable taxes and customs duty. And through the VAT imposed on goods, revenue is increased. By selling smuggled goods in the open market, the smugglers are depriving the nation of\u00a0 revenue, and also creating an alternative supply chain which is outside the scope of the mainstream economy.\nUnfortunately, the authorities seem to have lost sight of these facts, which is why they are allowing smuggling syndicates to operate without fear. In view of the repeated smuggling cases, the possibility of the various authorities \u2013 including the port authorities, coast guards, police, etc. \u2013 also being culpable cannot be ruled out.\nThe government should hold them accountable for their failure in stopping the smuggling and nabbing the criminals. Special drives should be conducted immediately to arrest the criminals. If political patronage is involved, then the patrons should also be brought to heel for their involvement. These smuggling syndicates should immediately be dismantled, before further wound is inflicted on the national economy.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Two verdicts in two different countries, located thousands of miles apart, by their respective supreme courts last week have stoked a serious debate about the role of judges and politicisation of the judiciary. Both these countries are known to be models of democracies \u2013 one for unfettered freedom of speech and the other for the vast number of its constituents. Both these verdicts have huge implications on the future of democracy beyond their borders, as the disputes involved religion and politics.\nOne of these two verdicts was in the United States. A nearly 50-year-old ruling which had given women reproductive freedom was reversed, which has shocked the majority and drawn criticism from world leaders, but has bolstered American conservatives and anti-abortion Christian faith groups. The appointment process of the US Supreme Court justices is known for its notorious political exercises.\nThe other verdict was in India, in which the Supreme Court has not only given Prime Minister Narendra Modi a clean chit for his role during the anti-Muslim riots in 2002 in Gujarat (during which he was the state's chief minister), but has also chided the victims for seeking justice. Some opposition parties and human rights activists have expressed their outrage and, as in the US, have pointed out that the latest decision is quite the opposite of the same Court's observation passed 18 years ago.\nThe harshest criticism of the US Supreme Court's judgement allowing states to deny the right of women to terminate their pregnancies, however, came from within the bench, as the three dissenting Justices (Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor) stated that the majority's decision \"undermines the court's legitimacy.\" Leading newspapers published editorials and opinion pieces questioning the politicisation of the highest court. Under the headline \"The Politicization of the Supreme Court Is Eroding Its Legitimacy,\" Peter Coy wrote in The New York Times, \"People on the losing end of Supreme Court decisions increasingly feel that justice is not being served. That's a scary situation for the high court, and for American democracy in general.\" Writing in the The Washington Post, columnist Max Boot noted, \"Everyone knows that the Founders were afraid of the tyranny of the majority. That's why they built so many checks and balances into the Constitution. What's less well known is that they were also afraid of the tyranny of the minority.\" And, his column bears the title: \"The Supreme Court rulings represent the tyranny of the minority.\" This view is not unexpected, as a Gallup poll, conducted mostly after the draft of a Supreme Court decision addressing abortion rights was leaked, found 55 percent Americans now consider themselves as being pro-choice.\nWorld leaders who have criticised this verdict include Canada's Justin Trudeau and Britain's Boris Johnson. Acknowledging global concerns about how the verdict will impact others around the world, the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, issued an unusual statement on a domestic legal issue by saying, \"Today's decision overturning Roe v. Wade has raised understandable questions and concerns across the world and within our workforce.\" He then promised that his Administration would remain fully committed to helping provide access to reproductive health services and advancing reproductive rights around the world.\nGiven the scale of jubilation and protests among anti- and pro-choice supporters in the US and other countries, political wrangling over this issue is unlikely to end anytime soon. Instead, political pundits have suggested that the upcoming midterm elections in the US will be more divisive and acrimonious.\nThe other verdict, delivered by the Supreme Court of India, had an almost instantaneous reaction. The apex court in its ruling upheld a clean chit given to the then Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, in the Gulberg Society massacre case and rebuked the appellants, the widow of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, and supported by human rights activist Teesta Setalvad, saying the \"pot\" was kept \"boiling\" for \"ulterior design.\" The use of these terminologies by top judges has shocked opposition politicians and jurists in India. They have pointed out the fact that another bench of the same Court in April 2004 observed, \"The modern-day Neros were looking elsewhere when Best Bakery and innocent children and helpless women were burning, and were probably deliberating how the perpetrators of the crime can be protected.\"\nThe Indian Supreme Court's new observation also indicates that the Court wanted them to be punished. And the results were predictable and quick. Citing the observation of the verdict, Gujarat police have arrested human rights defender Teesta Setalvad and former police official RB Sreekumar in a lightning response.\nRights groups have termed Setalvad's arrest as reprisal and say that it sends a chilling message to the civil society and further shrinks the space for dissent in India. Writing in the online portal, The Wire, Professor Apoorvanand of Delhi University says, \"What the present Supreme Court has done is unpardonable. It has made the victims of the alleged state-sponsored violence lonely. It has issued a threat that they cannot seek the help of the human right workers. And it has warned the human rights workers: do your work at your own risk.\"\nThe significance of the Indian Supreme Court's verdict cannot be overstated as the precedents it sets often become references for the rest of our subcontinent. And, it comes against the backdrop of ever-increasing concerns about the politicisation of our judiciary in tandem with the weakening of democracy.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed is an independent journalist and writes from London, UK.

        "full_article": "We often come across stories of human follies that bear no rhyme or reason. The smaller ones can be dismissed as mere faux pas, but when it reaches the border of absurdity, one begins to wonder at the level of mental fitness of those concerned. One such story that came to our notice involves Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited (Bapex), which reportedly invited job-seekers for a written test for the assistant manager post nearly eight years after they had applied! Yes, you heard it right. Those job-seekers had applied in 2014/15, and a lot of water has flown under the bridge since then. Many of them are now working at different government and private organisations.\nBut nothing seems to have changed in the world of Bapex which, in a letter, thanked the applicants for applying for the above post, and informed them that they had been selected for the written test after primary evaluation. Signed by the general manager (admin) of Bapex, the letter also asked them to submit their personal details, photos and copies of the \"calling letter\" by July 14, stressing that, otherwise, it will not be possible to send them admit cards for the written test.\nNot that any of them are likely to attend the test, nor many are eligible any longer to attend it, even if they want to. One recipient of the letter is now working in a state-run bank as a senior officer. He said he had completely forgotten about his application. Another recipient said his age limit for the job had expired in 2016. How is it possible that Bapex failed to assess their eligibility before sending that letter? Those who moved from their former addresses heard about it from social media posts or old acquaintances.\nNot surprisingly, the Bapex general manager said that the delay may have happened due to \"administrative complications,\" and refused to take responsibility\u00a0for the long delay or concerns of the applicants. This is, frankly, the definition of a disaster. The whole episode is a lesson in what\u00a0not\u00a0to do as an institution, especially one as important as Bapex. The mismanagement and incompetence demonstrated by this incident are typical of government offices which are, more often than not, slowed or encumbered by the bureaucratic deadweight. And that there are hardly any functional instruments of accountability only makes the situation worse.\nWe urge the Bapex authorities to investigate this incident and hold to account those responsible for it. The government should also ensure that such botch-ups never happen again.\n",

        "full_article": "We're alarmed by the recent series of attacks on teachers that saw at least two brutalised within the space of a week. First, there was a college principal in Narail Sadar Upazila who, on June 18, was forced to wear a garland of shoes for apparently trying to protect a student who ran into trouble after a Facebook post backing a controversial leader of India's ruling party. Then, on June 25, a teacher in Ashulia was beaten to death by a student apparently incensed by his disciplinary measures. Regardless of the circumstances of these events, the fact that such cruelty could be meted out to teachers, of all people, is deeply concerning.\nThere have been some disturbing revelations since the two events came to our notice. In Narail, for example, the shoe incident reportedly occurred right before the eyes of the police. Apparently, the deputy commissioner (DC) and superintendent of police (SP) were present on the scene. There were also announcements made via a microphone of the principal's impending humiliation, yet no one came forward to save him. In Ashulia, police have yet to apprehend the accused (although they did arrest his father). Equally distressingly, police tried to pass him off as a minor \u2013 by showing his age as 16 in the FIR \u2013 apparently to make him eligible for trial in a juvenile court. But school authorities have told\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0that he is actually 19 years and six months old.\nWe fail to understand the role of the police in these incidents. Their failure to act properly and responsibly only makes the consequent experience more traumatic. Also, in Narail, it didn't help that both teacher and student had a minority religion in common, which further angered their majoritarian tormentors \u2013 a pattern of marginalisation that deserves scrutiny. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture here: the crumbling of social values as well as increasing vulnerability of teachers who want to do their job with sincerity. Add to that the suffocating environment that prevails in most public universities and colleges thanks to their politicisation. In a statement condemning the attacks, the University Teachers' Network also decried this environment, saying that teachers are often being harassed and assaulted, which is partly to blame for the poor state of education in Bangladesh.\nThis is a bad sign for a country trying to develop a knowledge-based society to face the challenges of the future. We urge the authorities to help create an environment in which teachers are properly treated, protected, rewarded, and empowered to do their nation-building work. Teachers must be given all the safety they need, especially while on campus, and those who endanger it must be dealt with.\n",

        "full_article": "Intriguing it may seem to learn that the state-owned enterprises' (SOEs) loan has hit an all time high at Tk 926.01 billion. A FE report the other day expressed fear that in the time of current inflationary pressure the loan burden of these enterprises might soar further. According to the report, SOEs' debt burden, following a 25-per cent surge in their loans backed by government guarantees, has adverse financial implications for the state coffer. The borrowings involve mainly guarantees provided for 18 large project guarantees for power generating projects, according to sources. The government issues sovereign guarantees to the SOEs to help them borrow funds to run and expand their operations, as the organisations cannot arrange loans themselves because of their poor financial state. Both local and international financiers seek such guarantees from the government to extend loans. At home, it is the state-owned banks which provide the loan. Among the international organisations which need such guarantees are financial institutions, mostly banks. In the wake of the soaring loans, the question that automatically comes to mind is-- what good the guarantees are for, if the loans thus obtained keep ballooning with no return? The fact that the SOEs are not doing well is no news to be taken aback. It has been a grim reality for decades, a burden that the successive governments have only halfheartedly attempted to address. The situation in respect of all the SOEs is more or less similar. Losing concerns as they are, it is often believed that utter neglect has been mainly instrumental in rendering them what they are now-- inefficient and wasteful. One of the ways to revamp them could be modernisation so as to make them competitive in both local and foreign markets. Makeshift efforts in the past with no effective recovery plan backed by adequate funds have done nothing but increase government's liability for decades. The other solution, perhaps the only one, according to many, under the circumstances is to gradually let the enterprises go to private hands. The process of changing hands, that is privatisation, has been in place for quite sometime, but an appraisal of privatisation clearly shows that besides being time consuming, it has been an cumbersome procedure fraught with obstacles that cannot be remedied by lackluster moves. There are cases where the sale process has been bogged down in litigation concerning assets, land valuation, title deeds and various claims by the parent ministry after acceptance of a tender offer. There are also cases of conflict of interest involving the parent ministries which would like to retain control of the SOEs. Coupled with these are political interferences, causing not only inordinate delay but frustration among the private parties willing to take over. But if the government is firm in its decision, it can make things happen. Given the state of things, is it not sensible to find a way out to part with the undesirable liability? According to observers, it is high time the government realised that spending huge amounts only to keep these entities alive, albeit in life support, makes no sense.",

        "full_article": "Development, especially in our times, is like the moon. While we see the luminous side of it, it is the dark side which remains beyond our vision. And on that dark side are laid out the many tales of sorrow and heartbreak brought on by societal progress.The Padma Bridge is an engineering feat which does us proud, for the good reason that it now makes travel across the mighty river safe, comfortable and faster. That it will soon be a spur to development on both banks of it and beyond, through the twenty-one south-western districts it connects the nation's capital to, is a given. Additionally, the fact that we as a people have built the Padma Bridge with our own resources is truly cause for pride. We have done it!But even as we reflect on the glories linked to the bridge, there are the little people whose big worries should make us think. In these few days since the inauguration of the bridge, there has been a precipitous fall in the earnings of eateries, fruit stalls and boatmen on the shores of the Padma. The bridge has made travel easier for all of us, but it has also pushed the little people --- individuals for whom livelihood has been associated with the Padma --- into despondency if not yet despair.Which arouses in us all the old stories of traditional things falling by the wayside courtesy of the steamroller of progress in modern times. The old post offices which once dotted our villages, indeed every village in every country, have died out because people do not write letters anymore, do not send money orders to ageing parents and younger siblings by the old means anymore. Technology, obviously making life easier for everyone, has come in the way, indeed has pushed out all those symbols we once considered integral to our pursuit of life and happiness.And thus it is with the men and women, thousands of them, whose lives have so far been linked, intricately and generationally at that, with the Padma River. Observe these facts, raw and undeniable, as they come to us by way of the media: at Ilias Ahmed Chowdhury Ghat in Madaripur, no fewer than 37 restaurants, 54 tea stalls and 39 fruit shops happen to be. Likewise, 11 restaurants, 29 tea stalls and seven fruit shops are located at Sattar Matbor-Mongolmajhir Ghat in Shariatpur. These establishments are now at risk of obliteration. Not many people, travelers all, can be expected to break journey across the waters by ferries and help themselves to food and drink at these traditional spots of communion and reunion.It is once more an assertion of the truth that progress comes at a price. Here is a simple instance: where once the young read books in our towns and villages, they now play around with mobile phones, which certainly are a poor substitute for what has been left behind. WhatsApp and Facebook and Twitter certainly drown us in information, but knowledge? That is an entirely different proposition altogether. In circumstances where reading is fast receding into the past and libraries are now part of memory, especially in our rural interior, it is inappropriate to enthuse about any digital revolution. If such a revolution involves staring into the mobile screen all hours of the day and indulging in texting and liking and what not, it becomes pretty clear where development has left us all --- in a place where the imagination has been replaced by a cultivation of ignorance dressed in modernity.Think back on the plight of the little people again. The neighbourhood shops which once answered our everyday needs have over time been evicted by supermarkets. The few small shops which remain are largely ignored by people, the natural propensity in whom now is to make a dash for the supermarkets in the neighbourhood or, driven by notions of elitism, make their way to superstores in the upscale regions of the city. Meanwhile, the small shopkeeper waits the livelong day for a few sales to be made before he can make his way back home.And so we reflect on the dark side of the moon. With people now excitedly taking to buses across the bridge to travel to their destinations, it is those who own the launches and the speedboats who worry about their future and the future of their employees and the families of the employees. Easier modes of communication come at a cost in human terms. The 11,000 people employed on as many as 86 launches and 250 speedboats on the banks of the Padma cannot be expected to be happy, now that there will be a depletion in their earnings because there will be a decline in the number of people requiring their services.It is a paradoxical situation, one which pushes us to the inevitability of development and yet breaks down some of the foundations of life we had thought were there for good. On the banks of the Padma are the innumerable little boys and girls doing their bit to help their families inhabiting the villages nearby. They sell items of insignificant note which nevertheless are their lifeline. There are the coolies who have for ages helped tired travellers alighting from the ferries and the boats by carrying their luggage, at a pittance. Not much of that service will be there now, for no fault of these little men struggling to make a living.It is in such circumstances that the call for social security, for a well-thought-out strategy to ensure a decent livelihood for those at the mercy of development is called for. Our GDP is rising; people abroad give us plaudits for the strides we have made in our economy; our people now have a longer lifespan than they used to; and we reasonably eat well, without worrying about our next meal. All of that being true, it now remains for the state to ensure foolproof economic security for the population, particularly those sections of it rendered vulnerable through measures ironically linked to progress. Industries to be set up in the south-western districts will open up newer avenues of national progress now that the Padma Bridge has finally caused a union of the two banks of the river to be brought about.Let the truth not be ignored, though. The little people whose lives have been lived on the banks of the Padma need reassurance about their future. The Padma has been part of our folklore. And those who have lived by it, have earned their upkeep beside its waters, are those who have always peopled this folklore. They are the little people we must not forget as we bask in the light of the moon. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "From birth to six years, children learn the most and at the highest rate that they will in their entire lives.In their infancy their waking hours are spent learning through all their senses: looking, listening, touching, smelling, and putting things in their mouth. It is in this manner that they become familiar with and make sense of their environment. They are like sponges, soaking up information and understanding the form and function of their surroundings. These early days are the ideal opportunities to provide materials and activities that engage their senses and capture their curiosity. Exploring things freely and independently, albeit safely, is what forms the basis of becoming a lifelong learner. Children develop a sense of confidence towards trying new experiences, without fear or being concerned about 'getting it right'. They persevere until they master a skill and this attitude to life opens up the world as a place of infinite wonder all worth exploring.Young children strive to be like the grown-ups around them, being able to feed, dress, wash themselves and be helpful in everyday life. Involving them in simple household chores contributes towards their building a self-image of being valued and productive members of their group. Their confidence in their ability to try things, persevere, and be helpful is key to all future learning. Given these simple experiences at home, children are ready for Preschool or an Early Years program. It is natural for children to experience anxiety as they move from a familiar home environment to an unfamiliar school environment. Early Years programs provide the steps necessary for children to make this transition smoothly. Children's anxieties about separation from parents are addressed with care and patience to develop trusting relationships at school.

        "full_article": "Millions of people are leading an inhuman life in flood-hit Sunamganj, Sylhet, Kurigram and many other areas. They are badly in need of food and pure drinking water. In this situation, one of the most important issues, however, is hardly discussed. And that is menstrual hygiene management. Post-disaster relief and recovery operations seldom focus on women's priorities regarding menstrual hygiene. Women and adolescents girls are the worst sufferers due to floods, and the problem of menstrual hygiene management amplifies their miseries. Managing period in a crowded flood relief camp without non-segregated toilets and without any sanitary napkin is extremely problematic. In such a situation, the victims cannot tell anyone that they need sanitary napkins or clean cloth to absorb their flow due to social taboos around menstrual health. Sanitary napkins are one of the most important supplies to take care of menstrual hygiene. A packet of sanitary napkins during these difficult times can be a real blessing for the menstruating girls and women. Menstrual hygiene is a silent need during disasters. Access to appropriate menstrual hygiene materials, washing and drying, and menstrual hygiene infrastructure including water, sanitation, changing areas and waste disposal options are a must in shelter centres. The authorities concerned should include packets of sanitary napkins among their relief items on a priority basis. \nSamia Jahan Shefa,[email\u00a0protected]",
