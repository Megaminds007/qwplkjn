        "full_article": "It is rare for a public-opinion survey to shake established perceptions of a country in the way a recent Pew Research Center study of religion in India has done. The revelations in Pew's comprehensive survey, based on interviews with 30,000 adults in 17 languages between late 2019 and early 2020, have astonished many.\nIn particular, this nationwide, multi-faith study finds that Indians value both religious tolerance and co-existence, on the one hand, and religious exclusivity and segregation, on the other. But this apparent contradiction is in fact not entirely surprising.\nFor over 25 years\u2014notably in my 1997 book India: From Midnight to the Millennium and Beyond\u2014I have argued that India is not a melting pot like the United States. Rather, it is a thali\u2014a collection of different dishes in separate bowls that don't necessarily flow into one another, but nonetheless combine satisfyingly on your palate. Pew's study, titled \"Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation,\" appears to confirm my hypothesis.\nFor starters, India is deeply religious: 97 percent of Indians say they believe in God and about 80 percent are certain that God exists. \"Not only do most of the world's Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs live in India, but it also is home to one of the world's largest Muslim populations and to millions of Christians and Buddhists,\" the Pew study observes. \"Indians of all these religious backgrounds overwhelmingly say they are very free to practice their faiths.\" Some 53 percent of adults say religious diversity benefits India.\nAn overwhelming majority (84 percent) of respondents say that respect for other religions is a fundamental aspect of their identity. \"Indians see religious tolerance as a central part of who they are as a nation,\" say the study's authors. \"Across the major religious groups, most people say it is very important to respect all religions to be 'truly Indian.'\" Tolerance is also a religious value: \"Indians are united in the view that respecting other religions is a very important part of what it means to be a member of their own religious community.\"\nBut for all this mutual respect, segregationist impulses remain strong. For example, 36 percent of Hindus do not want Muslims as neighbours (though that does mean 64 percent are willing to accept them). Likewise, opposition to interfaith and inter-caste marriages is widespread. About 80 percent of Indian Muslims disapprove of, and wish to prevent, interfaith marriages. Roughly two-thirds of Hindus feel the same way.\nDisappointingly, Indians also prefer making friends within their own religious community. Religious identity has a strong hold: 64 percent of Hindus say it is very important to be Hindu in order to be \"truly Indian.\" North Indian Hindus say speaking Hindi, a language fiercely resisted in the country's south and northeast, is essential, too.\nAlthough Indians have many beliefs in common\u2014there are startling overlaps among all faiths on topics such as reincarnation, karma, identification with a caste, and the purifying power of the sacred Ganges River\u2014there is a marked preference for religious segregation. Adherents of every religion want to maintain a safe distance from those of other faiths.\nWhat are the national political implications of all this, at a time when the ruling party's Hindutva dogma has put identity politics in the ascendant? Many supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has long propagated a \"Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan\" version of Indian nationalism, strongly believe that being Hindu and speaking Hindi are vital to being truly Indian.\nThat suggests a risk of discrimination against India's minorities. Yet according to the Pew survey, only one in five Indian Muslims say they have faced religious discrimination. People in the south, where the BJP struggles to win votes, emerge in the study as less religious and more inclusive and accommodative.\nAt the same time, 95 percent of India's Muslims say they are proud to be Indian and 85 percent agree with the statement that \"Indian people are not perfect, but Indian culture is superior to others.\" Those Hindutva ideologues casting doubt on the patriotism of India's Muslims should take note.\nOther religious fault lines in Indian politics also appear less troubling than previously imagined. Although Pakistan has sought for three decades to foment disaffection toward India among Sikhs in Punjab, the study finds that 95 percent of Sikhs say they are very proud to be Indian, while 70 percent say that a person who disrespects India cannot be a Sikh.\nOverall, the study reveals that India is a highly religious country that is profoundly committed to respecting its diversity while practicing what Pratap Bhanu Mehta calls a \"segregationist form of toleration.\" Given this, reviving and reaffirming the civic nationalism enshrined in India's constitution, with its commitment to empowering the individual citizen rather than privileging his or her religious group, is all the more important.\nThis is the thesis of my most recent book, The Battle of Belonging (to be published internationally in October as The Struggle for India's Soul). The Pew survey confirms some of my concerns, but also offers hope for affirming a liberal constitutionalism that the BJP's nationalism has sought to eclipse.\nThere is one more straw in the wind for those, like myself, who would like India's current religious-identity politics to yield to a focus on governmental performance and issues that affect citizens of all faiths. The Pew survey shows that unemployment, corruption, and crime are the top concerns for people of all religious groups. A government that tackles those effectively, irrespective of whether it does so in Hindi or after offering prayers at a Hindu temple, is bound to win gratitude\u2014and votes.\nShashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general and former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs and Minister of State for Human Resource Development, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2021.\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "Let us begin with three news highlights related to our vaccine procurement scenario\u2014No one can show an accurate breakdown of how many doses of vaccines have been procured by Bangladesh; astonishing anomalies lie in the price-related information of vaccines; and apparently, despite what the official narrative tells you, there is no workable vaccine procurement plan including precise timelines and quantities.\nFor the last few days, we have been constantly bombarded with announcements that within the six-day period between August 7 and 12, one crore people would be vaccinated. We were also told that there was a stockpile of one crore and 25 lakh doses, in addition to another 21 crore doses that would arrive in the country by the beginning of next year. We were assured that the trend of vaccinating one crore people per month would continue. \"There are no shortages of vaccines, nor will there be any\"\u2014this message was generously and enthusiastically spread on behalf of the government, by both those you would expect to hear it from and those you wouldn't. But then, just one day before the inauguration of this massive drive, we were told that the promised vaccination campaign period has been cut short. No, it is not going to continue for six straight days. Instead, it'll simply be a daylong affair.\nFrom this bizarre and by now perhaps a little predictable turn of events, we can understand that there are doubts and confusion regarding the timing and quantity of any subsequent consignments of vaccines. The question is, why then, despite having doubts and uncertainties, was such a massive promotion made and that too by multiple individuals?\nGiven the scenario, it appears that neither the relevant ministry nor the minister has an accurate idea of the actual inventory of vaccines. Coming against this backdrop, the threat to punish the unvaccinated by another minister and subsequent dismissive statements made to cushion its fallout\u2014that \"it was not our statement\", or \"we are withdrawing the statement\", etc.\u2014rather made a mockery of the whole situation which could be, frankly, done without at this critical time in our fight against the coronavirus.\nLet's also recall that an announcement was made about importing 21 crore vaccine doses but no other information was given. Despite questions raised about the authenticity of this statement, we were given no subsequent information or explanation. It has been claimed that among the 21 crore doses, seven would come from Russia and seven from Johnson & Johnson. We have had no information thus far\u2014from public, private or foreign sources\u2014validating the claim that Bangladesh has struck a deal to buy seven crore doses of the Russian vaccine. What we know instead is that Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK) had sent a letter to the foreign minister along with supporting documents and informed him that Gonoshasthaya Nagar Hospital had been nominated as the official agent of Russia's Sputnik-V vaccine in Bangladesh. They reportedly gave a proposal to the government for the procurement of two crore vaccines. The government did not respond to that proposal. The government did not make a deal on its own either. In that case, how will these seven crore doses of Russian vaccine arrive? And when will they, if at all?\u00a0\u00a0\nNow the question is about the seven crore doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. There is a big question mark on Johnson & Johnson's capability to export such a large quantity of vaccines. Bangladesh did not even sign a contract with them. That means, all this talk of the Johnson & Johnson's seven crore vaccines is probably just a charade. A source tells us that Bangladesh will get seven crore doses of Johnson & Johnson as part of the COVAX initiative. Even if this information is accurate, it cannot be claimed with certainty that we will get the vaccines. Production of vaccines by Johnson & Johnson, their storage at COVAX and then the chance of getting it\u2014the whole thing is based on possibilities. Even if we end up getting our hands on the doses, those are likely to arrive in consignments of lakhs, not crores.\nAmong the 21 crore doses, it has also been mentioned that three crores will come from India. India, as we all know, is itself in a bind in terms of vaccinating its own populace. It is highly unlikely that it will lift the export ban on vaccines this year.\nAll this simply means that the possibility of getting 17 out of the 21 crore vaccine doses is completely uncertain. Bangladesh might get some vaccines from COVAX and China, but that will not be sufficient enough to keep a massive countrywide vaccination drive running.\nNow let us come to the issue of pricing.\nA glaring calculation error was identified in the health ministry's claim of procuring one lakh and 50 thousand doses of vaccines at a price of Tk 3,045 crore. The claim was made through a newspaper advertisement some time ago. On that advertisement, approximately 11 lakh free doses of vaccine received from COVAX were also included in the price calculation of paid vaccines. According to that flawed calculation, the price of each dose was shown as Tk 3,000 (or USD 35-36). However, the government procured seven million doses of vaccine from India's Serum Institute at a cost of USD 5 per dose, including carrying costs. Also, it bought vaccines from China at a price of USD 10 per dose, with carrying costs to be added to it. Thus, it's evident that the health ministry in its ad inflated the prices of each dose by at least USD 25 to 30. Till date, the health ministry has offered no explanation for this anomaly.\nNow, Bangladesh government is vaccinating people from the age group of 25 and above. The possibility of further lowering the age bar to 18 has been discussed but is yet to be put into effect. In our country, the number of people above the age of 18 is almost 14 crores, and all of them need to be vaccinated. Given the two-dose requirement for each individual, we need at least 28 crore doses of vaccine. Till now, one crore and 40 lakh people have received a single dose, while 40 lakh people received both doses. Still, another 13 crore people need to be included in the vaccination drive. Even if we manage to deliver one crore doses per month, 26 months will be required to cover the entire target population. This, too, depends on an uninterrupted supply of vaccines. At this point, we neither have the required stockpile nor can we hope to have the needed amount in the near future.\u00a0\nWhat, then, are the next steps for Bangladesh?\nWe need to urgently learn how to add and subtract properly, and we also need to eliminate all anomalies within the calculations in order to establish transparency. The most important factor is to increase the national capacity. We have to take effective steps for collecting the required amount of vaccines\u2014mere words will not suffice. Even if we manage to do that, we still cannot save everything. The only path to our survival and recovery is through producing vaccines locally. It doesn't matter whether the formula comes from China, Russia or any other country. Going ahead, Bangladesh has no other choice but to produce its own vaccines.\nGolam Mortoza is a journalist at The Daily Star. The article was translated from Bangla by Mohammed Ishtiaque Khan.\n",

        "full_article": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of the independence of Bangladesh and 100 years since the establishment of Dhaka University. On this occasion, it is important to highlight the stories of our achievements, successes and progress as a nation. One such success story is the sequencing of the jute genome, which was published in 2017. This is a landmark achievement in Bangladesh's science history, and probably the most significant scientific breakthrough for the country since its independence in 1971.\nThis major achievement was possible thanks to the support of the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who needs to be applauded for seizing the opportunity in a timely manner. The fruits of this great achievement are already being seen, including the granting of an international patent and triggering of further research exploiting the jute plant. It stands as an example of how government support can accelerate scientific progress by bringing together the best scientific minds to work synergistically and tackle complex scientific challenges. A notable aspect of the jute genome project was recruiting and harnessing the talent and skills of an exceptionally brilliant non-resident Bangladeshi scientist, Maqsudul Alam (who, sadly, passed away in December 2014) from the University of Hawaii in the USA. He effectively worked with researchers from several Bangladeshi organisations including Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Dhaka University, and DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Limited.\nTo understand how this success came into being, one has to delve into the history of genetics research in Bangladesh and those who played key roles in different spheres of activities that eventually led to the establishment of the field of biotechnology in Bangladesh, and thereafter the decoding of the jute genome. In this context, the name of Prof Ahmad Shamsul Islam is prominent for several reasons, although many others have contributed in different ways.\nProf Islam was born on August 6, 1924. As we celebrate his 97th birthday, it is an opportune moment to highlight some of his roles in the development of biotechnology in Bangladesh. He studied Botany and gained BSc (1945) and MSc (1947) degrees from Presidency College, Kolkata. The training received by Islam at Dhaka University and subsequently in the UK, the USA and Japan played an important role in his development as a pioneering scientist.\nWhile working at Dhaka University, he published one of his first scientific articles in 1949, on the cytogenetics of some common fruit trees. He was extremely fortunate to have Prof Panchanan Maheswari\u2014one of the most eminent Indian scientists, famous for his invention of test-tube fertilisation of angiosperms\u2014as his guide and mentor. Prof Maheswari was the head of Biology Department at Dhaka University. In one of his articles, Prof Islam acknowledged Maheswari's contributions in the following manner: \"I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Prof. P. Maheshwari who supplied most of the slides and under whose guidance I carried out the present investigation\". Maheswari returned to India in 1949 which was a great loss for Dhaka University. He passed away in 1966.\nProf Ahmad Shamsul Islam went to the UK and obtained a PhD degree from the University of Manchester in 1954. There, he received the Currie Memorial Prize for his outstanding contribution to the cytogenetics of strawberry. His PhD supervisor was a renowned scientist, Prof Sydney Cross Harland FRS, who was a pioneer in the genomic analysis of the cotton plant. During his PhD, he was also guided by another scientist, Dr Philip Frank Wareing, an expert in tree physiology, who later co-discovered abscisic acid.\nOne can cite several important papers of Prof Islam to justify his pioneering role in the foundation of biotechnology in Bangladesh, including the early work on jute genomics and breeding. In a paper published in 1960 in the Nature journal, he and his colleague were the first in the world to successfully produce a hybrid between two jute-yielding species, which continues to make impact in current research. Between 1952 and 1964, he produced three more papers in Nature on cytogenetics and embryo culture by use of plant hormones.\nIn 1971, after the independence of Bangladesh, Prof Islam became the head of the Department of Botany. This was an opportunity for him to demonstrate his leadership skills and create an ideal research environment for the use of latest techniques in the field of biotechnology with a view to improving Bangladeshi crops, including jute. It is, therefore, not surprising that in 1984, he and his colleagues published the first paper from Bangladesh on plant tissue culture focusing on sugarcane. Subsequently, he published a paper with Prof Zeba Seraj and others on tissue culture and micro propagation of jute. This set the scene for wider use of this technique in Bangladesh and was important for proliferation of biotechnology in different institutions across the country. He not only arranged funds for establishing a tissue culture laboratory but also for numerous international conferences and workshops with experts to train scientists in tissue culture techniques at the Botany Department.\nMany scientists from agricultural institutes from all over Bangladesh attended these and in turn started tissue culture activities themselves. Through his plant tissue culture research, Prof Islam was recognised as a pioneer in biotechnology research in Bangladesh. For example, Prof Naiyyum Choudhury, who was responsible for producing the National Biotechnology Policy of Bangladesh, noted that \"the programme on plant biotechnology in Bangladesh was initiated in late 1970s in the Department of Botany, Dhaka University with tissue culture of jute.\" Furthermore, the history section in the website of the Botany Department of DU notes the following: \"Dr. Ahmad Shamsul Islam initiated Plant Tissue Culture and Biotechnological research in Bangladesh.\"\nHe retired from DU in 1990 but his ceaseless passion for science and education continued and he remained active in research. In 2005, while working at the University of Texas, Austin, Professor Islam published a paper reporting preliminary work on the jute genome analysis, and this provided the momentum that ultimately led to the sequencing of the full genome. He has been active in research for over 55 years, publishing over 100 scientific articles and two text books on genetics, one of which is in Bangla. Many students completed their PhD degrees under his supervision. He was also active as the founding editor of several journals, including Bangladesh Journal of Botany and Journal of Plant Tissue Culture and Biotechnology, the latter now in its 31st year of publication.\nHis leadership skills and visionary thinking led him to work with others to establish the Global Network of Bangladeshi Biotechnologists (GNOBB) in 2004. The author of this article was invited by Prof Islam to join GNOBB as one of the founding members along with Dr Abidur Rahman (Japan), Prof Hemayet Ullah (USA), Prof Zeba Islam Seraj, Prof Haseena Khan, Prof Ahmad Abdullah Azad (Australia) and Prof Enamul Huq (USA). Prof Islam's leadership was pivotal in bringing together Maqsudul Alam from the USA and Bangladeshi jute genetics researchers like Prof Haseena Khan and others to fully unravel the jute genome. Although Prof Islam was not listed as an author in the Nature Plants paper published in 2017, the acknowledgement section rightly dedicated the paper to his memory. This work completed his dream of seeing what he initiated finally accomplished. There is no doubt that he is not only an exceptionally brilliant scientist but also a great scientific leader, enabler and above all a great human being. I wish him a long, happy and healthy life.\nParvez Haris is a Professor of Biomedical Science at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.\n",

        "full_article": "We are all glued to the mega-spectacle involving the flickering of the dropped or lost tails of some lizards who have tactically dissociated from a disposable part of their bodies to protect themselves from their attackers. These dancing tails have seductive names to live up to their alleged reputation of being honeytraps. They are presented as creatures of a dark fantasyland that exists on the fringe of our concrete jungles. They are presented as nymphs who lure men into their lairs, entertain them with narcotic and carnal substances, and retain memorabilia for future profiteering.\nBreathless media coverage of the dancing lizard-tails drowns out stories that affect us more. The spike in coronavirus-related deaths, after some super-spreader events when the lockdown was relaxed during the Eid-ul-Adha festival, is a case in point. The frozen education sector with all its uncertainties serves as another example. The irregularity and irresponsibility of government officials and contractors that led to the crumbling down of the noble gesture of the prime minister's housing project in Mujib Year can be listed as another big issue. The misfortune of the fortune-hunters from the country who try to cross the Mediterranean\u2014hitting the headlines on a regular interval\u2014can be deemed as yet another big news. Workers walking miles to return to their workplace amid Covid-19 movement restrictions; the highway roads that look like snapshots of Mars sent by some spacecraft; the waterlogging in the city that momentarily brings riverbanks to the comfort of our households; the pesky mosquitoes that simply refuse to go away; the brewing tension among the nationalist Rohingyas; the back-to-back win over the Kangaroos on home soil; the leap-year grand gala of sports in the Land of the Rising Sun\u2014all deserve to be treated as big news.\nInstead, the dancing tails are getting into our excited heads.\nWhen scores of armed men carried out an all-out raid in the greenery (Banani) to capture one such unarmed nymph, the tail started dancing according to the playbook of a cornered victim: go \"live\", grab attention even if it requires half-revealing yourself to titillate your audience, and cry \"dacoits\". Only months back, we were learning about the secret lives of religious leaders and now we are given access to the other quarters. It is no secret that there is no secret. In Greek mythology, Zeus had to visit his favourites in dreams to counsel them, teach them tricks. His agents would hide behind a wooden horse to undo the Helens of society; today, he can flash his winged horse, Pegasus, and strike out anyone at lightning speed. The moment someone has fallen out of favour, there are ample stored images and sound bites to discredit her or him.\nThe newly revealed facts remind me of one of my favourite fiction works of all time: Mirza Muhammad Hadi Ruswa's 1904 novel Umrao Jan Ada, depicting the gracious ambiance of old Lucknow and its wealthy nawabs, the hideouts of colourful drifters, and the lavish quarters of the city's courtesans. Umrao Jan displays strange sophistication in dealing with the nawab who refuses to marry her or the dacoit who offers stolen jewellery to buy her love. The tails then can have many hidden tales that can be our fascinating guide to unchartered territories. The nymphs of the leafy part of the town recount a contemporary version.\nBut there is something Machiavellian in the way the narrative is being presented as a media spectacle. Machiavelli advised his modern prince to maintain the rituals of governance and power through the productive use of cultivated spectacles. The gladiators fighting for their lives in an area to unleash the violent desire of the mob and making them a party to the power struggle is an example of spectacle. One can argue that the demand for such violence necessitated the supply of the bloodthirsty event in the first place. The reverse can also be true. The supply of violence created the demand. Whatever the case is, the production, construction, circulation and function of media spectacles hint at some deep-rooted social values. Once we consider the recent media sensationalism as a reaction to a similar action in which a male figure was exposed with bottles of liquors, we will probably be able to assume that the spectacle has an anti-women agenda. Instead of exposing one fairy, can we publish the list of visitors to the fairyland?\nWhat is actually her crime: an expired liquor license, hoarding mind-altering substances, arranging house parties, entertaining guests? According to one responsible police officer, there are many such \"night queens\". If employing full force to eradicate the night queens is the top priority of law-enforcing agents at a time of national emergency when the whole world is suffering from a pandemic, then, \"Houston, we have a problem!\" If we really consider these night queens symptomatic of a social disease, then it would be wise to run a full diagnostic test of the social body to address the disease that has caused the fever. The tail of the lizard is more important than these abandoned dancing parts. I am sure by now the lizards have changed their colours, and finding them will be no mean task. They have either left their territories or are hiding in plain sight, camouflaging themselves in their given surrounding. Who knows, some of these lizards may have already been eaten up by bigger predators.\nAs the audience of the media spectacle, we need to be aware of the information and entertainment (i.e. infotainment) that is being provided in this technologically dazzling, multimedia culture. Our thoughts and actions are influenced by seductive media spectacles. We scandalise the nymphs to strengthen the patriarchy that would like to avenge the humiliation it suffered recently. In the process, the general public becomes nothing but the grass under the feet of two fighting rhinos mentioned in an African proverb.\nI shall end with the observations of the French theorist Guy Debord who in the 1960s talked about the Society of the Spectacle. He wrote, \"When the real world changes into simple images, the simple images become real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behaviour. The spectacle, as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various specialised mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision to be the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for other epochs.\" (Section 18).\nWe are fast losing control over what could once be touched and grasped. We have become mere witnesses deriving voyeuristic pleasures out of seeing things, with no sensation of human touch. We can't pin down why the lizard actually dropped its tail. It's important to ask: what caused the lizard to lose its tail, instead of being entertained by its dance?\nShamsad Mortuza is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), and a professor of English at Dhaka University (on leave).\n",

        "full_article": "We are disappointed, but not at all surprised, to find that the government's ambitious six-day vaccination programme, which aimed to inoculate around one crore people in six days from August 7, has had to be revised even before it could take off. From its onset, we have seen the vaccination drive plagued with uncertainty, with it grinding to a halt in April due to a shortage of vaccines. At the time, the government was criticised for not planning for this eventuality. Although the arrival of more vaccines restarted the programme in July, the last-minute retreat from a massive vaccination campaign has again raised questions about the government's lack of coordination and planning when it comes to Covid-19 inoculations.\nWhat is the reason behind this change of plans? According to a Straight from Star Newsroom report, the government was expecting to receive more vaccines from China and COVAX at the beginning of this month, which have been delayed. However, since such delays have already happened before, we are confused why the government did not keep this in mind while planning the drive. Given that over half of the people who have received the first jab are yet to receive the second dose, some simple calculations would have yielded the fact that aiming to distribute almost all of the vaccines currently at hand to new candidates at the ward and union levels might be impractical, especially since the government had said it would prioritise vaccinating other groups as well.\nThe main special vaccination campaign is now set to begin on August 14, whereas today the government will be conducting a trial run aimed at vaccinating the elderly and people in rural areas. Given that we have seen the recent wave of coronavirus hit the rural areas of Bangladesh, with the highest mortality rate being among populations over the age of 50, it is a good decision to focus on the elderly in rural areas in today's vaccination run. However, we must also remind the authorities involved that there has to be a long-term strategic plan involved in achieving its inoculation target.\nSo far, the government seems to have made many open-ended promises about inoculating almost all of the adult population, without outlining any concrete plans on how it will be done. At different points, the authorities have said they will prioritise different groups (the elderly, disabled, migrant workers, families of frontline workers, students, etc)\u2014but with limited supply, how exactly will this work? Will this be done in phases? Will Covid-19 hotspots be specifically targeted?\nThe health minister has said the government will use this trial run to identify the problems of vaccine rollout and fix those accordingly before the main drive, and that there will be a special focus on raising awareness in rural areas. We sincerely hope that this will be the case, and that today's vaccination drive will operate smoothly and efficiently. We urge the authorities to ensure that the August 14 programme goes forward as promised. Otherwise, this constant back and forth and confusion over its plans, not just in terms of the vaccination drive but with regard to lockdowns and other Covid-related decisions as well, could place the government in a credibility crisis.\n",

        "full_article": "One of our worst fears of current times is too close to realisation for comfort, as the cases of dengue infections keep rising. The last major dengue upsurge was in 2019\u2014when 101,354 people had contracted the virus and at least 179 had died\u2014and the situation this year appears to be even more frightening given the accompanying Covid-19 pandemic and how it has all but crippled our healthcare system.\nIn case of the dengue surge, the numbers from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) speak for themselves. For instance, in May, there were only 43 hospitalised dengue patients. The number shot to 272 in June, and to an alarming 2,286 in July. Besides, it has also been observed that most of the patients are in Dhaka. Of the 218 people hospitalised with dengue in the 24 hours till Thursday morning, only 10 were from outside Dhaka.\u00a0\nWhat's worse is that the particular variant of dengue which has been prevalent this year is Serotype-3. According to experts, this variant is one of the more dangerous ones and increases mortality risks in infected patients. Since the dengue surge began last month, we have tried to highlight the severity of this situation given that it is deteriorating at a time when the deadly Delta variant of the coronavirus is also sweeping across the country. If a patient becomes infected with both viruses, not only will it increase their chances of mortality, but their recovery will also be challenging as the treatment for one may interfere with that for the other.\nIn order to combat the dengue virus, there are no better alternatives to early detection and hospitalisation. Apart from the city corporations' spraying of larvicides/insecticides, citizens should also make sure to not store water (clean or stagnant) anywhere for more than a few days at a time, so that Aedes larvae do not get the chance to breed.\nWe commend the DNCC's initiative of arranging free dengue testing facilities at 46 centres across its territory. However, we would also like to stress the importance of making similar arrangements elsewhere in the country, especially in all other parts of Dhaka where the concentration of this virus seems to be the most widespread. Testing facilities alone are also not enough to combat the dengue virus. Given the ever-worsening Covid-19 situation, authorities' top priority right now should be to bulk up healthcare resources\u2014and to assist our already overburdened doctors and healthcare staff\u2014in any way possible. We would urge the government to handle the dengue epidemic more seriously than it has done so far, because the challenge is huge and the consequence could be catastrophic if not handled with the urgency it demands.\n",
