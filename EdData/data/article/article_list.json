Israel has claimed the strike on Beirut that killed Shukr, but has neither confirmed nor denied its role in the assassination of Haniyeh, a standard approach about its operations inside Iran. Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon has remained tense ever since the Gaza war broke out last year with Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces exchanging fire. After Shukr was killed, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Israel had breached a red line, and the group has launched dozens of rockets over the past week, heightening the tensions. A bigger risk is the expected Iranian retaliation against Israel. When Israel bombed Iran\u2019s embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, Iran launched hundreds of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles towards Israel, most of which were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition. If Iran carried out such an attack in response to an Israeli strike on its embassy in a third country, it is unlikely to ignore a direct Israeli attack on its capital that killed an ally who was in Tehran to attend the presidential inauguration.To be sure, by killing Haniyeh in Tehran, Israel has demonstrated its capabilities to pull off sophisticated operations even in hostile territories and exposed Iran\u2019s security and intelligence vulnerabilities. Israel has also sent a strong message to Hamas, which carried out the October 7, 2023 attack, that none of its leaders is safe. Yet, this unchecked militarism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could turn out to be counterproductive for Israel in the long run. It is now apparent that Mr. Netanyahu is not serious about peace. The killing of Haniyeh has come at a time when both Israel and Hamas were making progress in talks for a hostage-ceasefire deal. Haniyeh, who was living in exile in Doha, was a relatively moderate voice within Hamas who pushed for a ceasefire. By taking him out, Mr. Netanyahu is telling the world that he wants the war to continue. And, by carrying out the attack in Tehran, which is a flagrant violation of Iran\u2019s sovereignty, Mr. Netanyahu is practically challenging the Islamic Republic to retaliate. If a direct war breaks out between Israel and Iran, the U.S. could be dragged into it, which is what Israel wants. The Biden administration avoided such a disastrous outcome in April by reining in Israel after Iran\u2019s retaliation. But that did not stop Israel from launching another provocative attack against Iran, taking the region back to the brink again. As West Asia braces for Iran\u2019s retaliation, the U.S. and its allies should work together to make sure that the impact of its response on Israel would be minimal, and then put in place new rules of the game for Israel so that it does not threaten regional security again as it did on April 1 or July 30.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\nIran\n\n/\n\nmurder\n\n/\n\nwar\n\n/\n\nLebanon\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nmissile systems\n\n/\n\nQatar\n\n/\n\nUSA",

        "full_article": "Ever since Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore won the silver medal in the men\u2019s double trap shooting at the Athens Olympics in 2004, Indian shooters have always dealt with the pressure of expectations. The stress quadrupled when Abhinav Bindra won the gold in the 10m air rifle category in the 2008 Beijing Games. This success was replicated in the 2012 London Games with Gagan Narang winning the bronze in the 10m air rifle shooting while Vijay Kumar did one better, seizing the silver in the 25m rapid fire pistol competition. And then followed the inexplicable drought in shooting during the subsequent editions at Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Cut to the latest Paris Games, where all doubts pertaining to whether the shooters would hit bullseye were emphatically laid to rest as 22-year-old Manu Bhaker became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting. It was also Manu\u2019s turn to exorcise the ghosts of the past as in the previous Tokyo Games she faltered as an equipment malfunction affected her performance. First up, Manu claimed the bronze in the 10m air pistol. Later she combined with Sarabjot Singh to win another bronze in the mixed 10m air pistol segment. A hat-trick though proved elusive as she finished fourth in the 25m pistol final.Manu\u2019s success is a testimony to the rapid strides that Indian shooting has made besides being a tribute to an efficient system that the sporting fraternity has established. Manu is following the path that predecessors Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur, presently a head coach too, had carved. Those were days when funds were meagre and, at times, awkward questions were asked about carrying firearms at airports as the knowledge of shooting as a sport was low. Anjali and Suma did not win an Olympics medal but they inspired their juniors to follow the sport with passion. Manu linking up with her former coach Jaspal Rana, an ace shooter himself, helped add a new dimension. Shooting demands still hands, a sharp eye and a zen mind, and finally Manu revealed that she was in the zone while aiming at the target. Her traits were evident in Swapnil Kusale too as he won bronze in the men\u2019s 50m rifle three positions event. Equally, Arjun Babuta\u2019s fourth-place finish in the men\u2019s 10m air rifle final was a pointer to shooting\u2019s razor thin margins that split ecstasy and agony. There was more grief too in archery, as India continued to fail at the Olympics with Deepika Kumari and company often stumbling at the business end.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nParis Olympics 2024\n\n/\n\nshooting\n\n/\n\nOlympics\n\n/\n\nTokyo Olympics\n\n/\n\nRio Olympics 2016\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "Hasina sowed the seeds of her downfall. But her exit is a huge problem for India\nOnce a thriving South Asian economy, Bangladesh today looked like a South Asian tragedy. Sheikh Hasina fled the country, protesters stormed her official residence, the army, via an interim govt, took over, and economic problems, worsening for a while, will most likely get worse in the short term. A Bangladesh in turmoil will also likely force a reset in New Delhi-Dhaka ties, and that raises multiple strategic and security questions for the region.\u00a0\nA lost opportunity | Hasina\u2019s decade-and-a-half stint in govt had many positives. Her notable achievements included major constitutional reforms that reintroduced secularism as a fundamental tenet of Bangladeshi polity. Trials for war criminals of Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 Liberation War \u2013 a hugely popular demand as manifested in the 2013 Shahbagh protests \u2013 were undertaken. And Bangladesh saw impressive economic growth that put it on the path to graduating from the Least-Developed Countries group to a developing nation by 2026. Were Bangladesh to continue on this track, it would have emerged as a genuine South Asian star.\u00a0\nIndia\u2019s great friend | Ties between New Delhi and Hasina\u2019s Dhaka reached unprecedented levels. Hasina ensured no anti-India group was able to operate from Bangladeshi soil. Connectivity and trade flourished. Transit and trans-shipment, especially to India\u2019s Northeast, became a reality. Bilateral maritime and land boundary issues were resolved.\u00a0\nThe fall | But where Hasina tripped up was in her handling of domestic politics. She decimated the opposition space, even had a bizarre experiment where the designated opposition party was in govt, and ruthlessly went after her govt\u2019s critics. The draconian Digital Security Act, 2018 was used to muzzle free speech across social and mass media. This lack of an official opposition created a political vacuum that eventually attracted street protests. Add to this recent economic woes engendered by Covid and the Ukraine war, which created a serious cost-of-living and unemployment crisis, manifesting in the anti-jobs-quota protests last month. Multiple factors created a perfect storm.\u00a0\nFuture uncertain | Bangladesh has a mixed record with interim/caretaker govts. The one between 2007-2008 unsuccessfully tried a minus-two formula to eliminate Hasina and her rival Khaleda Zia from politics. Plus, last week Hasina had branded Jamaat-e-Islami as a terror organisation. But Jamaat was part of the all-party discussions with the army chief. And India\u2019s experience with the last BNP-Jamaat govt wasn\u2019t pleasant. Then there\u2019s the issue of protection of Bangladesh\u2019s Hindu minority and security along the Indo-Bangla border. China, Pakistan will be sniffing opportunities. New Delhi faces a huge diplomatic challenge.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Indra Nooyi is our Simone Biles. We are also busy cracking UPSC, crossing waterlogged roads\nHaving lived through many Olympics, I am sick and tired of that old chestnut: Why do we do so poorly in the Olympic Games?\u00a0\nI have heard it all: Indian politicians and administrators see the Olympics as a free foreign trip; no one cares about athletes; why would anyone care about athletes if they do not win anything?; we do not spend enough on Olympic sports; we do spend enough now, so why can\u2019t our athletes perform on the biggest stage? And that chestnut of all chestnuts: Why can\u2019t we be like China?\u00a0\nSo now, I ask myself a more fundamental question: Why bother with the Olympics at all?\u00a0\nLet\u2019s be honest. It is not for us. If we were an autocratic fascist state, we could, like China, have a regimented system sponsored by govt, in the way East European countries and USSR once had, to institutionalise the production of champions. If we were a historically rich country like US and England, we would pursue sports for the fun of it, knowing that there was a livelihood to be made, if the sports thing didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0\nBut we are in India, and we roll different. Unlike China, we do have \u2018too much democracy\u2019, and what that implies is we have the agency to make a choice, and we have made a choice: To excel in C, Java, and Python. Decathlon is for noobs; we go full-stack, baby, front, and back-end. Forget gold every four years; our kids make gold every day through base, bonus, and LTI. Sundar Pichai is our Carl Lewis, and Indra Nooyi is our Simone Biles. Long-shot odds that require physical and emotional endurance? How about IIT-JEE, NEET, and UPSC? We run and swim and balance, but on roads, in waterlogged cities, and in public transportation, all in the pursuit of what we, as individuals, prioritise.\u00a0\nAnd when we want to chest-thump and wave our flag at a sporting event, we can always turn to cricket, a game we virtually own, regardless of whether we win or lose. So, yes, the Olympics are fun, and a medal or two, here and there, is worth celebration, like finding a few currency notes in an old jacket, but let\u2019s not lose sight of the larger picture. This is not our thing.\n\u00a0\n\n",

But whether it will improve MCD\u2019s functioning is anyone\u2019s guess. It took SC more than a year to rule on this crucial matter. The municipal corporation has been functioning without its all-important standing committee. Even after yesterday\u2019s judgment, it is quite possible there won\u2019t be much forward movement on vital projects stuck all these months. Interestingly, when it reserved its judgment in the case in May last year, SC had spoken of MCD being destabilised if LG was granted power to appoint aldermen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitical slugfest | The real issue for citizens of the national capital is that there\u2019s no end to BJP-AAP slugfest, and therefore to the fight between Centre-appointed LG and Delhi govt. Kejriwal is in jail, and may be there for a while, his ministers blame LG and Delhi govt bureaucrats, who are now answerable to Centre. LG blames ministers. The big casualty is decision-making. Even by the low standards of govt effectiveness in India, the way Delhi, India\u2019s most populous city, is being governed is extraordinary.\u00a0\nNo hope? | SC ordered in May last year that \u201cservices\u201d fall under the ambit of Delhi govt, only for GOI to pass a law overturning it. SC hasn\u2019t ruled on the appeal against that law. Will elections early next year solve the problem? If AAP returns, the same mess will continue. If BJP wrests Delhi back, will its govt get more space to govern? If that happens, there will be sharp questions and another round of political and legal fight about what happened when AAP was in office. Delhi\u2019s misfortune looks set to continue.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "People in Bangladesh went to sleep on Sunday night, August 4, shaken by the horror of the death of around 100 people throughout the day. The days leading up to it were no less horrific. What started as an anti-discrimination movement became a nine-point movement for government accountability and eventually morphed into a one-point demand for the government's resignation. The death of hundreds in the span of just under three weeks over these reasonable demands had kept the nation suspended in dread.\nThe morning of August 5 was no different. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement had called for a \"Long March to Dhaka\" the day before. As people were expected to pour into Dhaka from across the country, first the prospect, and then the news of more needless deaths consolidated the dread we had carried over from the month of July into August.\nBut then the tide turned.\nThe first sign of the shifting winds came with the Chief of Army Staff's announcement to make a rare address to the nation at 2:00pm. In different parts of Dhaka, news of clashes between protesters and law enforcement turned into news of law enforcement standing aside as people flooded the streets.\nWe dared to join the tide as well. From inside Bashundhara R/A, where people famously keep to themselves, processions of 20, 40, or even more came out of each block. The chants of\u00a0Palaise re palaise, Hasina palaise\u00a0(Fled, fled! Hasina has fled!) rang out through the usually quaint streets, all the way to the raucous intersection in front of Jamuna Future Park at Nadda. Groups gathered in circles, dancing, clapping, and chanting. Their faces betrayed unbound happiness, relief, and the outpouring of anger and dissent that had been repressed for years. To us, it seemed that many were at a loss as to what they wanted to say. Most of them could only muster one immensely strong word: \"Bhua.\"\nThe expressions of happiness, although simple, felt raw. People randomly handed out food and water for free, to our surprise\u2014surprise because we don't remember in our collective memory what these little acts of kindness and camaraderie in this country looked like. Rickshaw-pullers and CNG auto-rickshaw drivers joined in the celebrations. The first rickshaw-puller we asked to take us towards Dhaka South apologetically refused, saying he wanted to go the opposite direction and celebrate with the crowd, understandably so. The rest of the way, no rickshaw-puller or CNG auto-rickshaw driver refused to go the mile towards any direction, nor did they try to negotiate the fare. One of them said, \"Joto khushi den bhara\" (Pay however much you want to).\nIn Gulshan, we saw people chant slogans from inside their Land Rovers. On foot, people were louder. On the streets, there were children dressed in red in the arms of their parents, there were elderly citizens with energy beyond their years, and there were groups of young people whose beaming faces reflected their sense of achievement. We could see it on their faces\u2014the unfettered show of joy and the proud show of freedom in their gait. The collective sigh in the air was almost audible.\nIt was not all rosy. As expected, a deluge of people angry at law enforcement after weeks of face offs, when left to their devices on the streets, lashed out at any symbol of perceived government power. Police boxes, political offices of the Awami League, and a number of unidentifiable streetside structures were set on fire in Tejgaon Industrial Area. Smoke hung thick in the air and it was hard to breathe, and while people everywhere were armed with sticks and pieces of wood, in some areas, the weapons were of a more sinister nature. In Karwan Bazar, buses in front of government offices lay burnt and broken. On Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, which served as the main artery for people moving from Shahbagh towards Ganabhaban, the crowd hurled brickbats towards the building that houses the office of ATN News, disregarding the safety of parts of the same crowd who were walking on the road right under it.\nBy 4:30pm, some were using the same road to return after having played their part in the breach of the Ganabhaban and the Prime Minister's Office in Bijoy Sarani. People displayed their loot, which included everything from expensive looking china to useless looking sofa cushions. The expressions on their faces, that would have otherwise looked brave, seemed unnerving. In the same procession where a police car was being flattened by a score of angry citizens, a hundred yards behind, a boy plucked a yellow flower from a roadside garden inside a building for the girl who was with him, making vivid the fact that it is a day for the chaotic expression of emotions\u2014both good and bad.\nBangladesh has gone through a day of historical proportions, and the people on the streets seem to know this. While the struggles, sacrifices, and sentiments that led to this moment make us hopeful that history will look favourably upon August 5, 2024, the people of Bangladesh need to learn how to pull together and build the country back up for that to happen.\nAzmin Azran\u00a0and\u00a0Syeda Maisha Ali\u00a0are journalists at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Beginning with Abu Sayed, a great amount of sacrifice was made to reach this point. Our students and children were martyred, while many more were injured after being attacked by tear gas and rubber bullets. Many were arrested, some of whom were minors. Though this is a kind of victory, we are still mourning the lives lost. Even today, we lost people. We will always remember and respect the people in the protests of bloody July.\nOccasions such as this has repeatedly arisen in Bangladesh's history, whether 1971 or 1990. In truth, we missed the opportunity each time. The expectations people had from different political parties in the past were dashed many times, and our politicians have only acted in their own interests without keeping in mind the best interests of the people.\nThe most significant factor of this protest has been that this has not been carried out under the banner of a specific political party; its success lies in the participation of all people. Those who failed to understand history, and weaponised the spirit of the Liberation War to create an environment of corruption and suffering\u2014we have been able to bid them farewell. If we consider the atrocities over the past 15 years, we want justice for all of these actions. Those who used anything and everything, from shotguns to assault rifles and sniper rifles, to take lives during the movement in July, must be brought to book, as per national and international laws. In addition, people's sufferings must be addressed, particularly the increase of the prices of essentials and the burden of taxes being placed on the people.\nIn the past, we have faced disappointment; we don't want to return to a state where politicians work for their own benefit. We want to build a better nation in the memory of the martyrs of 1971, the martyrs of July and August 2024. We want an inclusive governance system where all people are recognised as equal citizens of Bangladesh, regardless of their gender, religion or any other factor. We want to see this initiative from the state and we want it to be institutionalised. Let Bangladesh begin anew, and let this new Bangladesh reflect the dreams of all those who lost their lives.\nMuch work remains to be done, however. We must determine a list of all those who passed away, provide treatment to the injured, and ensure safer means of livelihood for families that are in great distress due to this situation. These matters must be resolved at the earliest.\nTo reiterate, the success we have attained now cannot be attributed to any party, it belongs to the students, particularly the six coordinators along with various others who organised this at great risks to their lives.\nWe know that military rule never bodes well for any nation. Hence, the creation of an inclusive government is vital. This national solidarity that has arisen must be utilised to create a healthy and peaceful Bangladesh\u2014different from what we have seen in the last 53 years. We must remain united and integrated, and we cannot let the collective spirit and unity that has emerged from this movement dissipate in any manner. We cannot fall into the trap of a cult of personality again. We are all the same, we are all equal and we are all Bangladeshi people, regardless of how we identify or what class or segment of the population we belong to. The nation must be able to retain this collective identity.\nDr Mohammad Tanzimuddin Khan\u00a0is professor at the Department of International Relations in Dhaka University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

Violence, one may recall, first broke out in mid-July when the student wing of the ruling party attacked student protesters of the quota reform movement. Then we saw law enforcers being used to suppress their protests. Even though such incidents declined after massive casualties, and the government indicated its willingness to pursue a path of dialogue more recently, Sunday's events suggest that the latter can just as easily turn back to the path of force. In addition to the killing of ordinary people, the killing of police personnel and attacks on ruling party members' houses indicate that the violence is taking on a different colour now. This may escalate into a civic conflict with very ominous consequences.\nWe believe the prime minister's invitation for dialogue, regardless of the crisis of faith facing her government, was the wiser path to try and resolve the crisis. But Sunday's events represent a complete U-turn from that and towards the use of force from both sides. But embracing violence, no matter the cost. cannot be an acceptable approach. This violent reaction will only lead to more resentment, destruction, injuries, and deaths. Therefore, the ruling party's decision to resort back to the use of brute force, particularly using its student wings, is not only illegal, but also counterproductive.\nIt was only on Saturday that we saw a most massive gathering of protesters in Dhaka. They were quite vocal, united in their demand, and still fully peaceful. The very next day, we saw ruling party affiliated men taking to the streets with sticks, rods, machetes and, in some cases, firearms. It seems as if they were intentionally placed to face off against the protesters, and ignite confrontations.\u00a0\nThe ruling party has the right to peacefully demonstrate its strength, but under no circumstances should that show of strength be done with the use of violence. If it truly wants to reduce tensions, why create a situation where there is a guaranteed face-off between its supporters armed with deadly weapons and the protesters? Why would they fire live ammunition? Ruling party supporters could have easily gathered somewhere else, instead of taking position where the protesters were and attacking them. Such tactics raise questions regarding the government's declaration that it does not want conflict but would rather have a peaceful resolution. From what we witnessed today, it is the presence of ruling party members that caused the bloody conflicts.\nThese events show that the country is becoming a battleground with no restraint, particularly from the security forces deployed. This will create much deeper divisions that could prove impossible to mend in the future. That is an extremely dangerous path to embark on. At this point, further use of force would be most detrimental for the whole nation. We strongly call on the ruling party to withdraw its members from the streets, and for both sides to avoid a head-on collision and instead come to the negotiating table for a peaceful settlement. That is the only way to prevent further deaths and injuries.\n",

Every aspect of life was adversely impacted by the turmoil the country found itself in over the non-political quota reform movement turning violent for almost a week. This was at a time when the country was reeling from an overall economic slump made worse for the low-income and marginal people by the soaring inflation. A shift in the non-political programme to the politically-nuanced anti-discrimination movement has turned the confrontation even bloodier and uglier on Sunday. The country was in convulsion with 102 lives falling dead and hundreds sustaining injuries on that day. Unprecedented in the independent Bangladesh's history, the casualty figures on a single day include both protesters and members of the law enforcement agencies. This is on top of the more than the toll of 200 lives in the earlier clashes between July 19 and 23. The following stricter curfew now clamped indefinitely and the declaration of the three-day general holiday with banks and other financial institutes remaining closed, life has now come to a standstill. A breakdown of the supply chain that happened in the first round of bloody clashes has been further precipitated by this fresh round of violence marked by indiscriminate firing from men in uniform as well as rival groups in civilian dress, attacks on police stations and beating 13 policemen to death inside one of those in Sirajganj. This is proof enough that elements with ulterior motives have taken full advantage of the situation to further their nefarious mission to which students are unlikely to be a party. But this could certainly be avoided if only the administration did not mishandle the situation right from the beginning. Instead of taking the protesting students into confidence and opening a channel of dialogue, it has complicated the situation and given the handle to forces inimical to the country's very foundation. When brutality, destruction and carnage of such order as that of Gaza are in full play, people get dehumanised and Bangladesh has gradually sliding into such an abyss. At a time of such crises, even disruption of supply chain limiting availability of necessaries loses its prominence. After all the bodies of so many compatriots ---falling victim to violence in so short a time ---weigh heavy on the nation's collective consciousness. But the biological needs of the living cannot be dismissed odd-handed.People need foods for their survival. Grief and shock may numb senses ---in extreme cases traumatising a few beyond recovery---but ultimately they have to eat for survival. The snapping of the on-line communication which is now the basis of not only business transactions with foreign countries but also within the country earlier caused losses, according to a rough estimate, to the tune of $10 billion. Once again that connectivity has been severed making business difficult and in certain cases impossible. This is why maintaining flow of commodities through the supply chain proves crucial. People with small means cannot procure even the basic foodstuffs for keeping their body and soul together from a market with the minimum supplies.",

        "full_article": "The protests centring the anti-quota movement of the students have so far left more than 300 people dead and thousands injured in just 20 days across the country. The massiveness of the students' protests and the response to them by the authorities are seen as unprecedented in Bangladesh's history. People from all walks of life have been longing for an immediate end to such deadly encounters on the streets that during the last couple of days assumed the character of a political showdown. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of protesters occupied the streets of Dhaka and other cities and towns. And the ruling party men -- many of them carried firearms -- took to the streets to defeat protesters. As a result, the economic activities came to a grinding halt. Factories, shops, markets, and other commercial establishments remained closed for the last three weeks. The countrywide supply chain remains disrupted. The supply of essentials to Dhaka from the outside has been scanty, leading to a substantial price rise. The daily turnover of commercial establishments dealing with daily necessities has nosedived. The daily wage earners had financial difficulty since they had no work. Hundreds of them have gone back home. The ongoing unrest is not only hurting every sector of the economy, directly or indirectly, but has also exacerbated the existing problems such as high inflation, declining reserves, soaring prices of fossil fuels, slowdown in foreign and local private investment, huge classified loans, and rising unemployment. The deadly violence, hopefully, will be over as the demand of the students and masses is now fulfilled with the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as head of the government. Yet the events of the last three weeks will surely leave a deep scar in the nation's psyche. The economy has suffered a notable loss. At the end of the first phase of the violence, some trade bodies disclosed the losses they suffered. They will have to revise their estimates as and when the situation improves. During the Covid pandemic, the economy suffered both locally and externally. For obvious reasons, earnings from exports and remittances declined, and domestic production suffered because of the supply chain disruption. But the country's image outside had remained intact. It earned international plaudits because of the resilience it had demonstrated against many odds. That situation does not exist anymore, it seems. How can a country can maintain its image if it cuts off communication with the outside world for days together? The absence of internet has taken a substantial toll on the economy. Life without internet is impossible these days. That some IT professionals went to neighbouring Nepal and India to meet the demand of their clients abroad shows how important the internet is. Allegations have it that IT professionals in Bangladesh lost many clients because of the suspension of internet service at home. However, disconcerting developments involving certain macroeconomic issues and a notable decline in the performance of key institutions, including regulatory ones, have eroded in the country's image on the external front. And, this is evident from the consecutive rating downgrades of by international rating agencies, including Fitch and S&P. The Fitch downgraded the Bangladesh's credit rating despite the fact that the latter was making some improvements in terms of export receipts, remittance income and domestic resource mobilization during past few months. But other failings weighed on the rating exercise. Foreign investors and lenders always value the country ratings while making their investment decisions. One can well imagine the impact of the ongoing developments on the external front that matters greatly in the management of the country's economy. While both politics and the economy are crucial, the current situation has elevated politics to the forefront. A prudent political decision is now the key to resolving the crisis, and the fate of the country's economy hinges on this decision that the entire nation is eagerly anticipating. The Bangladesh Bank last month unveiled a monetary policy for the first half of the current financial year, keeping the contractionary stance in place. The core objective of the policy is to tame inflation that has been hovering around 10 per cent for several months.Given the urgency of the situation, a significant amount of reassessment and rebuilding is imperative in the aftermath of the recent unrest. This upheaval has impacted every aspect of national life, particularly the economy.  The monetary policy will necessitate a fair, objective review. The fiscal policy, the budget expenditures and many more economic issues will also demand a fresh look. It's important to acknowledge that progress on economic issues will be stalled until the nation successfully navigates the current crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Now that the main demand of the students and others opposed to the Awami League government is met, it is time to settle down and chalk out an appropriate course of actions for the economy. An interim government was set to be formed, according to the statement made Chief of Army General Waker-Uz-Zaman yesterday. Hopefully, law and order will restored within a short time and the interim administration will do what is needed to put the economy on track.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Far from easing off, the events surrounding the students' quota protests which have taken the new name with broader connotation, 'anti-discrimination students' movement, have been getting more violent. The encounters of the demonstrating students with the law-enforcers and the pro-government elements are behind the mounting toll of deaths and injuries every day. The widening violence and uncertainties surrounding the street events have started to leave their impact on the kitchen market. It is not just that local grocers, vegetable or fish sellers of the mahallahs (neighbourhoods) in the city are taking undue advantage, as they usually do, of the prevailing situation to artificially drive up the prices of essential commodities. This time what is happening is different. Recently, according to reports, the queues are getting longer to buy essential commodities from the local retailers. The long lines are not because the commodities being bought by the public are in short supply. On the contrary, it appears, the members of the public are in a mad race to buy as much groceries as they can from the kitchen market. Such consumer behaviour, called 'panic buying' is observed in anticipation of calamities, whether manmade or natural, or of supply shortage. The fear that drives the public to stock up consumer goods may be real or imagined. Whatever the reason, such hysterical consumer behaviour can create real shortage of goods. One may recall here the pandemic time panic buying of hand sanitisers, masks, toilet paper, etc., in Bangladesh as elsewhere in world. Also, during the military regime of Ershad, the general consumers often demonstrated similar crazy buying habit. That would usually happen following the announcements of 48-hour, 72-hour or longer periods of countrywide hartals or shutdowns called by the opposition political parties.We are often in the habit of criticising such crazy shopping on the part of the public whether driven by any rumour of supply crunch or the possibility of an impending crisis as a characteristic of only the Bengali people. But the fact remains that the behaviour is universal. History has ample evidence of this. Both before and after the two world wars, people in Europe and the colonial countries resorted to panic buying of foods, fuels and other basic necessities. It happened during the Bengal famine of 1943 during the second World War that caused widespread starvation, malnutrition, diseases and deaths. Between 0.8 and 3.8 million people died during that infamous manmade famine. So, the driving force of panic buying can be both spontaneous and ill-motivated. In either case, it is the people who have the money to buy more goods than necessary and stockpile those trigger the irrational shopping frenzy. The actual sufferers, as usual, are the limited income people and the vulnerable segments of the community.Understandably, the current cases of frenzied shopping have to do with the agitating students' recently announced non-cooperation programme, long march, etc. As there is no sign yet of the unrest dying down, the members of the public are naturally fearing more chaos and anarchy in the days ahead. And the public's fears and anxieties are not misplaced either. With the extension of the curfew relaxation time, it appears that things are gradually going back to normal. Now, only a positive move from well-meaning quarters can restore normality in the market and society at large. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Polythene and plastic goods have become a daily necessity, and are widely used due to their affordability. However, its extensive use poses significant environmental and health risks. Polythene contributes to environmental degradation through river pollution, waterlogging, air pollution, and soil contamination. Moreover, it poses health hazards including eye irritation, impaired liver function, respiratory issues, cancer, and headaches, the extent of which remains largely unknown.Recognising these dangers, Bangladesh implemented a ban on the production, use, marketing, and transportation of polythene bags in 2002 under the Environment Protection Act of 1995. Violators would face severe penalties including imprisonment for up to 10 years or a fine of 10 lakh taka. Despite these regulations, enforcement has been lax, emphasising the need for stricter measures.Authorities must take proactive steps to reduce polythene usage and curb plastic pollution. Alternatives like jute bags should be promoted as substitutes for polythene.Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to the environment, impacting water bodies, soil, air quality, and biodiversity. Plastic waste contaminates water sources, harming aquatic life, while its presence in soil reduces fertility and disrupts ecosystems. The burning of plastic releases toxic fumes, contributing to air pollution and endangering human health.To combat plastic pollution, reducing plastic use through measures like utilizing jute or cloth bags and glass bottles, as well as promoting recycling and awareness campaigns about the harmful effects of plastic pollution, is crucial. Preventing plastic pollution requires collective efforts from individuals, industries, and policymakers alike. \nAbu BakarStudentDepartment of Communication and Multimedia JournalismIslamic University[email\u00a0protected]",
