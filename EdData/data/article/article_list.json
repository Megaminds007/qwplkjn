The last caretaker government initiated efforts to that end; those efforts gained momentum when the Awami League government took office in 2009.\nAs soon as they came to power, the Awami League government started propelling the development of oil- and gas-based rental and quick rental power plants as a part of their overall effort to increase power production in the country. Several ruling party leaders, lawmakers, and businessmen were given approval to set up quick rental and rental power plants\u2014even those with no prior knowledge or experience in the area. The process raised many questions then, as it had several loopholes: there was no mechanism to check the expertise of the producer; the prices were too high; and the producers were able to bill the government for \"capacity charge\" despite zero production of power.\nBecause of these loopholes and the lack of transparency in the entire power production process, the government faced a lot of criticism. Yet, it stayed firm on its decision. In order to avoid possible legal actions in the future\u2014as well as to smoothen the process of opening up these power plants\u2014the government formulated a law named the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act, passed in parliament in 2010.\nDespite all these issues, the power sector in Bangladesh began to see higher output, and people started getting electricity supply per demand. There were still concerns regarding the alleged corruption in the sector and the price hike, yet the general populace started to experience a sense of relief. Residences, commercial establishments and factories started to get uninterrupted power supply. It seemed the curse of \"load shedding\" was finally being lifted from the country.\nBut those issues still exist, and have become causes for concern. According to experts, there are some major shortcomings in the overall \"development philosophy\" of the power sector in Bangladesh. Before, there was a severe lack of supply, but now we have ample amount of power. There is no clear answer to some vital questions, such as how much power the country needs, to what extent does the production capacity need to be enhanced, etc.\nIn 2008-09, our electricity output was around 3,800MW against a demand of around 7,000MW, which means there was a shortage of more than 3,000MW. At present, the total demand for electricity ranges between 9,000MW and 12,000MW. But the country's power generation capacity is more or less 22,000MW. As yet, the daily power production has topped at 13,000MW. The average daily production now is 9,000MW. The daily demand for power rarely exceeds that amount, which means we are operating at less than half of our power generation capacity.\nDespite this situation, because of the conditions set in the agreements, the government is forced to pay the producers the capacity charge for about 12,000MW of power that is not even produced. That capacity charge amounts to a whopping Tk 9,000 crore.\nIn 2020, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a Dhaka-based think tank, said about 60 percent of the power plants in Bangladesh were sitting idle and earning money in the form of capacity charges. According to last year's data provided by US-based research firm the International Energy and Environment Foundation (IEEF), about 57 percent of the power plants in Bangladesh are sitting idle.\nAccording to a source, a recent utility report from the power sector\u2014which has not been made public\u2014shows that in 2023-24, the country's power overcapacity will be as much as 66 percent, which means the burden of capacity charge will grow even bigger.\nAfter building some small rental and quick rental power plants, the Bangladesh government proceeded to make big investments in big, coal-based power plants. But how these plants will be connected to the national grid, where the electricity generated from these plants will be used, and whether there is a demand for that power still remain unclear. A key benefit of having large-scale power plants is that the production costs go down, but the opposite is happening in Bangladesh.\nThe two-unit Payra thermal power plant, with 1,320MW power generation capacity, officially went into production last year. But the 400kV transmission line required to supply the generated power to the national grid has not been set up yet. There is no other way to connect the output of the power plant to the national grid, which means it is not operating at its full capacity.\nWe are being forced to pay Tk 100 crore as capacity charge for the Payra power plant as well.\nThe organisation that was appointed to build the transmission line failed to meet the deadline. The contractor was fired and replaced with a company named China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation. Speaking to the daily Prothom Alo earlier this month, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid said: \"We hope the work for the transmission line will be complete by next year. The work was interrupted due to a spike in coronavirus infections.\"\nHe further said: \"As long as we are not being able to utilise the produced electricity [from Payra power plant], we will be forced to continue paying the capacity charge.\"\nEven if the transmission line is established within the deadline specified by the state minister, we will be forced to pay a monthly capacity charge of Tk 100 crore for nearly a year and a half. It is also not certain whether we will be able to use the electricity generated at Payra plant even if the transmission line is ready.\nEnergy expert Prof M Shamsul Alam also voiced his concerns regarding the transmission line and the issue of commercial production at Payra power plant.\n\"The approval for commercial production can be given only when full-capacity production is confirmed by running tests. Since there is no functional transmission line, there has been no scope for testing the full capacity of the two units [of Payra power plant]. But the power plant has been approved to go ahead with commercial production,\" he said.\n\"As the government has to bear the cost of idle capacity charge for the power plant, the cost of per unit power generated there has gone up to Tk 10. This is the opposite of what the aim of such a large-scale power plant was\u2014cheap electricity. In this case, the country's greater interest has been ignored to favour the power plant's benefits,\" he added.\nSaying that the electricity generated at Payra coal-fired power plant would not be usable even when the transmission line is in place, Prof Shamsul Alam added: \"The issue of the transmission line is being used as an excuse. Even if the transmission line is installed and fully functional, the 1,320MW of power generated at Payra plant cannot be used in full. Moreover, the second phase of Payra power plant has been initiated, which will see the construction of another plant with an additional 1,320MW generation capacity, set to be completed by 2024. There is a complete lack of transparency regarding the usage of that power. A big sum of money is being spent, in a non-transparent manner, in order to construct unnecessary power production facilities. Because of these coal-fired plants, not only is the biodiversity of the area +facing a threat, but money is being wasted as well.\"\nProf M Tamim, former adviser to the caretaker government and an energy expert, said: \"Although it is claimed that Bangladesh's overall power generation capacity is 22,000MW, in reality it is about 15,000-16,000MW. But paying for capacity charges for idle power plants is causing a huge loss.\"\nHe also said transmission lines should be installed keeping in line with the construction of the power plants.\nThe Payra coal-fired power plant is importing coal at a price of USD 100 per tonne to fuel the production. The Barapukuria coal-fired power plant is buying coal extracted from the local mines at a price of USD 150 per tonne. A Chinese company is mining the coal from Barapukuria and selling it to the Bangladesh Coal Mining Company Ltd (BCMCL). The BCMCL is paying an extra USD 50 per tonne in order to buy locally mined coal, compared to the price paid for imported coal. As there is a scarcity of locally mined coal, the Barapukuria power plant is running at 50 percent capacity. Still, the cost of producing each unit of electricity is Tk 6.5 at Barapukuria, whereas the same costs Tk 10 at Payra. This leads to the question: Is the \"impunity law\" being exploited to build exorbitantly expensive power plants?\nThere are a few other big power plants under construction in Bangladesh. In Rampal, Bangladesh and India are jointly building a 1,320MW power plant. Japan is financing the construction of a 1,200MW power plant at Matarbari in Moheshkhali, Cox's Bazar. In Pabna's Rooppur, a 2,400MW nuclear power plant is being constructed. There are plans to supply electricity to the national grid from this two-unit power plant in 2023.\nThe government contracts with the rental and quick rental power plants will be expired by the end of this year. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) has sent a proposal to Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) to renew contracts with five gas-fired rental and quick rental power plants.\nBangladesh is also importing electricity from India. As per the contract, we have an arrangement to procure 1,200MW of power from India on a daily basis. From India, Bangladesh is buying coal-fuelled and gas-fuelled electricity at a price of Tk 6 and 7 per unit, respectively.\nBangladesh will also buy hydroelectricity from Nepal, where India will act as the third party. It is not confirmed as to what amount of electricity will be procured, but the price per unit will be nearly Tk 8.\nBefore, there was no electricity; now, there is. This has become the guiding philosophy behind power generation in Bangladesh. But there is a disconnect between this philosophy and a science-based working plan. We have big power plants, and coal-fired plants that are extremely harmful to the environment are already in production\u2014yet, the prices of electricity are not going down, nor is there any such possibility on the horizon. Crores of taka from the state coffers is getting squandered away in the name of capacity charge. Some producers are making money without generating any power, while the consumers are being forced to pay high tariffs.\nAt the end of the day, it is the people of the country who are being deprived.\nGolam Mortoza is a journalist at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "With rapid industrialisation and increased technological complexity over the last two centuries, we seem to have lost touch with the magnitude of our effect on our surroundings. Today, our fingerprints on the environment can be found everywhere\u2014the atmosphere, the oceans, and the Earth's surface. Not to be outdone, there is now another player, up in the sky\u2014the moon, whose periodic \"wobble\" together with rising sea levels on Earth will make high tides even higher in the near future, eventually leading to devastating floods around the world.\nHigh tides are caused mostly by the gravitational pull exerted by the moon on Earth. But because our planet's lone natural satellite wobbles ever so slowly over a predictable 18.6-year cycle, the power of the pull varies from year to year. Nevertheless, the result is two simultaneous high tides: one on the side of Earth facing the moon, and the other on the opposite side.\nEarth rotates on its axis much faster than the moon revolves around it. Our planet's rapid rotation coupled with higher orbital speed about the Sun drags the tidal bulge ahead of the moon's orbit, while the moon's gravitational attraction tries to pull it backward. The Earth, therefore, feels a drag force known as tidal friction, which has slowed down its rotational period from five hours almost four billion years ago to 23 hours 56 minutes today.\nThe moon takes the same time\u201427.3 days\u2014to rotate once on its axis as it takes to orbit the Earth. This is called synchronous rotation. In other words, the moon is tidally locked with Earth, which means we always see the same side of the moon, irrespective of where the moon is in its orbit.\nAdditionally, there is an apparent wobbling and nodding of the moon, collectively called \"libration.\" The wobbling is similar to the back-and-forth motion of a simple pendulum. It is an effect of the moon's non-uniform speed along its elliptic orbit around Earth. The orbital speed increases as the moon approaches the perigee, which is the point closest to the Earth. It decreases as it recedes from the perigee and approaches the apogee, the point farthest from the Earth. This gradual increase and decrease in the orbital speed causes the moon to wobble back and forth\u2014at least to our eyes\u2014by roughly seven degrees in the east-west direction.\nThe wobbling motion also arises from the fact that the moon's rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane; it is tilted by 1.5 degrees. Furthermore, moon's orbital plane is inclined to Earth's orbital plane by about five degrees. The net effect of these inclinations is an up-and-down wobbling, or nodding, in a north-south direction.\nAlongside global warming, lunar wobbling can either exacerbate the severity of tides or counteract them. During one half of the 18.6-year wobbling cycle, high tides are lower than normal and low tides are higher than normal, so the difference between the two is rather small. As a result, it negates the effect of rising seas to some extent. During the other half of the cycle, high tides get bigger and low tides get lower, thereupon increasing the range between the highest and lowest tides. This cycle boosts the effects on the sea level rise.\nThe moon is now in the tide-amplification cycle, but the sea level has not risen enough yet due to climate change for the effect to be pronounced. However, a new study by scientists from Nasa and the University of Hawaii published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Climate Change, only days before the recent destructive flood in Western Europe, warns that Earth may experience record flooding in the mid-2030s, when the moon's next tide-amplification cycle is set to happen. By then, global sea levels will have risen enough to make the already elevated high tides especially troublesome.\nThe study is the first to take into account all known oceanic and astronomical causes for floods. According to the study, these floods will exceed flooding thresholds in the coastal countries more often\u2014as frequently as every day or every other day. They may even occur in clusters and can last as long as a month or more, depending on the positions of the moon, the Earth and the Sun. \"It's the accumulated effect over time that will have an impact,\" the study warns. However, it also notes that the prediction does not apply uniformly to every coastline everywhere.\nClimate change has already increased the frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather events around the world. This impending threat on the horizon could wreak additional havoc, thereby worsening the already grim predictions of climate change for people living along the coastlines. Some of the biggest cities on the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts, including New York City, Miami and New Orleans, will be hard hit. Osaka in Japan is also a major-risk city; climate models show it could \"disappear\" with rising tides. Other high-risk cities are Alexandria in Egypt, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Shanghai in China.\nIt took Noah years to build an ark to save him and his family from a godless society that God was going to destroy by sending a catastrophic flood. Unlike Noah, we have 15 years, more or less, to build the ark of mitigation and adaptation necessary to save us from the calamitous effects of climate change. It is thus a race against time, because the flood is coming faster than many once thought. Keeping this in mind, Nasa's Sea Level Change Team is providing crucial information so that we can \"plan, protect, and prevent damage to the environment and people's livelihoods affected by flooding.\" Unfortunately, if poor low-lying countries like Bangladesh become the victims of high tides caused by lunar wobbling, they will suffer immensely because they may not have the technology and/or sufficient fund to implement Nasa's recommendations.\nFinally, our moon, until now the quiescent mystical object majestically shining in the sky, has been \"faithful to its nature and its power is never diminished.\" One of the powers it always flexed (albeit unnoticed by us) and will flex again approximately 15 years from now\u2014but this time working in tandem with climate change\u2014is its ability to create record floods. The floods will perhaps give our leaders, who are not doing enough to combat climate change, an alibi to throw in the towel by blaming the wobbling moon.\nDr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.\n",

        "full_article": "The global food system is unsustainable. While it is worth approximately USD 8 trillion annually, its negative impact is valued at roughly USD 12 trillion. And this is not the system's only contradiction. Around the world, food systems are both affected by climate change (owing to disruptive weather and rising temperatures) and make significant contributions to it (through greenhouse-gas emissions and biodiversity destruction). The millions of jobs they provide are often low-quality and poorly paid. And, most significantly, they fail in their ultimate purpose of delivering affordable, healthy food to all.\nBecause the global food system is fundamentally unviable, change is inevitable. But the radical reforms needed to create an inclusive, sustainable sector that produces nourishing food for the world's population may have devastating short-term consequences. If we take the wrong approach, incorporating the true costs of production into food systems could trigger widespread bankruptcy, devastate rural unemployment, drive up prices, and increase poverty.\nThe best way to achieve a rapid, fair, and safe transition to a sustainable global food system that can deliver affordable, healthy food for all is, however, a matter of heated debate. This is reflected in the strident and largely unproductive discussions taking place in the run-up to the United Nations Food Systems Summit, to be held on September 23 during the UN General Assembly.\nFrom a production standpoint, advocates of regenerative farming vehemently oppose a new generation of soilless food production, such as lab-grown \"alternate protein\" and vertical farming. But it is tough to scale regenerative farming rapidly. Soilless systems must be a major part of the solution, given their dramatically reduced carbon footprint and water use, minimal impact on biodiversity, and potential for rapidly delivering cheap, healthy food at scale.\nThe role of finance in this transition is no less controversial.\nThere is some merit to complaints about the undue influence of a limited number of private players on decisions that impact the entire global food system. Financialisation\u2014the drive to maximise risk-adjusted financial returns\u2014is increasing across the global food system, and market concentration is growing. For example, just ten companies control half of the world's seed market, and four agribusiness firms account for 90 percent of the global grain trade. Just one percent of agricultural firms own 65 percent of the available farmland.\nFinancialisation reinforces the unequal distribution of economic returns, squeezing the incomes of small farmers and communities, while supporting business models that under-supply healthy, affordable food, and over-supply foods containing high levels of salt, sugar, fat, and carbohydrates. Moreover, financialisation amplifies corporate lobbying that externalises public health costs, maintains perverse agricultural subsidies, and ensures that the costs to the climate and nature do not adversely affect financial bottom lines.\nBut private capital is absolutely necessary for financing the global food system's transition. We need to harness the massive financial resources managed on our collective behalf by pension funds, banks, and private equity while mitigating the dangers of financialisation.\nIn a recent report, Making Finance Work for Food: Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Food System, the Finance for Biodiversity Initiative maps out the role global finance can play in the needed transition. The report, prepared in association with the Food System Economics Commission, describes four ways financial tools can be used to shape future food systems.\nFor starters, financial policies and regulation, reinforced by shareholder and public activism, must drive investors' internalisation of the costs to nature and climate in their financing decisions. This change would strand dirty assets, accelerate green-friendly investments, and trigger a shift towards more nutritious food production.\nSecond, financial innovations, including blended public and private solutions, are needed to accelerate investment in healthy food produced by climate- and nature-friendly forms of farming, thereby driving down costs. Such innovations could involve scalable instruments equivalent to the feed-in tariffs that have been used to great effect in catalysing investment in renewable energy.\nThird, policies and public finance are needed to protect and retrain those whose livelihoods are eroded during the transition. The goal should be to provide technology, skill development, and capital to enable them to own and operate commercially viable regenerative and soilless forms of food production.\nFinally, we need to create opportunities to empower citizens, especially by harnessing the power of digitalisation. As consumers, they can make an impact by adopting improved, sustainable diets. As investors, pension policy holders, and taxpayers, they can advocate for better uses of their money.\nDelaying the transition to a more inclusive and sustainable global food system would jeopardise food security, destroy livelihoods, and prevent us from achieving environmental goals. We need to overcome the resistance not only of those who profit from today's systems but also of those who seek to protect the vulnerable. Resetting global finance and harnessing its benefits is necessary to fund a rapid, sustainable, and equitable transition.\nSimon Zadek is Chair of the Finance for Biodiversity Initiative.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2021.\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "Covid-19 has accelerated the pace of change around the world. From the way we live and work to the way we think and act\u2014everything has gone through dramatic change due to the ongoing pandemic. Democracy has not been spared either, with its very foundation shaken to the core because of the pandemic's wide-ranging socioeconomic impacts witnessed over the last 18 months.\nA report by Freedom House\u2014an organisation actively advocating to strengthen democracy around the world\u2014revealed that the condition of democracy and human rights has worsened in 80 countries, with \"particularly sharp deterioration in struggling democracies and highly repressive states.\" The organisation's president, Michael J Abramowitz, suggested: \"What began as a worldwide health crisis has become part of the global crisis for democracy\u2026 Governments in every part of the world have abused their powers in the name of public health, seizing the opportunity to undermine democracy and human rights.\"\nFrom strong European nations such as Hungary, where the parliament had initially voted to give the right and authority to Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree in the name of the coronavirus, to the more struggling nations such as Chile that had postponed constitutional assembly polls in view of rising Covid-19 cases\u2014democracy around the world has been hit hard by the pandemic.\nFreedom House has identified four major issues that have become even more complicated due to Covid-19: lack of government transparency and information on Covid-19; corruption; lack of protection for vulnerable populations; and government abuses of power.\nThese challenges are universal; the case is not so different in Bangladesh either, where press freedom, human rights, and the performance of vital institutions have all been affected during the pandemic.\nThe government in Bangladesh has perhaps been less ruthless in leveraging the challenges posed by the pandemic to erode people's democratic rights, as opposed to some other democratic governments that have pressed home their own vindictive agendas\u2014case in point: India, where the minority Muslims have been targeted during anti-Covid drives (The Wire published a column titled \"The Coronavirus Has Morphed Into an Anti-Muslim Virus\" elaborating this socio-political injustice)\u2014but it cannot be denied that democracy in the country has suffered overall.\nThe government's lack of transparency regarding its Covid-19 management plan has been highlighted by the media multiple times, and has caused the common people immense suffering. The government's mass immunisation drives and vaccine sourcing strategies suffer not only from a lack of proper planning and execution, but also from a lack of clarity, accountability and a meaningful engagement with the public. The government has yet to elaborate on how it plans to inoculate 70 percent of the population, and its measures so far can at best be termed as \"kneejerk reactions\" to the various Covid-19 waves the country has experienced.\nSimilarly, the lack of transparency and accountability in the government's plans to distribute relief goods among the affected people have allowed these drives to be mired in corruption and misappropriation, as many public representatives embezzled rice, among other relief commodities. While punitive action has been taken by the authorities in some cases, there has been no initiative to address the systemic loopholes that allowed this to happen in the first place, potentially leaving room for future transgressions.\nAnd when the media reported these incidents, many journalists came under fire\u2014or should one say sticks and weapons, as it happened in the case of SA Television district correspondent AH Bhuiyan Sajal. Sajal was beaten up by the henchmen of Amirganj Union Parishad Chairman Nasir Uddin Khan, when he and his colleagues were investigating Nasir's alleged involvement in the misappropriation of relief commodities.\nOne would also remember the government-imposed censorship on medical professionals\u2014especially nurses\u2014who were asked not to talk to the media amid reports of the shortages of PPE and meals, at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe government initially also warned that it would monitor the news outlets and social media, and the information they broadcast and share on Covid-19, to apparently stop the spread of fake information. In the face of protests, however, the government took a step back and only suggested keeping an eye on the social media platforms to observe if misinformation with regard to Covid-19 were being circulated.\nIn March 2020, the government also arrested six individuals for allegedly spreading misinformation about Covid-19. The Digital Security Act, which experts termed \"draconian\" due to its nature, has been used on multiple occasions to smother the dissenting voices.\nEven the notorious colonial-era law, Official Secrets Act, 1923, has been used to supress press freedom. Prothom Alo journalist Rozina Islam, who has exposed many irregularities in the country's public health sector, has been sued under this act for the apparent theft of confidential official documents. Before handing her over to the law enforcement officials, health ministry officials confined her in their office for around five hours and also \"searched\" her, raising serious questions about the abuse of power by a quarter of state officials and their deep distrust of the free press.\nWhile human rights, transparency, and press freedom are still struggling to rise above the challenges posed by the pandemic, the damage done to democracy and our democratic values are not permanent.\nSome elements within the executive and the legislative bodies may have taken advantage of the pandemic for their own gains, but one can argue that many of the problems predate the pandemic. A case can even be made that the government, over all, has been comparatively pro-people during this time. However, we cannot ignore its shortcomings in fighting the pandemic (especially its indecisiveness and inefficiency in managing Covid-19 challenges), the corruption it has allowed to go on, and its suppression of free speech in the name of combating fake news.\nThe government, if it genuinely aspires to achieve a true democracy, must work on changing the system that enables the gagging of democracy. It can start by reforming and strengthening the democratic and regulatory institutions, the statutory bodies and other public sector institutions, including the Election Commission, the Bangladesh Public Service Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission, various ministries, law enforcement bodies, and the central bank, among others. These institutions should be allowed and necessarily empowered to function with fairness and without external influence.\nThe government needs to identify the individuals who are using the pandemic to their advantage, and take punitive actions against them in order to make examples of these greedy, unscrupulous people who are hurting the democratic ethos of our nation in these trying times.\nThe authorities must demonstrate strong political will to flush out these elements and reset the system to salvage the democracy we so cherish and take pride in. Otherwise, the misdeeds of a few\u2014albeit influential\u2014will cause permanent damage to the democratic values of our nation. This scenario should not be desirable for anyone\u2014most of all our democratically elected government.\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.\nHer Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "We are sceptical about the recent government decision that any university can resume in-person classes if all of its students complete online registration to get the Covid-19 vaccine by September 27. Earlier, the deadline for reopening the universities was set at October 15.\nAccording to a report by The Daily Star, 60 percent of the country's university students are yet to register for the vaccine. Currently, students over the age of 18 years can register using their national ID cards. But for those who do not have NID cards, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has said it will create a link on its website, through which students can register using their birth certificates. The list of students will be forwarded to the health authorities, and students will then be able to register using the Surokkha platform. Once registered, they will be vaccinated on a priority basis, as decided in a meeting between the education ministry officials, the UGC, vice-chancellors of the public universities, and health officials on Tuesday.\nHowever, the mishandling, miscalculations and chaos that we witnessed during the special mass vaccination drives in August and earlier this month (conducted by the city corporations) give us pause as the drives for registration/inoculation of all university students may very well face a similarly chaotic situation.\nEven if all students, regardless of their NID status, register for the vaccine by September 27 and begin to attend classes, how does this address the threat of virus transmission in the classrooms in the short term? After all, even if the registration plan goes as expected, the students will only be registered for vaccination at the time of reopening; it may take them weeks to get their schedule for the first dose, and at least a month to get their second dose. There are real concerns about what might happen if the 44.34 lakh or so university students across the country start in-person classes without being fully vaccinated. Will it lead to a surge in Covid-19 infections? When the time for their vaccination comes, will we again see the pandemonium that marked the two special mass vaccination drives? Most importantly, are there enough vaccine doses to inoculate all university students alongside the 2.03 crore citizens who have reportedly registered but have yet to get their first dose?\nWhile we would, of course, like to see the university students return to their classrooms, we hope this will not happen in a haphazard manner, giving way to another wave of Covid-19 infections. We hope the health officials are right about having enough vaccine doses in stock, but we urge the authorities concerned to conduct the vaccination of university students in a more planned and disciplined manner. Otherwise, this much-needed action may cause more chaos than relief.\n",

The workers have been staging such protests for the past one month, leading to the prime minister, on September 6, directing the relevant authorities to set up an RT-PCR lab at the airport. Why hasn't one been set up even then? More importantly, why hasn't one been set up over the past year and a half of Covid-19, knowing how essential such facilities are for pandemic-time travel?\nThe fact that we don't have any Covid-19 testing facilities at our largest international airport yet is a disgrace. It shows just how indifferent the relevant authorities are to the plight of the people\u2014and the migrant workers in particular. Even the prime minister's express directive couldn't nudge them into doing what they should have done of their own accord long ago. While this lack of compliance raises serious questions about administrative accountability, it is because of this kind of negligence that Bangladeshi migrant workers have been suffering immensely\u2014and unnecessarily. Around 50,000 Bangladeshis working in the UAE have been stranded in Bangladesh for months now, unable to return to their workplaces as the UAE government has imposed a condition for migrant workers from different countries, including Bangladesh, that they must carry Covid-19 negative certificates based on RT-PCR test within six hours of boarding a plane. In response to that, if India and Pakistan could set up RT-PCR labs at their airports to aid their migrant workers, why couldn't we? The only logical answer is apathy on part of our authorities.\nBut why should such apathy towards the plight of migrant workers be acceptable? The government often boasts about the economic progress of the country riding on the backs of these migrant workers. But when it comes to providing vital, pro-migrant services, the government mostly seems either silent or reluctant, acting only when prodded into.\nThis attitude has to change. The authorities need to prioritise the needs of our migrant workers. Throughout this entire pandemic period, migrant workers have suffered more than most other groups. And during their times of urgency, the government has failed to lend them the needed support. We expect the expatriates' welfare ministry to do much better in supporting our migrant workers. And the government in general needs to do a better job. Setting up an RT-PCR lab urgently at Dhaka airport will be a positive step towards that goal.\u00a0\n",
