While GDP growth slipping to 5.4% in the second quarter was termed a transient blip, policymakers have acknowledged slowing consumption demand led by restrained spending trends in urban India. They have also exuded optimism about a festive boost from cities along with a resilient rural demand outlook lifting the momentum. The latest data points are also important as they are part of the final gauges for the Finance Ministry to assess before it finalises its economic blueprint for 2025-26 in the February 1 Union Budget. Bank credit growth has slowed for the fifth straight month in November, while core infrastructure sectors \u2014 about 40% of industrial output \u2014 expanded at a four-month high pace of 4.3%. However, production levels were 3.3% below October with six of eight sectors operating at lower capacities. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index shows factory activity levels through November and December were the worst through 2024, even as input cost inflation spurred price hikes that would hit demand somewhat over time.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) receipts for December, based on transactions concluded in November, do not have much succour to offer either, especially on the consumption engine of the economy. Gross revenues were at a three-month low of almost \u20b91.77 lakh crore, and just 7.3% higher than last year, marking the joint-second slowest uptick in three and a half years. December\u2019s revenues, in fact, mark the fourth straight month of below-10% growth, with the pace decelerating every passing month, and the year-to-date rise in revenues is now just 8.6%, making the 11% growth estimate in the Budget a tall task to catch up with in the final quarter. Net revenues after refunds were just 3.3%, the slowest this fiscal, although this may partly be explained by high refund payouts in December. Revenue growth from domestic transactions slowed to 8.4%, while import revenues grew just 3.9% \u2014 the former may perhaps be linked to tighter retail credit flows and a post-Deepavali spending pullback, but the latter is a tad puzzling as November\u2019s goods import bill had shot up 27% to a record high of $70 billion. The poor revenue growth rates for major consumer States such as Uttar Pradesh (1%) and Gujarat (4%), and the persistent contraction in Andhra Pradesh and a few northeastern States (including Manipur), also need closer scrutiny. For the Budget\u2019s formulation, the Centre would do well to try to understand and address the pain points afflicting consumption, including high inflation.

        "full_article": "An annual assessment by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) on the state of groundwater, and its quality, has some worrying portents. First, the number of districts with excessive nitrate in their groundwater has risen from 359 in 2017 to 440 in 2023. This translates to a little more than half of India\u2019s 779 districts having excessive nitrate, or more than 45 mg/L (milligram per litre). There are two major concerns with excess nitrate content: first, methemoglobinemia, or a reduced ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. This sometimes causes \u2018Blue Baby Syndrome,\u2019 in infants. The bigger problem is environmental: once nitrates in groundwater rise to the surface and become part of lakes and ponds, algal blooms throttle the health of aquatic ecosystems. What the CGWB found, from analysing 15,239 groundwater samples across the country, was that close to 19.8% samples had nitrates \u2014 nitrogen compounds \u2014 above safe limits. However, this proportion has not shifted much since 2017, when 21.6% had excessive nitrate (13,028 samples).Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu reported the largest extent of nitrate contamination, with 49%, 48% and 37% of the samples reporting numbers beyond the limit. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have a perennial nitrate problem, primarily from geological factors, with relative levels fairly constant since 2017, the report says. However regions in central and southern India are reporting a rise, which is a reason for worry. Through the years, several studies have established the correlation between elevated nitrate levels and the practice of intensive agriculture. Other significant chemical contaminants affecting groundwater quality were fluoride and uranium. Fluoride concentrations exceeding the permissible limit were \u201ca major concern\u201d in Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The report drew attention to the fact that States with over-exploited groundwater blocks \u2014 where extraction is more than replenishment \u2014 were more likely to have excessive chemical contaminants. Overall, the country\u2019s degree of groundwater extraction is 60.4%, or roughly the same as it has been since 2009. About 73% of the blocks analysed for groundwater levels are in the \u2018safe\u2019 zone, meaning that they are replenished enough to compensate for the water drawn out. While it is a good sign that India now has a robust, scientific system of assessment to monitor the health of groundwater blocks annually, efforts are lacking in getting States to act on these findings. There needs to be more concerted awareness programmes led by the highest levels of leadership to contain the crisis.\r Published - January 04, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        water pollution\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        water\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        groundwater\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        environmental issues\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Rajasthan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Karnataka\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Madhya Pradesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Gujarat\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Haryana\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Andhra Pradesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Telangana\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        science (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        agriculture\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        chemicals",

        "full_article": "By Narayani Ganesh\nA brand new year is here, but we also carry with us, naturally, a considerable amount of the past. A favourite quote on the past, is the one by writer L P Hartley, who remarked, \u201cThe past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.\u201d It\u2019s a refreshing way to say that things change with time and circumstances; the context becomes different; what was thought to be scandalous could be kosher today and vice versa. We need to move on, and wherever possible, adapt, even as we feel enriched/ happy \u2013 or burdened/ unhappy \u2013 by the past.\nIn the history of evolution, which quality is most important for survival of the species? Charles Darwin, known for the theory of evolution with Alfred R Wallace, said, \u201cIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, not the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.\u201d It is interesting that while \u2018adjustment\u2019 and adaptation, cooperation and coopetition were part of one\u2019s way of life in previous generations, it is less so, in present times. To \u2018adjust\u2019 in Indian lingo \u2013 among some of us \u2013 is a bad word, as it implies giving in, surrendering a bit and whittling the ego.\nThe word \u2018endurance\u2019 does not figure in the dictionary of those who fiercely uphold individual freedom at any cost, in a situation that might beg some endurance from us. Swami Venkatesananda in his commentary on the Bhagwad Gita\u2019s verse 15 in the second chapter, explains the need for endurance and/ or detachment by asking you to imagine that you are walking through the forest on a cold morning. Suddenly, a monkey jumps on you and tears your shirt so that the cold wind blows on your bare back. You feel so cold but you endure it. This is \u2018titiksa\u2019 \u2013 patient endurance of suffering.\nThe cold wind is blowing on your face as well, but you are not even aware of that. This, Swamiji says, is \u2018sama,\u2019 equanimity, wherein the external condition does not affect you in the least.\nThe spiritual aspirant strives to practise endurance. To him, pain and pleasure are alike. As Swami Sivananda pointed out, the more you are able to identify yourself with the immortal, all-pervading Self, the less will you be affected by the pairs of opposites.\nComing back to the past, present and future \u2013 as a movie title put it, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow \u2013 all masters and ancient teachings advocate honing the art of transcending the past, living in the present and dealing with the future when it is appropriate to do so. No point agonising over the past and letting the present slip away, or unnecessarily worrying about the future and forgetting to live in the present moment.\nHappy memories are made when you live joyfully in the present. But if most of your time is spent regretting the past and stressing about the future, it only wastes time and energy. The New Year is a good time to affirm to live life afresh with a heart brimming with kindness, compassion, joy \u2013 and ah yes, to adapt and endure, for the right reasons.\n\n",

Diclofenac was banned in 2006 for the same reason. So was ketoprofen and aceclofenac. But these moves have done little to revive vulture populations. There are two main reasons for this. First, despite the bans and restrictions, enforcement is lax \u2013 Nimesulide continues to be available in rural markets. Second, vultures reproduce very slowly, making reviving their numbers a big challenge.\nVultures as a keystone species are vital for the ecology. No other animal does the job of naturally disposing of animal carcasses as these big birds. So their rapid decline in the country \u2013 from 40mn before 1993 to near extinction \u2013 is a huge problem. In fact, a study earlier this year linked the decline of vulture populations to an indirect increase in human deaths. It found feral dogs and rats are not only poor scavengers but also spread disease among humans. Therefore, a three-step solution is in order.\nFirst, continuously monitor veterinary drugs for toxicity to vultures. Second, evolve alternatives and stop-gap measures such as restricting the vial size of diclofenac to 3ml to prevent livestock use. And third, ramp up vulture breeding programmes through creation of vulture safe zones where the toxic drugs are strictly banned. Vulture conservation must become central to all ecological conservation efforts.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Prof Syed Munir Khasru, who heads the Institute for Policy, Advocacy, and Governance (IPAG), an international knowledge outfit based in Dhaka with a presence in five continents, discusses the performance and challenges of the interim government led by Prof Muhammad Yunus, in an exclusive interview with\u00a0Monorom Polok\u00a0of\u00a0The Daily Star.\nWhat do you think about the current state of the interim government?\nIn the aftermath of more than 15 years of autocratic rule that suppressed human rights and freedom of speech, this government came to power in a rather unusual situation. Students and others sacrificed their lives and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears went behind this change. This is quite different from the military-backed caretaker government of 2007-08, and for legitimate reasons, people's expectations are quite high. This government still has time, but I'm concerned that we may end up with another wasted opportunity.\nThree things are lacking at present: a clear vision of where we are heading; a pragmatic strategy to help us get there; and having people's trust in the same.\nCan you elaborate on your concerns?\n\nTake Prof Yunus as an example, who is internationally the most well-known living Bangladeshi. When students approached him to head the interim government, he acted too hastily. Before forming a cabinet from overseas, he should have spent a few days upon return home to take stock of the situation by talking to relevant parties like the army, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, political leaders, etc. The formation and swearing-in of the council of advisers were unnecessarily hasty and not a well-thought-out process.\nSince on several occasions, Prof Yunus has stated that he is not interested in politics as he does not know how to run a country, at least he should have been more thoughtful about the people he is choosing to do it for him. It is ironic that a government that is the product of an anti-discrimination movement has almost one-third of important positions, including the cabinet and CA's office, being filled up by people from one district over the rest 63 districts of the country and Grameen Bank and Yunus Foundation. How is it different from the ousted government's \"Pro Gopalganj\" policy of regionalism? This is not expected from a globally revered social revolutionary and Nobel laureate we all hold in high esteem.\nIn the initial stage, I had discussions with some of the advisers on how I may support matters related to policy and strategy, but in hindsight and looking at the way things have been unfolding since then, it has been better to be outside this spectrum of poor coordination, ineffective communication, and growing disillusionment. However, there is still time to correct the course before it is too late.\nMany in his cabinet are well-qualified individuals in their respective fields, but governing a country requires a different skill set. There's concern about the direction we're heading. Adding to this is the shadow of the upcoming election, which doesn't have a clear roadmap. During informal chats with heads of some of the reform commissions, I felt they lacked the mandate to independently carry out their tasks. Let us see what recommendations they have and, more importantly, whether the political parties are willing to accept the same. Without political parties passing reforms in parliament, all the commissions' work will be mere paperwork, with no teeth and gathering dust on bookshelves.\nYou mentioned education reform earlier. Could you expand on that?\n\nOne of the most glaring oversights is the absence of an education reform commission. It's rather ironic because this movement was led by students, fighting for their right to government jobs. Yet, nothing has been done to improve the quality of education or provide meaningful employment opportunities for the youth.\nOur youth are largely unemployed, and our education system is falling apart. While administrative and police reforms are important, education reform is vital. An undereducated population leads to a weaker economy, less innovation, and greater inequality. Without significant investment in education infrastructure, teachers' training, and curriculum development, we're failing the very people who risked their lives for positive change, i.e. the student community. Young people feel disenfranchised when they see little return for their hard work and degrees. Many turn to alternative paths, often destructive, exacerbating societal issues.\nWhat are your thoughts about the foreign policy challenges we're facing currently?\n\nLet's start with our neighbourhood. I believe we have to engage constructively with India. India has made mistakes, such as putting all their trust and investment in one party and one person in Bangladesh. This myopic strategy cannot serve India well in the long run. If the BNP made a mistake by irking India in 2001-2006 with issues like the arms truck case, India did not do much better either by putting all its bets in one person and one party for one and a half decades\u2014something I have repeatedly told friends and colleagues in India. Relations should be state-level, not party- or person-centric.\nBangladesh also needs to strengthen ties with other South Asian nations, as well as in countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the European Union, and North America to have a more balanced and nuanced approach. We need to get out of this India-China-US orbit and start acting like a truly sovereign nation.\nHow do we restore confidence in the Bangladesh-India relations?\n\nWe must find ways to converge as opposed to catering to the forces of divergence working on both sides of the border with their vested narrow interests. A section of Indian media has been playing an irresponsible role by circulating stories that are either exaggerated or outright false, creating negative perceptions about Bangladesh.\nWe also have to get out of these emotionally driven extremes of either \"Pro-India\" or \"Anti-India\" sentiment and opt for a more pragmatic \"Engage with India\" approach. One can choose friends, but not neighbours, and we will have to live with our largest neighbour with a shared border of more than 4,000 kilometres. For India, it is a unique opportunity to reboot and start building relations with the people of Bangladesh, not a person or a party.\nWhat about student involvement in politics?\n\nStudents have the right to form political parties and participate in elections. If they choose to do so, they should proceed in a manner that does not put their political ambitions on a collision course with the task of the interim government to hold a free, fair, and credible election. Having student leaders in the cabinet raises questions about the administration's impartiality.\nI personally don't think it was a good decision to include them in the cabinet in the first place. In recognition of their brave role and sacrifice, alternate arrangements could have been made to give them a fair opportunity to make positive contributions to things that matter to the larger student community, like access to quality education, employment, entrepreneurial opportunities, and have platform to share their hopes, aspirations, and dreams for the future of Bangladesh. Student movements have historically been a driving force for change, but they need our support and guidance.\nDo you think there's a disconnect in governance under the interim government?\n\nAbsolutely. Take police reform, for example. Honest, professional, and non-partisan police officers who served under difficult conditions during the Awami League rule need reassurance that they won't be victimised just because they were assigned to some positions of importance by the previous government, unless they behaved like party lackeys and committed excesses being overzealous.\nAnother example is the lack of cohesive communication between government departments. Policies are announced without proper background work or necessary consultative process. This disconnect hampers progress and erodes public trust. Governance requires clarity of purpose, coordination among stakeholders, and transparency at all levels. Without these, even well-intentioned initiatives will fail to deliver results. Some of the advisers should restrain their disruptive loose talks and focus on the work for which they have been assigned.\nDo you think the country has the resources to improve?\n\nWe have everything except political leadership with vision and courage, honesty and integrity to achieve our full potential. We've already wasted over 30 years since 1991. We cannot afford to waste another 25 years and end up in the same quagmire in 2050.\nA country of more than 17 crore people, Bangladesh is rich in human resources, which no government since independence has bothered to have a well-thought-out strategy to take advantage of. Even a small country like Nepal has outsmarted us in having educated and skilled Nepali youth grabbing lucrative jobs from the Middle East to Europe, while we continue to rely mostly on remittance from the low-paid jobs of our unskilled and semi-skilled labour working overseas. Leveraging technology and innovation, investing in renewable energy and climate-resistant infrastructure, harnessing the talent of the youth, improving governance, and having an honest and patriotic political leadership could transform the nation.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We are concerned about the ongoing cold wave that has brought hardship and suffering across the country. Reports from various regions show how plummeting temperatures, combined with chilly winds and dense fog, are disrupting daily lives, livelihoods, and transportation. Weather forecasts indicate that the cold weather may persist throughout January, with moderate to severe spells expected to affect large parts of the country intermittently. What this means for the poor and low-income groups\u2014who must venture outdoors for work but are least equipped to do so\u2014is not hard to understand. This is yet another reminder of how extreme weather conditions, whether cold or hot, disproportionately impact the vulnerable in our society.\nIn Dhaka, where temperatures plunged on consecutive days, the impact has been equally severe. While many have stayed indoors over the weekend, many others suffered under the open sky or in poorly insulated homes and shelters. There was no respite for low-income workers, such as rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors, either. Many were also seen to light makeshift fires under flyovers or in open spaces to stay warm. They were battling not just discomfort but also serious health risks. Reportedly, there has been a surge in cold-related illnesses\u2014including pneumonia, respiratory infections, and diarrhoea\u2014with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) reporting a 25 percent increase in paediatric cases of diarrhoea compared to last year. Even deaths have been recorded.\n\nIn Dhaka, where temperatures plunged on consecutive days, the impact has been equally severe. While many have stayed indoors over the weekend, many others suffered under the open sky or in poorly insulated homes and shelters. There was no respite for low-income workers, such as rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors, either. Many were also seen to light makeshift fires under flyovers or in open spaces to stay warm. They were battling not just discomfort but also serious health risks.\nHospitals in the northern districts have similarly reported a spike in cold-related illnesses. The situation in this region has been particularly punishing for both humans and animals, with Panchagarh's Tetulia recording the country's lowest temperature of 8.3 degrees Celsius on Friday morning. Clearly, these vulnerable regions, and those most exposed to the cold in other areas, require special attention. The immediate priority is to intensify relief efforts including the distribution of blankets and warm clothing among the poor. It is reassuring to learn that 679,000 blankets have been allocated from the Chief Adviser's Relief Fund for distribution, while approximately Tk 33 crore has been allocated by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief to purchase additional blankets. These efforts, along with volunteer initiatives by citizen groups, will need to be expanded if the cold weather persists as forecasted.\nIt is vital that all relief efforts are streamlined and coordinated to ensure that aid reaches those who most need it. During the recent floods, we saw how uncoordinated efforts exacerbated victims' suffering instead of alleviating it. Such disorganisation must not recur this time. As the cold deepens, our collective response must rise to meet the challenge.\n",

        "full_article": "Urban Bangladesh lacks a well-functioning primary healthcare system. Currently, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, through its Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), operates 35 urban dispensaries nationwide. Additionally, the Local Government Division runs a public-private partnership (PPP) model under the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCP) in selected areas across the country.\nThe need for a well-functioning and structured primary healthcare system with nationwide coverage is paramount. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), primary care can meet around 80-90 percent of a person's lifetime health needs. If unaddressed, the problems due to inadequate primary healthcare in urban areas are only likely to worsen, exacerbated by the ever-increasing urban population and the consequent increased demand for healthcare.\nConsider the situation in Dhaka city. People come from all over the country to the hospitals here, which are often overburdened with patients and operate at overcapacity, struggling to provide quality care. Patients frequently face difficulties, such as limited accommodation, extended waiting times, and transportation hurdles due to late-night commutes.\nOne of the major problems in the current healthcare system is the lack of an effective referral system and inadequate gatekeeping at tertiary care facilities. Barring emergency care and referrals from lower-tier health facilities, patients should not visit hospitals as they are meant to provide tertiary-level care. However, due to the lack of primary healthcare centres\u2014and perhaps also due to the lack of awareness\u2014patients are often left with no choice but to visit tertiary-level hospitals, further burdening these facilities. Patients should have primary care centres close to their homes. The community clinic model in rural areas aims for one clinic for every 6,000 people, trying to mitigate pressure across these facilities.\nUrban health-seeking patterns present a more complex scenario. While hospitals remain crowded with patients, data from the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) shows that pharmacies are the most frequented healthcare providers. Findings of the 2010, 2016, and 2022 HIES all show that pharmacies consistently emerge as the preferred choice, with 53 percent of healthcare seekers choosing them in 2022, whereas, 11 percent preferred visiting qualified doctors' chambers, the second-most-used option.\nSo why are pharmacies so frequently preferred? Firstly, pharmacies are easily accessible and closer to people's residences, as there are 200,000 registered and over 100,000 unregistered pharmacies across the country. Secondly, the average waiting time to access care at pharmacies is 8.22 minutes in urban areas, significantly shorter than the average of 17.51 minutes at formal healthcare facilities, and 48 minutes at government hospitals, according to the 2022 HIES data.\nHowever, pharmacies do not have medically trained professionals who are licensed to diagnose patients. Nor are they pharmacists, as they do not hold a formal degree in pharmacy.\nTo standardise the retail pharmacy sector, the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) launched a novel concept in 2016 called model pharmacies, consisting of accredited pharmacies that comply with DGDA-recommended and health ministry-approved standards. Requirements include 300 sq-ft of floor space, an air-conditioning system, a pharmacy-grade refrigerator, a graduate pharmacist, etc.\nWhile the initiative sounded very promising, media reports revealed that many of the model pharmacies were involved in various irregularities, such as non-compliance with the DGDA guidelines for drug sales and the absence of registered pharmacists. It has also been found that pharmacies without the DGDA approval use the logo of model pharmacy at their shops and mislead consumers. The DGDA lacks adequate manpower to properly monitor these irregularities.\nIn the absence of a well-functioning primary healthcare system, the proposition is to leverage the existing pharmacies and transform them into comprehensive points of care for a primary healthcare system. Despite the current shortcomings of the model pharmacies, lessons can be learnt from a thorough evaluation. If the DGDA collaborates with other wings of the health ministry and the local government bodies in formulating a comprehensive policy and guidelines, along with strict monitoring and regulation, there is a potential to create a robust primary care system.\nConverting even 10 percent of the 200,000 registered pharmacies into comprehensive primary care centres could result in 20,000 such facilities in urban areas, which would result in a better ratio than one clinic per 6,000 people ratio in rural areas. As pharmacies are already the most popular choice for seeking treatment, transforming them would require minimal resources compared to launching new dedicated primary care centres.\nSolving the primary care gap can go a long way in ensuring health equity for all citizens of the country and the country's ambition of attaining Universal Health Coverage status by 2032.\n\nMohammad Ihtesham Hassan is research associate at the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC).\n\u00a0\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.
