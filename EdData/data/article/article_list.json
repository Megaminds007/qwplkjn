        "full_article": "The Election Commission of India (ECI)\u2019s explanation on December 24 in response to the Congress party\u2019s charges regarding voter turnout data in the recent Assembly elections is unlikely to allay growing concerns regarding the integrity of the election process. It was on December 20, on the recommendations of the ECI, that the Centre had amended the Conduct of Election Rules to restrict public access to poll documents except for those that are specifically mentioned in them. The ECI has also said it does not want to share CCTV footage of the booth, citing privacy and security reasons. This change in the rules happened after the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the ECI to share all documents related to the Haryana Assembly elections, including CCTV footage, to a private citizen. The court ruled that this was permissible under 93(2) of the Rules which allowed public access to all \u201cpapers\u201d which were not specifically barred. The amended rule now says that only those \u201cpapers\u201d that are specified in it are open to public inspection. For an institution that is so central to the functioning of democracy, and yet facing an unprecedented challenge to its credibility, less secrecy and more transparency must be the way forward. Sadly, the ECI is falling short on this count, and damaging its own credibility.Allegations of electronic tampering of voting machines are misplaced and misguided but concerns regarding the conduct of elections \u2014 police high-handedness, partisanship of local administration, and voter suppression through various means \u2014 are valid. They require a thorough and impartial investigation. Of particular concern is the dramatic rise in voter turnout in the final figures, compared to what was announced at the end of polling time, noticed in recent elections. The ECI may well be right in saying that voters who are in queue at the closing hour get recorded only in the final figures. But the easiest and perhaps the most credible way to establish this claim is to allow wide inspection of the relevant video footage. The ECI has explained that the candidates have access to all documents, papers and records and nothing has been amended in the rules in this regard. It remains unclear how its officials will deal with requests from candidates for records including video footage while the public will face a default denial in most cases. The privacy and security arguments are weak if candidates can access records anyway. In effect, the change in rules does not solve any problem that the ECI says it does, other than time and effort. And it has raised more questions about the ECI\u2019s intentions.\r Published - December 25, 2024 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Election Commission of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Indian National Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Haryana Assembly Elections 2024\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        voting\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        judiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        investigation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Right to Privacy",

        "full_article": "A U.S. court\u2019s decision holding an Israeli company liable for surreptitiously installing Pegasus, a spyware suite, on the phones of targeted individuals through WhatsApp, has brought the focus back on the Centre\u2019s questionable inaction when such surveillance allegations surfaced in India in 2021. The U.S. District Court for Northern District of California ruled that NSO Group Technologies violated both federal and State laws against computer fraud and abuse. WhatsApp sued the NSO Group in October 2019, alleging that its system was used by the Israeli company to plant malware on approximately 1,400 mobile phones and devices for surveilling their users. In a summary judgment, the court agreed with WhatsApp that its application had been reverse-engineered or \u2018decompiled\u2019 to create a modified version called \u2018WhatsApp Installation Server\u2019 or WIS. In the backdrop of this ruling, the question that arises in India is about the fate of reports submitted by a court-appointed expert committee in 2022 to the Supreme Court of India. The then Chief Justice of India (CJI), N.V. Ramana, had read out a few paragraphs from the report of the panel\u2019s overseeing judge, Justice (retired) R.V. Raveendran. The report said the Technical Committee found no conclusive evidence on the presence of Pegasus, but there was some kind of malware in five out of the 29 phones examined. The reports are yet to be made public.\rEven if there was no effective hearing or follow-up action, what cannot be forgotten is that CJI Ramana had observed in open court that the government did not cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation. It was conduct typical of the Modi regime, which has repeatedly demonstrated that silence, denial and obfuscation form its stock responses whenever allegations emerge. It showed no interest in probing disclosures that the phones of journalists, activists, doctors and court staff were targets of spyware. It made a strange claim that the country had such ironclad laws that illegal surveillance was not possible. It adopted the untenable position that acknowledging that its agencies possessed any particular software would jeopardise national security. All this, despite admitting in Parliament that it was aware of some users being targeted by Pegasus through WhatsApp. It did not respond to credible reports that Pegasus may have been used to plant evidence on computers to frame dissidents. In the light of a judicial decision, albeit an overseas one, that the NSO Group is liable for the use of its spyware by its clients, solely government entities, the time has come for sealed reports to be opened and deeper probes begun. The government should come clean on whether it possesses surveillance software. Otherwise, citizens will be rendered even more vulnerable to illegal surveillance.\r Published - December 25, 2024 12:08 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        judiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pegasus surveillance\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Israel\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        mobile phones\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        technology (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        investigation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Narendra Modi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        parliament\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        national security\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        software",

        "full_article": "In films & other artforms, avant garde influences commercial creative outputs, makes them better\nThose who routinely, mournfully ask where the new Satyajit Ray is, or Bimal Roy or Kumar Shahani or Mrinal Sen, will now also ask where the new Shyam Benegal is. IPTA and eighties parallel cinema are two influences particularly storied among Indian film aficionados. It may also be true that, for example, Do Bigha Zameen, Bhuvan Shome, Manthan and Khayal Gatha, are unfamiliar to a majority of audiences today. Even in their own times, many of these texts may have lived as \u2018high art\u2019, which the masses stayed away from. But judging their value by the box office alone is a fool\u2019s game.\u00a0\nCreativity isn\u2019t mathematical. Sensitivity to the human condition is a complex civilisational inheritance. Think about a selfie and van Gogh\u2019s self-portraits. To ask which is better is no crime. But what\u2019s really interesting about the comparison is stopping to think about how the two work, to debate their form and meanings. It is contemplation and conversation that carry culture forward. Payal Kapadia, whose All We Imagine as Light is a Cannes Grand Prix winner, has spoken about how Ritwik Ghatak\u2019s Subarnarekha shook her up, its editing, its script, its scene constructions. This is how influence jumps across time. Neither is the diversity that has come to define OTT content unconnected from the storytelling that was once bracketed as art cinema.\u00a0\nActually, this is true across the arts. Those who aren\u2019t exactly attempting the Great Indian Novel still benefit from those who have. There are directors who persuaded Birju Maharaj to choreograph for their movies, including Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Kamal Haasan. But the influence of kathak on the picturisation of song and dance in Indian cinema is vastly greater. It\u2019s the same with classical music. Its pop impact is immeasurable. It\u2019s impossible to think of a desi song cabinet that owes nothing to Hindustani or Carnatic or Qawwali styles. Of course, none of this stops at national borders. We are hearing Beethoven\u2019s F\u00fcr Elise all the time, even if we don\u2019t know we are hearing it.\u00a0\nOne thing is that the greats may not be well judged in their own times. Take Keats \u2013 ironically of the \u201cA thing of beauty is a joy forever: its loveliness increases; it will never pass into nothingness\u201d fame. It\u2019s said very bad reviews hastened him to an early death. How tastes evolve is impossible to predict. But that the good lifts up the average is certain.\u00a0\n\n",

It was as though I were hearing music not through my ears, but my palate, an edible melody of sweet, and tart, and spice, blending in perfect harmony.\u00a0\nWhen we were in Calcutta, Bunny would begin to make preparations for the cake in mid-Nov, its recipe an eclectic ensemble culled from several cookery books.\nWe\u2019d go to the New Market to buy the almonds and walnuts, bittersweet orange peel, ruby red glace cherries, jade green angelica, and the currants and raisins and sultanas which, along with butter, and eggs, and sugar and flour, would go to make several large cakes.\u00a0\nThe fruit would be steeped in generous measures of rum, and left to soak till the first week of Dec, when the batter would be made, ladled into tins, and put in the oven to bake, filling our flat with an ambrosial aroma.\u00a0\nThe cakes would emerge golden-brown and faintly hissing as they cooled, as though in inviting impatience to be eaten there and then.\u00a0\nMy mother was much taken by what she called \u201cChristmas prasad\u201d, but being a strict vegetarian she couldn\u2019t taste it. So Bunny found a way to make an eggless cake, which was met with enthusiastic approval.\nWhen we moved to the NCR cooking, including that of Christmas cakes, perforce took a back seat to Bunny\u2019s hectic career in advertising.\nFortunately for us, with the true generosity of Yuletide, friends and well-wishers have ensured we\u2019ve never had a cakeless Christmas. Our chef friend, Crescentia, has given us one of her cakes, David and Pat have sent us theirs from Dehradun, and Derek and Tonuca have despatched one made by Nahoum\u2019s, the legendary 120-year-old Jewish bakery in Calcutta. And as it should be, each of these imparts its own distinct flavour to the togetherness of taste that is Christmas.\nHave a marvellous Christmas, one that truly takes the cake.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Advanced safety features in cars are no good without user awareness\u00a0\nCar airbags seem like soft, fluffy cushions until you\u2019ve been in a crash. Powered by an explosive, they expand at speeds touching 320 kmph \u2013 faster than a jet taking off. For an adult, airbag impact is painful, sometimes bruising. For a child, it can be fatal, as happened in Mumbai\u2019s suburb Vashi on Saturday night. Six-year-old Harsh Arethia was in the front passenger seat of his father\u2019s car when its airbags deployed in a freak low-speed collision that left the other occupants more or less unharmed. Doctors said Harsh had no external injury and may have died of shock and haemorrhage caused by airbag impact. On Sep 29, a two-year-old travelling in her mother\u2019s lap in Kerala was smothered by an airbag. A week earlier, another two-year-old travelling in a car\u2019s front passenger seat had died of airbag injuries in Ukraine.\u00a0\nThe takeaway is not that airbags are dangerous, but that a car\u2019s front row is no place for kids, especially now when all new cars come fitted with airbags. It\u2019s been only three years since two airbags became mandatory in Indian cars, so maybe the message has not seeped in. Seatbelts and helmets \u2013 mandatory for decades \u2013 are yet to become universal habits. But it\u2019s also true that public messaging about airbag risks is lacking: adults in the front row can also be severely hurt if they don\u2019t wear seatbelts.\u00a0\nOf late, talk about road safety has centred on vehicle features \u2013 stronger shells, more and more airbags, cameras, AI. But last week\u2019s accident, in which a container truck crushed a sturdy SUV near Bengaluru and killed its six occupants, shows this survivalist mindset in which each man or woman is only as safe as their cocoon-on-wheels is deeply flawed. There\u2019s no substitute for awareness and road sense.\n\n",

Trump\u2019s victory revalidates nationalist politics everywhere, and his decision to use tariffs against any country that runs a huge trade surplus is affirmation of mercantilist policies. The world will see a continuation of the trend towards partial de-globalisation, mercantilism and messier trade relations in 2025. Bilateralism, or deals between geopolitical blocs, will be the way of the future.\nDespite Trump\u2019s rhetoric on tariffs, India will discover more opportunities than negatives, so long as it\u2019s prepared to play the game by Trump\u2019s rules.

On December 22, he was reportedly beaten and forced to wear a garland of shoes around his neck by a group of Jamaat activists and supporters\u2014two of whom were later expelled from the party. The group also ordered him to leave the district by nightfall. Following the incident, a video surfaced on Facebook showing two individuals dragging Abdul Hai while he was wearing the garland. We must say, such indignity for a freedom fighter is an affront to not just the person himself but also all freedom fighters and the very ideals of our Liberation War. This heinous act has rightly sparked outrage and demands for justice.\nFifty-three years after our liberation, it is unimaginable that our freedom fighters\u2014whose sacrifices brought us to where we are today\u2014could still be subjected to such treatment. Following the incident, Abdul Hai fell ill and is now receiving treatment at a private hospital in Feni. He expressed his frustration asking, \"For whom did I fight to achieve the country's independence? Certainly not to wear a garland of shoes like this.\"\n\nIt is encouraging to see various socio-political groups, including BNP, protest the incident. The chief adviser's office has also condemned it, directing the police and local administration to launch an investigation. So far,\u00a0police have arrested five individuals in this connection.\u00a0This sends a positive signal that such incidents will not be tolerated.\nThe Liberation War of 1971 is the most significant event in our history. It was a people's war, and those who fought in it should be the most honoured individuals in our country. Regrettably, we have fallen short in extending the respect they deserve, as evidenced by the public humiliation of Abdul Hai. Over the decades, our nation has often failed to meet the expectations of the Liberation War, and we must hold our political leaders accountable for not fulfilling people's dreams and aspirations. However, this does not justify tarnishing the spirit of the Liberation War in any way\u2014certainly not by assaulting a freedom fighter.\nIt is encouraging to see various socio-political groups, including BNP, protest the incident. The chief adviser's office has also condemned it, directing the police and local administration to launch an investigation. So far,\u00a0police have arrested five individuals in this connection.\u00a0This sends a positive signal that such incidents will not be tolerated in an independent country. Going forward, we must be more vigilant and prevent any repeat of such humiliation for freedom fighters or other symbols of our independence struggle.\n",

        "full_article": "As researchers studying air pollution, we've encountered fascinating yet troubling observations about people's perceptions regarding environmental crises. Despite growing evidence and alarming statistics, many Bangladeshis continue to hold onto misconceptions about air pollution, what causes it, who it affects, and how it impacts health.\nAir pollution in Bangladesh has reached critical levels, posing serious health risks, particularly to children and senior citizens. Yet, public awareness remains frustratingly low, and many dismiss the issue altogether. This is not simply a lack of information; it's a problem rooted in myths and outdated beliefs that prevent meaningful action.\n\nToday, many still view air pollution as an urban problem, confined to bustling cities like Dhaka, while rural areas are perceived as untouched havens of clean air. Others blame seasonal illnesses or external factors, such as vaccines, for respiratory problems, completely overlooking the role of chronic exposure to harmful pollutants like PM 2.5, sulphur, and lead. And perhaps most concerning of all is the widespread dismissal of indoor air pollution, despite its growing threat in poorly ventilated homes and workplaces. It's time to replace myths with facts, challenge outdated beliefs, and confront the invisible threat that's already affecting our health and future.\nOne of the most widespread myths in Bangladesh is that air pollution is only an urban problem. Many people assume that the countryside, with its lush green fields and open spaces, is free from the toxic haze that hangs over cities like Dhaka. This misconception is deeply rooted in the visible sources of pollution like factories and construction dust which are concentrated in urban areas.\nHowever, this myth could not be further from the truth. Rural areas are equally affected by air pollution, albeit in ways that are less visible but just as harmful. From the smoke of brick kilns to the burning of crop residues, rural pollution contributes to the same deadly air quality. And let's not forget that pollution doesn't care about borders; it travels across countries and vast distances. No area is immune from the harmful effects of pollution, whether it's the smog-filled streets of Dhaka or the quiet, dusty lanes of the countryside.\nAs the season changes many of us start experiencing shortness of breath and the \"seasonal flu\" or a harmless \"winter cough.\" While the weather does play a role, the underlying cause of these respiratory issues is not simply the change in seasons, but the constant exposure to harmful air pollutants.\nTiny particles known as PM 2.5 and PM 10, along with gases like sulphur and lead, linger in the air, causing long-term damage to the lungs and respiratory system. These particles are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, where they can cause everything from chronic coughs to more severe conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and even heart disease. This is common science. So, while a little cough during the change of seasons might seem normal, persistent respiratory problems are more likely the result of chronic exposure to poor air quality, not just a passing flu.\nSince the pandemic, another myth has taken hold: that the COVID vaccine is responsible for the rise in respiratory problems. Many people believe that the vaccine has damaged the lung functions and is causing persistent coughs, fatigue, and breathing difficulties. While the vaccine may have had some side effects for a very small group of people, the widespread rise in respiratory problems cannot be attributed to it, especially not without evidence.\n\nBangladesh has been grappling with poor air quality for years, and respiratory issues like coughing and shortness of breath have been on the rise long before the pandemic began. So, blaming the vaccine for health issues that have been building up over time misses the larger point: air pollution is the true threat to our lungs.\nOne of the most dangerous myths about air pollution is the idea that it only matters if you can see it. If the air looks clear, then it must be safe, right? This belief is especially common in areas where smog or heavy pollution is not immediately visible. Pollution doesn't always present itself in visible form. Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), which is among the most harmful pollutants, is so small that it's invisible to the naked eye. These tiny particles can easily enter your lungs and bloodstream, causing significant health issues. So, just because you can't see pollution doesn't mean it isn't there. On the contrary, it's likely lurking in the air you're breathing.\nIndoor air quality can often be far worse than outdoor air, especially in homes where cooking, smoking, or the use of certain household products is common. In many Bangladeshi households, traditional cooking methods such as burning wood, cow dung, or coal release harmful pollutants like particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Without proper ventilation, these pollutants accumulate indoors, creating a toxic environment for those living there. In fact, indoor air pollution can sometimes be as bad as outdoor pollution levels, making it just as hazardous, if not more so. So, the idea that staying indoors protects you from pollution is not only false\u2014it could be putting your health at greater risk.\nOverwhelming evidence shows that air pollution has far-reaching consequences, impacting nearly every aspect of our lives. It leads to deaths from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, harms children's health, reduces workplace productivity, and even affects cognitive ability. Emerging research also links air pollution to mental health issues, sleep disturbances, and so forth.\nThese misguided beliefs prevent meaningful action, keeping people unaware of the true risks and long-term health effects. It's time to confront the reality of air pollution head-on. By understanding that pollution affects everyone\u2014indoors and out, urban and rural\u2014we can make informed choices to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and future generations.\nLet's challenge these myths, embrace the truth, and work together to breathe cleaner, healthier air.\nAARM Mehrab Ali is the founder and executive director of ARCED Foundation. \n\nSadia Sumaia Chowdhury is the senior programme manager at ARCED Foundation.\nShirsha Songshoptak is a research assistant at ARCED Foundation.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We welcome the long-overdue official conversation on legislating protection for journalists in Bangladesh. The chief of the Media Reform Commission recently announced plans to recommend a new law to safeguard journalists, as well as amending 32 existing laws that hinder press freedom. Such initiatives are critical if we want a media industry that can truly serve as the fourth pillar of democracy, holding those in power accountable.\nAt a recent dialogue in Dhaka, the commission chief also underscored the importance of financial security for journalists, advocating for a minimum floor wage applicable nationwide. This statement coincides with the unveiling of findings from a Broadcast Journalist Center (BJC) survey that revealed that over half of the country's TV channels are failing to pay their employees on time, while at least 20 percent owe workers several months' salaries. The survey also found that less than 25 percent of channels provide provident funds, and only 10 percent offer gratuities. Similar challenges plague many print outlets as well. Alarmingly, especially outside Dhaka, journalists often have to juggle multiple roles\u2014as reporters, ad procurers, and salespeople\u2014leaving them vulnerable to corruption and exploitation.\nPhysical security remains another major concern. Reports of journalists facing attacks\u2014sometimes fatal\u2014while pursuing their work are far too frequent. We cannot forget the tragic death of Golam Rabbani Nadeem, district correspondent of Banglanews24.com and Ekattor TV, who was beaten to death after reporting on a local upazila parishad chairman's activities in Jamalpur. Equally haunting is the unresolved case of journalist couple Sagar Sarowar and Meherun Runi, who were murdered in their home 12 years ago, with justice still eluding their families.\nIn addition to these risks, journalists also face job insecurity. According to the BJC survey, at least 150 TV journalists lost their jobs this year alone. Expecting journalists to uphold high standards under such conditions is not only unrealistic, but also inhumane. This is why we applaud the Media Reform Commission's initiative to address these systemic issues. Reforms must ensure that the press is free from government interference and undue influence from powerful entities. Introducing a uniform code of conduct, aligned with international best practices, could help promote ethical and high-quality journalism.\nSuch measures are crucial to fostering a media landscape capable of holding power to account. We eagerly await substantive reforms that will enable journalists to thrive professionally and contribute to a more transparent, accountable society. Independent, fact-based journalism benefits everyone\u2014and its sustainability depends on the authorities' commitment to ensuring journalists' well-being.\n",
