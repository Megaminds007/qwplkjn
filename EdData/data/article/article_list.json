The abhorrent violence, including repeated incidents of sexual violence against tribal women in the State, should have brought the government and the Opposition together; instead, they are unable to even debate the issue. The Opposition has insisted that any discussion must begin with a statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who would not commit to that. Home Minister Amit Shah said the government was willing to discuss the issue and sought the cooperation of the Opposition, which saw the outreach as an attempt to shield Mr. Modi. The Opposition has now moved a no-confidence motion against the government as a way of forcing Mr. Modi to speak on the issue. Considering how he has responded until now, that might be a bit too optimistic. The discussion on the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha is likely to be a continuation of the obfuscation of the issue by the BJP and the persistent demand by the Opposition. Meanwhile, in the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition continues to demand a discussion followed by a statement by the Prime Minister.The demand for a comprehensive statement by the Prime Minister is legitimate, but the Opposition must understand that it serves no purpose if the outcome is no discussion. It must seize whatever opportunity it gets for a discussion in Parliament, and take the protest to public places outside. The BJP\u2019s response to the horror in Manipur has been to equate it with crimes in Congress-ruled States, which is difficult to sustain. For moral and strategic reasons, the turmoil in Manipur is a threat to the country\u2019s security, integrity, and social harmony; it is a threat that calls for national unity. It is a sad moment in Indian democracy that its politics remains partisan even in the face of such human suffering, ethnic violence and the breakdown of law and order in a sensitive border State. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge has written to Mr. Shah saying that the government cannot be seeking the Opposition\u2019s cooperation while the Prime Minister is likening it to extremist outfits. Labelling critics as anti-national or unpatriotic may be politically convenient, but this predictable response in the BJP toolkit is turning out to be an impediment to national unity. It is time Mr. Modi called for healing in Manipur, reassured the scared victims of the State and set an example by holding the perpetrators accountable. And there is no better place than Parliament to make it all clear to the country and the world.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nsexual assault & rape\n\n/\n\nRajya Sabha\n\n/\n\nLok Sabha",

But the Fund\u2019s marginal 20 basis points upgrade to its April projections, which were released in the wake of the banking failures, and concerns at the time about the then yet-to-be-resolved U.S. debt ceiling standoff, does little to provide reassurance that the world economy is out of the woods. As the IMF\u2019s chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas cautioned on Tuesday, \u201cmany challenges still cloud the horizon... while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside\u201d. That risks abound, both known and unsighted, would be an understatement. For starters, the two largest economies, the United States and China, have slowed down appreciably and face increased uncertainty amid global and domestic headwinds. In the U.S., the surpluses from pandemic-era cash transfers, made to help families tide over the distress wrought by COVID-19 and the cost-of-living crisis in its aftermath, have all but depleted. China\u2019s post-reopening rebound has begun to fizzle out, with the economy floundering on the shoals of a contraction in the key real estate sector, combined with weakening consumption and slumping overseas demand for its exports.The euro area, another key engine of the global economy, is still reeling from the Ukraine-war induced spike in gas prices with momentum decelerating especially in the largest regional economies of Germany and France. Eurozone business output fell at the fastest rate for eight months in July, S&P Global\u2019s latest HCOB flash PMI survey showed this week. Worse, deteriorating forward-looking indicators flag the likelihood of the region\u2019s downturn deepening in coming months. And with inflation, particularly core inflation, remaining well above central banks\u2019 targets, policymakers may be left with little option but to stay the course on inflation-taming but demand-retarding monetary tightening. Russia\u2019s termination of the Black Sea grain deal could also push up grain prices by as much as 15%, Mr. Gourinchas warned, affecting some low-income economies in Africa. The IMF economist also pointed to the heightened debt vulnerabilities among many frontier economies and stressed the urgent need for a concerted global debt resolution initiative to help highly indebted countries from sliding into debt distress. Ultimately, the world\u2019s economic leaders must realise that lopsided growth, that bypasses the vulnerable nations, risks having the weakest links weighing down the larger global economic edifice in an interconnected world.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n \nbanking\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nreal estate\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nAfrican Union\n\n/\n\nSwitzerland\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

It led to some wistfulness over social media and questions on the business wisdom of Twitter\u2019s current owner Elon Musk. Twitter, of course, will continue. But the commentary over the change in logo brought the power of brands into sharp focus. A logo is a visual representation of what a brand hopes to embody. Tinkering with it, a mere symbol, and not the underlying business, was enough to spark uneasiness among users.\nBrands take years to build. It may be a little different in the digital age as the idea of time seems to have been compressed. Little surprise then that the top four global brands in consultancy Brand Finance\u2019s 2023 rankings are technology companies. The top five brands, beginning with Amazon, are all from the US. It\u2019s an indicator of the level of sophistication and competitiveness of the world\u2019s largest economy. Brands also point to where the world\u2019s moving. The 2023 rankings have two from East Asian economies, Samsung and Tik Tok, which have leapfrogged several venerable European brands.\nA successful brand represents durable acquisition of a customer\u2019s mental real estate. For a business, it represents an intangible asset often worth more than tangible ones \u2013 Apple is a \u201cfactoryless\u201d manufacturer. Brands are not limited to just business. Yoga and Indian food embody the richness of Indian culture and are vehicles of soft power. However, they are old legacies. What of more contemporary Indian brands? Fittingly, for an intellectual culture that created the numeral zero, IITs and IIMs are brands in themselves. But they are outcomes of institution building by the state and not comparable to a commercial brand.\nA notable gap in the post-1991 economy is the inability of any business brand to transcend national boundaries. Information technology firms, the ones who compete in a global marketplace, deal mainly with other businesses. Mass brand recognition comes from directly reaching the end-consumer. Here, there\u2019s a lesson to be learnt from the UK. An iconic British car, Jaguar, evokes a lot of online passion from enthusiasts. Its intangible benefits accrue to the UK, in the form of a positive perception. That\u2019s ironical, as the brand\u2019s owner, Tatas, is headquartered in Mumbai. But then, that\u2019s the power of brands.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It was only the other day that we commented on an incident in Natore in which five cops allegedly tortured three men in custody, leading to the local court asking the police authorities to file a case against the officers responsible. While a court's intervention on behalf of helpless victims is laudable, the truth is, bereft of institutional accountability, it is hardly a deterrence against police excesses, which have been occurring with frightening regularity in the country. The latest to be reported by the media occurred at the Pallabi area of Mirpur, Dhaka, where Baishakhi Akhter, aged 16, allegedly took her own life after police attempted to detain her mother during a raid.\nThere have been contrasting claims about what really happened. Police allege that the family ran a drug business and that the aim of the raid on their home was to \"recover narcotics.\" But the family denied these allegations. Our concern is not about whether the family had any criminal history, but what happened after the so-called raid and whether police were somehow responsible for the tragedy that followed. According to Baishakhi's family, the police team demanded bribe from them during the raid, and also assaulted mother and daughter before hauling the latter off to a room where, locked from outside, she threatened and subsequently committed suicide.\nThe truth of the matter will only come out if a thorough investigation is conducted. However, from what has been reported, several facts stand on their own: 1) police conducted the \"raid\" in plain clothes; 2) a young girl killed herself during the raid; and 3) something happened during the raid that prompted it, leading to angry protests by locals. These facts are enough to indicate foul play at some stage of the raid. The picture that emerges from these and other reports \u2013 as well as the history of police involvement in extortion using the well-worn excuse of narcotics possession \u2013 is once again a reminder that beyond token disciplinary measures, not much is being done to ensure accountability of the errant members of this vital force.\nIn the past, we have often seen how the authorities tried to discredit allegations of police misconduct by citing the supposed crimes of the accused/victims. But in the eyes of law, everyone, regardless of their history, deserves to be treated with dignity and given a fair chance to be heard in a court of law. But it is because of the continued tolerance of such vigilante-style raids \u2013 using the cover of plain clothes \u2013 that these principles stand violated, and that people find it hard to trust police. In these columns, we have also often raised concerns about corruption, the use of excessive and lethal force, custodial death and torture and other such extrajudicial actions which have created fears among ordinary citizens. Our concerns were further vindicated when, in February,\u00a0eight United Nations rapporteurs raised objections against excesses of Bangladesh law enforcement agencies to the government.\nThe higher authorities must take these concerns seriously.\u00a0We also urge them to ensure a fair investigation into the Baishakhi tragedy and bring anyone responsible to book. Unless they take proper steps in such cases, public trust in police may never be restored.\n",

        "full_article": "Social protection is an important component of the national budget in Bangladesh, which essentially aims to improve the welfare of vulnerable citizens. Identifying the pitfalls of the social protection system and realising the importance of improving it to meet certain objectives, Bangladesh adopted the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) in 2015. Thereafter, it was agreed that the recommendations of the NSSS will be implemented through medium-term five-year plans and annual economic plans, such as the national budget. Based on this, the analysis for the social protection budget should ideally be carried out in line with the NSSS.\nReforms outlined in the NSSS fell under two broad categories: programmatic reform and institutional reform. On the other hand, the reforms may also be considered from equity and efficiency lenses. The proposal to cover 50-60 percent of vulnerable citizens, increase social protection expenditure to three percent of GDP, and enhance transfer values to reflect the needs of beneficiaries originate from an equity perspective. Improvement of the payment system (such as G2P), installation of an MIS system, establishment of a single registry, and digitisation of data are some of the proposals adopted in the NSSS on grounds of efficiency. Improvement of the beneficiary selection (that is, minimising the exclusion and inclusion errors) covers both equity and efficiency.\nHow does the social protection budget for the 2023-24 fiscal year fare when analysed through the lenses of equity and efficiency?\nAllocation and equity\n\nThe government has allocated Tk 126,272 crore, around 7.4 percent more than last year's social protection allocation of Tk 113,576 crore. However, in terms of GDP, the allocation in FY2023-24 is 2.52 percent \u2013 which falls short of the NSSS target of three percent of GDP. This is a disturbing development. The Tk 126,272 crore allocation may be considered as gross allocation, since it includes a number of items which are not usually categorised as social safety net items. These include pensions for retired government employees and their families, interest payments for national savings certificates, agriculture subsidies, interest subsidy for SMEs, and allocation for health risk and natural shock management. Together, these constitute around 59 percent of the total social protection budget allocation for FY2023-24. In other words, the net social safety allocation for vulnerable citizens is only around 41 percent of the social protection budget. This amount was around 64 percent of the gross allocation in both FY2020-21 and FY2021-22. But a significant drop occurred in FY2022-23 by about 18 percent, and by 23 percent in FY2023-24. Again, the declining trend in net allocation is a serious cause of concern.\nAnother important observation is that, due to rural to urban migration, poverty and vulnerability have been shifting to urban areas in Bangladesh. However, the social protection system is not keeping pace with this development. As a result, the coverage gap (the difference between poverty rate and social safety expenditure) has widened for the urban poor in Bangladesh. The government must use the social protection allocation to reduce these gaps and establish parity in social safety budget allocation between rural and urban areas.\nBeneficiary selection and efficiency\n\nBangladesh's social safety system is still beset with myriad exclusion and inclusion errors, reflecting the inefficiency in reaching out to deserving beneficiaries. To remedy this, the NSSS recommended establishing a single registry system (that is, a comprehensive database of existing and potential beneficiaries), a robust management information system (MIS), and a grievance filing mechanism. Progress has been slow on all these fronts. In particular, the country has neither established a single registry system, nor installed a robust MIS. The National Household Database (NHD) was initiated by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) with support from the World Bank to prepare a comprehensive household-level database. However, NHD's fate is still unclear. Even if it is now made available, the database would have lost its relevance due to demographic transition (or dynamism) and large income growth. Meanwhile, the criteria used for beneficiary selection were prepared in 2013 and are still in use, raising serious concern about their usefulness due to their lack of dynamism and adaptability.\nSince it is more or less accepted that the NHD has failed, it was expected that for the FY2023-24 social protection budget, the government would have rectified its position regarding the NHD by discarding it and experimenting with new alternatives that would be home-grown and less expensive. In this context, it should be mentioned that under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Covid-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) programme, and in collaboration with the Department of Social Services (DSS), a pilot community-based targeting and selection process (CBTSP) was carried out in two unions in Bangladesh between March and April 2023. Only two programmes \u2013 old age allowance and widow allowance \u2013 were considered. In terms of selection efficiency, the pilot CBTSP produced encouraging outcomes suggesting that, with community involvement, it is possible to better identify beneficiaries for social protection programmes. And following focused group discussions, social mapping, transact walks, and dedicated household surveys, it would be possible to prepare a master beneficiary list and separate beneficiary lists for most of our social safety programmes.\nAlso, allowing private participation in social protection could improve efficiency, coverage, and lessen burden on the national budget. A modern and balanced social protection system is composed of three pillars: social assistance (SA), social insurance (SI), and active labour market programmes (ALMP). When SI and ALMP are active, private sector participation increases. However, both these pillars are underdeveloped in Bangladesh.\nAs is apparent, both equity and efficiency have been ignored while formulating the FY2023-24 social safety budget allocation. Unless measures are included to improve equity and efficiency, the benefits of the social protection budget will continue to be low. The government may consider some solutions in this regard.\nFirst, it must commit to enhancing net social safety allocation to around three percent of GDP. The social protection budget should be used to ensure parity in allocation across rural and urban areas and across all age groups.\nSince the NHD is not functional, the government must look for an alternative beneficiary selection approach. The CBTSP approach may be an important source of information to prepare an evidence-based social protection budget, which is likely to improve selection, reduce leakage, and improve value for money. However, in order to assess its robustness and scale it up at the national level, the CBTSP may be conducted in eight upazilas spread over four regions \u2013 north, south, east, and west \u2013 to allow assessments and inclusion of regional characteristics.\nAdditionally, the criteria used for beneficiary selection for social safety programmes need complete overhauling. Hence, there is a need not only to update them but also include periodic automatic updates in line with economic expansion. The government must also ensure balance between the three social protection pillars to generate maximum benefits and ensure private sector participation.\nDr Bazlul Haque Khondker\u00a0is chairman at South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem) and former faculty member of the University of Dhaka.

        "full_article": "The signals coming from the streets are very concerning. Our two biggest political parties might be heading towards greater violence with the focus firmly on tomorrow's rallies at the moment. While both sides express their determination to not trigger any violence themselves, they seem more than willing to jump into the fray if the \"other side\" provokes it. And, as we have seen in the past, there will always be an \"other side\" to blame if it happens.\nThe tragedy of the situation is that regardless of endless talks about avoiding violence, neither side will make any concession that can ensure it. Leaders of both parties know in their hearts that, without compromise, there is no way to stop violence, and yet no leader will publicly even hint at such a possibility without any clearance from the top. And so far, there has been no hint of that.\nWe have criticised the ruling party for always trying to hold rallies on the same day as the opposition does, but to no avail. In tomorrow's case, it is going to be the same as Jubo League, Swechasebak League, and Chhatra League have all shifted their programmes to coincide with that of the BNP. The aim of the ruling party appears to not let BNP be physically present on the streets of the capital without ensuring its own simultaneous presence \u2013 the logic being that if BNP is allowed any open play, it will get some advantage from which it cannot be dislodged later. So, prevent it before it happens! It is quite uncertain how far this goal of the ruling party can be implemented with any serious occurrence of violence as BNP will have to be contested every time it plans an event. The ruling party's suspicion has been further fed by BNP's calling for two major demonstrations in such quick succession.\nWhatever may be the goal of the two sides, the general public cannot but be worried about how the rising tensions between the two will affect their lives. It can almost be assumed that shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, daily workers, etc may have to forego at least a day's earnings for tomorrow's events, assuming that there is no violence, police assault, arrest or death.\nWe express our serious concern about the way political events are unfolding in the country. The constant exchange of invectives, the growing violent tendencies on both sides, and the diminishing chance of a peaceful settlement have created uncertainty about the prospect of a peaceful transition towards the coming polls. More and more, our passage towards the polls appears to be strewn with violence which is turning people away from the most crucial of democratic exercises \u2013 casting their vote. This cannot bode well for our democracy.\n",

The picture that emerges from these and other reports \u2013 as well as the history of police involvement in extortion using the well-worn excuse of narcotics possession \u2013 is once again a reminder that beyond token disciplinary measures, not much is being done to ensure accountability of the errant members of this vital force.\nIn the past, we have often seen how the authorities tried to discredit allegations of police misconduct by citing the supposed crimes of the accused/victims. But in the eyes of law, everyone, regardless of their history, deserves to be treated with dignity and given a fair chance to be heard in a court of law. But it is because of the continued tolerance of such vigilante-style raids \u2013 using the cover of plain clothes \u2013 that these principles stand violated, and that people find it hard to trust police. In these columns, we have also often raised concerns about corruption, the use of excessive and lethal force, custodial death and torture and other such extrajudicial actions which have created fears among ordinary citizens. Our concerns were further vindicated when, in February,\u00a0eight United Nations rapporteurs raised objections against excesses of Bangladesh law enforcement agencies to the government.\nThe higher authorities must take these concerns seriously.\u00a0We also urge them to ensure a fair investigation into the Baishakhi tragedy and bring anyone responsible to book. Unless they take proper steps in such cases, public trust in police may never be restored.\n",

        "full_article": "The signals coming from the streets are very concerning. Our two biggest political parties might be heading towards greater violence with the focus firmly on tomorrow's rallies at the moment. While both sides express their determination to not trigger any violence themselves, they seem more than willing to jump into the fray if the \"other side\" provokes it. And, as we have seen in the past, there will always be an \"other side\" to blame if it happens.\nThe tragedy of the situation is that regardless of endless talks about avoiding violence, neither side will make any concession that can ensure it. Leaders of both parties know in their hearts that, without compromise, there is no way to stop violence, and yet no leader will publicly even hint at such a possibility without any clearance from the top. And so far, there has been no hint of that.\nWe have criticised the ruling party for always trying to hold rallies on the same day as the opposition does, but to no avail. In tomorrow's case, it is going to be the same as Jubo League, Swechasebak League, and Chhatra League have all shifted their programmes to coincide with that of the BNP. The aim of the ruling party appears to not let BNP be physically present on the streets of the capital without ensuring its own simultaneous presence \u2013 the logic being that if BNP is allowed any open play, it will get some advantage from which it cannot be dislodged later. So, prevent it before it happens! It is quite uncertain how far this goal of the ruling party can be implemented with any serious occurrence of violence as BNP will have to be contested every time it plans an event. The ruling party's suspicion has been further fed by BNP's calling for two major demonstrations in such quick succession.\nWhatever may be the goal of the two sides, the general public cannot but be worried about how the rising tensions between the two will affect their lives. It can almost be assumed that shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, daily workers, etc may have to forego at least a day's earnings for tomorrow's events, assuming that there is no violence, police assault, arrest or death.\nWe express our serious concern about the way political events are unfolding in the country. The constant exchange of invectives, the growing violent tendencies on both sides, and the diminishing chance of a peaceful settlement have created uncertainty about the prospect of a peaceful transition towards the coming polls. More and more, our passage towards the polls appears to be strewn with violence which is turning people away from the most crucial of democratic exercises \u2013 casting their vote. This cannot bode well for our democracy.\n",

        "full_article": "The budget announced by the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) for the fiscal year 2023-24 on Monday last is certainly not an ambitious one. It has increased by just Tk2.20 billion from Tk50.49 billion in the previous fiscal, 2022-23. Given the depreciation of taka, the allocation in real term this time would be less than the previous fiscal's. Of the Tk52.69 billion budget, Tk18.30 is likely to come from its revenue income, Tk 147.5 million from other sources and the larger share is expected in the form of aid and assistance from the government and external sources. The indication is clear that the city corporations have to look to the greater contribution, estimated in case of the DNCC at Tk23.89 billion, from foreign aid and assistance for development projects. There are miles to go before the municipalities and city corporations in Bangladesh garner enough revenue income to overcome dependence on foreign aid. Sure enough, the income stands to be augmented significantly if illegal toll collection from and undervaluation of some key sources such as the three bus terminals, property and infrastructure can be done away with and the city corporations' valid revenue income ensured. Also, it is highly important to use the allocations for pragmatically prepared development projects. When footpaths, median strips of roads and traffic islands in perfect conditions are repaired or redesigned with bricks of different sizes and shapes or railings no matter if such acts involve mayhem of trees, those are strangely passed as development work or beautification. This happens at a time when roads, lanes and by-lanes with potholes and in deplorable conditions elsewhere are overlooked year after year. There is no dearth of excuses for wasting money in the name of flimsy development projects to the neglect of uniform development of all areas in the city.Donors and aid agencies are tightening their fists following the worldwide economic downturn. The emerging situation demands that every available dollar or taka is spent prudently. In this context, the allocation of Tk 1.14 billion the DNCC has proposed to spend on eradication of mosquitoes may once again go down the drain. Tk 450 million of that amount will be used only for pesticides. Now the question is, what kind of chemical compounds they will be. Organophosphates and adulticides are used in the USA for controlling mosquitoes. On his return from a visit to the US, the mayor of Dhaka North categorically stated fumigation is a futile exercise. Will he waste more money on fumigation or procure organophosphates and adulticides to fight mosquitoes and dengue under a coordinated programme? However, the DNCC deserves appreciation for setting aside Tk2.2 million for plantation and nurturing of 0.20 million saplings in the next two years. What is particularly pleasing is that saplings of indigenous trees like chhatim (blackboard tree, scholar tree, milkwood and devil's tree), bakul (bullet wood), kath badam (almond), krishnachura (flamboyant), sonalu (golden shower) will adorn the median strips and footpaths of DNCC roads. Neem (Indian lilac), Sonajhuri or akashmoni (acacia) and naglingam (cannonball) are well qualified to be added to the list. Equally appreciable is the plan to plant indigenous fruit trees on the banks of canals reclaimed from grabbers. But excavated canals' maintenance matters and those yet to be reclaimed have to be taken up for restoring their free flow of water. A heated up capital city could not do with less.",

        "full_article": "Wang Yi, the senior Chinese diplomat, is back in his old job as his country's foreign minister. He replaces his successor Qin Gang, who was in the job for slightly over six months. In the past few weeks, there has been no news of Qin, which is not surprising given the historical opacity that has characterised important appointments and departures in Beijing's political hierarchy. The top job in diplomacy, in any country nowadays, is an important undertaking. In China, Marshal Chen Yi served as foreign minister for a good number of years in the 1960s. Prior to that, Zhou En-lai was both prime minister and foreign minister at a formative stage of communist rule in Beijing. By that measure, Qin Gang's presence in the foreign ministry was all too brief.Conversations on foreign ministers in modern times are often part of the historical narrative. Long-serving foreign ministers have often had an impact on the development of their countries' links with the rest of the world. Take, for instance, Andrei Gromyko, who after a stint as ambassador to the United States went on to serve as Soviet foreign minister for decades, all the way from Nikita Khrushchev to Mikhail Gorbachev. Not until Gromyko was elevated to the presidency of the Soviet Union did the country have a new foreign minister in Eduard Shevardnadze.And, of course, Sergei Lavrov has been foreign minister of the Russian Federation for a good many years and in this position has been presenting a strong defence of his country in the councils of the world. Some foreign ministers have been unfortunate, to the extent that they have lost their lives at the hands of the governments they served. SadeghGhotbazadeh took charge as Iranian foreign minister following the Islamic revolution. In the event, he did not survive long in that position. Removed from office by the clergy, he was soon executed by the regime.In India, Jawaharlal Nehru served, in addition to be being prime minister, for nearly the entirety of his days in power carrying out responsibilities as minister for external affairs (that was how foreign ministers were referred to in India at the time). SardarSwaran Singh was for a number of years foreign minister under Indira Gandhi. An unfortunate instance of an Indian foreign minister unable to perform to his full capacity was K. Natwar Singh, who was forced to resign in the oil-for-food scandal during Saddam Hussein times.Pakistan has had an interesting cycle of foreign ministers. Choudhry Muhammad Zafrullah Khan served as the country's first foreign minister before moving on to serve at the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Later, in the Ayub Khan era, he was president of the United Nations General Assembly. President Ayub's first foreign minister was the lawyer ManzurQuadir, who was later succeeded by former prime minister Mohammad Ali Bogra. When Bogra died in January 1963, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, minister for industries and natural resources, took over as the new foreign minister.Bhutto was forced to resign in mid-1966 when he publicly began to raise questions about the Tashkent Declaration signed by Ayub Khan and Indian prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. He was succeeded by Syed SharifuddinPirzada, who in turn was replaced by Mian Arshad Husain, Pakistan's high commissioner to India. Bhutto's stint as foreign minister was remarkable for the shift toward China which Pakistan initiated, a clear move away from its membership in such US-influenced regional associations as CENTO and SEATO.A formidable foreign minister in the Cold War era was Indonesia's Subandrio. With him in charge of diplomacy --- and Ahmed Sukarno was president --- Indonesia developed extremely close relations with China. The Suharto coup put paid to that relationship, with Jakarta making a complete turn away from Beijing. Subandrio remained in prison for a long number of years. Under Suharto, Adam Malik took over as Indonesia's foreign minister, performing his responsibilities with dexterity. Carlos P. Romulo was a respected foreign minister of the Philippines, much admired for his diplomatic skills. The same could not be said about George Brown, the erratic politician who for a time served as Britain's foreign secretary under Harold Wilson. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister in 1963, later would serve as foreign secretary in the government of Edward Heath. Sri Lanka's scholarly foreign minister LakshmanKadirgamar was killed in a sniper attack in 2005. Meanwhile, the mystery of the death of Czechoslovak foreign minister Jan Masaryk's death has never been fully explained. Masaryk, the son of Czechoslovakia's first president Thomas Masaryk, was in office as foreign minister from 1940 to 1948. He was found dead in the courtyard of his office, dressed in his pajamas. In Bangladesh's history, KhondokarMoshtaq Ahmed, the first foreign minister (and that was during the War of Liberation), was stopped by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad from travelling to the United Nations, where he had been expected to speak for the country, in September 1971. It had transpired that in New York he would reverse government policy and advocate a political settlement with Pakistan. Independent Bangladesh's first foreign minister was AbdusSamad Azad. Following the election of March 1973, Dr. Kamal Hossain, the law minister, took over as foreign minister. Hossain played an instrumental role in securing Bangladesh's admission into the United Nations in September 1974. Hossain, who was in Europe on official visits when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated, did not return home despite Moshtaq's entreaties. His place as foreign minister was then taken over by former president Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury, who only days before the 15 August tragedy had been inducted into the cabinet as a minister without portfolio by Bangabandhu. America's top diplomats, otherwise officially referred to as secretaries of state, have had a mixed history. Dean Acheson under President Truman played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of Europe as well as a reshaping of US foreign policy in a post-war world. In the Eisenhower administration, John Foster Dulles cheerfully helped in a shaping of policy that would exacerbate tensions around the world. President Kennedy's secretary of state, Dean Rusk, was in charge of a department where the views of the man in the White House mattered. Rusk went on being part of the Johnson administration right till the end. His successor in the Nixon administration, William P. Rogers, was unfortunate in that he was from day one upstaged by Henry Kissinger, the national security advisor. Kissinger secretly went to China in July 1971 and Rogers was kept in the dark about it. In September 1973, Rogers was eased out of his position for Kissinger to take over as secretary of state. Qin Gang's departure or dismissal is but an instance of the pitfalls foreign ministers often stumble into. Conversely, men like Israel's foreign minister Abba Eban knew how to navigate their way through the woods, diplomacy their yardstick of skills. It's all a mixed bag. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Aparajita has a tidy appearance. Wearing a brown jacket over a black shirt, she looks human. She even sounds human. But last week she was introduced as the first television presenter in Bangladesh who is a robot run by artificial intelligence. \"Viewers, I, Aparajita, am welcoming you. I'm here at Channel 24 as the first artificial intelligence presenter in the television industry of Bangladesh,\" she says in Bangla. The four-minute video has already generated a flood of reactions on social media. Some praised the virtual presenter as an innovation, while others expressed their concern about using AI in the newsrooms. A heating debate is now going on whether AI news presenters will one day take over the job of human news anchors. Aparajita is not the only virtual newsreader in the world. In 2018, China became the first country in the world to use AI news anchors, with a pair of suit-clad men delivering a bulletin for China's state-run Xinhua news agency -- one speaking Chinese and the other English. Indian media outlets now have around half a dozen AI news presenters. The increasing use of AI in newsrooms surely poses a threat to human news presenters' job. According to a report published by Goldman Sachs, AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs around the world. The report also suggests that the technology may also mean new jobs and an increase in productivity.Broadcasters in Bangladesh will surely consider using AI presenters as they are incredibly efficient. They never need to take breaks or rest, which means they can work round the clock. They can bring the news in the middle of the night with no holidays and no salary. This means more contents can be created at a faster pace. Moreover, AI presenters are able to deliver content in multiple languages, which can help TV channels to reach a wider audience. Another advantage of using AI presenters is that they can be customised to fit any show. Like human presenters, AI newsreaders do not need expensive makeup, wardrobe or hair. However, one thing is for sure that AI presenters lack the human touch that the audience expects. They are not able to express emotions or reactions in the same way humans can. This can make them seem robotic. Additionally, AI presenters lack improvisational skills that human presenters have, which can be crucial during live TV situations. Technical glitches can also ruin AI presenters' performance. AI technology is still in its early stages. So, there is always a risk that something could go wrong during a live broadcast. While it is still unclear whether or not AI broadcasters will actually replace human ones, it is certain that the technology is advancing rapidly. And it is possible that we may see more AI presenters in the near future, especially as newscasters. However, it is unlikely that AI presenters will completely replace human counterparts anytime soon. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

They need health care facilities at their doorsteps. In this case, upazila health complex (UHC) can serve them the best. However, it is unfortunate that most of these complexes have been suffering from an acute shortage of doctors, nurses, medical assistants, pharmacists, general officers and staff. More than half of the posts of physicians and other staff have been lying vacant for long at these health care units. Many doctors are not interested in serving at these UHCs. If we want to provide our rural people with better health care facilities, we must focus on our UHCs. These complexes should be modernised and converted into 250-bed general hospitals. They should have doctors' chamber, doctors' room, patients' wards, nursing station, diagnostic centre, storehouse, operation theatre and administrative buildings. Residential building for doctors, nurses, paramedics, medical assistants and general staff should be arranged. And it will encourage the physicians and other staff to work in these UHCs. These complexes should also be equipped with necessary medical equipment and instruments so that all diagnostic tests could be conducted there. Also, the fees of diagnostic tests should be affordable for most village people. \nMd Ashraf Hossain 120, Central Bashabo, Dhaka-1214, [email\u00a0protected]",
