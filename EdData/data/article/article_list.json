The attacker, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an American citizen who had served in the military, was killed in a shoot-out. Police found an Islamic State (IS) flag and explosives in his truck. Just hours earlier, Jabbar had posted videos on social media, indicating that he was inspired by the IS. In recent months, the IS, a terrorist organisation founded in Iraq and Syria, and now present across geographies, has released propaganda videos asking its \u201csoldiers\u201d to strike during celebrations in western cities in the holiday season. A few hours after the New Orleans attack, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, killing at least one person and injuring several. Police later said Jabbar, the suspected New Orleans attacker, did not act alone, and are investigating any potential link between the truck attack and the cybertruck explosion.The IS, which lost its physical Caliphate in Iraq and Syria, has been trying to revive its lost fortunes. The terror group survived as an insurgency, shifted its centre of operations to Afghanistan (Islamic State-Khorasan), where it carries out attacks, targeting the country\u2019s Shia minority, and opened new networks in Africa. When the IS was at its peak in 2014-15, it had successfully globalised terror \u2014 any sympathiser could hold the IS flag, declare loyalty to the \u2018Caliph\u2019 and unleash attacks against the \u201cinfidels\u201d. World cities, from Dhaka to Orlando and Istanbul to Belgium, witnessed dozens of IS-inspired attacks. These have ebbed, partly due to the destruction of the IS \u2018caliphate\u2019 and partly due to enhanced security measures and deradicalisation programmes. But now that Syria is in transition following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime, the IS is trying to rebuild itself. Kurdish fighters in Syria\u2019s east, who played a pivotal role in defeating the Islamists in 2015-16, say IS militants have looted government weapons\u2019 depots and are preparing for a comeback. The New Orleans attack should serve as a warning signal for the U.S. The IS should not be allowed to regain a foothold in conflict-ridden West Asia. Besides, the U.S. should also get to the roots of the radicalisation of American citizens and counter it. Organisations such as the IS should be fought with both force and ideas.

        "full_article": "Amidst signs that New Delhi and Dhaka are trying to resolve other issues that have marred their ties in the last few months, the issue of Bangladesh\u2019s demand that India extradite Sheikh Hasina remains intractable, with neither side budging. In December, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri was able to convey during his Dhaka visit, that India remains a friend. He also reaffirmed the continuity in ties in trade, energy, infrastructure and connectivity; the two sides appear to have calmed the situation at the border as well. Finally, the government indicated to a parliamentary committee that while Ms. Hasina remains in Delhi as India\u2019s guest, it had no truck with her political pronouncements and messages targeting Mr. Yunus. The situation seemed to shift last week, as Bangladesh sent New Delhi a \u201cnote verbale\u201d or diplomatic missive demanding Ms. Hasina\u2019s extradition to face trial for cases that include corruption, and a Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal charge that she had perpetrated \u2018crimes against humanity\u2019 in ordering a police crackdown on student protesters. The India-Bangladesh extradition treaty of 2013, amended in 2016, sets out the course of procedures quite clearly, which needs to be pursued through a more formal representation from Bangladesh to India. The note verbale appears to be meant only to assuage domestic political constituencies, while India\u2019s External Affairs Ministry\u2019s response \u2014 not rejecting it outright \u2014 seems to be a non-escalatory way of dealing with the situation.While the legalities of the request can be the subject of protracted negotiations, it is important to ensure that the issue does not hold India-Bangladesh relations hostage. The Yunus government must understand that the history of India\u2019s relationship with Ms. Hasina and her family is forged in the sacrifices made in both countries for the liberation of Bangladesh. The assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and members of her family in 1975, and her first exile in India, strengthened the bond. It is futile to expect that India would simply hand Ms. Hasina over, when she has sought refuge here, and no amount of coercive pressure could force an Indian government to comply. The decision to shelter the Dalai Lama in 1959, for example, has not wavered despite Chinese pressure. Furthermore, bringing Ms. Hasina to account is not the mandate of the interim regime, and should be pursued by a government duly elected by the Bangladeshi people. In Delhi, there must be a recognition that the actions of Ms. Hasina\u2019s government have scarred the nation. The fact that she is making political statements with ease from Indian soil is likely to embitter ties and New Delhi must conduct a full cost-benefit analysis of how helpful these statements are. Given the consequences of a tense border and geopolitical turmoil, both countries must learn to deal with the issue diplomatically \u2014 in a separate silo from other aspects of their important relationship.

        "full_article": "Terrorist tactics are evolving. Security forces everywhere must gear up\nNew Year\u2019s car attack on a New Orleans street that left 15 dead again shows the limits of old ways against terror. All the sniffer dogs and 3D scanners in the world fail when everyday objects become projectiles and battering rams. Doctors say dose makes a poison; it\u2019s now clear that intent makes a bomb. It happened when terrorists flew planes into the twin towers, and when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a 20-tonne truck into a crowd in Nice, France, in 2016, killing 86 and injuring over 300. That same year, Anis Amri drove a truck laden with steel beams into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 49. And we\u2019ve seen the familiar plot play out twice over the past fortnight \u2013 in Magdeburg, Germany, where Taleb al-Abdulmohsen killed five and injured over 200 with his car at a Christmas market, and again with Shamsud-Din Jabbar\u2019s killing spree on New Orleans\u2019 Bourbon Street two nights ago.\nSome will pounce upon the perpetrators\u2019 names as an indictment of their faith. It\u2019s not faith that links them, it\u2019s a toxic idea \u2013 terrorism. Let them note that Abdulmohsen, a Saudi doctor living in Germany since 2006, is a self-professed atheist who allegedly pushed conspiracy theories about Germany\u2019s project to Islamicise Europe. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel and Amri were Tunisian but Jabbar was a Texas-born US citizen and army veteran who had served in Afghanistan. Yet, the Ford pickup he drove into the holiday crowd had a black Islamic State (IS) flag pinned to its tail. When Lahouaiej-Bouhlel and Amri declared allegiance to IS, the group was seen as a threat to West Asia. But its ability to indoctrinate in 2025 should worry the incoming Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, Jabbar\u2019s attack only furthers MAGA\u2019s nativist agenda. If a non-white, US-born citizen can\u2019t be loyal to the country, can settlers be trusted, they are likely to argue. And you can see that only leads to more racial abuse for and resistance to \u201coutsiders\u201d, regardless of whether they are from West Asia or India.\n9/11 was a turning point for America. It tightened the security screws so well that for a long time there was no terror attack on its soil, but it does not have a shield against cars-turned-missiles. Nor does India, which has enjoyed more than a decade of calm after a spate of blasts and gun attacks in the 1990s and 2000s. Terror is a globalised enterprise, and what happens in Germany or US may happen here. Prepare now, or be caught in the next car\u2019s headlights.\n\n",

        "full_article": "56% of govt schools don\u2019t have computers for students. This is terrible prep for the AI era\nLast year, on Artificial Intelligence Appreciation Day, the skill development ministry talked up India\u2019s emerging status as \u201ca global AI powerhouse\u201d. What the new UDISE+ data underlines is that such ambitions rest on worryingly weak moorings. Computer and internet facilities are only available in 57.2% and 53.9%, respectively, of the country\u2019s schools. A massive cohort of students isn\u2019t even being rudimentarily equipped for full participation in a rapidly changing global economy.\u00a0\nThe digital chasm is widening very much along class lines \u2013 44% of govt schools, 70% of govt-aided and 71% of private unaided schools have a functional computer facility for pedagogical purpose. But between govt schools, there is wide variance by geography, presumably because of the governance that comes with it. Only 11%, 18% and 21% of govt schools in Bihar, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh provide the above facility. There is variance within the richer, southern states too. Karnataka founders with 33% while Kerala rocks with 99%. Point is, govt after govt really needs to haul up computer access. Because in depriving students of this basic building block, it\u2019s unconscionably mucking up their personal and professional futures.\nWarnings about digital illiteracy have been coming in from other directions as well. A composite digital adoption index scores govt much higher in India but people and business far lower than in countries like US. An Aser survey finds that around 50% of rural youth who use social media cannot do basic safety tasks like changing a password or blocking a profile. What kind of development gap will today\u2019s digital schooling gap mean tomorrow? What\u2019s certain is that the upshot will be terrible, or worse. Surely the world\u2019s fifth largest economy has the resources to computerise all its schools, and the understanding that this is an essential investment.\u00a0\n\n",

I was eager to meet someone whom I greatly admired and respected. Yet, for these very reasons, I was loth to take up his valuable time with my visit.\nThe host was to receive not one but two visitors that winter morning, myself and my columnist colleague, Bachi. The Times Group had just published collections of our TOI columns, and someone had organised the meeting, which included a photo op of Bachi and me, with our books, standing by our host.\nAs elegant in her attire as in her prose, Bachi wore a stylish sari for the occasion. I had on an anorak that had seen better days. You could have put on something a bit smarter, said Bachi. I feel cold, and this is the warmest thing I have, I said in defence.\nWe arrived at our host\u2019s residence and were ushered into his presence. After a fluster of greetings, we were served tea. Cup and saucer perched nervously in my lap, I tried to think of something to say which wasn\u2019t irredeemably inane.\nI needn\u2019t have worried. In his characteristic soft and gentle manner, our host put us at ease, making us welcome guests and not impositions foisted on him by the noblesse oblige of protocol.\nHe spoke lightly and without the slightest hint of grievance about the weight of work, the adversarial headwinds he faced. What seemed to burden him the most was the inconvenience caused to the public by the security arrangements made whenever he went out. As a result, he voluntarily curtailed his visits to family and friends.\nIt was then that I pinpointed the singular quality that I\u2019d sensed in our host: the most uncommon quality of all, that of common decency.\nIn an age of cynicism and the unabashed arrogance of power, decency was like finding the welcome shade of a tree in a scorched wasteland, a spring in arid desolation.\nIt was this sense of an innate decency that I brought back from my first, and last, meeting with Manmohan Singh.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are concerned about the ongoing cold wave that has brought hardship and suffering across the country. Reports from various regions show how plummeting temperatures, combined with chilly winds and dense fog, are disrupting daily lives, livelihoods, and transportation. Weather forecasts indicate that the cold weather may persist throughout January, with moderate to severe spells expected to affect large parts of the country intermittently. What this means for the poor and low-income groups\u2014who must venture outdoors for work but are least equipped to do so\u2014is not hard to understand. This is yet another reminder of how extreme weather conditions, whether cold or hot, disproportionately impact the vulnerable in our society.\nIn Dhaka, where temperatures plunged on consecutive days, the impact has been equally severe. While many have stayed indoors over the weekend, many others suffered under the open sky or in poorly insulated homes and shelters. There was no respite for low-income workers, such as rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors, either. Many were also seen to light makeshift fires under flyovers or in open spaces to stay warm. They were battling not just discomfort but also serious health risks. Reportedly, there has been a surge in cold-related illnesses\u2014including pneumonia, respiratory infections, and diarrhoea\u2014with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) reporting a 25 percent increase in paediatric cases of diarrhoea compared to last year. Even deaths have been recorded.\n\nIn Dhaka, where temperatures plunged on consecutive days, the impact has been equally severe. While many have stayed indoors over the weekend, many others suffered under the open sky or in poorly insulated homes and shelters. There was no respite for low-income workers, such as rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors, either. Many were also seen to light makeshift fires under flyovers or in open spaces to stay warm. They were battling not just discomfort but also serious health risks.\nHospitals in the northern districts have similarly reported a spike in cold-related illnesses. The situation in this region has been particularly punishing for both humans and animals, with Panchagarh's Tetulia recording the country's lowest temperature of 8.3 degrees Celsius on Friday morning. Clearly, these vulnerable regions, and those most exposed to the cold in other areas, require special attention. The immediate priority is to intensify relief efforts including the distribution of blankets and warm clothing among the poor. It is reassuring to learn that 679,000 blankets have been allocated from the Chief Adviser's Relief Fund for distribution, while approximately Tk 33 crore has been allocated by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief to purchase additional blankets. These efforts, along with volunteer initiatives by citizen groups, will need to be expanded if the cold weather persists as forecasted.\nIt is vital that all relief efforts are streamlined and coordinated to ensure that aid reaches those who most need it. During the recent floods, we saw how uncoordinated efforts exacerbated victims' suffering instead of alleviating it. Such disorganisation must not recur this time. As the cold deepens, our collective response must rise to meet the challenge.\n",

        "full_article": "Urban Bangladesh lacks a well-functioning primary healthcare system. Currently, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, through its Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), operates 35 urban dispensaries nationwide. Additionally, the Local Government Division runs a public-private partnership (PPP) model under the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCP) in selected areas across the country.\nThe need for a well-functioning and structured primary healthcare system with nationwide coverage is paramount. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), primary care can meet around 80-90 percent of a person's lifetime health needs. If unaddressed, the problems due to inadequate primary healthcare in urban areas are only likely to worsen, exacerbated by the ever-increasing urban population and the consequent increased demand for healthcare.\nConsider the situation in Dhaka city. People come from all over the country to the hospitals here, which are often overburdened with patients and operate at overcapacity, struggling to provide quality care. Patients frequently face difficulties, such as limited accommodation, extended waiting times, and transportation hurdles due to late-night commutes.\nOne of the major problems in the current healthcare system is the lack of an effective referral system and inadequate gatekeeping at tertiary care facilities. Barring emergency care and referrals from lower-tier health facilities, patients should not visit hospitals as they are meant to provide tertiary-level care. However, due to the lack of primary healthcare centres\u2014and perhaps also due to the lack of awareness\u2014patients are often left with no choice but to visit tertiary-level hospitals, further burdening these facilities. Patients should have primary care centres close to their homes. The community clinic model in rural areas aims for one clinic for every 6,000 people, trying to mitigate pressure across these facilities.\nUrban health-seeking patterns present a more complex scenario. While hospitals remain crowded with patients, data from the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) shows that pharmacies are the most frequented healthcare providers. Findings of the 2010, 2016, and 2022 HIES all show that pharmacies consistently emerge as the preferred choice, with 53 percent of healthcare seekers choosing them in 2022, whereas, 11 percent preferred visiting qualified doctors' chambers, the second-most-used option.\nSo why are pharmacies so frequently preferred? Firstly, pharmacies are easily accessible and closer to people's residences, as there are 200,000 registered and over 100,000 unregistered pharmacies across the country. Secondly, the average waiting time to access care at pharmacies is 8.22 minutes in urban areas, significantly shorter than the average of 17.51 minutes at formal healthcare facilities, and 48 minutes at government hospitals, according to the 2022 HIES data.\nHowever, pharmacies do not have medically trained professionals who are licensed to diagnose patients. Nor are they pharmacists, as they do not hold a formal degree in pharmacy.\nTo standardise the retail pharmacy sector, the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) launched a novel concept in 2016 called model pharmacies, consisting of accredited pharmacies that comply with DGDA-recommended and health ministry-approved standards. Requirements include 300 sq-ft of floor space, an air-conditioning system, a pharmacy-grade refrigerator, a graduate pharmacist, etc.\nWhile the initiative sounded very promising, media reports revealed that many of the model pharmacies were involved in various irregularities, such as non-compliance with the DGDA guidelines for drug sales and the absence of registered pharmacists. It has also been found that pharmacies without the DGDA approval use the logo of model pharmacy at their shops and mislead consumers. The DGDA lacks adequate manpower to properly monitor these irregularities.\nIn the absence of a well-functioning primary healthcare system, the proposition is to leverage the existing pharmacies and transform them into comprehensive points of care for a primary healthcare system. Despite the current shortcomings of the model pharmacies, lessons can be learnt from a thorough evaluation. If the DGDA collaborates with other wings of the health ministry and the local government bodies in formulating a comprehensive policy and guidelines, along with strict monitoring and regulation, there is a potential to create a robust primary care system.\nConverting even 10 percent of the 200,000 registered pharmacies into comprehensive primary care centres could result in 20,000 such facilities in urban areas, which would result in a better ratio than one clinic per 6,000 people ratio in rural areas. As pharmacies are already the most popular choice for seeking treatment, transforming them would require minimal resources compared to launching new dedicated primary care centres.\nSolving the primary care gap can go a long way in ensuring health equity for all citizens of the country and the country's ambition of attaining Universal Health Coverage status by 2032.\n\nMohammad Ihtesham Hassan is research associate at the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC).\n\u00a0\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Not long ago, we wrote about why workers deserve a better deal in today's Bangladesh owing not only to their contribution in the July uprising but also to the fact that they have received the smallest share of whatever economic progress has been achieved over the decades, despite being its main drivers. Workers, particularly those in labour-intensive industries, are often deprived of their due benefits and rights, such as the right to workplace safety. This has been once again confirmed by a study by the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS) that says that at least 707 workers were killed in workplace accidents in 2024. Among them, transport workers accounted for the highest number of fatalities (273), followed by those in agriculture (102), construction (91), rickshaw pullers (43), migrant workers (38), and day labourers (32).\nIn comparison, 2023 had seen slightly higher fatalities, with 742 deaths. The BILS study has identified road accidents, roof collapses, electrocution, fires, cylinder explosions, and trawler or boat capsizing as the leading causes of workplace deaths. Many, including fishermen, also died or went missing during natural disasters. Unfortunately, this state of precarity has been persistent throughout the past decade that claimed over 8,000 lives in total\u2014with 2019 and 2021 going down as the deadliest years. The relative decline in numbers in more recent years is not due to any positive shift in industrial policies and practices, however.\nThe question is, how much longer will workers have to wait for meaningful changes that ensure their safety? When, if ever, will the authorities address the systemic neglect that allow such tragedies to persist? One sector where this neglect has been most glaring is shipbreaking, which recorded nine deaths last year. This doesn't adequately portray the danger lurking in shipbreaking yards, as workers there routinely face hazardous conditions, inadequate safety measures, and exposure to toxic materials. A recent views-exchange event organised by the BILS in Chattogram's Sitakunda\u2014where such yards have collectively witnessed 129 fatalities since 2015\u2014brought out their appalling conditions.\nSpeakers, for example, highlighted the prevalence of unskilled, noncompliant contractors, who often obtain licenses through dubious means, as well as the lack of protections and proper wages for workers. They also expressed concerns about the occurrence of accidents in so-called \"green shipyards\", questioning how they receive certification without ensuring workers' rights and safety. They also raised alarm about the non-implementation of the minimum monthly wage of Tk 16,000 set in 2018. The persistence of such issues, which are by no means restricted to the shipbreaking industry, shows how workers are still being treated as expendable despite their critical role in driving our economy.\nThis needs to change. Our industries, both formal and informal, must undergo a radical transformation in how they approach workers' rights, including workplace safety and decent wages. It is imperative that the government not only ensures the implementation of existing safety regulations and wage structures but also introduces stronger mechanisms for worker representation, fair investigations, and transparency in industrial practices. Otherwise, this cycle of preventable workplace tragedies will continue to claim lives.\n",
