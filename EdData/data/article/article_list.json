This happens to him whenever he has to meet any man alone. This fear is deep-rooted in his childhood experience of being sexually abused by his uncle repeatedly. He has never been able to disclose this to any family member, and worries that his cousins too have had similar experiences of abuse by the same perpetrator. Recently, he disclosed the incident to a colleague who advised him to seek counselling to heal from the trauma.\nStories like the above remind me of the book Why I Didn't Say Anything, written by former ice hockey player Sheldon Kennedy. In 1996, Kennedy shocked the Canadian hockey world by announcing that his former minor-league coach, Graham James, had sexually abused him more than 300 times. The media portrayed Kennedy as a hero for breaking the code of silence. James eventually pled guilty to the charge that he abused Kennedy, and was convicted of sexually abusing several of the players he coached in the 1990s. Kennedy's revelations contributed to increasing abuse awareness in sports, and in society. His story has resonated around the world. He gave many others the courage to come forward, and he has supported numerous programmes of awareness and recovery from abuse in the 25 years since he told the truth about his days in junior hockey.\nMany people believe that children are usually abused by strangers, and only girls are abused. However, experience from different parts of the world suggests that the abuser is usually a relative or someone known to the child, and that both men and women can be perpetrators. Sometimes, older children (boys and girls) may also abuse younger children. Boys or girls of any age, from any socioeconomic background, in urban and rural areas, are at risk. Child sexual abuse happens in many different ways, which can range from inappropriate touching to rape. Children are abused in all settings\u2014homes, schools, playgrounds, workplaces, institutions, etc.\nMost of the cases of child sexual abuse remain unreported, and the likelihood of the abuse being unreported is higher in the case of boys. Researchers have found that at least one in six men have experienced sexual abuse or assault, whether in childhood or as adults. This is supported by scientific research, including a study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is likely an underestimate of the actual prevalence, as it does not include non-contact experiences, which can also have lasting negative effects.\nPerpetrators use their greater size, strength and knowledge to manipulate or coerce boys into unwanted sexual experiences. This is usually done from a position of authority or status (e.g. coach, teacher, older cousin, admired athlete, community or religious leader). They gain children's trust by showing attention and giving special privileges (e.g. money, gifts), and then become close enough to abuse them. Sometimes, children get confused and do not even understand what is happening to them. Many fear that they will be blamed for this and remain silent.\nMen who have experienced sexual abuse as children are at a much greater risk of serious mental health problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, alcoholism and drug abuse, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, problems in intimate relationships, and underachievement at school and at work.\nGender stereotyping affects both men and women negatively. For example, many boys/men are engaged in unhealthy and risky behaviours (e.g. smoking, drinking alcohol, crossing speed limit while driving) that are harmful for their lives. This is rooted in masculine gender socialisation, which depicts men as strong\u2014physically and emotionally. Boys receive these messages from family, society, media, etc. repeatedly. The myth on masculinity implies that a boy or man who has been sexually abused will never be a \"real man.\" Society expects men to be able to protect themselves. Successful men are depicted as never being vulnerable. As a result of all these, boys find it very challenging to speak out when they are sexually abused.\nThere are also legal ambiguities regarding the sexual abuse of boys and men in Bangladesh, which should be addressed immediately. As of now, the country's laws define rape as a gender-specific crime\u2014committed by a man against a woman who is not his wife. This archaic definition allows perpetrators of male sexual abuse to evade justice. Alongside a long-term campaign to make the law more inclusive, the following could also be done to protect children (both boys and girls) from sexual abuse.\nParents should explain that if somebody does or wants to do something with the children or their bodies that s/he does not want, they can say \"no\" (starting from the slightest touch to tickling, hugging, etc). Parents should notice if the child wants to avoid a particular person. If yes, they should try to understand the reasons and must not force the child to interact with him/her. Children should be informed that it is the perpetrator who has done something totally unacceptable; the child is never to be blamed for any incident of abuse.\nParents should not show that they are alarmed, overreact, ask too many questions or punish the child if they suspect an incident of abuse. Underestimating the incident or taking the side of the perpetrator must be avoided. If needed, medical, counselling and legal services should be offered to the child.\nThe parent-child relationship is very important when it comes to responding to and preventing child sexual abuse. Children will only feel comfortable in expressing themselves if they feel confident in communicating with their parents without fear.\nParents should raise children in a way that they do not feel confined by gender stereotypes, which will free boys from the burden of being \"strong\", and will also contribute to protecting them from abuse. The media can play an important role in promoting positive images regarding gender roles. The social stigma and silence around the sexual abuse of boys/men result in a lack of awareness and understanding about the long-term negative impacts of these experiences, and what men need to move forward. It is time to break the silence and take actions.\nLaila Khondkar is an international development worker.\n",

        "full_article": "When Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar briefed floor leaders of 31 parties in Parliament on August 26 on the developments in Afghanistan, he faced some searching questions about New Delhi's policy, actions and future strategy towards Afghanistan, post-Taliban takeover.\nThe meeting was aimed at generating a national consensus on a vital foreign policy and national security issue for India. By all accounts, the government and opposition parties have been able to set aside their recent face-off over the Pegasus spyware, farm sector laws and handling of the second wave of Covid-19 when it came to dealing with the Afghan developments.\nJaishankar made it clear that India's top priority right now is the evacuation of all Indians from Afghanistan, which is already well underway. India has been allowed to operate two flights per day from Kabul and more than 600 people, including 565 Indians, have so far been brought back. However, evacuations have been slowed by the volatile security situation in and around Kabul airport, whose control is divided between the Taliban forces and the US. In turn, the opposition lawmakers asked how many Indians are still stranded and how New Delhi planned their repatriation after the August 31 deadline.\u00a0\nQuestions were also asked about how the Indian government views the situation in Afghanistan, what options it has with the Taliban dispensation and how New Delhi intends to pursue the visa regime for Afghans, irrespective of their religious identities, who feel unsafe or fear persecution under Taliban rule. Two key issues that came up were: did India hurriedly shut down its embassy in Kabul and consulates in Herat, Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar by pulling out all Indian staff, and could it have waited a little longer?\nJaishankar made a robust defence of the closure of Indian diplomatic missions\u2014his comments came just hours before powerful blasts rocked Kabul airport, resulting in scores of casualties. The minister pointed to the past when the Indian embassy in Kabul had been attacked thrice, and consulates multiple times, by terrorists. In view of the deterioration of the situation in recent weeks, India-based personnel were withdrawn from Indian consulates in Herat and Jalalabad. In June this year, India scaled down its diplomatic presence in Kabul and issued four advisories in the last three weeks asking Indian citizens to leave Afghanistan.\nAnother important question was if India would recognise the new Taliban regime, and if so, when. The participants in the meeting also wanted to know\u2014what is the future of about 500 India-funded development projects in all 34 provinces in Afghanistan?\nOpinion is divided on whether India should engage with the Taliban. Since the Taliban are the only de facto authorities in Afghanistan, should India not hold a dialogue due to its deep economic interests in that country, and for safeguarding Afghans of Indian origin? This, it is felt, becomes all the more important because India has no diplomatic presence there. India chose to close down its embassy in Kabul even when the US, European countries, China, Russia and Iran had not done so. The US and European countries have shifted their diplomatic missions to Kabul airport primarily to facilitate the evacuation.\nOn these questions, Jaishankar told the August 26 meeting that India was in wait-and-watch mode and would not rush to a decision. This is primarily due to acute uncertainty on the ground in Kabul, and differences within the Taliban and within the international community over the contours of a new government in Afghanistan. Besides, he underlined, the situation in Afghanistan was critical and there was no clarity as to how long the US will stay in that country. He indicated that there was \"some coordination\" with the \"local authorities\" in Kabul for the limited purpose of evacuation of Indians, but declined to elaborate, obviously for security reasons.\nSome analysts in India noted a significant development when the UN Security Council on Saturday night skipped any reference to the Taliban from a paragraph in its statement that called on Afghan groups not to support terrorists \"operating on the territory of any other country\". India's former Permanent Representative Syed Akbaruddin was the first to point this out on his Twitter handle. It may be recalled that India is the president of the UNSC for August, and signed on the UNSC statement and issued it in its capacity as chair, in what is seen as an indication that India would not like to be seen as going against the international community when it came to recognising the Taliban. Jaishankar remarked that India's only long-term interest is the friendship of the Afghan people. But to secure and sustain that friendship built over the last two decades under non-Taliban rule, India needs to engage with whoever holds the levers of power in that country in future.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, the Taliban too came out with its first outreach to India on Saturday. In a video message in Pashto circulated on the social media accounts of the Taliban and Afghanistan's Milli TV, the deputy head of the Taliban office in Doha (Qatar), Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, said India is \"very important for this sub-continent\" and that his group wanted Afghanistan's cultural, economic and political ties with India to continue \"like in the past.\" Of course, India needs to wait and see if Stanikzai's words are in sync with the Taliban's actions on the ground.\nIt is true that the turn of events in Afghanistan poses a serious national security threat for India, and has the potential to roil India's domestic politics and polarise society. Two members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in Uttar Pradesh state have gone on record supporting the Taliban, a development that was condemned by leading Muslim civil society members like actors Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi, and lyricist Javed Akhtar. Of course, AIMPLB sought to distance itself from the two members. A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader of Uttar Pradesh has also filed a sedition case against a Samajwadi Party lawmaker for allegedly terming the Taliban as \"freedom fighters.\"\nOn the other hand, the inflow of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs into India has been utilised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President JP Nadda and senior cabinet minister Hardeep Singh Puri to justify the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which gives Indian citizenship to six religious minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who came to India from the three countries till 2014. The BJP's former ally Shiromani Akal Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal has demanded that the Indian government amend the CAA to extend the cut-off date of December 31, 2014 to facilitate citizenship for Sikhs taking shelter in India after the Taliban triumph in Afghanistan.\nSurely, the August 26 meeting was intended to convey that India has a strong national stand on Afghanistan, and it will be unfortunate if scoring political brownie points by parties stands in the way of India's entire political establishment speaking in one voice on the Afghan issue.\nPallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation, spent most of his life in politics outside state power. He struggled against colonial and undemocratic regimes\u2014first against the British for nearly seven years, and later against Pakistan for 24 years to establish the economic, political and cultural rights of the Bengalis. If we look into his long, arduous struggles and 3.5 years' rule in independent Bangladesh, he emerges as an exceptional figure to shape the lives of Bengalis and others, transforming the world into a better place. Bangabandhu had a few specific political ideals and goals, and he worked consistently to achieve them. Through his accomplishments, he presented before us and the world a philosophy of love, peace and freedom.\nIn my opinion, Bangabandhu is one of the greatest leaders the world has ever produced. He acquired his philosophical belief from his love for the people and the country, and through unusual courage, honesty and sincerity. He did not follow Marxist or Maoist philosophy to bring about sociopolitical change\u2014he had his own philosophy. Bangabandhu declared that he would not import socialism from other countries, but he would form a socialist society of our own, keeping democracy, social justice and people's rights undisturbed. The aim was to transform society by establishing socialism in a democratic way and making it functional.\nAt the core of Bangabandhu's philosophy was love for the people. He became the conscience of humanity, and asserted the right of the common people to live with respect. Bangabandhu wrote: \"As a man, what concerns mankind concerns me. As a Bengalee, I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees. This abiding involvement is born of and nourished by love, enduring love, which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being.\" This quote makes it clear how Bangabandhu identified as a human being and as a Bengali. His self-identification thus asserted helps us understand the main features of Bangabandhu's philosophy\u2014love, peace and freedom.\nBangabandhu deeply loved his people and the country. His people were dear to him. It was his people who were his strength and source of power. His biggest weakness was also his love for people. In reply to the question by British TV journalist David Frost\u2014\"What is your strength and weakness?\"\u2014during an interview on January 18, 1972, Bangabandhu said, \"My greatest strength is the love for my people; my greatest weakness is that I love them too much.\"\nFrost also asked, \"When you see them digging a grave and you think of everything you have to leave behind you, do you think of your country, or for instance, of your wife and children first?\" In reply, Bangabandhu said, \"I feel for my country and my people, and then my family. I love my people more. I suffered for my people and you have seen how many people love me.\"\nBangabandhu always stood by the poor. He was involved in many social and political movements, such as the movement of the peasants against the introduction of the Jinnah Fund, prohibiting inter-district trade in rice known as the \"cordon\" system, etc. He supported the movement of the fourth class employees of Dhaka University and was imprisoned in 1949.\nBangabandhu, throughout his whole life, was involved in politics and movements, and talked about people's emancipation from exploitation and oppression. However, he never deviated from his stance of peaceful, non-violent movements. He transformed the Bengali nationalist movement into a movement for independence, following democratic norms and culture, from 1947 to 1970. The movement turned into an armed struggle in March 1971 after the Pakistani military junta refused to hand over power to the Awami League, which secured an absolute majority in the 1970 elections.\nBangabandhu practiced honesty throughout his whole life. He honestly and wholeheartedly supported and fought for the emancipation of the people, and he got this lesson of honesty of purpose from his family. In The Unfinished Memoirs, Bangabandhu wrote that his father Sheikh Lutfar Rahman had said, \"If you don't study, you won't become a good human being. And one other thing: if you have sincerity of purpose and honesty of purpose, you will never be defeated.\" Bangabandhu never forgot this advice.\nBangabandhu believed in peace, harmony and equal rights for all people. Though he was involved in the Pakistan movement, he believed that Muslims in India and Hindus in Pakistan should enjoy equal rights as citizens and live together in peace and harmony. Bangabandhu saved both Muslims and Hindus from acts of communal riots that broke out in Kolkata on August 16, 1947. He, along with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, actively participated in efforts led by Mahatma Gandhi to establish peace and communal harmony.\nBangabandhu not only thought about Bangladesh or regional peace\u2014he also stood for global peace, and against the nuclear arms race and nuclear war. His speech at the 29th UN General Assembly (UNGA) on September 25, 1974 ushered in fresh ideas and policies to build a brave new world free of economic inequalities, social injustice, military aggression and threats of nuclear war. He said, \"Peace is absolutely necessary for the protection of the existence of mankind. The hopes and aspirations of all men and women in the world are embodied in this peace. Peace can never be sustainable if not based on justice.\"\nBangabandhu was a visionary leader. He thought that Bangladesh must adopt science and technology to help expedite building a poverty-free, happy and prosperous Shonar Bangla (Golden Bengal). He did not forget to seek international cooperation and partnership in resources and technology to alleviate people's sufferings at the UNGA. He said, \"There is no room for doubt at all that international cooperation and partnership in resources and technology can facilitate our task, can alleviate people's sufferings. However, the emerging countries like ours should have confidence in their own efficiency. It should be kept in mind that only through the united and concerted effort of the people, we can be able to reach our specific goal, can build a better future.\"\n\"This future will be free from the threats of nuclear war. By the equitable distribution of all the wealth and technical knowledge of the world, the door to such welfare can be opened where everyone will have the minimum assurance of a happy and honest life,\" he said.\nThe conspirators, in August 1975, killed a great leader and the best Bengali of all time\u2014Bangabandhu, who fought for the cause of people and brought independence. But they could not erase his name. His philosophy and ideology are with us. Freedom-loving people can get the taste of freedom if they follow the philosophy of Bangabandhu.\nZunaid Ahmed Palak, MP, is the State Minister for the ICT Division.\n",

        "full_article": "\"Safety first. Because let's face it. If you get injured while covering a protest, your colleagues will come to see you in the hospital, send good wishes to your family, talk about the incident for some days\u2026 but that's all.\" A representative of a top Bangladeshi 24/7 news channel said this while speaking as a guest for the students of a course on news presentation that I took recently.\nJust to put this into perspective, one may recall that 23 journalists have been killed in Bangladesh between 1992 and 2021, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an independent nonprofit organisation promoting press freedom worldwide. Among them, three died while on what the committee described as \"dangerous assignments.\" The number of journalists injured, harassed or intimidated in various other ways over this period would be more, much more.\nIn February, Borhan Uddin Muzakkir, a reporter for the news website Barta Bazar and newspaper Bangladesh Samachar, became the latest casualty when he was shot in the throat while covering clashes between Awami League factions in Noakhali's Companiganj. He succumbed to his injuries the next day.\nElias Mia, a correspondent of Daily Bijoy, was murdered in October last year in Narayanganj for \"exposing a criminal nexus\" in gas line distribution. The 52-year-old was stabbed with a sharp weapon in the Geodhara area while on his way back home.\nJournalists\u2014whether a stringer or full-timer\u2014are targeted or become collateral victims in an atmosphere of intense political tension in Bangladesh. Five of the victims listed by CPJ\u2014Ahmed Rajib Halder, Ananta Bijoy Das, Avijit Roy, Niloy Neel, and Washiqur Rahman Babu\u2014were freelancers who were hunted down by religious extremists because of their views.\nBangladesh has slipped one notch in this year's World Press Freedom Index. It ranked 152nd out of 180 countries, according to the report released in April by Reporters Without Borders.\nCuriously enough, despite this dire situation, we now have 37 television channels, 1,277 daily newspapers, and more are on the way, indicating a fast expansion of the industry. The media landscape of the country is also equally dominated by social media and citizen journalists.\nIn 1993, only three universities offered undergraduate and graduate journalism, mass communication and media studies degrees in Bangladesh. This increased to 21 by the end of 2016, according to a paper titled \"Journalism education in Bangladesh\" published by the Deutsche Welle Akademie.\nApart from the universities, the government-run Press Institute of Bangladesh has been giving in-profession training for working journalists since its establishment in 1976. The other significant providers of journalism education in Bangladesh are NGOs, which occasionally offer trainings for in-profession journalists on issues like gender, environment and business.\nSeeing such prospects, many juvenile minds are perhaps harbouring the dream of becoming a journalist. But the burning question is, how many of them are actually willing to pursue a career in journalism and then stick to it? How many of them are willing to take the risks that come with the thrill of travelling, being creative, and serving the core purpose of being the voice of the people and contributing to the betterment of society?\nAlongside security concerns, low salary and lack of job security, family pressure is often a much bigger inhibiting factor for journalists. As a result, many who start with enthusiasm eventually move on to other fields. In fact, the doubt is sown much earlier when in their undergrads, students are advised by their families and well-wishers to keep courses like business, English, public relations, etc. as\u00a0 back-ups in case things get problematic or not turn out to be as well as expected.\nIt seems there is a long road ahead to ensure the protection, safety, and welfare of journalists in Bangladesh. A staggering 1,600 journalists lost their jobs in 2020 due to the closure and loss of income of media outlets during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Article 19 Bangladesh and South Asia's annual report on Violation of Freedom of Expression in Bangladesh.\nIt is expected that any government in any part of the world will be wary of the activities of media houses and journalists, as the very nature of the fourth estate is to keep the authorities in check. It will always be the watchdog over any form of power, be it political or otherwise.\nBut in Bangladesh, the picture is grimmer. It is not uncommon for professionals to stray from ideal journalistic practices to serve the interests of the business entities owning their newspapers or media outlets. We also see media outlets engaging in sensationalised reporting to engage readers/viewers, often running the risk of promoting content that is sexist/racist and thus raising concerns over the quality of journalism. On top of that, the draconian Digital Security Act hangs like a sword above them, deepening the overall culture of fear prevailing in the country.\nThe defamation clauses in the Act (sections 21, 25, 28, 29 and 31) have been crafted in such a manner that any critical social media post or news report can be interpreted to be a violation. There have been reports of arrests being made indiscriminately and the so-called offenders being kept behind bars for indefinite periods. Citing data from Bangladesh's Cyber Crime Tribunal, Amnesty International recently stated that 10 newspaper editors faced legal charges under the DSA for critical reporting on leaders of the ruling Awami League in 2020.\nSo, with the growing number of instances of journalists and their families being threatened, assaulted, abducted, or worse, it is likely that many creative minds with noble intentions might just drop their aspirations of serving the world through journalism and move to other, safer professions.\nIn these turbulent times, we need good, inspiring examples to turn the tide around in Bangladesh. For example, the judiciary can and should set strong examples by sentencing those responsible for crimes against journalists through speedy trials. Other responsible state institutions should also come forward to protect the public good that journalism is through greater cooperation with the media, and by removing the roadblocks that exist in the way of accessing vital information for the sake of the interests of the nation. Also, aside from book lessons and assignments, schools offering journalism courses should provide practical tips and advice to their students wishing to pursue a career in journalism. This will inspire and enable them to pursue their careers with more confidence.\nUnregulated distribution of licenses to TV channels and newspapers may lead to mushrooming of media outlets, but not the safety of journalists, or freedom of expression. It is high time the authorities paid more attention to improving the quality of journalism and ensuring greater press freedom in Bangladesh, rather than focusing on the quantity of media outlets. Society as a whole should be more supportive of the press, especially the serious press, for the sake of this industry as well as its own.\nPromiti Prova Chowdhury is a journalist.\nEmail: promiti.chowdhury@gmail.com\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is set to embark on a new era of commuting with a new mode of transport hitherto unseen on our land\u2014the elevated metro rail of Dhaka. The first step in that direction was taken on Sunday, when the road transport and bridges minister inaugurated a series of test runs of the metro train, which will continue until its planned commercial launch in December next year. Sunday saw the beginning of what is being called the \"performance tests\", which will continue for about six months, followed by three months of \"integrity tests\" and then another five months of \"trial runs\" (without passengers). These test runs are to ensure the elevated train service is ready for use while works on the overhead railway viaducts, tracks, wiring, and other preparations are in various stages of completion.\nThis is a big moment in the country's transport sector. Although the train service will be launched initially from Uttara to Agargaon\u2014and later to Motijheel, covering a distance of 20.10 km\u2014one can imagine a successful period of run may eventually lead to its replication across other busy parts of Dhaka and also in other metropolitan areas of Bangladesh. The benefits of an elevated metro rail in an overpopulated, rapidly urbanising country like ours\u2014forever jostling for space\u2014are many. It will not only significantly reduce travel time in daily commute but will also carry a large number of passengers, easing the pressure on other transport services. The flexibility, ease and speed of communications, and consequent economic potential that this service promises to bring, may have profound impacts on the quality of life.\nReaching that potential, however, will depend to a large extent on how fast the impending work and purchases (of trains, coaches, etc.) are completed and how satisfactorily the service is delivered, once it is available for commercial use. As of July this year, the Dhaka metro rail project, which has seen several deadline extensions since its initiation in 2012, made only 68.49 percent of progress, its execution delayed, most recently, by pandemic-induced disruptions. Going forward, we hope the project work will be expedited and no more disruptions will be allowed to get in the way to ensure the December 2022 deadline is met.\nThere seems to be no dearth of goodwill on the part of the authorities. However, care should be taken so that it is properly reflected in the execution of the project and the quality of services to be rendered\u2014and so that, to take a cue from past experiences, it doesn't meet the same fate of other ambitious communication projects that have failed to deliver as promised.\n",

        "full_article": "On June 30, 2015, a fish trader named Mosharraf was allegedly beaten up by members of the police, placed inside an empty septic tank, and left there for nearly 36 hours. Later, he was shown arrested for carrying 200 pieces of yaba. Today, Mosharraf isn't fighting in court to get justice for his ill-treatment but to prove his innocence in regards to the drug case. There are many types of enforced disappearance cases that we hear about in Bangladesh. And being picked up by law enforcers and not being produced in court within the legal timeframe of 24 hours\u2014and instead being detained at a clandestine place before that, leaving hours, days, or weeks in custody unaccounted for\u2014is just one of them.\nDespite widespread allegations of law enforcers using enforced disappearance as a tactic against victims who remain untraceable, collecting data on such cases has proven to be difficult. The issue only came under substantial media scrutiny after cartoonist Ahmed Kishore filed a case alleging that he was kept in an unknown location for several days and tortured. Typically, despite the number of individuals who have gone missing racking up in the hundreds, once any of these people returns, they all seem to go into a cocoon, distancing themselves from the glare of the media and staying silent on their whole experience of being disappeared\u2014that is, if they are \"lucky\" enough to return alive.\nDetaining someone and not presenting them in court within 24 hours is a clear violation of the law. It is also a violation of human rights. It contradicts a number of different international treaties that Bangladesh is a signatory to. Still, according to rights organisations, there are hundreds of alleged cases of enforced disappearances that the authorities continue to pay very little heed to. And then there are many more cases where, despite the victims disappearing for a few days, they are only shown arrested and produced in court much later, without any explanation as to their whereabouts during the time that they had remained traceless\u2014or any explanation whatsoever as to what had happened to them.\nThe tendency on the part of the higher authorities\u2014when their political adversaries, or people they view as their opposition, disappear and remain traceless for days on end\u2014is bound to eventually trickle down onto others. And we have now reached a point where enforced disappearance has become normalised for most members of the law enforcing agencies, as well as other state machineries. It means that some law enforcers might resort to such tactics even for their own parochial reasons, knowing that such cases have become so common and are so readily overlooked that chances of them getting caught or punished is highly unlikely.\nThe truth is, even if it isn't any of the state organs that are responsible for these individuals disappearing\u2014which is what the victims' families almost always claim\u2014it is incumbent upon the state to investigate what happened to them, and bring them safely back to their families. Any failure to do so is a failure on the part of the state to fulfil its mandate of protecting the constitutional rights of citizens. And that is a most egregious failure\u2014one that should entail accountability and serious penalties.\n",
