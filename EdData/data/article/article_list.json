The district court in Varanasi has rejected objections to the maintainability of a suit filed by five Hindu devotees seeking the right of daily worship at a spot in the Gyanvapi mosque. Of particular significance is that the court ruled that the suit is not prohibited by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which freezes the status of places of worship as it was on August 15, 1947 and bars suits that seek to change their character. On the fact of it, the ruling only paves the way for the suit to be heard and is in consonance with law. The plaintiffs have argued that the spot had the status of a Hindu temple on that day and ever since, and that the suit does not seek to convert a mosque into a temple; on the other hand, they are only demanding the right to worship deities in the complex. If limited to this assertion of a religious and customary right, the suit may indeed not be barred by the 1991 law. However, it is a matter of concern that the ruling is also grounded in other claims that appear to question the mosque\u2019s status. For instance, the court says records produced by the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee were not enough to show that the complex was Waqf property. This appears in concert with the Hindu side\u2019s claim that Muslims were \u201cencroachers\u201d, an assertion that clearly makes it a dispute aimed at converting the property\u2019s status.Courts should be wary of underhand designs behind the legal facade that such litigation builds to gain a toehold right that can be incrementally expanded. The mere pendency of some kinds of religious disputes can contribute to the vitiation of peace and harmony. It is now clear that the enactment of a special law to freeze the status of places of worship and prohibit litigation over inter-religious disputes over their location has not stemmed the Hindu right-wing\u2019s obsession with targeting mosques and stoking communal passions. It is no surprise that the latest efforts to raise civil and legal disputes involving the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and the Shahi Idgah Mosque in Mathura are being made in tandem with a campaign against the Places of Worship Act. Several petitions have been filed challenging its validity. That such a campaign goes on despite the experience of communal frenzy through the 1990s shows the unregenerate nature of majoritarian forces. The abominable destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the communal riots that took place in its aftermath, the serial bomb blasts in Mumbai, and the fundamentalist violence that the sequence of events spawned cannot be forgotten. It is unfortunate that an atmosphere has been created in which the political leadership can encourage divisive litigation and exploit the process, if not influence the outcome.",

This year, it became the first to introduce coaching during matches. There is also non-conformity of a different kind; Flushing Meadows is no single male player\u2019s fiefdom. Since January 2006, the Australian Open, Roland-Garros and Wimbledon have collectively seen just five different winners. In the same time span, U.S. Open has had 10, the last of which is Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz, crowned the king of New York on Sunday after a four-set victory over Norway\u2019s Casper Ruud. The triumph has taken Alcaraz, 19, to the pinnacle of ATP rankings, making him the youngest man to reach the top. He is also the first teenager to win a Grand Slam tournament since Rafael Nadal at the 2005 French Open. The title run was Alcaraz\u2019s baptism by fire. Prior to the final, he had spent over 20 hours on court and had to battle through three tough five-setters that finished well past midnight. Ruud, known for his consistency and court coverage, had past experience of a Major final (2022 French Open). But Alcaraz did not suffer a letdown, displaying the same spirit he had in clinching the Madrid Masters in May by defeating Alexander Zverev after having recorded back-to-back victories over Nadal and Novak Djokovic.Circumstances played a role in Alcaraz\u2019s ascent. Djokovic not being awarded any points for his Wimbledon win and then being barred from entering the United States of America because of his unvaccinated status eased his path. While he undoubtedly plays first-strike tennis of the highest order, there may yet be contemporary equals. Jannik Sinner, after all, had a match-point in the fourth set of their quarterfinal. But no player in recent memory has combined as many good traits \u2014 shot-selection, temperament and a complete absence of big-match nerves \u2014 into such a wholesome package like Alcaraz. Even as the Spaniard ushers in the churn at the top of the men\u2019s game, the women\u2019s side seems to be settling down, with both a dominant force and a pecking order emerging. Iga Swiatek, the unquestionable World No.1 since the first week of April, captured her maiden U.S. Open \u2014 second Grand Slam title in 2022 after Paris and third overall \u2014 while Ons Jabeur made her second straight final. Though Naomi Osaka has a higher Slam count (four), Swiatek\u2019s awe-inspiring all-court prowess makes her the ideal candidate to be the next figurehead. As Serena Williams heads into retirement \u2014 the third-round defeat in New York appears to be her last stand \u2014 it finally feels like the passing of the baton.",

        "full_article": "Alongside WFH, moonlighting \u2013 employees doing jobs on the side of their contracted full-time work \u2013 expanded exponentially during the pandemic, particularly among techies. The grey zone outside of office hours in which pre-pandemic moonlighting operated, really flourished with Covid blurring home and office. AKA side-hustle, moonlighting is in the crosshairs of some major employers, who are also keen to restore white-collar work to its pre-pandemic definitions. With employees in many places resisting status quo ante, the open secret of moonlighting in the IT sector had to be confronted head on by employers. Infosys has called it \u201ctwo-timing\u201d and the Wipro chairman called it \u201ccheating, plain and simple\u201d. But Swiggy and Cred are greenlighting moonlighting. It\u2019s a reflection of how employer-employee relationships are in great churn right now. But this turbulence is not the same across white-collar jobs.\nWFH made stark the deep fault line between white-collar workers and the rest. Likewise moonlighting opportunities gravitate to specific groups, especially where demand outstrips supply. A PwC survey tellingly found 54% of respondents strongly/moderately agreeing that India faces a shortage of their skill sets. It\u2019s complicated, so no wonder even HR managers, never shy of reminding employees of the binding nature of contracts, are divided. Some are worrying about side-hustles lowering office productivity and causing IP leaks and conflicts of interest \u2013 understandable concerns. But other HR mavens are open to the idea of companies working productively with employees without having exclusive \u2018ownership\u2019 of them. They will cite experts who argue that moonlighting can help one do one\u2019s day job better. An American study published in the Academy of Management Journal last year found that side-hustles made employees feel empowered, and the resulting uplift in mood actually improved their mainline performance.\nThe thing, though, is all managerial positions and employee options will ultimately be decided by unsentimental market forces. In a booming sector that\u2019s short of skilled people, employers will be hard-pressed to punish moonlighting. In a sectoral labour market where employers call the shots, moonlighting will probably be punished.\n\n",

        "full_article": "GoI should act on the recommendation of the parliamentary standing committee on health that cancer be made a notifiable disease. \u2018Notifiable\u2019 makes it mandatory for healthcare providers to report every case to authorities. So far states like UP, Bihar, Maharashtra and MP have dithered on this. The panel has noted with dismay that various population-based and hospital cancer registries cover just 10% of the Indian population though the programme began four decades ago. With just 22% of registered deaths medically certified, all we have are estimates. ICMR estimates there are 14 lakh cases and 7 lakh deaths annually.\nAbsence of high-quality data on cancer incidence and mortality is felt across the spectrum of cancer prevention and treatment. Urgency for localised implementation of screening programmes will materialise only with concrete data of high incidence of cancer in particular areas. Even risk factors like tobacco, air pollution, pesticides and packaged/junk food consumption will be better understood with a comprehensive database, which tracks patients across geography, age groups, economic status and lifestyles. Better reporting will also pressure governments to proportionately increase funding and resources for cancer care and research. A 2013 Union Cabinet decision to build 39 state and tertiary cancer institutes is inordinately delayed and will be fully completed only by 2024.\nIndia\u2019s mortality to incidence ratio of 0.68 is much higher than those in rich countries, where the ratio is 0.38. The West\u2019s cancer incidence is bigger than India\u2019s. But what reduces mortality is early cancer detection. And a good state health insurance system encourages treatment. Currently, official grassroots screening programmes in India are very basic, covering just 10% of the population for three cancers \u2013 oral, cervical and breast. Though health is a state subject, the parliamentary panel urges GoI to take the lead in setting up new cancer centres. It has projected a Rs 35,000 crore expenditure in setting up a nationwide hub-and-spoke model for cancer treatment. The least states must do is to make cancer a notifiable disease, and then GoI must step up the funding.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Surely, development is more than the building of new structures while tearing down those with history and character? Yet, that is exactly what we continue to witness happening in Bangladesh, and most noticeably in Old Dhaka. Most recently, a section of the ancient Boro Katra, comprising three chambers of the historic structure, has been all but torn down. But this is apparently no news, even to the authorities concerned.\nThis daily reported on the rampant encroachment on ancient structures in Old Dhaka earlier this year, while the conservation organisation Urban Study Group (USG) alerted police in July of how parts of Boro Katra were being demolished. Yet, the historically significant site is being turned into rubble by its \"owner,\" Ali Hossain of Holding 15, Boro Katra Lane. Alarmingly, this is taking place despite a High Court directive in 2018 ordering the authorities to \"stop changing, modifying and demolishing 2,200 British-era buildings named in the USG's list of heritage sites in Old Dhaka.\" Boro Katra is also at the second position on Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha's (Rajuk) list of historical buildings that require conservation. And, as recently as in 2020, Rajuk declared Boro Katra and Chhoto Katra as \"Traditional Special Establishments.\"\nOwner Ali Hossain's claim that the structure was being demolished after the city corporation deemed it risky and after permission was obtained from Rajuk to construct a multi-storey building on the site. This was found to be untrue when this newspaper contacted the director of Rajuk Zone 5, who denied providing such a permission. However, question remains as to why the authorities could not stop Ali Hossain from demolishing this historical site, despite having been informed of the threat it was in. Given that the responsibility of conserving such sites falls largely on the Department of Archaeology, their response has been lukewarm at best, limited only to warning the owner months ago and never following up on the state of the structure again. Now, they have said they will \"inspect the relevant papers.\" It is disappointing to see how neglectful the police and the Department of Archaeology have been regarding their duty to protect Boro Katra and Chhoto Katra.\nJust last month, we voiced our astonishment in this column when a century-old two-storey structure in Bangla Bazar was being demolished, only a month after the same happened to Neelam Ghar. These, too, have been done in violation of the law and only for the benefit of the owners who usually have the backing of local political heavyweights.\nDhaka has a glorious past just as any ancient city, and it is most prominently embodied by its architecture. We urge the government to ensure that the authorities tasked with protecting our heritage are actually doing their job. We must not hand over our future generations a city that has lost its ornamented past in its chase for futile development.\n",

        "full_article": "The draconian Digital Security Act (DSA) strikes again, and most worryingly, in collusion with communal bigotry. This time, police arrested Pritom Das, a leader of left-leaning organisation Rashtra Sangskar Andolan, on September 9 in a case filed under the DSA for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The case was filed by Mahbub Alam Bhuiyan, an activist of Bangladesh Chhatra League, on September 4. He accused Pritom of hurting religious sentiments and undermining the country's sovereignty through a Facebook post.\nLet's see what that post was.\nPublished on July 8, 2022, the post reads, \"Someone asked Saadat Hasan Manto, the great Urdu story writer, how is your country? He replied, 'Just like the Friday prayers in jail. A fraudulent inmate offers the call to prayer, the imam is a murderer, and the worshippers are all thieves'\" (The original post was in Bangla).\nThe same quote was used by historian Prof Muntasir Mamun in an online article published the previous day, and by M Naser Rahman, son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman and a former member of parliament from Moulvibazar 2 constituency, on July 28. However, they were not sued for using the quote.\nDear readers, did you find anything offensive to religion and state sovereignty in Pritom Das' post? It shouldn't hurt anyone except frauds, murderers and thieves. Religion never condones bigotry, and the sovereignty of a state is created and sustained by the consent of its people, not by the government or the law enforcement agencies loyal to them.\nManto, in his short life of 42 years, faced such allegations several times; therefore, he can explain the motive behind these accusations better than anyone: \"When these leaders cry their hearts out telling people that religion is in danger, there's no reality to it. Religion is not something that can be endangered. If there is a danger, it is to these leaders who endanger religion to achieve their own ends.\"\nNow, let's look at the background events leading to the arrest of Pritom Das. It will help understand Manto's insight.\nOn August 27, as Pritom and his comrades were staging a protest in Sreemangal's Chaumohana Chattar in solidarity with the tea workers' demand for a daily wage of Tk 300, a group of 56-60 activists of the ruling party led by the former general secretary of Sreemangal municipal unit of Chhatra League, Abed Hossain, attacked Pritom's group in the police's presence. Police, however, played the role of a silent spectator. Pritom and his nine comrades were injured in the incident. On that afternoon, they held a press conference condemning the attack and demanded immediate arrest of the perpetrators, including Abed Hossain. They also blamed police inaction for the incident. The attack was widely criticised on both online and offline platforms. So far, the police haven't taken any action against the attackers.\nThree days later, 52 days after the appearance of the Facebook post, the same Abed Hossain brought allegations of insulting Islam against Pritom. He made a social media post demanding that Pritom be brought under the law. His followers jumped into spreading the word.\nThe next day, a protest was brought out from a local mosque under the banner of \"Sreemangaler Dharmapran Muslim Janata,\" and they demanded Pritom Das' immediate arrest. An ultimatum was issued that if he were not arrested before the Jummah prayer of September 2, protest marches would be brought out from all the local mosques. They also called upon local Muslims to join the protest. It created huge panic among the local Hindu population.\nIsn't this the same old script? Since the Ramu attack a decade ago, communal violence has been carried out again and again, following the same formula of raising false allegations of demeaning religion through Facebook posts. This is also not new that political, social and religious influentials and groups with vested interests are the masterminds behind communal attacks. In Rangpur's Pirganj upazila, for example, a local Chhatra League leader, along with his accomplices, instigated the mob to burn down homes and shops of the local Hindu community on October 17, 2021 over a doctored Facebook post.\nHowever, this time their plan didn't work out. The local people, particularly religious leaders, didn't walk into their trap. Most importantly, Pritom Das stood strong and didn't give in to the demand for seeking an apology. The united stand against communal provocation showed the path of resistance to the abuse of religious sentiments by political opportunists, and this feat of Sreemangal's people was widely celebrated.\nUnfortunately, the defeated forces struck back by weaponising the Digital Security Act. This time, the local police acted over-enthusiastically. Pritom Das is now languishing in jail. The vaguely worded law on digital security has created its own moral brigade, and, unsurprisingly, the ruling party activists are leading it. They feel entitled to enforce their parochial interest as morality, and that has created a new political dispensation which mandates an atmosphere of violence and fear.\nThe role of the local administration is no less frustrating. If not complicit in the crime, they played into the hands of the communal bigots. In the case of Jhuman Das, they failed in the same way. Instead of taking action against the Hefazat activists and supporters who attacked and vandalised the houses of minorities in Shalla, Sunamganj, they implicated local youth Jhuman Das in a DSA case, who warned in a Facebook post that the hate speech preached by the Hefazat leaders would disrupt communal harmony in the area. He suffered in jail for over six months before being released on bail by the High Court in September 2021. He was arrested again on August 30 this year in another flimsy DSA case. The government has devised a unique formula for tackling communal tension: arrest the victim to calm down the perpetrators! Doesn't it constitute a defeat of the people by the government, which has no legitimacy without their popular will?\nPritom Das' Facebook post containing Manto's quote has turned out to be distressingly prophetic in the present context of Bangladesh. Shouldn't we be worried about it?\n\u00a0\nShamsuddoza Sajen\u00a0is a journalist and researcher.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The fact that extreme weather events are increasingly growing worse in Bangladesh is obvious from our climate experiences from this year alone. In June, heavy rainfall, flash floods and excessive water-flow from upstream rivers affected an estimated 7.2 million people in the north-east. Yet, this was followed up with a searing heat wave, where the average maximum temperature for the month of August was a three-decade high. This, along with the delay in the actual rainy season, meant that planting seasons were affected, and there are growing worries that food security will be threatened as a result.\nUnfortunately, a new report from the World Bank signals this might only be the beginning. According to the report, because of climate change, cyclone-induced flooding could cause damages worth USD 570 million across coastal areas. This is not a one-off event \u2013 the report suggests that it will occur every year in future. It analysed the effects of rising sea levels on coastal districts, and found that some upazilas could go under as much as 8 metres (26 feet) of water as a result of floods if there is a sea level rise of half a metre. Depending on how severe the floods are, the damage could amount to as much as USD 21 billion.\nThe severity of this situation cannot be in any way understated. Not only will it have devastating impacts on livelihoods, farmlands, roads, and critical infrastructure; it will push saline water further into tidal channels, threatening agricultural production, water supplies, and the diversity of coastal ecosystems. The recent events in Pakistan, where more than 14,00 people have died, millions have been left homeless and an economic crisis has gripped the country, shows just how much danger we are facing.\nLast month, it was reported that Bangladesh requires USD 230 billion by 2030 to implement the National Action Plan on climate change, but we urgently require international and bilateral support. While we urge the authorities to do everything to raise these funds, we must equally stress on the importance of using them with accountability and transparency. The corruption and irregularities in climate projects have been reported in this daily over the years, with a report finding, only last month, that the managing director of the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust has been collecting \"donations\" in exchange for releasing cheques to the projects under the trust.\nThe World Bank report's analysis of coastal resilience projects also found a lack of maintenance as a significant challenge. In this, as in so many public projects, it is clear that a lack of good governance is hampering our progress. If we are to receive adequate funds, and eventually compensation from responsible countries for the loss and damage climate change has inflicted upon us, this has to change.\n",

        "full_article": "Over the last 50 years, Bangladesh has been recognised in South Asia as well as around the world as a laboratory for development success in alleviating poverty, girls' education and inclusion in the workforce, and unlocking the potential of the private sector in banking, industries and commerce, among others.\nThis development was by no means perfect, particularly when it comes to protecting the environment, which was badly neglected, and also with regard to inclusive development where the divide between the richest and the poorest citizens has been getting worse. So, looking at the development pathway for the next few decades, we need to rectify these two major flaws in our development pathway to become more environment-friendly as well as more equitable in the benefits of development investments.\nAt the same time, in the next 50 years, we will have to deal with a new major global emergency called human-induced climate change, which will cause severe stress to our development investments. So we will need to incorporate measures to tackle climate change to our development pathways if we wish to prosper in the coming decades.\nLet me share some ideas on ways in which Bangladesh can become a global laboratory for climate change solutions in the future.\nThe first recommendation is to expedite the pace and quantum of investments in tackling climate change in all our development investments, both in different ministries in the government and, perhaps even more importantly, in the private sector and civil society. This is already happening. There are a number of national plans that are being developed to achieve this goal, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP). Now these plans must be folded into the main national planning process with a priority for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP), which will be developed soon. Mainstreaming climate change activities such as mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage is now essential for the 9FYP.\nThe second recommendation to focus on is building the capacity of our young citizens, with a priority on educating girls, to make them climate-literate citizens and indeed mould them into future climate champions. Investing in our youth is the single most lucrative measure in terms of value for money over a decade or so. This should become a major priority for us immediately. Bangladesh needs to look to transformational ways forward, rather than incremental ways only. Investing in today's youth will lead to the transformation of the country tomorrow.\nAnother aspect of tackling climate change, in which Bangladesh is already a globally acknowledged leader, is Locally Led Adaptation (LLA), where the country is investing in vulnerable communities to enable them to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change that is already happening. This now needs to be made into location-specific LLA for each different ecosystem \u2013 from coastal zones to the hill tracts, to haor areas, to the Barind Tract, to urban areas.\nThis location-specific Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EBA) combined with LLA can be developed for different ecosystems, and that learning can be shared with other countries where they have similar ecosystems. This knowledge can be shared both with other vulnerable developing countries and with developed countries. Knowledge of how to tackle climate change is a global asset; so developed countries can learn from Bangladesh.\nNext, our private sector needs to accelerate their investments in mitigation measures, such as solar power, going from small scale to larger scale as rapidly as possible. At the same time, investments in adaptation are needed so that companies can make profits from supporting communities to adapt to the adverse impacts of human-induced climate change. This is still untapped potential where our dynamic private sector can also become global leaders and sell their knowledge to the rest of the world.\nFinally, we need to invest in developing a national mechanism to tackle loss and damage from human-induced climate change, which is now a reality. Bangladesh has the opportunity to be the first mover and share with the world our learnings at local and national levels.\nOur world has just now entered the era of loss and damage from human-induced climate change and each country will have to learn how to tackle the new and emerging situation. Bangladesh has the potential to become a global laboratory of climate actions and solutions going forward.\n\u00a0\nDr Saleemul Huq\u00a0is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).\n\n",

In June, heavy rainfall, flash floods and excessive water-flow from upstream rivers affected an estimated 7.2 million people in the north-east. Yet, this was followed up with a searing heat wave, where the average maximum temperature for the month of August was a three-decade high. This, along with the delay in the actual rainy season, meant that planting seasons were affected, and there are growing worries that food security will be threatened as a result.\nUnfortunately, a new report from the World Bank signals this might only be the beginning. According to the report, because of climate change, cyclone-induced flooding could cause damages worth USD 570 million across coastal areas. This is not a one-off event \u2013 the report suggests that it will occur every year in future. It analysed the effects of rising sea levels on coastal districts, and found that some upazilas could go under as much as 8 metres (26 feet) of water as a result of floods if there is a sea level rise of half a metre. Depending on how severe the floods are, the damage could amount to as much as USD 21 billion.\nThe severity of this situation cannot be in any way understated. Not only will it have devastating impacts on livelihoods, farmlands, roads, and critical infrastructure; it will push saline water further into tidal channels, threatening agricultural production, water supplies, and the diversity of coastal ecosystems. The recent events in Pakistan, where more than 14,00 people have died, millions have been left homeless and an economic crisis has gripped the country, shows just how much danger we are facing.\nLast month, it was reported that Bangladesh requires USD 230 billion by 2030 to implement the National Action Plan on climate change, but we urgently require international and bilateral support. While we urge the authorities to do everything to raise these funds, we must equally stress on the importance of using them with accountability and transparency. The corruption and irregularities in climate projects have been reported in this daily over the years, with a report finding, only last month, that the managing director of the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust has been collecting \"donations\" in exchange for releasing cheques to the projects under the trust.\nThe World Bank report's analysis of coastal resilience projects also found a lack of maintenance as a significant challenge. In this, as in so many public projects, it is clear that a lack of good governance is hampering our progress. If we are to receive adequate funds, and eventually compensation from responsible countries for the loss and damage climate change has inflicted upon us, this has to change.\n",

Yet, that is exactly what we continue to witness happening in Bangladesh, and most noticeably in Old Dhaka. Most recently, a section of the ancient Boro Katra, comprising three chambers of the historic structure, has been all but torn down. But this is apparently no news, even to the authorities concerned.\nThis daily reported on the rampant encroachment on ancient structures in Old Dhaka earlier this year, while the conservation organisation Urban Study Group (USG) alerted police in July of how parts of Boro Katra were being demolished. Yet, the historically significant site is being turned into rubble by its \"owner,\" Ali Hossain of Holding 15, Boro Katra Lane. Alarmingly, this is taking place despite a High Court directive in 2018 ordering the authorities to \"stop changing, modifying and demolishing 2,200 British-era buildings named in the USG's list of heritage sites in Old Dhaka.\" Boro Katra is also at the second position on Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha's (Rajuk) list of historical buildings that require conservation. And, as recently as in 2020, Rajuk declared Boro Katra and Chhoto Katra as \"Traditional Special Establishments.\"\nOwner Ali Hossain's claim that the structure was being demolished after the city corporation deemed it risky and after permission was obtained from Rajuk to construct a multi-storey building on the site. This was found to be untrue when this newspaper contacted the director of Rajuk Zone 5, who denied providing such a permission. However, question remains as to why the authorities could not stop Ali Hossain from demolishing this historical site, despite having been informed of the threat it was in. Given that the responsibility of conserving such sites falls largely on the Department of Archaeology, their response has been lukewarm at best, limited only to warning the owner months ago and never following up on the state of the structure again. Now, they have said they will \"inspect the relevant papers.\" It is disappointing to see how neglectful the police and the Department of Archaeology have been regarding their duty to protect Boro Katra and Chhoto Katra.\nJust last month, we voiced our astonishment in this column when a century-old two-storey structure in Bangla Bazar was being demolished, only a month after the same happened to Neelam Ghar. These, too, have been done in violation of the law and only for the benefit of the owners who usually have the backing of local political heavyweights.\nDhaka has a glorious past just as any ancient city, and it is most prominently embodied by its architecture. We urge the government to ensure that the authorities tasked with protecting our heritage are actually doing their job. We must not hand over our future generations a city that has lost its ornamented past in its chase for futile development.\n",

        "full_article": "Plastic, a substance made from the waste products found while processing crude oil and natural gas in the early 1930s, is now a global threat to the environment and life. Once admired for its durability, this universal packaging material has now become a curse since unlike most other substances of everyday use, it does not mix with soil and degrade. Now microplastics have found their way into the food chains of humans and other animals including those in ponds, lakes, rivers and oceans raising the threat to life to a new level. According to a World Bank (WB) study, in the last 15 years, the use of plastic products in the country tripled from 3.0 kg per head annually in 2005 to 9.0 kg in 2020. Of the approximately 0.1 million tonnes of plastic used in the country in 2020, only 31 per cent were recycled, while the rest was mismanaged, which means that those (mismanaged) plastic products, the disposable polythene bags, in particular, were dumped everywhere- on the roads, in the drains, in the landfills and in the water bodies. How alarming, at 24 kg per capita per year in 2020, the capital city's plastic consumption was close to thrice the national average in that year! But of this huge quantity of plastic garbage (some 646 tonnes) that Dhaka generates every day, only 37.2 per cent are properly managed, that is, recycled. Notably, in the European countries, the average per capita plastic consumption is far higher at 100 kg than that in Bangladesh. But still Bangladesh is among the world's top plastic-polluted countries due to its mismanagement of the plastic waste. In this connection, reports from the port city of Chattogram on plastic pollution are a cause for added concern. Around 3,000 tonnes of waste the port city produces daily, 8.3 per cent, or 249 tonnes, constitute plastic waste. About 44 per cent of this plastic waste, mainly polythene products, are collected and deposited in the landfills, while the rest, uncollected 56 per cent, are left to clog the port city's drains and the canals leading to its chronic water-logging. A recently done Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET)-sponsored study found that, among other causes, a lack of public awareness about the dangers of plastic pollution, shortage of garbage bins, burning of plastic/polythene products and a lack of enforcement of relevant laws to protect environment lay behind the port city's woes relating to plastic pollution. But Bangladesh should not have been in such a hell born of mismanaged plastic waste. It was the first country in the world to ban plastic shopping bags two decades back (in 2002). This brings us to the issue of sustainably managing plastic waste. On this score, the government is learnt to have endorsed a national action plan for sustainable plastic management under the rubric of 'roadmap' to protect the environment. Also, the environment ministry has issued a gazette notification to this effect recently. The so-called 'roadmap, meant to rid coastal areas of the hazardous, single-use plastic, as reported, is obviously a step in the right direction. Its policy of circular use of plastic based on what it calls a 3R strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle), is, to all appearances, a sustainable way to rid the environment of plastic menace. However, the crucial point is to consider the plastic menace an emergency and go all out about removing it from the environment.",

        "full_article": "For decades 'export diversification' has been a buzzword whenever the issue of the country's exports comes up for deliberations. Clearly, it is the overwhelming reliance on readymade garment (RMG) which accounts for more than 76 per cent of the country's total exports that makes the buzzword a compelling choice for expanding the export basket. The underlying argument here is: the export basket has hundreds of products but as most of them suffer from poor performance, diversifying the basket means adding vigour and strength to the products so that the export sector can rid itself of over-reliance on a single product. Keeping this in view, the government has been framing policies from time to time with special emphasis on prospective products by way of various incentives and supports. To say that these have not at all worked is not true, but there is no visible momentum in exports, except for a few core products, including the RMG. Actually, diversification is a package comprising scores of issues from product development, product adaptation, quality assurance, market demand, compliance fulfilment, competitive pricing and so on.So, when one speaks about diversification, it must not be seen as a remedy readily available. It has to be worked on, in a planned manner taking into account all relevant factors as a package. In the past the Export Promotion Bureau undertook many foreign aided export development projects. However, as many of the projects approached the aforementioned package only partially, the outcome was far from satisfactory. Recently, it has been reported that a multi-donor funded export diversification project of the government is languishing with very little works done so far. The Tk 9.95 crore project aimed at providing assistance to export diversification and expanding export capacity of select product areas, namely garment, food-processing and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Scheduled to be completed by 2021, the project extended subsequently to July 2022, has reportedly been able to complete only 11 per cent of the work programme. No doubt a pathetic case, but had the project been completed in due time, could we say its goal was accomplished? Unfortunately, No. This is because such projects can at best disseminate information on various relevant issues including training the manpower with required knowledge. But there is a lot more to the job, and these can only be taken up by a comprehensive medium-term plan with sufficient fund allocation and development of required infrastructural facilities.The reason why diversification figures so prominently in public discussions on export is because of its many tangible benefits. Diversifying the export composition protects a country from the risk of an unpredictable declining trend in international prices of exportable commodities that, in turn, leads to unstable export earnings. Export diversification could therefore help out to stabilise export earnings in the long run. Due to an absence of export diversification in developing countries, decline in and fluctuations of export earnings have negatively influenced income, investment, and employment. Diversification provides the opportunities to extend investment risks over a wider portfolio of the economic sector which eventually increases income. Diversification can also be seen as an input factor that has the effect of increasing the productivity of other factors of production. Furthermore, economic growth and structural change depend upon the type of products that are being traded. Thus export diversification allows an economy to achieve some of its macroeconomic objectives namely sustainable economic growth, satisfactory balance of payment situation, employment, and redistribution of income.There are different strategies adopted by different countries, depending on the country-specific situations. In the Asian region, Thailand is a good example of pursuing diversification in keeping with the resources and infrastructures the country could make use of. It was a two-pronged strategy involving thrust on natural and agricultural resources on the one hand, and on the other, upgrading labour-intensive manufacturing. China, along with some East Asian countries, benefited from the rise in regional economic integration through the development of cross-country production networks through vertical integration of production chains.It is strategising that is the most important issue, and to do that, intensive research is required to identify which model to stick to. Also this would require product and market-specific studies to be able to tell the strengths and weaknesses in respective areas. However, considering the trends of Bangladesh's exports, it is not too difficult to identify some potential and prospective products, and although there are provisions of fiscal and other incentives for them, the fact remains that these supports are of little use in the absence of a medium-to-long-term strategy to stimulate the products with a robust supply chain. That is to say, facilitation does not mean incentives alone but also drawing up and working on a roadmap for product development and putting in place institutional and infrastructural support in an appropriate manner.For quite sometime, Bangladesh's export basket comprises a core group of products besides RMG. These include: jute and jute goods, leather and leather goods, frozen foods including shrimp, agro-processed foods, cement, pharmaceuticals etc. Over a decade or so, few other products have demonstrated great potential, such as-- shipbuilding, ICT, light engineering, plastic. The government does recognise the importance of the emerging items, but whatever facilities they received remained confined to fiscal incentives.It is thus strategising the roadmap that must be at a focal point when it comes to export diversification.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The offer comes apparently unexpectedly as India promises Bangladesh free transit facility through her territory for exports to third countries. This is the opportunity land-locked Nepal and Bhutan have been looking for, for years, to use Bangladesh's seaports for their international trade.New Delhi's transit offer, recorded in the joint statement issued on conclusion of the Bangladesh premier's visit to India last week, should make the Bangladeshi business community excited about the prospect of exporting goods through India to third countries. This is certainly going to open up a new chapter of regional trade.Also the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) had, during the 16th summit in Thimphu in 2010, unanimously acknowledged the importance of developing transport infrastructure and transit facilities, as a means to promoting intra-SAARC trade. This time around, the offer is made bilaterally, something that India always prefers for her foreign policy pursuits. To be specific, the pledge to allow transit though India is the outcome of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.So, now is the time to translate the Indian leader's political commitment into reality. Why won't Bangladesh and other stakeholders take advantage of India's transit offer, and that too without any tariff, for exporting and importing goods at the lowest possible costs!Very important decisions taken at the bureaucratic level to facilitate trade and business people's aspirations of increasing inter-country trade don't carry much real-life value when there is a lack of political will. Inversely, high-level decisions with explicit political commitment need to be followed up with actions on the ground.Thus Dhaka has a special role to play in transforming Delhi's assurance of third country transit into a day-to-day affair of clearing Bangladeshi consignments of exportable goods to another country at Indian checkpoints. For Bangladesh, third country via Indian territory means not just Nepal and Bhutan, but also Sri Lanka, Pakistan and even China, the countries that have borders with India but not with Bangladesh.Opportunities are up for grabbing, as, according to the joint statement, Bangladesh's businessmen have been invited to use India's port infrastructure for transshipment to third countries. A Nepali member of parliament told this scribe during a recent visit to Kathmandu that they are interested in importing a number of Bangladeshi products such as sea fish, fertiliser, ceramic items and readymade garments and traditional sarees. That's feasible only if India allows the transportation to and from Bangladesh through the 16-mile Indian corridor called chicken neck. Bangladeshi sea ports are also ready for use by Nepal and Bhutan for their external trade.Furthermore, as a former foreign secretary has pointed out, Bangladesh has the scope to get connected to a greater economic corridor. It will then be able to send trucks carrying goods to and from China through the Indian state of Sikkim if the Modi administration's transit offer means serious business. In that case, Bangladeshi exports and imports to and from Pakistan may also be possible through roads since India has trading relations with her nuclear rival.Before the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnah said yes when a Reuters journalist asked him if he would 'demand a corridor through Hindustan connecting the Eastern and Western Pakistan States'. Such transit facility through India has never been operational since it's the issue of a single country. Now, the Indian authorities are for use of territory of Bangladesh created through dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971 for transportation of goods from India's one part to another.Delhi's latest proposal for providing transit to Bangladesh to a third country may prove to be a game changer, if it is implemented. It's also expected that the Indian public servants at both diplomatic and operational levels respect their government's promise in writing, in bringing changes in trade relations among the countries of the region.On Bangladesh's behalf, the public officials and direct beneficiaries of the transit facility should engage with their counterparts in India and each of the third-country trading partners to take initiatives for trade transactions through Indian territory. Small consignments under this facility today may start the process of increasing the volumes of trade manifold within South Asia to take regional trade to an extraordinary level in the future. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
