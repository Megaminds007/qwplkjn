Unprecedented bushfires, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and Novak Djokovic\u2019s unsavoury deportation over his unvaccinated status marred the competition in each of the previous three years. But come Monday, as the 2023 edition of the tournament gets underway, the season\u2019s first Major looks set to regain its free-spiritedness. So unshackled is the atmosphere that even COVID-positive players can compete, a far cry from the happenings of the last two years. It is expected that the on-court action would march in step, despite the absence of the now-retired duo of Roger Federer and Ash Barty, two-time Australian Open women\u2019s singles champion Naomi Osaka, and the reigning men\u2019s World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic\u2019s mere presence makes him the automatic favourite, for Melbourne is to him what Paris is to Rafael Nadal. The Serb has won the event nine times, an Open Era record, and was undefeated in his last 21 matches at the site. He has also warmed up well by securing the tune-up in Adelaide after saving a match-point in the final against Sebastian Korda. Nadal \u2014 the top seed, defending champion and a men\u2019s record 22-time Major winner \u2014 looks underprepared, but as the Spaniard proved in 2022, he is not one to be discounted.Among women, all eyes will be on World No.1 and three-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek. A disappointing loss to Jessica Pegula in the United Cup and a right shoulder injury may have affected her preparations, but the Pole is still the player to beat. Second seed Ons Jabeur, who has emerged as a solid all-court threat, will look for her maiden Slam title after finishing as runner-up at the Wimbledon and US Open last year. The championship will also be an opportunity for the next rung of players to stake claim as the stranglehold of the \u2018Big Three\u2019 (Federer, Nadal and Djokovic) will only loosen going forward and the women\u2019s game has already moved into the post-Barty, post-Serena Williams era. Daniil Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion and a two-time finalist in Australia; Casper Ruud, runner-up at two of the four Majors in 2022; Stefanos Tsitsipas; and Felix Auger-Aliassime will all want to come good. So will the in-form American Pegula, also the third seed; Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia; Belarus\u2019s Aryna Sabalenka; and the continuously rising Coco Gauff.",

        "full_article": "It is fairly well-known that parliamentary legislation is subject to two limitations under the Constitution of India. One is by judicial review, or the power of constitutional courts to review legislation for possible violation of any fundamental right. Another is that no amendment to the Constitution should have the effect of destroying any of its basic features. While the first limitation is set out in Article 13, under which laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights are void, the second limitation is based on the \u2018basic structure\u2019 doctrine evolved by the Supreme Court. Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar\u2019s remarks questioning the basic structure doctrine propounded in the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) does not reflect the correct position of law. In his view, the basic structure doctrine has usurped parliamentary sovereignty and goes against the democratic imperative that the elected legislature should reign supreme. His particular concern seems justified: that the Supreme Court prevented the National Judicial Appointments Commission, a body to appoint judges to the superior courts in the country, from coming into existence by striking down the relevant amendment to the Constitution and a parliamentary law to give effect to it. But it is difficult not to see his attack on the basic structure doctrine as part of the current dispensation\u2019s tirade against the judiciary and its grievance that it does not have enough say in the appointment of judges.The idea that the basic structure doctrine undermines parliamentary sovereignty is simply wrong. Parliament is sovereign in its domain, but it is still bound by the limitations imposed by the Constitution. Mr. Dhankhar seems to have a problem with any sort of limitation on Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction to amend the Constitution. Surely, he could not have forgotten that the basic structure doctrine had helped save the Constitution from being undermined through the misuse of parliamentary majority. The main purpose of the doctrine is to ensure that some fundamental features of the Constitution are not legislated out of existence. It has been invoked to strike down amendments only in a few cases, but many others have survived basic structure challenges. Parliamentary majority is transient, but essential features of the Constitution such as the rule of law, parliamentary form of government, separation of powers, the idea of equality, and free and fair elections ought to be perennially protected from legislative excess. It may be open to a new Constituent Assembly to come up with another constitution that changes these fundamental concepts, but a legislature formed under the current Constitution cannot be allowed to change its core identity.",

        "full_article": "Joshimath is sinking. Why? One reason is that the town came up on landslide debris, which was unable to bear the load of houses and roads. Another is that it\u2019s located in a seismically active neighbourhood, and Joshimath itself lies next to a fault line. Also, because the rocks are so young, rain and snow melt percolate within, creating aquifers beneath the surface.\nSpot the cracks: Pressure to reduce carbon, provide water and create jobs has led to a warped model\nThen there are the dams. The Tapovan Vishnugad Hydroelectric project lies a few kilometres away from the town. In 2009, a tunnel boring machine employed in this project punctured an underground aquifer and released about 60-70 million litres of water daily for nearly a month! That\u2019s an astounding volume of water \u2014 about 5,000 Airbus A-320s worth \u2014 that used to sit below the ground. When that water was released, the land over it could potentially sink \u2014 almost like a slowly deflating balloon. Next, when we build roads or houses, we blast the hills to flatten out the land and clear trees. Blasting destabilises land. Tree roots act like scaffolding holding onto the land on steep slopes. When we remove them and intense rain falls on a bald slope, it can pull it downward. Finally, water seeping from the soak pits in Joshimath adds to the water-earth merry-go-round of this land. Taken together, we see this sinking was to be expected.\nAnd it was. We\u2019ve been warned of these dangers many times. By protests and reports over the decades. By landslides, flash floods, lost lives and now, by cracked roads and houses. And the malaise is spreading: There is more water gushing out of one of those cracks and houses in nearby Karnaprayag have recently developed cracks. With the media frenzy, political leaders have to be seen to act. Families have been moved to a safer place and there is talk of compensation amid razing unsafe structures and resettling families. Even as human stories emerge \u2014 a lifetime of earnings slipping through the cracks, of resettlement and forced migration (these will become repetitive themes on a larger scale as the climate warms) \u2014 let us consider the root causes of the problem. They pertain to the need to reduce carbon, provide water and create jobs within India\u2019s democratic realities.\nClimate ambition first. India has promised to increase the share of electricity capacity from non-fossil sources from 42% today to 50% by 2030. To do this, India is amping up its solar, wind and to a smaller extent, hydropower capacities. Energy experts believe several more gigawatts of hydro will need to be added by 2030 to stick to our decarbonising goals. That could be dicey given the existing problems with hydro. Of course, we could bring down our carbon footprint in other ways. For example, with agriculture using a good chunk of India\u2019s electricity, we could ask those using agricultural connections (not always farmers) to pay fairly for the electricity, which would better manage demand (and save groundwater). But few politicians will risk being branded anti-farmer by doing this. Moreover, hydropower is alluring for other reasons. Energy can be stored in water and quickly released, making hydro far better for meeting peak loads than the more variable solar and wind. The rent-seeking possibilities with construction can be politically salient. Dams provide drinking water. Everything needed to build a dam is available within the country \u2014 important in a geopolitically unsettled world. Lastly, dams are a concrete (pun intended) symbol of development. When someone asks what a leader did for people, s/he can point to the dam.\nMoving to roads. The people living in the hill tracts of Uttarakhand have few employment opportunities, and look to elected leaders to correct this. Enter religious tourism and the roads and hotels built to cater to it, which provide livelihoods that people asked for. Reducing the number of tourists while preserving jobs is akin to saying the grace of Lord Badrinath is only for those who can afford a helicopter flight. Not realistic. Reducing the tourism revenue overall means fewer livelihoods. Not politically acceptable. And so, we are stuck. To get unstuck, let us (rightly) descry dams and roads built in sensitive areas, but also ask how Delhi can do without Tehri\u2019s water in May 2023, how to secure livelihoods of Joshimath\u2019s residents, how to supply low-carbon stable electricity in a raucous democracy. But with the climate changing, the equilibrium is shifting. Who wants a dam that is overwhelmed by constant flooding and who wants to travel on roads which can slip away? The end of this road is approaching, and a new path where roads and homes are built more thoughtfully, fewer dams in fragile areas and better managing how our electricity is consumed and our water managed, is emerging. Down that path lies Joshimath\u2019s salvation, but will we walk it?\n\n",

        "full_article": "As per recent reports, India ranks third in the world for research, seventh for highly cited papers and tenth for patent filings. One must see these figures in light of the fact that India has just around 250 scientists/researchers per million population (the lowest even among the smaller Asian countries) and ranks 40th in the Global Innovation Index 2022. Therefore, the two issues India needs to address as part of 2022-23 budget allocations are: increasing the scientific base for research and strengthening our deep-technology innovation ecosystem. Innovation is all about generating value for knowledge. So how do we achieve these objectives? Here are three pointers.\nTime to tap the potential: India\u2019s successful space programme shows the talent of its scientists\n1. Increased spending on higher education: India has been expanding on the higher education system without a proportionate increase in budgets. In comparison, China spends more money on two of its premier institutions (Tsinghua and Peking Universities) than the entire higher education budget of the ministry of education. This low spending eventually affects quality. A closer analysis of world university rankings data as published by FAST India, a thinktank, shows that top 100 universities have average funds double those of universities in the next 100 positions and triple of universities in the positions 201-300. Given these challenges with funding and the lack of a financial model for our public-funded academic institutions, our premier institutions never had any motivation to increase their student intake and expand on their own. The only two times we have had a major increase in student numbers is once while implementing the Mandal commission and the second time during the EWS quota implementation. Both times, there weren\u2019t any significant budget allocations for infrastructure development. Since government funding is not based on any of the institutional metrics of excellence or expansion, every increase in student numbers comes at a cost of quality. It\u2019s therefore important to allocate higher resources as a percentage of GDP (at least 2% as compared to the current 0.7% on R&D) and spend this money wisely for expansion and excellence through formation of a higher education commission comprising leading academics and institution builders in the country.\n2. Mandate industry spending for R&D in academia: Higher education in India is highly siloed and fragmented. While the recent National Education Policy (NEP) is a step in the right direction, without additional fund allocation for its implementation, it\u2019s going to be a herculean task to see NEP implemented in the right spirit in our institutions. Innovation thrives when \u2018unlike\u2019 minds come together\u2014 unlike in terms of attitudes, disciplines, and cultures. One way to do this is by mandating industries to spend a certain percentage of their profits for R&D in academic institutions. Unless such a mandate is made, industry-academia collaborations, as our track record shows, will never take off. Eventually, such a mandate will also help in the long-term sustainability of both academia as well as the industry. There is a lot of latent talent in Indian academia, which is hardly utilised for societal benefit. Despite the low spending for R&D and our siloed approach, if India can rank third in the world for knowledge generation, build successful space, defence, and atomic energy programmes, make India self-sufficient in foodgrain production, and even help the country fight the Covid pandemic, it\u2019s Indian scientists who need to be applauded.\n3. Allocate funds to ministries to collaborate with academia: The transformation of US universities had started with the Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862 which mandated universities in the US to solve the problems of society. NEP launched in 2020 could be our Morrill moment. This will not happen if we do not restructure our R&D funding models. Ministries which work with grassroot problems need to engage academia. The National Research Foundation (NRF), which is yet to be established as per NEP, must have part of its funds channelled through the allied ministries with clear problem statements. While basic research must be encouraged to a higher level, the funding for addressing societal problems must come from allied ministries and industries. The framework for interoperability of different ministries with academia must be well defined and implemented. The structural, operational and the financial commitments of this framework must be prioritised as part of the budgetary allocations. NRF, with the involvement of the allied ministries, industries, and start-ups can drive the innovation ecosystem in the country.\nA lot of untapped potential exists in Indian academic institutions. Providing them sufficient funding and tweaking the national R&D funding models can turn our institutions into world-class centres of excellence. The road to an Atmanirbhar Bharat passes through our academic institutions. The sooner we realise this, the faster will be our transition to a developed economy.\n\u00a0\n\n",

HC cited Constitution\u2019s Article 246 to conclude that CAPF personnel fall under the definition of armed forces and, thereby, are eligible for guaranteed pensions. The background to the judgment is that central government personnel who joined in January 2004 onwards are not eligible for OPS. Instead, they are grouped under the national pension scheme (NPS), which functions on the lines of EPF. There are no guaranteed payouts in NPS and the benefits that accrue to pensioners depend on the returns generated by their investments.\nHC\u2019s ruling is inconsistent with reality. A GoI written response in Parliament said that CAPF personnel who joined since January 2004 have been part of NPS. It\u2019s a situation where bureaucratic sloppiness in drafting notifications has led to a judicial verdict at odds with reality. GoI needs to appeal and get matters sorted. Separately, it\u2019s important that Parliament has a discussion on the perils of reckless promises on reversion to OPS. It took a rare moment of unanimity among major political parties to shift to NPS, and its implementation spanned two governments.\nIt\u2019s not just GoI, most states voluntarily shifted to NPS because OPS is fiscally unsustainable. Therefore, Himachal Pradesh government\u2019s decision to revert to OPS will undermine the state\u2019s fiscal position and cut into other development spending. GoI, which sets annual borrowing limits for states, needs to deal with this issue at a political level. Many richer countries find themselves in a fiscal straitjacket on account of crushing pension burdens. India\u2019s transition to NPS happened at the right time and it\u2019s now important to stick to it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A city as large as Dhaka cannot have just one detailed plan for all its areas. It should, instead, plan the expanding and newly claimed areas that are inevitably surrendering to urban use, especially in terms of informal settlements lacking in infrastructure and amenities, irrespective of rules and regulations.\nHowever, the recent Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for Dhaka has no plans for its 18 central sub-areas and eight expanding sub-areas, even though sub-areas should have detailed plans showing its permissible uses, types of developments, amenity locations, and right of way for transportation. The DAP could also plan already-planned areas, the uses of which have deviated, diversified or intensified, such as Tejgaon or Motijheel.\nOf the many policies and strategies in DAP, density control (which involves building fewer houses) has been highly contested. Urban density, referring to the number of people inhabiting a given urbanised area, does not only refer to residential areas but looks at a broader spectrum. It describes urban phenomena, and different phenomena can result from the same density. Thus, it hides more than it reveals \u2013 examples include overcrowding,high plot coverage, ghost cities, and large apartments with low ground coverage and small residential shares.\u00a0None of these can be justified for a city like Dhaka.\nIn the current DAP, the meaning of \"density\" is missing. Is it the volume, building heights, or the numbers of people? One person's high density may be another's sprawl; the same tall building may be oppressive or exhilarating; a \"good crowd\" for one can be \"overcrowded\" for another. Population densities vary, as the numbers of people in a neighbourhood at a given time include those who work there or are visiting, making the same precinct dense during work hours and empty on weekends. Density fluctuates with functionality. In mixed-use neighbourhoods, residents are not alone; people move from place to place, creating density rhythms.\nUrban density is important for a city's functions. A 2020 study concluded that density boosts productivity and innovation, improves access to services, reduces typical travel distances, encourages energy efficient construction and transport, and allows amenity sharing. There is also the complexity of street-life density of jobs and visitors, functional mix, car dependency, mobility and walkability. What is often overlooked is that an urban \"buzz\" can deliver huge socio-economic benefits. Therefore, many planners advocate higher densities, as cities operate more efficiently when residents live closer.\nSustainability has many components relevant to planners, the most important being how people move around. Dense cities have greater options. Cities lack sustainability and quality of life if they expand without smart planning and depend on cars as the primary mode of transport. This generates sprawl characterised by road-dependent developments, increased air pollution, and expensive municipal services (cheaper only in dense, multi-functional developments).\nMuch of urban planning theory has been premised on raising densities along with new urbanism, smart growth, transit-oriented development, etc. All these, except densification, have been considered in the new DAP, even though urban experts argue that low-density dispersed car-dependent cities are unsustainable, and high-density cities are more efficient.\nThe DAP also presumes that the city cannot provide utilities to the projected population of 31 million in 2035. Both of these are contentious ideas. It is the main planning objective, as well as the authorities' responsibility and citizens' right, that the government provide all basic necessities \u2013 they cannot be denied on the premise of incapacity. This should have been established at the Structure Plan level. Urban area plans under it should list strategies to implement policy, and the DAP should show how they can be implemented at the local level.\nBoth the 1981 and 1995 Plans suggested the densification of Dhaka, as more people could be accommodated within its conurbation with existing infrastructure. Floor area ratio (FAR), the commonest measure of density, and the number of dwelling units, have to be viewed in conjunction with ground coverage, unit size, family size, residential density, employment density, etc.\nWith the same FAR, it is possible to build high-rise low-density buildings, or low-rise high-density ones. Building height is not a measure of density, although sometimes the two align. However, confusions abound here, since the current DAP is equating FAR with dwellings/acres to control population, a blunt measure that neither assesses population nor building densities, unless the sizes of dwellings and households are defined.\nThe greatest fallacy of the DAP's philosophy \u2013 building less houses \u2013 cannot deter in-migration; all literature on the topic suggest it will encourage informal settlements, urban sprawl and the filling up of water bodies. People come to the city for predominantly economic reasons, and a majority of them resort to informal settlements or\u00a0bostis. Only a national socio-economic plan can ensure a situation to prevent this, which is beyond the scope of the DAP or Structure Plan. Various modelling suggest that Dhaka could become a city of 31 million people by 2035. Add to it the climate migrants created by sea level rise and other calamities. Southern Bangladesh being the most vulnerable in this regard, there will be a few million extra destitute people in Dhaka by then.\nDhaka's\u00a0bostis\u00a0can have deplorable and unacceptable conditions. Yet, we cannot remove them without providing humane solutions, and eradicating the conditions that force such degradation. Unfortunately, the DAP refused to even recognise the term \"slum\", saying it is \"controversial\", and that it \"wished\" for the development of \"affordable housing\".\nThe question is, affordable by whom? Readers can recall the gentrification of Bhashantek as part of a government project to build houses for urban slum dwellers, which ended up pushing most of them out from the area since they could no longer afford the housing there.\nAt the end of the day, the ill-conceived plan for limiting Dhaka's population will ultimately be devastating for the urban scenario of Bangladesh, as well as the socioeconomic situation of a large portion of the population.\nProf Mohammed Mahbubur Rahman\u00a0is an architect, urban planner and Pro-VC of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology\n\n",

        "full_article": "Quality education is the backbone of a wholesome and prosperous society. But finding the \"quality\" in quality education continues to be elusive in Bangladesh. The \"so called\" universities (more like community colleges) are rife with social, economic, political and ideological problems that work against building learning organisations. Teachers, the kingpins, don the mantle of educators but have little to show in their academic profiles. For today's new generation of hungry learners, seeking to be actively engaged with illustrious minds, their classroom experience is simply frustrating, backdated, irrelevant, and unpalatable.\nHence the following student comment: \"I don't know why I was present in the class; boredom was at its peak; teacher was not prepared for the class\u2026 Many teachers are toppers of their batches, but they cannot teach. After the first week, most students are lost in a black hole.\"\nWhere is the accountability? Teaching is not just about content and delivery; it is also about human interaction and connectivity, keeping an open mind, creating a positive ambiance, sharing perspective and skepticism, and maintaining a sense of humour \u2013 all interspersed with patience, commitment, flexibility, compassion, hope, and a great deal of creativity. The failure of academia to meet the needs of today's learners is already ushering in dramatic change.\nFor example, technology is changing the educational landscape. Imagine a day in the future when AI, robotics and corporate innovators will develop personal learning programmes (PLPs) catering to the individual learner. With corporate sponsorship, the PLPs will train and craft employees fitted to their needs. Computers will adapt to individual learning capacities, eliminating the competition for a GPA 5 that generally produces parrots! Will our universities be able to compete in this environment?\nUniversity degrees, providing little value, may in fact be on their way out. Today's learners are more interested in skills. Hence the emergence of Coursera, working with universities, offering MOOCs (massive open online courses) with certification programmes. Other similar organisations like Udemy, EdX, Udacity, Skillshare, MindValley, LinkedIn Learning, and Google platforms are fast evolving, seeking the sweet spot to cater better to different learner segments. Many are finding a Microsoft certification far more valuable and less costly than a local university degree.\nThe Internet is also opening up creative educational programmes abroad where learners see clear value addition. Why would they seek a local degree? With Google Classrooms to Zoom, MS Teams, Moodle, and much more, the opportunity to craft one's skills is now far greater. In fact, smart students abroad are already selecting courses and crafting their own majors aligned with their interests and changing global needs. In Bangladesh, once a student enters an academic track (a major), there is no way out: the student is literally trapped, even if she finds the subject remotely close to her interests. Our universities have still not found a way out for the \"trapped\" and \"paying\" student to pursue her dreams.\nOne can be fairly confident that the power of private enterprise will make alternate learning platforms stronger and far more creative in the days to come. Private bodies are already emerging to provide focused training in Bangladesh \u2013 training that the market demands but that our universities have failed to anticipate in making learning more useful and contextual.\nChange is coming at us with increasing velocity. Where is the discussion on how these changes will affect our education system? How are we preparing our students for the imminent changes? The volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous future hurtling towards us appears to ruffle few academic feathers, secure in their unproductive \"tenured\" (guaranteed) positions.\nWe have already lost significant returns from Bangladesh's demographic dividend because of a poor education system. Substantive changes are needed here if we are to train, brain and unchain our learners. Unfortunately, a vested class of incompetent people who rule the roost in education revel in their power base but display a dearth of ideas and an unwillingness to confront and shape change, while the nation remains shackled. If this state of affairs continues, \"outsourcing\" the training of our youth will grow while our universities languish.\nIt is time for our education to become future-oriented by liberating our learners to go forth into the world with skills, confidence, imagination and enthusiasm. A \"new education\" \u2013 rising from a Schumpeterian creative destruction process \u2013 is in order for Bangladesh to explore the opportunities and meet the challenges that lie ahead. We need to think comprehensively and holistically to fix the education system and enable Bangladesh to attain its goals of a developed nation. Without quality, relevant and value-added education, I'm afraid, our education system will fade into obscurity.\nThe UGC and other educational bodies of influence ought to consider the imminent changes in their planning horizons and lead a conversation on \"What will education look like in 25 years? How should we prepare for it? How can we make our students future-ready?\" The proposal is not academic; it is imperative.\nSyed Saad Andaleeb\u00a0is\u00a0former Vice Chancellor of BRAC University and Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Pennsylvania State University.

RTI is a high-thought activity to be undertaken by intellectuals. What would a marginalised person do by knowing this law?\"\nThese angry questions were directed to an RTI worker by the deputy commissioner of a northern district of Bangladesh.\nAnother senior official once asked an RTI applicant: \"What are you going to do with the information? Why do you want it? Who motivated you to show such a daring attitude? You are going to be in deep trouble if you keep seeking information from government officers.\"\nSuch remarks dominate the experiences of RTI applicants, activists and promotors throughout the country. Barring a few instances of encouragement that help to keep the RTI law moving, we mostly see a continuing lack of understanding among many public officials about the basic objectives of the law, thereby impeding its application.\nWorryingly, more than a decade after its adoption, the purpose of the law is still not clear to them. They fail to understand that seeking information from public offices is only a means to a larger end \u2013 that of better governance. The law, in fact, seeks to engage citizens in monitoring the work of public offices. Hence, seeking information is not only a\u00a0right\u00a0of citizens, but also a civic\u00a0duty.\nThe preamble to the RTI Act underscores two clear goals of the law. One, to concretise the fundamental provision of our constitution that all powers of the state belong to the people; and two, to empower citizens to play a role in establishing transparency and accountability in the work of all public offices so that governance is improved, and corruption is reduced.\nTo achieve these goals, the Act provides a legal basis for citizens to access information held by the government or other public offices, except some exempted categories, such as those related to national and public security, international relations, law enforcement, etc. In doing so, it confers a responsibility on citizens to engage with public bodies to advance the objectives of the law. It is thus inherently an active law, not a passive or reflexive one. Citizens must use it to obtain its benefits.\nFrom this perspective, the RTI law may be seen as an additional pillar of democracy in the country, similar to election law, since both are meant to strengthen democracy. Election law allows citizens to elect their representative to govern on their behalf, thus providing for indirect participation by the people in the governance of the country. RTI law allows for direct participation. By using it, citizens exercise a monitoring role over public officials. As a result, both are important for participatory democracy. Although one complements the other, RTI law is often more useful when election laws falter.\nSuch an understanding of the law makes its implementation easier. It can be applied by citizens not only to obtain specific information from public offices, but also to fulfil a civic responsibility \u2013 of enhancing interactions with public authorities, helping those authorities overcome their traditional ruler-ruled mindset, inculcating a value of openness in their work, and promoting their accountability to the people. There could be no better recipe to improve governance.\nFrom this perspective, RTI requests may be seen as helping public officials realise that times have changed, and they must adjust to the new reality. Understandably, this change of attitude takes time, but global experiences show that after initial unease in terms of dealing with demands from ordinary citizens, the stance of public officials begins to change. More so, when they discover that most RTI laws make it mandatory to provide any information held by them (except for the exempted categories). The law also provides for sanctions against disobedience. While applicants are not required under the law to give reasons for seeking information, the Act obliges public authorities to do so if they fail to supply them. The RTI Act has clearly been designed as a citizen's law.\nThe Information Commission, the putative guardian of the law, must also recognise the predominance of citizens' interests under the law. The Commission has been known to ask complainants of the reasons for seeking the requested information, forgetting the mandatory provision of the law, and the importance of citizens' use of the law in a democracy, whatever their motive (unless, of course, they are clearly abusive).\nIt is time that all of us \u2013 citizens, public officials and the nation as a whole \u2013 recognise the immense value of the RTI Act to enhance democracy and good governance. To obtain its full benefit, we must develop a proper understanding of its objectives, as clearly delineated both in the spirit and text of the law.\nAs the nation makes progress in various areas of national development, we must also ensure proper implementation of the RTI Act, the basic principles of which have been duly recognised in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which Bangladesh fully endorsed.\nShamsul Bari\u00a0and\u00a0Ruhi Naz\u00a0are Chairman and Assistant Director (RTI) respectively of Research Initiatives, Bangladesh, RIB.\n\n",

The stellar presence of Nobel laureates, Booker International, Booker Prize, Oscar, and Masterchef winners, among others, made the 10th edition of the DLF truly exceptional. Neither the coronavirus-inflicted hiatus of three years nor the exceptionally fog-canopied cold weather could dampen the spirit of the fest. Dhaka won the hearts of the visitors, as is evident in their many complimentary remarks. And there was much to learn from visitors themselves.\nIn its 150-plus sessions, participated in by 500 speakers and panellists, the four-day event celebrated the theme of coming together through stories. We heard stories of different kinds \u2013 of sports and music, of genres and genders, of struggles and survivals, of place and memory, of humans and non-humans. Above all, we heard stories of the triumphs of science \u2013 innovations that helped us navigate through the pandemic. We also heard about the importance of stories \u2013 both big and small. We heard how travelling to Dhaka changed the minds of our honoured visitors; how the event put us on a global map.\nMeeting the writers and thinkers in person, who have the special ability to present the world in words, asking them questions on specific issues, sharing a selfie moment or getting a copy of their book signed are all part of the DLF package. The ambience was great, with a lot of screenings, interactive sessions, activity corners for children, mind-blowing performances, and a wide range of book and food stalls. The only glitch in the system was the introduction of tickets for the first time. The price was deemed too much and social media became divided in its characterisation of DLF as an \"elite fest.\"\nIn their pre-event press conference, one of the three directors of DLF, Kazi Anis Ahmed, mentioned that the subscription was needed to reduce the dependency on corporate sponsorship. But critics seemed unconvinced and unsatisfied. They sensed a deep-seated conspiracy to turn culture and literature into a profiteering scheme.\nThe commodification of art is a notorious topic. While the sensory perception of artwork, painting, or sculpture initiates a cognitive and emotional process, paying for such an experience is another ballgame. Art has traditionally benefited from a culture of patronage. People in positions of power have historically funded artists to outfit their homes or homelands and writers to narrate their lives and experiences. The Medici family, for instance, was responsible for the majority of Florentine art during the Italian renaissance. The same can be said about the Nauratnas (nine gems) in the courts of the Hindu emperor Vikramaditya, the Mughal emperor Akbar, and the feudal lord Raja Krishnachandra.\nHowever, some artists are not willing to put a price tag on their creativity.\nThe nature of the sponsors has changed over the years. From the religious commissioning of churches to charitable foundations, and from the sponsorship of aristocrats to that of plutocrats, there has been a radical shift in the artistic and literary world. With the hefty inflation of art prices and the celebrity status assumed by writers, the shift involves an obscene amount of money.\nDLF is an expensive affair. I am not in a position to comment on how much of a ticketing fee is right to make an event of the stature of DLF viable. I am rather interested in a tangential strain of thought I picked up during this meeting of minds.\nTwo young members of the audience, at a session on climate change on the first day of DLF, objected to the playful tone of the panellists. One compared the scenario to that of the musicians who played their instruments to calm the passengers of the Titanic in the ship's final moments of sinking. Is the aesthetic response of artists, to offer therapeutic or cathartic readerly experience, enough to address the \"doomed\" Earth? The second comment was more direct, as a young woman felt that we should simply pursue climate activism like Greta Thunberg does.\nThese questions challenge the validity of art at a time when the planet we share with other species is dying due to the irresponsibility and indifference of humans. While artists have been expanding the scope of social conversation by shaping the imagination of their readers and viewers about the nonhuman world, climate activists have long felt that it is not enough to keep on beating the old drum of ethical responsibility in an imaginative space.\nLast October, climate activists across the globe started a unique protest by glueing themselves to several iconic art pieces in European museums to raise awareness about climate change. Two groups of young activists, under the banners of Ultima Generazione and Just Stop Oil, vandalised many paintings to point out, \"Maybe they don't understand that the inconvenience we created is nothing compared to one billion climate migrants and the many deaths that the climate crisis is causing already.\"\nIs it possible for art to be an ally in promoting the climate conversation?\nAmitav Ghosh, who attended DLF as one of the featured authors, recalled how his ancestral homes kept changing with the changing course of the River Padma. The vulnerability he faced as a climate migrant had a lasting impact on his creative and intellectual makeup. His novels have been instrumental in expanding the social conversation about climate change by inviting his readers to imaginatively engage with the world that we inhabit. His work inspires us to retool our inner climate while acknowledging the fear and guilt that dominates the climate conversation.\nThe two young individuals who asked the questions during the aforementioned DLF session seemed less convinced that art and artists are doing enough to save the world.\nIn another session featuring Amitav Ghosh and Abdulrazak Gurnah, a 15-year-old schoolboy stood up to ask what advice the panel has for their 15-year-old selves. The panellists ducked the query.\nFor me, these questions by our young generation have been the highlights of DLF 2023. The fest provided a space where the current generation can rise to the occasion and raise questions. Such space is more and more getting squeezed in Dhaka. DLF, with its international orientation, opened it up.\nWe must curate many such moments and occasions. I am sure by now DLF has created many friends who can take up a financial plan to make the greatest show in Dhaka easily accessible. It is important that our young generation gets exposed to the best minds and can then prepare to be the best versions of themselves.\nDr\u00a0Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is a professor of English at Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The home minister's statement in parliament that the government has taken the initiative to launch an \"Integrated Lawful Interception System\" to monitor social media is as chilling as it gets. It appears to be part of ongoing efforts to increase the government's surveillance capacity to \"prevent anti-state and anti-government activities\". The legal cover potentially serves as a protection against any legal challenges in this regard. Moreover, we're told that modern technology like Open Source Intelligence Technology (OSINT) has already been included in the arsenal of the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre (NTMC) for the same purpose.\nThere is nothing to rejoice at the vibe coming off the floor of parliament. Publicly acknowledged or not, any effort by state actors to intercept communications lends itself to the suspicion, by now well-justified, that it might be abused. The gap between interception and legal interception has always been thin and at times blurred. And when terms like \"anti-state\" and \"anti-government\" \u2013 which, in Bangladesh, have been mostly a byword for political repression \u2013 are thrown around to justify it, we have more than enough reasons to be wary of such initiatives.\nThe home minister says that there are local and foreign conspiracies afoot that must be thwarted to protect the interests of the country. We can't argue against that. But \"anti-government\" is not necessarily \"anti-state\", and \"anti-state\", without a clear, acceptable definition, has been known to be used interchangeably with the former to muzzle the voices of critics. Citizens would like to have the assurance that this will not be repeated. They would like to have a clear picture of said conspiracies \u2013 which is seldom given, however \u2013 and a reliable, transparent mechanism to deal with that.\nUnfortunately, while the government seems keen to increase its surveillance capacity, it doesn't seem to believe that gaining public trust in the process is as important. Last week, Haaretz, an influential Israeli newspaper, reported that Bangladesh had purchased advanced surveillance equipment including a \"Vehicle Mounted Mobile Interceptor\" from an Israeli company, despite the two countries having no diplomatic ties. One can hardly expect any accountability of the use of spyware collected through such dubious methods. The new interception system adds to the government's growing arsenal of surveillance tools. It can, using OSINT, track mobile and land-line phones to identify/locate suspects. It has devices for remote interception of calls, content blocking and filtering, etc.\nSo much effort to increase digital surveillance \u2013 but what about people's right to privacy? Where is the initiative to protect and promote it? Even if used for a public purpose, can citizens trust that these tools and systems will be handled responsibly without encroaching on our fundamental rights? The government must answer these questions, and must be very convincing in that. There is already deep-seated resentment against its handling of social media rights and issues, because of repressive laws and practices. It must try to improve the situation.\n",

        "full_article": "In the global imagination, Bangladeshi RMG factories are the hotbeds of worker exploitation. However, while there are justifiable criticisms of the apparel industry, which has systematically failed to address workers' rights violations and ensure dignified wages, what is often overlooked in international discourses is the complicity of the global brands in enabling such terrible conditions.\nA recent survey of 1,000 Bangladeshi factories making garments for global brands highlights that more than half of the factories were subjected to order cancellations, refusal to pay, price reductions or delayed payment for goods during the pandemic. This resulted in massive job losses, lower wages for workers, and high staff turnover, with one in five factories reporting they could not even pay the legal minimum wage as a result. At the height of the pandemic, when no alternative employment opportunities were available, over 26 percent of the total workforce were simply left to fend for themselves \u2013 or rather, starve to death \u2013 without so much as payment of due benefits.\nThe study shows that many big brands, including H&M, Inditex, Primark, C&A, Gap, and Walmart, engaged in such dubious practices. The bigger their influence, the more likely they were to pressurise suppliers to accept unfair terms. Of the 78 brands buying from four or more factories, 90 percent were reported as engaging in unfair practices, with 86 percent cancelling orders, 85 percent reducing the price arbitrarily, 50 percent refusing to pay for goods already in transit/production, and 85 percent delaying payment for goods already dispatched for more than three months. Seventy-two percent of brands with 15 or more suppliers were reportedly purchasing from factories at below the cost of production, while 96 percent were reported as purchasing from factories struggling to pay the minimum wage.\nEven more alarmingly, the brands did not stop these practices once the factories reopened after lockdown, and continued to pressurise suppliers for reduction of prices, despite the increase in cost of raw materials and Covid-19 mitigation measures. With suppliers consistently failing to negotiate fair terms with retailers, the burden of increased costs was inevitably pushed on to the workers, who were forced to work long hours under tremendous pressure, often without pay, to meet unrealistic targets.\nIt is unacceptable that global brands would be allowed to simply get away with such unfair practices, in the absence of any mechanism to hold them accountable. Attempts to regulate the global supply chain have thus far been met with little success, with retailers severely pushing back on any sort of binding agreements. The US and EU, which house most of these big brands, have not taken concrete steps to hold non-compliant retailers accountable, even though they regularly criticise and pressurise supplier nations to adhere to labour rights. Suppliers and supplier countries, on the other hand, are afraid to raise their concerns in case they lose orders.\nWe, therefore, need a global regulatory framework that prioritises the interests of the RMG workers. We urge all stakeholders to find a workable solution to this long-standing problem.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is visited by an approximately half a million tourists every year. The main problem they face when they come to visit is getting access to cell phone pacakages, which until now had been a major problem. Because unlike some countries in the Asian region that draw in large numbers of tourists from within and outside, there was no provision to sell mobile SIM cards to foreign visitors arriving in Bangladesh. All that is apparently set to change since the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has reportedly finalised the guidelines in this matter. The various Telecom companies have been given the green signal to launch their products catering especially to this group of people which brings in much-needed foreign exchange.If one looks at the situation in Thailand, a country which is visited by millions of tourists every year, the idea of limited-time SIMs has been around for more than a decade. There is no hassle for these inbound passengers to get a SIM either at the airport, or from designated points outside the airport. The means of verification is their passports and it takes very little time to activate the service. Little paperwork, no hassle is the name of the game here. Although Bangladesh is late coming to the realisation, the fact that BTRC has finally come round to this thinking is a piece of positive news. Although BTRC intends to make use of biometric registration for the purposes of security, it should be noted that these machines need to be made fully operational (at airports or other ports of entry) before the companies launch their products. The last thing one needs is a botched launching. It is nice to see that the operators are in discussion with the regulator on the various durations these SIMS will be operational. But given that these SIMS are destined for tourists, promotional rates need to be given that make it attractive to tourists. They are after all, valued guests to Bangladesh who inject much-needed foreign exchange into our economy. While the experience of getting a new SIM with limited duration varies from country to country in the South Asian region, Bangladesh needs to take lessons from what is happening in South-East Asia. Security concerns relating to terrorism and crime exist in those countries too. But with the availability of electronic tools to security agencies of the country, these issues can be tackled. The focus for launching such mobile packages is to give inbound tourists the ease of communication over voice and data. They are, after all, here to visit the sights and sounds that Bangladesh represents. Their experience in the country will be much more rewarding if they can spread their experiences over the various modes of the media like Facebook, instagram, etc. in real time.",

        "full_article": "Last year was marked by a big drop in the secondary trading of fixed-income tradable government securities. The value of annual secondary trading in these securities stood at Tk 1.13 trillion in 11 months of 2022. December figure is yet to be released by the central bank. The amount was Tk 1.83 trillion in 2021. Even if there had been a big amount of trading in the final month of the last year, the annual amount would stay well below the previous year's.In fact, the 11-month secondary trading of govt securities in the past year was equivalent to that of 2020. In 2020, the annual value of the secondary trading in the fixed-income securities for the first time crossed Tk 1.0-trillion mark, recording a jump by 145 per cent over the previous year and also reflecting a growing demand for secure investment options. In 2021, the secondary trading in these securities increased by 61 per cent.Though both institutions and individuals are allowed to invest in these instruments, mainly through primary dealers (PDs), participation of the latter is still small, less than 10 per cent of the total secondary trading. And more than 90 per cent are institutional investors including banks, non-bank financial institutions, insurance companies, corporations, provident funds, pension funds and mutual funds.Lack of clear knowledge and understanding of the trading patterns is one of the main barriers to the individuals investing in these securities. What is noteworthy here is that there are two types of fixed-income government securities that are tradable. One is short-term or treasury bills, another is medium- and long-term or treasury bonds. T-bills are government-issued zero-coupon debt instruments that are risk-free. There are 91-day, 182-day, and 364-day T-bills. These debt instruments are issued to address government's short-term funding needs. Treasury bonds carry periodic (half-yearly or quarterly) coupon payments with the redemption of the face value at maturity. Also known as 'vanilla bonds (meaning basic and safer bond)', there are 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20-year T-bonds available on the country's debt market.Many individuals also face difficulties as to how to invest in the treasury bonds. Though many commercial banks, including the PDs, offer service for individuals to invest in these bonds, in reality only a limited number of banks' branches provide the service.Individuals and institutions purchase these bills and bonds on the primary and secondary markets. These can also be traded on the secondary market via Trader Work Station (TWS) and over-the-counter (OTC) in the Market Infrastructure (MI) module by all manner of investors. Generally, an individual or an institution needs to open a BP ID in the MI module through a bank or NBFI. Once the ID is opened, the investor can request the bank or NBFI to purchase desired securities by depositing funds. After procuring the securities from the auction or from the secondary market, it is kept against the BP ID. Moreover, it is the bank or NBFI's responsibility to collect coupon and sale proceeds.Nevertheless, most of the banks or NBFIs find it burdensome to provide the service to individuals for obvious reasons. Unlike the savings certificates, the non-tradable fixed-income government securities, there is no commission for selling the treasury bonds. It also requires prior approval from the central bank to purchase T-bonds by individuals -- to open the BP ID which needs some extra paper work. Moreover, banks are used to selling the savings certificates for long and individuals are more interested to purchase these certificates for good returns. Anyone with a bank account and tax-identification number (TIN) can purchase the savings certificates through the bank. The savings certificates are also easy to encash when needed.Like the savings certificates, treasury bonds are also risk-free. The yields, the expected earnings generated and realised over a particular period of time, vary in terms of maturity. At the end of November 2022, the yield on 2-year T-bond was 7.49 per cent. The rates were 7.81 per cent for 5-year T-bond, 8.25 per cent for 10-year T-bond, 8.67 per cent for 15-year T-bond and 8.72 per cent for 20-year T-bond. At the same time, 364-day T-bill yield stood at 6.93 per cent and for 182-day T-bill, the rate was 6.58.It appears that medium-term debt securities offer more attractive returns. A comparison with the savings certificates may help to clear the picture. At present, the minimum profit rates for quarterly interest-bearing Sanchayapatra, 5-year Bangladesh Sanchayapatra, Poribar Sanchayapatra, and Pensioner Sanchayapatra are: 9.0 per cent, 9.50 per cent, 9.30 per cent and 9.75 per cent respectively on maturity. (The maximum profit rates are: 11.04 per cent, 11.28 per cent, 11.52 per cent, and 11.76 per cent respectively). Though these non-tradable securities offer higher return compared to T-bonds with similar maturities, the gap has been slowly narrowing over the last couple of months.The profit rates for savings certificates are also not market-based and kept high artificially. This enhances the interest-repayment burden on the government. One way to attract more people to treasury bonds is reducing the profit rates of savings certificates or make those market-based. It will help investors diversify their portfolios. The tax benefit for investing in T-bond is also there, which needs to be highlighted properly.As treasury bonds are already listed on the stock market, individuals now have the wider opportunity to invest in these debt securities. The secondary trading in these bonds on the bourse, which started last October, is still tiny. There are a number of potential buyers on the bourse whereas the number of sellers is quite small. Most of the T-bond holders are institutions and they still find disposing of those less profitable.Thus, individual's investment in T-bonds is not hassle-free even now. The policymakers need to address the drawbacks to develop a vibrant bond market.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Amazingly, the Dhaka residents nowadays wake up in the morning to the vendors' loud hawking coming through bullhorns (hand-held mikes). To the people not aware of the trend, the technique may appear strange --- and, considering the time being early morning, atrocious too. In the distant past, mornings in Dhaka, a busy city, used to welcome the residents of the city with the chirping of birds. Those were slowly replaced by the different types of sounds coming from automobiles. Since the corona lockdown in 2020, the whole scenario has changed radically. With road movement prohibited in the city to ensure social distance, hawkers and vendors seized the opportunity. These people selling varieties of products were seen coming out to trade in their merchandise stealthily. After nearly a month, with the lockdown slackening, the hawkers began entering localities on pedalled vans and pushcarts. To the surprise of the peaceful neighbourhood people, almost all the vendors were carrying hand-held mikes --- in order to attract the possible buyers' notice. The people, especially the womenfolk, welcomed the itinerant vendors. That was the beginning. Since that time of the early corona pandemic, the streets in the middle-class areas in the city have been dominated by the bullhorn-wielding hawkers. In the beginning they maintained a discreet manner, but with their demand and popularity increasing, the roaming vendors became more dominant as days wore on. It was because the womenfolk veritably welcomed the hawkers. The reason was that instead of going to the nearby kuchcha bazaar, they could shop in front of their residences. The hawkers' deafening voice coming through the bullhorn emerged as a dreadful nuisance to many people. More than a year after the withdrawal of the lockdown, the mobile hawkers are still there, the varieties of their products increasing manifold. Apart from vegetables and groceries, the hawkers bring fish, live chicken etc to the people's door. In the early period of the pandemic lockdown, they were seen selling rice, flour, beef & mutton to the people confined to their homes.Nowadays, the bullhorn-blaring vendors continue to display and sell clothing items. And even herbal medicines. Some of them shout from early in the morning for old household items like rejected electronic goods in exchange for money. The newcomers using bullhorns appear to be replacing the old-time hawkers, who had been engaged in the trade since long.Whatever may be the case, the mobile hawkers have earned a lot of infamy for their bullhorns. The bullhorns' piercing sound as the hawkers shout out while moving along a street leaves a deleterious impact on the heart and nerve of patients. Moreover, the hand-held mikes' sound detracts from the students' studies. Silence and endurable sound cannot go with noise pollution. The professional vendors' hawking sound could also be sweet and mesmerising. The skilled hawkers do not require a mike. Their plaintive sweet style of calling out and the voice modulation is enough to attract the prospective customers. Such hawkers used to people the Dhaka streets sixty-seventy years ago. In place of today's battery-driven hand-held small mikes, those hawkers would use the tin-made archaic bullhorns. The elderly people who heard the hawkers shout the words 'kulfi malai' on a high summer noon are still haunted by the sing-song voice. The hawkers' technique of attracting clients varies. Some vendors still retain the tradition of the rhythmic sound of home-made jhunjhuni. But those sweet sounds are fast being buried under the cacophonous and revolting noise pollution.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

In the past, Shakrain was all about a day-long event of flying kites and enjoying traditional pitha. With the passage of time, the festival has seen many changes. Nowadays on the day of the festival, kites start flying above rooftops of neighbourhoods in the morning. As the day progresses, the festivities take on new colours. The afternoon ends with a game of kite fighting, while the night sky is illuminated with fireworks and paper lanterns in the evening. However, for many people living in Old Dhaka, Shakrain celebration has nowadays become intolerable. On the occasion, what we see now are open parties that are dazzling with lights and loud noise on the rooftops. These parties also add shows of fire-spinning, fire-spitting, fireworks, and fire lanterns, which could cause a fire incident anytime. Many people cannot sleep well because of these late night parties. And there are children, elderly people and hospitalised patients who cannot sleep because of blaring sound of loudspeakers and firecrackers. The noise and lighting also scares birds and stray animals on the road. Festivals are meant for joy. They should not create any nuisance to anyone.
