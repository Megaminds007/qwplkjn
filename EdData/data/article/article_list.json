In a disturbing, but recurring sign of the toxicity that pervades the country\u2019s public space, his comments were presented by a TV channel as condoning the Islamist bigots in Udaipur who ruthlessly killed a man they suspected of supporting blasphemy. The channel and the anchor in question issued an apology, but only after the malicious act blew up as an indefensible scandal. BJP leader and former Union Minister \u2014 for Information and Broadcasting, no less \u2014 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, and some other party leaders who shared the same doctored video on social media did not feel any compulsion to retract their endorsement of the fake news. The doctored video clip, flagged \u2018out of context\u2019 by Twitter, remains on their timelines. Mr. Gandhi could be seen and heard as saying that it was children who did that, and while it was a mistake, the issue could be put to rest. The malicious misrepresentation of these words by the news channel and the BJP leaders is an extremely irresponsible act in a country that is deeply polarised. The Congress wrote to BJP President J.P. Nadda to take action against these leaders for spreading fake news, and get the doctored video removed. The BJP has not responded.The police in Chhattisgarh, a State that is under Congress rule, have registered an FIR on the fake news video and complaints have been filed in other States as well. A police team from the State was prevented by the police in Uttar Pradesh \u2014 a BJP-ruled State \u2014 from taking the accused TV anchor into custody, adding yet another layer to the controversy. The BJP claims to be a party with a strong leadership that is serious about internal discipline. If its leaders are not expected to talk out of line from the official position of the party, the question that begs an answer is whether Mr. Rathore is acting in accordance with it. If his position is not the BJP\u2019s position, the party must immediately clarify that and consider action against Mr. Rathore and other leaders who are brazenly spreading misinformation that could ignite more violence. The fact is that communally provocative statements are an easy route to popularity in the BJP ecosystem, and the party is either helpless or has no capacity to contain the malaise. By scripting an outright lie, the channel and the anchor further exposed the deep crisis of journalism in the country; as the ruling party at the Centre, the BJP must distance itself from Mr. Rathore\u2019s act.",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s monthly merchandise trade deficit hit a fresh record of $25.6 billion in June as per preliminary estimates released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry on Monday. This is the third occasion in seven months and the second month in a row that the trade deficit has widened to all-time highs. In June, the value of outbound shipments grew 16.8%, marginally slower than the 20.6% growth recorded in May, to about $38 billion \u2014 reflecting the third successive month of moderation. Worryingly, four of India\u2019s top 10 export items \u2014 engineering goods, cotton yarn, drugs and pharma and plastic products \u2014 contracted from a year ago. Petroleum exports were up 98% from June 2021, but about $0.7 billion lower than May 2022. Even as exports growth slid, imports surged by over 51% to $63.6 billion in June, crossing the $60 billion mark for the fourth month in a row. Coal imports, up almost 242% year-on-year, and petroleum inflows, up 94.2%, drove nearly three-fourths of this surge. And although gold imports, which had soared nearly eight-fold in May to touch 107 tonnes, moderated from over $6 billion that month to $2.6 billion in June, they were still 169% higher than a year ago and significantly over April\u2019s imports of $1.7 billion. The trade deficit for Q1 adds up to a record $70.25 billion, over two times higher than a year ago.The tangible slowdown in exports, due to weaker global demand, is unlikely to change much soon, with recessions or sharp growth slowdowns expected in several developed markets. Domestic demand for imports of oil, fertilizers, coal and even gold \u2014 a safe haven for investors amid tumultuous financial markets \u2014 is largely inelastic, and elevated global prices for these will continue to escalate the import bill through this year. The weakening rupee, which tumbled further to 79.37 vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, will raise import costs further. Analysts expect the rupee to scale the 82 to a dollar mark by the October to December quarter before recovering and the current account deficit to more than double to around 3% of GDP this year from 1.2% in 2021-22. Robust forex reserves notwithstanding, the persistent outflows of foreign capital from the financial markets have triggered concerns about the balance of payments situation. Last week, the Government imposed a windfall tax on crude oil production that could help bridge concerns about the fiscal deficit. It also placed restrictions on petroleum products\u2019 exports and acknowledged that gold imports were hurting the current account by raising customs duties to 15% from 10.75%. This may end up hurting petroleum exports further while import duties may not dent India\u2019s unparalleled appetite for the yellow metal as much as hoped. Coal imports, on the other hand, are expected to keep hitting record highs as the monsoon will affect domestic output. Policy makers may have little room to manoeuvre out of this vicious cycle, but missteps must be avoided and domestic inefficiencies hurting exports reviewed urgently.",

In its commitment towards global climate goals, the government has implemented its notification banning identified 19 single use plastic (SUP) items. The violation of the ban is expected to invite penalties and jail terms as well under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986. Single use plastic items are those that are used once and discarded. They have high littering potential and high degree of non-biodegradability. The government has issued immediate directions to all States to curb supply of the banned finished goods and prohibit the petrochemical industries from supplying raw materials such as polystyrene used in producing SUPs.\nThe blanket ban on the 19 SUP items is a welcome move that promises to deliver relief to the environment and wildlife. The styrofoam cups, plates and plastic spoons and forks have long been an eyesore all around our cities, parks, beaches, railway tracks and even wildlife sanctuaries. In fact, the landfills across India are replete with SUPs that will not biodegrade even in the next 400 years. India generates 3.5 million tonnes of plastic waste a year, which is 3 kg of per capita plastic waste per year. During 2020-21, India generated 41,26,997 tonnes of plastic waste. Considering these staggering figures, it is apt for the government to launch the initiative. But is India ready, and more importantly, will the ban work this time?\nRestrictions on SUPs have been attempted in India as long back as 1999 when the sale of polythene bags was prohibited. Since then a plethora of national and state level laws have been enacted and implemented. However, the last 22 years are a testament to the fact that we still have plastic cutlery and many other SUP items freely available in the market. Till date, the centre had encouraged the states to phase out the SUPs but the states\u2019 efforts were largely ineffective and SUPs thrived as always. The cause of the earlier SUP futile ban is always attributed to lax enforcement which took place in fits and starts. The current ban seeks to address this loophole and may to a large extent resolve the ineffective enforcement issue. But the real cause for failure of the SUP ban in the past has not been lax enforcement alone. The lack of sustainable alternatives to SUPs has been the major cause for the ban to remain ineffective and before long one could see resurgence of the SUP items in daily life.\nThe government seems to have put its weight behind enforcement of the SUP ban notification and its rules and paid less attention to the impact and viable alternatives for the industry and the people. Consequently, there\u2019s a serious gap on ways and means of replacement of the single use plastic, which stands prohibited in a large part of the country, barring a few days of relaxations given at some of the places. An unrealistic time frame given for phasing out these single use plastic products means that the industrial houses in the country have been unable to research and develop practical and affordable solutions for the single use plastics. As a result, there is a dearth of manufacturing capacities of the alternatives to the single use plastics and no set supply chains are available for their raw materials either. The government could have opted instead to stagger the ban and used the time to develop a parallel line of eco-friendly products that would seamlessly have taken over the SUP slots. This would not only make the ban more successful but would have also saved the employment of scores of people engaged in production of SUPs and the capital of industries that has been invested into the production machinery.\nIndia needs to move towards a complete plastic free future and this cannot be possible in a short time. The government cannot and must not directly or indirectly support the plastic industry, while it bans SUPs as this will tantamount to taking two steps forward and one step backward. The Indian plastic industry must be slowly diverted towards adopting alternative materials on one hand and incremental staggered ban on plastic items must be applied in every quarter on the other hand to discourage the production and use of plastic items. In this balanced manner the government can actually phase out plastic from daily life. Some exceptional uses can be allowed such as for medical and defence purposes.\nFor a better environment, the people will fervently hope for the latest ban on SUPs to succeed. But there are lessons from the past failures, which must not be repeated. The government should enforce the ban effectively, while also making available the affordable alternatives to the shopkeepers and the consumers.\n(The writer is an environmental journalist.

        "full_article": "As the saffron juggernaut rolls on, the Oppn\u00a0 must do better than just making speeches\nSenior BJP leader Amit Shah\u2019s claim that the next 30-40 years will be the era of the saffron party should not be dismissed or downplayed by opponents as pure hyperbole or an assertion suggesting complacency. The BJP juggernaut under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah seems unstoppable; indeed it is gaining momentum. This is extremely disconcerting for the Opposition and a large section of the intellectual class; for them, it\u2019s a nightmare come true. There have been highs (too numerous to be mentioned) and lows (eg, West Bengal last year) in the BJP\u2019s journey; but its rise has been secular \u2014 no pun intended. Some political and thought leaders may even try to see complacency in Shah\u2019s statement, though there is none. He is not among those who like to rest on their laurels; for him, laurels are never enough; there is always need for more. Winning a State is not enough; the number of BJP\u2019s MLAs and MPs from the State should rise further; and after every rise, the Modi-Shah duo look for another rise. They fight for not just the 543 Lok Sabha seats, but also every Rajya Sabha seat, every State, even municipalities. The duo has excised complacency from the BJP genes. It is a new BJP, not that of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani. This is not to say that the Vajpayee-Advani BJP was lethargic and laidback; quite the contrary, it has always been extremely active, vocal and enthusiastic.\nEven in the late 1980s, when the saffron party was reduced to two seats in the Lok Sabha, there was no let-up in its activity; its leaders continued to make their presence felt even though the Congress had over 400 members in the Lok Sabha. Whatever else the BJP\u2019s opponents say about it, they can\u2019t fault it for being slack or slothful. Under Modi and Shah, the saffron party has been further galvanised. Not many parties show the kind of energy, purpose and drive when out of power that the BJP does; and the Congress, which can boast of all-India presence, is certainly not that party. It bounced back to power in 1980 because the Janata Party fell under the weight of its own contradictions. Ditto with another experiment, involving Janata Dal, which was repeated a decade later. In 2004 too, the \u2018grand old party\u2019 came to power not because its leaders sweated it out on streets to win a landslide against the BJP \u2014 in fact, it got just seven seats more than the BJP\u2019s \u2014 but because the saffron party\u2019s messaging was awful and it could not get the RSS\u2019 support during campaigning. Against this backdrop, Shah\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t seem improbable. If the GOP and other Opposition parties want to oust the BJP, they must do more than making fiery speeches and viral tweets. They must come up with something that is politically feasible and electorally possible. They have to stir out of their complacency.",

In a recent order, SC critiqued NGT for \u201cmechanical and pre-drafted\u201d orders after a construction firm complained that it wasn\u2019t heard before a hefty penalty of Rs 40 crore was imposed on it. The tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction over environmental protection and pollution control matters has arguably not lived up to its billing. Some months ago, another SC bench had frowned upon NGT\u2019s tendency to set up expert committees, noting that its adjudicatory functions cannot be delegated in this manner.\nAfter the first two decades of liberalisation, tribunals have lost favour. In NGT\u2019s case it was expected to quickly settle a growing number of environment-related matters pending at constitutional courts and tap into expertise on environmental law available in India. And given rampant ecological degradation and related localised grievances, such an adjudicatory body staffed with judicial and technical experts having significant powers came with a lot of promise. Though a number of NGT rulings have held the field, some of its big-bang orders \u2013 de-registering 10-year-old diesel vehicles, bans on firecrackers, RO-water purifiers and sand-mining \u2013 have had minimal impact in the absence of political support. NGT has ended up as another casualty of the messy \u201cdevelopment vs environment\u201d debate, which has no easy answers.\nThere are staffing issues. Against NGT Act\u2019s mandate to have 10-20 judicial and expert members each, NGT presently has seven judicial and six expert members. In 2019, these numbers were down to four and two respectively. Fewer members make two extreme scenarios likely: backlogs and hasty disposals. Not surprisingly, stays against NGT orders clearing or blocking projects are routinely secured from SC and HCs, eroding NGT\u2019s credibility.\nNGT boasted of a high disposal rate even during the 2021 pandemic year courtesy virtual hearings but critics say the data doesn\u2019t speak for the quality of orders, an assessment that appears to have caught SC\u2019s eye. NGT was one of the pioneers of virtual hearings, but lawyers say the lack of physical interface has affected their ability to make a more pressing case before the bench. NGT must get the support it needs from GoI but it must also do more to clean up its act.\n\n",

Uzbekistan is a key Central Asian Republic that borders Afghanistan. Protests in Karakalpakstan broke out over plans to revise the Uzbek constitution that would change the autonomous region\u2019s status and curtail its right to secede. Those plans have now been put on hold. Interestingly, there are parallels here with the situation in Ukraine and its separatist Donbas region. However, despite Karakalpakstan\u2019s close ties with Russia, Moscow has backed Tashkent saying the unrest was Uzbekistan\u2019s internal matter.\nThat said, any unrest in the Central Asian Republics (CARs) is problematic for the whole region. Islamist extremism here received a second wind with the conflict in Syria. And though regional governments have been largely successful in containing extremist groups, the latter could still take advantage of any social, economic or political turmoil. That would be bad news given Taliban\u2019s return in Afghanistan. Security implications stretch all the way to South Asia. This is precisely why in November last year New Delhi hosted the national security advisers of the five CARs for its regional security dialogue on Afghanistan, and PM Modi held a virtual summit with the leaders of these nations earlier this year.\nBut for true synergy, India\u2019s outreach to the CARs must have a strong economic component. With Uzbekistan, India in 2020 concluded agreements on 15 investment projects for $3 billion and also extended a line of credit of $448 million. Plus, both Amity and Sharda universities opened branches in Uzbekistan in 2018. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is a uranium giant and Turkmenistan has the world\u2019s fourth-largest gas reserves. Together, they could fulfil India\u2019s energy needs and provide vital connectivity as part of the International North-South Transport Corridor. But there is also competition in the form of China\u2019s growing influence in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative. India should, therefore, present itself as a long-term trustworthy partner for the CARs by supporting regional stability, coordinating on security and actualising transparent, need-based investment projects.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is seeing another rise of Covid-19 cases. In the first five days of July alone, 32 Covid-infected patients died, according to the health directorate. As of 6pm July 5, our total caseload stands at 1,982,972 since the pandemic broke out in the country on March 8, 2020.\nThis scenario once again reminds us of the fact that we are still in the midst of a pandemic, although at times \u2013 especially when Covid is less active \u2013 we seem to lose sight of it and take on a more complacent approach in our fight against the pandemic.\u00a0\nFor some time now, Europe, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia have been witnessing a rise in Covid, with Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 accounting for many of those cases. These two subvariants are highly contagious, classified as variants of concern by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and can easily navigate the immunity provided by previous infections and cause breakthrough infections.\u00a0\nTraces of BA.4 and BA.5 have also been found in Bangladesh. The Jashore University of Science and Technology was the first to report detection of the subvariants in June. And with the rising number of cases, the footprint of these subvariants has increased.\nUnder such circumstances, our immediate way forward is strictly reinforcing and adhering to safety guidelines. But even in this, there seems to be a reluctance on the government's part. In view of the deteriorating situation, the National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC) for Covid management in Bangladesh, during a meeting on June 14, recommended implementing six restrictions to curb the spread of the infection. However, it was not until June 28 \u2013 two weeks after the NTAC meeting \u2013 that the Cabinet Division issued a notification on the new restrictions. Given the urgency, why did it take two weeks for the authorities to issue the notification?\nSimilarly, people too seem reluctant to stay safe. They are hardly seen wearing masks out in public: on the roads, in public transport, inside shops, in the crammed lifts.\u00a0\nBut then, masks are a luxury for some \u2013 especially for rickshaw-pullers, van-pullers, hawkers and day labourers, for whom meeting the daily basic needs is a challenge at present. And in the reality of inflation, for most \u2013 even in the middle class \u2013 masks would likely be at the bottom of the monthly grocery list. One needs to note here that masks are no longer VAT-exempted, meaning their prices have increased. Why the authorities made such a decision is another question which with no logic one can answer.\nWhat is even more unfortunate is the irresponsible behaviour of the people and institutions we consider responsible. Big, crowded events such as Eid fairs, weddings, parties and official programmes are going on in full swing. Now, with Eid-ul-Azha coming up, Covid cases are expected to increase, because as usual, public transports will be operating in overcapacity; buses, launches, trains and trawlers will be overcrowded with homeward-bound people, turning them into the ideal hotbeds for Covid breeding.\nIn view of this, our healthcare professionals need to brace themselves for a new onslaught of Covid cases. Although the government has done a commendable job of vaccinating more than 70.4 percent of the population with two full doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it won't be enough to stop the spread of the subvariants. A part of the solution could be in the bivalent vaccine, which is currently in development. Bivalent vaccine works by \"stimulating an immune response against two different antigens, such as two different viruses or other microorganisms,\" according to the National Cancer Institute in the US.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to develop bivalent vaccines that could target both the original coronavirus strain, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, according to the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Dr Peter Marks. The FDA is planning this for the autumn boosters. However, for countries like Bangladesh, the challenge would be to get the bivalent vaccines.\u00a0\nA two-pronged approach could cushion us from the shocks of the fourth wave of the pandemic. While complete lockdown is not a feasible solution, especially in view of the economic pressures we are already facing, we cannot also allow the situation to reach a point where the only solution is a hard lockdown. Therefore, at this point, what we need to focus on are strict implementation of social distancing and health safety protocols. Since the new variants are still active in small clusters, vigilant monitoring of cases, proactive contact tracing, immediate testing, and isolation where required would be key in preventing the new variants from spreading. At the same time, law enforcement officials need to strictly enforce social distancing guidelines. At the same time, VAT on masks should be withdrawn immediately. Rather, masks should be subsidised so that a greater number of our population can afford them.\u00a0\nVaccination is the other component of this two-pronged solution. The government needs to ramp up efforts further to vaccinate the population with booster shots, and start immediate inoculation of children aged 5-12. Moreover, it should start working right away to secure the doses of bivalent vaccines, especially for the frontline workers and the elderly in order to provide them with the immunity required.\u00a0\nComprehensive, combined and concerted efforts are our only weapons to overcome the fourth wave. With the holiday weekend coming up and then winter in a few months, vigilance, precaution and prevention should be our agenda to tackle the fourth wave of Covid infections.\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for\u00a0The Daily Star.

We all are aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers, writers, poets, activists, student leaders are all put in jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India,\" he told an interviewer.\nIn his meticulous fight for justice, one of Swamy's several campaigns sought the implementation of a Supreme Court order that said, \"Owner of the land is also the owner of sub-soil minerals.\" It naturally made him highly unpopular with the mining barons who control the state's economy.\nChristophe Jaffrelot, in his book Modi's India: Hindu Nationalism and the Rise of Ethnic Democracy, discusses in detail the Bhima Koregaon case in which Swamy and some of India's most selfless rights activists stand targeted as \"urban Naxals.\"\n\"The way the urban Naxals have been harassed and arrested in India before and after 2019 suggests that police forces reporting to BJP ministers have emulated the Hindu nationalist vigilantes to some extent, and appear to be translating into action the increasingly authoritarian strategy of the government, a trend that also manifested in the decline of freedom of expression\u2026,\" says Jaffrelot.\nMany eyebrows were raised recently when the\u00a0Supreme Court gave a clean chit\u00a0to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in cases pertaining to anti-Muslim pogroms during his tenure as the chief minister of Gujarat. What caused greater consternation was the court's censure of the petitioners and an unusual order that those who pursued the case for over 16 years be put in the dock.\nConsequently, rights activist Teesta Setalvad and two former top cops were slapped with charges and jailed. All three have stood shoulder to shoulder with the Muslim victims of the pogroms. But the debate over the shocking judgment hasn't significantly enthused major Muslim groups \u2013 barring some individual responses \u2013 that seem to confine their interest to religious disputes.\nThe Indian state has acquired additional features of a police state under the post-2019 BJP-led government. Immediately after Modi II was formed, recalls Jaffrelot, Indian parliament passed a law that empowered the state to designate individuals as terrorists. Previously, that was the case only for organisations.\nAmong those arrested were Surendra Gadling, a lawyer, Shoma Sen, a retired English professor, Sudhir Dhawale, a poet and publisher, while Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson were human rights activists. Soon, the police arrested, in the same case, the poet-activist Varavara Rao, the lawyer and trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, who gave up her US citizenship to join the Indian struggle, and the human rights activists-turned-authors and columnists Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves.\nIn April 2020, Anand Teltumbde, a regular contributor to the Economic and Political Weekly, and professor at the Goa Institute of Management, was arrested followed by Gautam Navlakha, former consultant with the\u00a0Economic and Political Weekly\u00a0and a member of the People's Union for Democratic Rights. Then Hany Babu, associate professor at Delhi University, was arrested as \"co-conspirator\" for propagating Maoist ideology. Finally, the Jesuit priest was thrown in jail.\nThey were all accused of conspiracy to overthrow the government and assassinate the prime minister. The Amnesty Tech (Amnesty International digital security team) later discovered that one of the seized computers contained malware allowing remote access, through which incriminating letters could have been planted. The idea that the letters had been manufactured was supported by the fact that Naxals' communication is heavily coded, says Jaffrelot.\nEminent historian Romila Thapar and other scholars filed a petition against the targeting of intellectuals, but lost the appeal. The dissenting judge, Justice DY Chandrachud, observed \"that a clear-cut distinction has to be made between opposition to the government and attempts to overthrow the government by rising up in arms.\" For him, the Bhima Koregaon case was \"an attempt by the state to muzzle dissent\u2026 Each of them is prosecuted for being a defender of persons subjected to human rights violations.\" Justice Chandrachud is expected to become chief justice in November 2022.\nThis article was first published in Dawn, an ANN partner of The Daily Star, on July 5, 2022.\n\n\u00a0\nJawed Naqvi is a New Delhi correspondent of Dawn.\n",

        "full_article": "\"Noted physicist a victim of land grabbing,\" screamed the headline on the City Page of The Daily Star on June 19. The story details how an old man ran from door to door to free his land from the ugly clutches of grabbers.\nIn another report in the Daily Ittefaq, we learnt how a woman grabbed all the properties of an expatriate man by forging his signature and personal information. She earned his confidence by doing some minor jobs for him, and when he trusted her with renewing his passport, she came up with her masterstroke. Collecting full information provided in his passport, she prepared some false documents and claimed ownership of most of his properties. A clever act of grabbing, indeed.\nIn this daily, we have also read a report on how there was an onslaught of grabbing on the Meghna River. The report elaborated on the fact that the river custodians turned a blind eye to \"influential grabbers\" filling up the Meghna foreshore. These are big grabbers in tuxedos who sit next to you in the club of elites.\nChattogram used to boast of thousands of beautiful hills all over the district, but today hundreds of them are gone. In the name of numerous prokolpos, the hills have been levelled to the ground and occupied. If you look at the 100-year-old maps of the country, you will notice many small rivers and canals crisscrossing the landscape. Most of them have been devoured by the influential grabbers lurking under the shadow of the powers-that-be over the century.\nDhaka city once had about 10 major canals \u2013 all are gone now. The official record says they have been grabbed by some influential people. We believe these influential people were and still are more powerful than the government. The cat-and-mouse game of grabbing the land on the two sides of Buriganga River has taken a legendary proportion by now.\nOne must recognise the fact that grabbers in Bangladesh have taken the enterprise to the highest level of creativity and perfection. They began as small-time snatchers, but worked hard to become big-time grabbers. They have shown the world how to put paws on anything that is worth a dime. Therefore, the enterprise should be given due recognition and enlisted as a legitimate commercial activity. Since you cannot stop these highly enterprising people with laws, you'd better come to terms with them. Commercial banks should come forward to finance these \"business activities\" with loans to the tune of, say, Tk 4,000 crore. That's peanuts to some.\nAnalysing the success of these hard-working and innovative people, I strongly suggest that, instead of a BCS university, as suggested by an eminent teacher, someone open a university to impart theoretical knowledge as well as practical training on how to grab things: anything, from your mobile phone to 100 acres of government land, private land or a house, a hill or even half of an entire river, graveyards, cremation sites, playgrounds, sand, earth, toilets, skeletons, ponds, canals, riverbanks, forests, migratory birds and wild animals. Enrolment should be good, and very soon students from abroad would come seeking admission.\nAs resource persons, we should invite successful grabbers from different countries to deliver lectures on the art of the business. They would talk about why the tendency of grabbing things that belong to others is one of the strongest characteristics in humans, and why the insatiable hunger for land is still the most prominent one among them. In both the urban and rural areas, life revolves around land. A man in love with his land would not hesitate to kill or die for it. In this connection, we may suggest including Leo Tolstoy's short story \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\" in the syllabus of the institute. Added to that should be the wisdom of Niccolo Machiavelli, who said, \"But above all he must refrain from seizing the property of others, because a man is quicker to forget the death of his father than the loss of his patrimony.\"\nThese enterprising humans are active in our rural areas, too, with a dredger to grab sand from the bottom of the river or earth-cutter to cut the top soil of agricultural land in broad daylight. You don't care if in the process the land loses fertility and water gets stuck in the ditches. When you have cut the top soil of about 200 acres of land and sold it to the local brickfield owner, your attention turns towards the village road with four feet of elevation waiting to be devoured. Since it will be difficult to cut the entire road in daytime, you wait for midnight. Your attention will soon turn to the riverbanks.\nWhen a nosey reporter goes to the local administration to collect information regarding the grabbing of a pond or a hill by the blessed ones, they usually say, \"No, no, no, no. No such thing has come to our notice. How can anyone fill up an entire pond or cut down a hill when we are sitting here (read: sleeping)? We shall send someone to inspect. We shall definitely take stern action against anyone doing any mischief.\" The reporter comes back knowing what to expect when he will visit the office next month.\nWhat about the blessed ones who can vanish millions from the vaults of the banks like the mercurial Harry Houdini? When we are hounded by our banks for the monthly credit card instalment of Tk 600, lo and behold, the blessed ones will get another sanction of, say, Tk 15 crore, even though he has not paid a single instalment of interest on his first loan worth Tk 20 crore!\n\u00a0\nShahnoor Wahid is a senior journalist.\n",

        "full_article": "If you ask someone born and raised in Bangladesh before 1990 about what government jobs meant for them, the first things they would probably say are \"respect\" and \"job security.\" From a village-level officer to a top-ranked bureaucrat at the Secretariat Building, respect and job security are the two main factors that likely motivated them to put their minds and bodies through the arduous and excruciating process of memorising thousands of pages of \"general knowledge\" in order to take an extremely competitive examination on public service \u2013 with no guarantee of success at all.\nOf course, government employees also enjoyed certain degrees of influence within their own circles\u00a0of authority, but no one really ever associated \"power\" with government employees, aka bureaucrats. Power, in the true sense of the word, has been exclusively reserved for the politicians, who got to enjoy it only after investing years of physical, mental and monetary capacities to gain popularity among a large number of people, and more importantly, prove their mettle in street activism and finally show their leadership acumen.\nNow, if you ask the same question to someone born after 1990, they would probably say it is mainly \"power and influence\" that make government jobs attractive. Respect and job security are still very much part of the package \u2013 it's just that they are not the most desired deals anymore.\nTake the example of a motor vehicle. Politicians are like the drivers, while bureaucrats make the engine. Politicians show the way by making pro-people policies and legislations, while bureaucrats find the most efficient ways to put those policies and legislations into effect by using the available resources.\nHowever, if the person behind the wheel suddenly starts to feel that the engine is not behaving the way they want it to, a crash does seem inevitable. And that is exactly what is happening in Bangladesh. It is increasingly becoming apparent every day that there is a tug of war going on between our bureaucrats and politicians.\nPlanning Minister MA Mannan, who was a veteran government employee himself before becoming a full-time politician, recently commented that bureaucrats were keeping local-level politicians on a tight leash. He made this comment in connection with the harassment that union- and upazila-level political leaders often face even by a low-ranking government officer. What this goes to show is that the balance of power has decisively shifted towards the government employees.\nAlthough it is hard to really pinpoint exactly when this shift began to take place, what is absolutely certain is that it was the politicians who got the ball rolling. It was them who approved an unprecedented pay hike for government employees. It was them who passed the Bangladesh Public Service Act, 2018 in parliament that prevented law enforcement agencies from suing or arresting government employees without judicial permission. It was the politicians who caused a widespread \"politicisation of the administration\" by indiscriminately lobbying to appoint political workers in government jobs.\nThe result of those actions is that now the administration is full of politically connected bureaucrats with political ambitions. All of these have eventually culminated into government employees feeling more empowered than ever before, and consequently, they are now replacing politicians as the heads of local-level relief committees during crises (such as the Rohingya influx in 2017 and the Covid pandemic breakout in 2020) and natural disasters (such as the ongoing floods in Sylhet and Sunamganj), which is another clear sign of the shifting of the balance of power.\nA senior field official from a top national security agency once told me about an interesting theory on how government officials deal with local politicians. He called it the \"ABCD of bureaucracy.\" The first thing that our bureaucrats try to do is \"avoid\" when they receive a request from a local politician. Then they \"bypass\" said request by forwarding it to a fellow official. If that doesn't work, they try to \"confuse\" the one making the request, and if that also fails to turn the politician away, they finally resort to the time-tested \"delay\" technique.\nYou may ask: Isn't that what bureaucrats always do? I'd say yes; they always do this to the common people, but until recently, they never did this to a politician. But given the outcomes of the last two general elections, people's distrust of our politicians is on the rise. The politicians have also gotten alienated from their voters, because there are now easier ways to win elections. Add to that all the legislations, policies and practices enforced in recent years to empower the bureaucrats, and you know who the politicians have to blame as their authority gets seriously challenged on a regular basis \u2013 no one but themselves.\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "As experts have confirmed already, Bangladesh has entered its fourth wave of Covid infections within the last few weeks. In the 24 hours till 8am on Monday, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) reported 12 Covid deaths \u2013 the highest after March 5 this year when 13 people had died \u2013 and 2,285 cases of infection. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the test positivity rate for the virus stood at 15 percent, which is a staggering difference from the 0.8 percent positivity rate at the end of May. While it was timely of the Cabinet Division to issue a mask mandate on June 28 to battle this rise in Covid cases, all institutions and individuals must come together to practice health safety rules vehemently \u2013 especially during the upcoming traditionally chaotic homegoing days of the Eid-ul-Adha.\nIn addition to a reluctance towards mask-wearing and social distancing, many of the population also seem to be in denial of the fact that the fourth Covid wave is in Bangladesh. Some think their fever may be due to dengue \u2013 which in itself is nothing to be brushed aside \u2013 or that their symptoms indicate only a seasonal flu. However, the data of recent weeks proves otherwise.\nThe only way for one to find out whether their symptoms are from the coronavirus or not would be to get tested. Given that many are intimidated by the costliness of laboratory tests, the government should subsidise such testing so that citizens are able to get reliable diagnoses early on and can seek proper treatment.\nMore worrying is the fact that Eid holidays are days away, during which thousands of people will be travelling between the capital and the rest of the country, packed into cars, buses, trains, and ferries. Experts rightly fear that this could result in a high surge in Covid cases post-Eid.\nThe coronavirus is something that is here to stay, and will only mutate to take different, often more dangerous, forms. To combat this, it is crucial that the population stays up-to-date on their Covid vaccines, as every dose eventually wears off \u2013 exposing a person to higher chances of being infected.\nAs such, only our vigilance (through daily health safety measures and receiving vaccines) can prevent the virus from devouring numerous lives and livelihoods, as it has done in the past. We urge the government to ensure that health and safety rules are strictly enforced at shopping malls, kitchen markets, and on public transport vehicles, and that a thorough and efficient vaccine drive is conducted to safeguard the population against this fourth wave of the Covid virus in Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "It is concerning to note that people across the country are having to endure long power cuts as electricity production is being hampered mainly because of a shortage of natural gas supply. Around 52 percent of the country's power is produced using gas, according to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) data. And data from Petrobangla shows that the government has been injecting less LNG into the national gas-supply grid, as it decided to not buy LNG from the international spot market for the time being due to its increased price. When the government last bought LNG from the spot market in May, the price of LNG was USD 26 per Metric Million British Thermal Unit. Now, it has shot up to USD 36 per Metric Million British Thermal Unit. According to the Petrobangla chairman, the government would only buy more LNG once the price comes down which, given the global circumstances, may take some time.\nAs the government lowered its gas supply for energy production, people across the country have been experiencing power outages multiple times a day, bringing back memories of days when \"loadshedding\" was a common phenomenon. At least 854 mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) of LNG was supplied to the national gas grid on June 29. That figure, however, dropped down to 507 mmcfd by July 4, according to Petrobangla data. Even though it is easy to accept that the government is in a tight spot in relation to gas supply because of external factors, what we cannot understand is why the government did not anticipate the ongoing supply crunch and take pre-emptive measures to prevent the present crisis.\nThe government itself has admitted that the main reason for the rise in gas price is the Russia-Ukraine war. But that war began on February 24. The government should have anticipated a rise in gas price in its immediate aftermath, and taken necessary steps to mitigate any potential crisis. In fact, experts have long warned of an impending crisis because of the government's overdependence on expensive LNG from abroad. Because the government failed to take into account these concerns, people across the country are now suffering \u2013 industries are having to endure higher production costs, and hospitals are suffering from power outages while doctors are in the middle of performing surgeries on their patients.\nThis cannot continue. The government cannot simply expect people to endure such hardship day in and day out. It needs to immediately come up with an alternative strategy, with a focus on renewable energy, and in the meanwhile, make sure that healthcare and other essential services are not hampered by this type of power outages. Additionally, it needs to return to focusing on local gas exploration and extraction instead of relying so heavily on its export, as experts have suggested for years.\n",

        "full_article": "Notwithstanding the rising inflation with attendant fall in the demands for consumer products globally, performance of the country's export sector during the last fiscal year (FY2021-22) was indeed robust. According to the data provided by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), the volume of export in FY22 increased by 34 per cent over that of the previous fiscal (FY 2020-21) to a whopping USD 52.08 billion. This is no mean achievement considering that the prices of raw materials for the export industry, for the Readymade Garment (RMG) in particular, had gone up during the past fiscal compared to pre-Covid time. All this only points to the remarkable resilience of the export sector in the face of adversities.In fact, the mainstay of the country's export, the Readymade Garment (RMG), which fetched 82 per cent of FY22's total export earning, did indeed again prove its worth as the country's flagship export item. In fact, RMG's growth potential is still far from being exhausted. Looked at from this perspective, the claim made by some industry leaders that the export earning from RMG alone may reach as high as USD100 billion mark by 2030 may not be exaggerated. However, everything would depend on the continuance of the present trend of rising demand for Bangladeshi RMG products in the international market. On this score, some upgrading measures such as increasing product diversity including high-end items targeting exclusive markets would be required. It is only then that the international buyers leaving China can be expected to turn their attention to Bangladeshi products in a big way.Meanwhile, besides RMG, other exportable items including leather and leather products, agricultural items such as jute and jute goods, fruits, live and frozen fish, pharmaceuticals, engineering and plastic products have also not lagged behind. What is gratifying at this point to note is that each of the mentioned sectors and subsectors of export showed some positive growth. Which, in other words, means that given the needed support, be it in terms of policy or otherwise, it is not only the RMG, but all other items in the country's rather small export basket also have immense potential to grow and contribute to the economy through enhanced export earnings. For the agricultural product, jute, for example, once the country's premier export good but has had hard times recently, showed impressive performance with its earning still maintaining the billion dollar benchmark. Given its eco-friendly attributes, it is time to take a fresh look at jute and unleash its full potential as the major cash crop of the country as it was in the past as well as an exportable item of bigger international potential than it is at the moment.Overall, the export sector's latest accomplishment has also been a confidence booster for the entire economy when concern has been growing over the reduced inflow of expatriate workers' remittance in recent months. Though the government has lately introduced some measures including raising of the cash incentive against the incoming remittance dollars from migrant workers to 2.5 per cent, the tendency to send the money using unofficial channel is continuing unabated. Innovative ways need to be hit upon to avert such a trend to keep the foreign exchange reserve at a comfortable level. Despite the odds, with the highly performing export sector beside it, it is expected that the economy will be able to meet the challenges in its stride.",

        "full_article": "Following the conclusion of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva on June 17, the highest level meeting on global trade caused hardly any ripple. In the wake of the lingering impasse concerning WTO activities, there was not much to look up to the Conference to deliver in concrete terms, and so all one is left with is a package of well crafted statements-- of either recognising the commitments of earlier ministerials, or of agreeing to take moves in respect of topical issues such as fisheries subsidy, emergency response to food insecurity, COVID-19 pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics. However, one issue apparently not directly related to trade but integral for ensuring a coherent trade discipline that came up for discussion is WTO Reform. No doubt an important issue in as much as the role of the global trade body is concerned, particularly in the context of its failure to prevail on circumstances calling for its intervention, the issue of WTO reform is indeed crucial.  Reforming the WTO is a broad subject, encompassing many facets of the WTO's work. The debate over WTO reform is not new. Soon after the organisation's inception, members have been thinking about how the WTO could be improved in order to respond more effectively to the challenges facing the multilateral trading system. However, the push for WTO reform has gained momentum in recent years, reflecting the following general concerns:1. The challenges WTO members face in initiating, negotiating and concluding trade agreements, both for outstanding issues as well as for fresh ones; 2. The need to strengthen the work of the WTO's regular bodies and committees as well as strengthen notification and transparency disciplines under existing agreements;3. The question of whether, and to what extent, the WTO's more advanced emerging economies should take on greater obligations under the WTO agreements, and whether existing special and differential treatment provisions for developing and least developed countries are sufficient or effective;4. Improvements in the functioning of the WTO's dispute settlement system and overcoming the four-year impasse on the appointment of new Appellate Body members. More than 30 submissions have been made by WTO members individually or in groups on specific topics. One of the early proponents for WTO reform was the Group of 20 leading economies. At their Buenos Aires summit in late 2018, G20 leaders issued a statement acknowledging that the system \"is currently falling short of its objectives and there is room for improvement\". In subsequent summits, G20 leaders reaffirmed their support for reform of the WTO to improve its functions and pledged to work constructively with other WTO members on the matter, including in the lead-up to the MC12. Submissions on WTO reform have been discussed in the regular meetings of the General Council as well as within the various councils and committees where issue-specific proposals were presented. The main focus of the WTO reform has been dispute settlement, prompted by the crisis over the future of the Appellate Body. In August 2017, the United States said it would not agree to the launch of selection processes to fill vacancies on the Appellate Body until its systemic concerns regarding the WTO's dispute settlement system were addressed. At meetings of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, more than 120 members issued a joint call for the selection process to be started forthwith. Many of these members have warned that the continued impasse on the appointment of new Appellate Body members not only undermines the WTO's dispute settlement system as a whole and the credibility of the WTO itself, but also denies all WTO members their legal right to a binding, two-stage dispute settlement process which is a fundamental pillar of the WTO system. As a result of the US hold on Appellate Body appointment and reappointment procedures and the expiry of the terms of the Appellate Body members, the Appellate Body, since December 2019, is no longer able to review new or pending appeals. To date, more than 20 panel rulings have been appealed \"into the void\", meaning that a resolution of these dispute proceedings is not possible until new Appellate Body members are appointed. All future panel rulings also face the risk of being appealed \"into the void\" unless a solution is found to the impasse. At the MC12, members reaffirmed the foundational principles of the WTO and committed to an open and inclusive process to reform all its functions-- from deliberation to negotiation to monitoring. Notably, they committed to work towards having a well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. The Ministerial Declaration says: \"We acknowledge the need to take advantage of available opportunities, address the challenges that the WTO is facing, and ensure WTO's proper functioning. We commit to work towards necessary reform of the WTO. While reaffirming the foundational principles of the WTO, we envision reforms to improve all its functions. The work shall be Member-driven, open, transparent, inclusive, and must address the interests of all Members, including development issues.\" The Declaration also adds: \"We acknowledge the challenges and concerns with respect to the dispute settlement system including those related to the Appellate Body, recognise the importance and urgency of addressing those challenges and concerns, and commit to conduct discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by 2024.\" Can we hope that the WTO General Council, in line with the Ministerial Declaration, will soon be able to formulate reform plans acceptable to all parties? Let's hope the world trade body gains the strength it requires to function as mandated.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

A student of Jagannath University pens down the state of his (gloomy) mood in the answer sheet of an examination. An elderly man of Dhaka city shoots himself dead live on a video clip. Crafty elements use garland of shoes to publicly insult a teacher in Narail. A young man takes off nuts and bolts from the Padma Bridge's railing, claiming it is so easy to do this when it should not be so. Only one global platform breaks all these news items and the newsmakers themselves share their stories with the public. The traditional media outlets play the secondary role in these cases. A select group of audience goes back there to read the follow-up reports and meet some curiosity but most others remain glued to the new media. Perhaps the expressive nature of the digitally addicted masses doesn't allow them to live in tranquillity.Unhappiness and joys, anger and support, protests and sycophantic words, and even private affairs and whimsical acts are expressed through the social media without slightest hesitations at the cost of decency.People may still have hunger for knowing the unknown and the yet-to-be-found known or maybe they miss the objects that can pacify their restless minds. These netizens look for remedy from hassles of living by means of information and communications technology.Digital solutions to essential services such as land registration, public healthcare, schooling and regulatory supports have not been fully readied yet. Knowledge resources, especially libraries and database, have not been digitised to the proportion of emerging economies.So, there is disconnect between the trends and treasures. Old school boys and girls may want to stick to the analogue system while digital enthusiasts prefer shortcuts to make life more comfortable by replacing the old system.In such a context, people of wisdom have reasons to be concerned about whether their legacy shall be carried forward by their posterity.Antagonists of change can't accept one particular fact that they won't be able to return to the age that makes them nostalgic. Loss of peace to ubiquitous activities of the virtual world is affecting not them alone, but the madness of using the machine at hand round the clock is turning the individual into a hostage to the habits and dominance of the platforms s/he uses.Paradoxically, the busy users of the social media hardly appreciate how internet really offers unprecedented scope for learning and receiving services, sitting at home and within moments. The energy and time they can save should have been utilised in more constructive purposes.Despite the vast array of resources available on the web, the contents generated and consumed by most of the contemporary professionals and amateurs appear to be disturbingly repetitive and lifeless.Also reading books is no longer a passion for the new generation, a generation which wants digital version of every source of knowledge for convenience, according to traditionalists. The joy of reading has become out of fashion.We, in Bangladesh, have embarked on the journey of digitisation but neglected digital literacy which is generally defined in a parochial manner. How it's possible without education proper and due diligence is a question thoroughly ignored.When libraries, hard copies of archives, research findings, and official documents will be digitised almost entirely, will that be the end of learning age? It's feared to be the era of robots that can, however, only replicate human knowledge and innovation.Few believe that widespread digital resources can produce highly knowledgeable individuals and society and explore opportunities for higher level of creativity. To do so, each individual needs to settle her/his mind and peacefully search for knowledge instead of unnecessarily being tired of everything. Exhausted leaders can't build any sound family and society, so nursing human values and instilling confidence into each societal unit about the future are critically important in a new world.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Even a decade ago, it was unimaginable to think of a hot day without power outages. Load-shedding used to be a household word. The word had, however, started to fade from our memory since 2018 when the interruption of power supply became almost non-existent in urban areas. But those rosy days are now gone. And load-shedding is back again. People across the country including capital Dhaka have been experiencing severe power cuts multiple times a day in the past few days. Some people are even experiencing load-shedding for five times a day. Every time it lasts for more than 30 minutes. Villagers are suffering power cuts six to seven times a day on an average. Each time it takes an hour to three hours before power comes back. If this continues, we are back to square one. The authorities concerned blamed a shortage of natural gas supply for this situation. The only solution to the load-shedding conundrum, in my view, is to formulate a long-term plan for producing power. We should consider making coal a primary energy source for electricity generation. Shifting towards coal will cut electricity costs across the economy, and the cheaper energy would raise incomes for households and businesses. \nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
