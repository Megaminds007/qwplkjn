At stake are the futures of heavily intertwined and socially cohesive communities of two large economies contributing significantly to India\u2019s GDP and employment numbers. The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, N. Chandrababu Naidu and A. Revanth Reddy, respectively, not only remained cordial throughout the two-hour long meeting in Hyderabad last week but also proposed a well-thought-out three tier-mechanism to resolve all outstanding issues since the creation of Telangana in 2014. The first tier is a committee of top administrative officials, three members from each State, which would meet at regular intervals and attempt resolutions of as many disputes as possible. There would be sub-groups within this committee to address sectoral issues such as water sharing, assets and liabilities distribution, and the return of the five villages in the erstwhile Khammam district that were merged with Andhra Pradesh as they were expected to be submerged by the Polavaram Irrigation project. The second tier consists of a similar committee of three Ministers from each State, which would attempt to resolve issues that could not be resolved at the bureaucratic level. And, finally, the third tier consists of the Chief Ministers themselves who would intervene on the most hardened positions.In the first five years since Telangana\u2019s formation, these issues festered to a point of no return, as much bad blood remained over the carving out of the richest part of undivided Andhra Pradesh into a new State, and the political futures of the legatee regional parties \u2013 K. Chandrashekhar Rao\u2019s Telangana Rashtra Samithi/Bharat Rashtra Samithi, and Mr. Naidu\u2019s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) \u2014 depended to a degree on public posturing, much to the detriment of the smooth day-to-day governance of the two new States. The abrupt stoppage of power supply by Andhra Pradesh to Telangana in 2017, leading Telangana to enter into expensive power purchase agreements with other neighbouring States is a case in point. But now, with Mr. Revanth Reddy, who looks up to Mr. Naidu as a political mentor \u2014 he groomed him from his early days as an independent MLC 17 years ago, and prodded him to join the TDP \u2014 there is hope that the two leaders would do what is right by the peoples of their States. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n/\n\nTelangana\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nHyderabad\n\n/\n\nwater rights\n\n/\n\nTelugu Desam Party\n\n/\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi\n\n/\n\nelectricity production and distribution\n\n/\n\nministers (government)",

        "full_article": "France\u2019s New Popular Front, a coalition of left parties comprising socialists, communists, ecologists and the hard-left France Unbowed, has surprised poll watchers to emerge as the single largest bloc in the snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron last month, following the European parliamentary elections. The NFP garnered 182 seats, putting it in pole position ahead of Mr. Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and its 168 seats. In third place \u2014 much to the surprise of their supporters, who hoped to reprise their winning performance in the European parliamentary election \u2014 came Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally and allies, although their 143 seats still positioned them far ahead of their 89 seats in 2022. Despite the reasons for celebration that the left and the right might claim in the result, it is Mr. Macron\u2019s prospects for political and economic progress in France along a centrist path that has truly taken a beating from voters this time. Given that no single party has reached the minimum requirement of 289 seats for an absolute majority, France now stares at the gloomy prospect of continuing political uncertainty, the very scenario that Mr. Macron sought to avoid when he called for polls three years ahead of schedule.At the heart of the present conundrum in France is mainstream concern about the rise of the right across the spectrum of European politics. The National Rally, founded by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Holocaust denier who also espoused extreme views on migration, was once considered an \u201cunviable political option\u201d. Now led by its 28-year-old President, Jordan Bardella, the party is actively seeking to transform its public image, perhaps even if broader voter acceptability requires a softening of its stance on questions of migration, minorities, religion and jobs. The broader regional paradigm, whose echoes reverberated through the election, is that the European political right is similarly finding a measure of acceptability in countries such as the Netherlands, Italy and Finland \u2014 and in these and other cases, the business of labelling them \u201cfar-right\u201d has become relatively tricky as their policies tend to change frequently and vary significantly across the region. In France, the National Rally may have won over as many or more voters for consistently challenging Mr. Macron on the cost-of-living crisis in the country than for its view on immigration. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently scolded her party\u2019s youth wing for giving fascist salutes. Yet, anti-migration views have won strong support from voters who created unexpected election breakthroughs for Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Nigel Farage of Reform UK in the United Kingdom and the AfD party in Germany. One thing is clear across Europe: the contest for political dominance, between the right, left and centre, could not be more intense. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nFrance\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nnational elections\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nEuropean\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nmigration\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\nreligion and belief\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nNetherlands\n\n/\n\nItaly\n\n/\n\nFinland\n\n/\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nGermany",

        "full_article": "Law (Enforcement) Under Influence: that\u2019s what tends to happen when rich/powerful drive drunk\nWeeks after the terrible Porsche accident in Pune, a BMW driven by an allegedly drunk son of a Shiv Sena senior has claimed a life in Mumbai. Unlike Pune police, Mumbai police has acted swiftly and made arrests. However, the prime accused remains at large. Cops must not let his VIP son status get in the way of nabbing him and fast-tracking investigations.\nCulture of impunity | But similarities in such accidents are too glaring to be missed: young men from powerful or wealthy families driving high-powered cars under the influence, often with fatal consequences for innocents. For instance, May saw three other accidents involving luxury cars, besides the Pune one. That power, hard or soft, has a role to play here is evident from Bengaluru\u2019s example. Despite witnessing several such crashes involving influential drivers over the last decade, it has witnessed conviction in just one case.\nThe Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 introduced a steep hike in fines for drunk driving. The newly introduced BNS\u2019s Section 106 has raised the punishment for acts of negligence that lead to death \u2013 to five years\u2019 RI. But who is going to ensure these laws\u2019 effective implementation?\nLax enforcement | As things stand, a bribe to cops on duty is often all it takes for drunk drivers to get away. And in case of a serious accident, there is an entire system that connives to protect the powerful and wealthy, as was made evident by the Pune episode. As many as 1,68,491 lives were lost due to road accidents in India in 2022. And, per official data, 1,503 of those were due to drunk driving. Our new rules and laws are still not stringent enough by first world standards. But, more important, it is their shoddy implementation that leads to road tragedies like the one in Mumbai.\n\n",

        "full_article": "France\u2019s dramatic election shows the virtues of coalition dharma when faced with threat to core democratic values\nFrench talk of French exceptionalism is food for many jokes around the world. But their dramatic parliamentary elections suggest there is indeed something je ne sais quoi different about them. In the first round it looked like Macron was a total mug for calling snap elections. And that Marine Le Pen\u2019s decade-long \u2018de-demonisation\u2019 rebranding would now deliver France its first far-right govt since World War II. Instead, a front r\u00e9publicain has put a sensational, last-minute pause on that scenario.\nExtreme screams | The way in which centrists and leftists came together to hold the far-right at bay, has been called horse-trading. But that\u2019s an unfair label for a tactical voting pact that involved unusual levels of sacrifice. More than 200 candidates pulled out of the runoff, to help consolidate the anti-far-right vote. In India, of course, we well know the positive possibilities of coalition politics, including its check on both rightwing and leftwing extremes. Running a coalition may be no easier than building it. It may be a laborious and fractious process. But the extensive consultations between different parties that it necessitates, can mean that the agreements have broader legitimacy not just across the aisle, but also across the country.\nIndia\u2019s own parliamentary elections have given a solid thumbs-up to coalition politics. BJP couldn\u2019t have formed govt without its allies. Nor would Congress revival have been as substantive, without agonising compromises with its allies. Results like Uttar Pradesh\u2019s also underline how the cobbling of successful coalitions can mean that little-known but deep grievances get recognised.\nTogether bellwethers | It\u2019s also a fact that despite a record turnout for the final election, no party has an outright majority in France. This will mean a period of uncertainty, perhaps extending to the Olympics. Some of the elements on the far-left are also dodgy. M\u00e9lenchon, for example, has refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation and flirts with antisemitism. A new govt will feel pressure from these even as the far-right keeps gnawing at it. Through all this, though, what will continue to give legitimacy to the anti-far-right coalition is that it has been supported by a solid French majority. No rebranding can disguise that Le Pen\u2019s party\u2019s core appeal lies in scapegoating minorities and migrants. It is because this toxic vision is on the rise elsewhere too, that the world\u2019s following all the French election drama, closely and seriously.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Every Indian male is Captain Underpants at heart\nFashion may have begun with bark, foliage and animal skin as a simple matter of modesty and keeping warm, but is today a zillion-dollar industry with bling, bangs and thongs. Much before the first supermodel lifted an anorexic ankle to catwalk down Paris, Milan and London ramps, desi fashionistas dabbled in ghungats, pallus, aanchals and dupattas. For the prim and proper Indian men there was always the baniyan, which they wore under everything like a second skin. At roughly the time women adopted nighty as the national costume, sleeveless vests and large underpants became the go-to couture for men. They have been loitering in public spaces since then with their lower half decorated in floral prints, stripes or large checks.\nWhich is why Justin Bieber\u2019s performance at a recent sangeet in a ganji and peeping boxers so warmed the Indian heart. In the pics that followed, there he is, standing next to a brightly festive lot, in a state of undress. Victoria\u2019s Secret may have tried to replace granny pants with G strings and elevated bras to bralettes and bustiers, and skorts may well catch on, but the day Bieber almost mooned us is when lingerie became evening wear.\nTill the invention of sewing machines, unstitched garments were the norm. Old Bollywood widows who cleverly rid themselves of their kids in a mela \u2013 to reunite only when the latter were adults with monthly incomes \u2013 draped themselves in white saris. Ditto female ghosts who sang their high-pitched songs in old havelis. While heroines wore thin chiffon saris on snowy mountains, heroes bundled up in sweaters and jackets. Then came Madonna\u2019s cone bras, Britney Spears\u2019 corsets, Lady Gaga\u2019s meat dress and the safety-pin gown of Elizabeth Hurley. Zendaya\u2019s see-through bot suit, Jared Leto dressed as Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s cat at the Met Gala, Salman Khan\u2019s Dragon Ball Z pants, Akshata Murty\u2019s choice of stripes in her bye-bye appearance\u2026Wardrobes go viral.\nWith bracelets shaped as Sellotape and high-end pouches styled on garbage bags, trends rush in where mortals fear to tread. The one sustaining style statement across the country, however, has been its insistence on underwear as outerwear; every Indian is a Captain Underpants at heart. And Bieber has brought the chaddi to page 3. Indian men who traditionally team up monkey caps with their baniyan now feel ready to take on the world of high fashion.\n\n",

        "full_article": "AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami and BJP Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai are at each other\u2019s throats. Again. On Friday, Annamalai said AIADMK would have come third, if not fourth, if it contested the Vikravandi byelection; and EPS said it\u2019s because of people like Annamalai that BJP couldn\u2019t form the Union govt on its own.\nEPS had attributed his party\u2019s decision to boycott the Vikravandi poll to alleged electoral malpractice by DMK in the Erode East byelection last year. Annamalai poked fun at this, asking if EPS would apply the same logic in 2026 and make his party stay away from the assembly election. EPS isn\u2019t functioning as a responsible opposition leader, he added. The AIADMK general secretary said Annamalai lied throughout the Lok Sabha election campaign; Annamalai said EPS stabbed Modi in the back. EPS called Annamalai a liar. Annamalai called EPS a betrayer. And that appears to have put the lid on the probability of a united opposition against DMK in the election on July 10.\n\nPolitics makes strange bedfellows, so we cannot rule out a reunion for the 2026 polls, but why is the bitterness between the two leaders growing every passing day? Beneath the emotional outbursts is a possible erosion of AIADMK\u2019s rank and file who BJP is trying to attract to its camp. Annamalai\u2019s aggression is to catalyse this migration; EPS\u2019s counterattack is to show he can match anyone in lung power and that Annamalai is not an honest leader that his straying cadres should fall for. EPS was, inadvertently, admitting to a possible erosion of his base when he warned that deserters would not be taken back into AIADMK.\nLower-level cadres and followers of AIADMK who are practicing Hindus are more likely to be attracted to the saffron brigade than DMK though the latter has gone soft on its rationalist ideals. EPS has so far proved doomsayers wrong by keeping the party and a considerable vote share alive, but another electoral defeat could make a substantial number of its followers look elsewhere.\nBut Annamalai may not have it easy. His planned ascent to the No.2 slot in Tamil Nadu politics faces the next threat from actor Vijay whose Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) is expected to contest the 2026 assembly election. Vijay threw his hat in the ring with the recent statement that Tamil Nadu lacks a good leader. So far, TVK has come across as a party with a regional, even a sub-national, identity and a secular outlook. And that makes it a natural rival for BJP which has tried to label the actor as a Christian. It may not be by accident that Vijay wore a tilak on his forehead at a recent event in Chennai.\nVijay\u2019s gradual initiation into public space seems to be well planned, starting with non-controversial, positive statements at seemingly apolitical events. His stand against NEET \u2013 his first statement on a policy \u2013 was well received. The first indication of public support for him as a politician, however, will be known only when he fires the first salvo at a politician. While some whisper campaigns suggest that Vijay may not be averse to having some allies, common sense tells us that an entrant with such great expectations should face the first election alone as a litmus test.\u00a0 Till Vijay spells it out, his only definitive rival will be someone who answers to the name Kuppusamy Annamalai.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In 2021, the Nagarik Tadanta Committee (Citizens' Investigation Committee) looked into the Hashem Foods factory fire that tragically killed 54 workers and injured many others. They concluded that the fire was not just an accident but \"murder caused by negligence.\"\nThe investigation found that the six-story building had no smoke detectors, fire alarms, or emergency exits. Additionally, watchdog agencies like the Department of Labour, the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE), and the Fire Service and Civil Defence did not properly do their jobs. There were irregularities in how they granted various clearances from the beginning.\nHowever, nearly two years later, in September 2023, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) removed the names of the factory owner, Abul Hashem, and his four sons from the charge sheet. Inspector Moksedur Rahman, the investigating officer, said there was not enough evidence against them. Instead, the charge sheet included six other people, like the factory's Chief Executive Officer Shahan Shah Azad and several DIFE officials. This decision has led to calls for renewed legal action and further investigation to ensure justice for the victims and their families. The exclusion of the owner and his sons has caused outrage among victims' families and the public, who believe the factory owner should be held responsible for the poor safety measures that led to the disaster.\nWhy are the owners not facing consequences in the case? It's a crucial question, and the answer is not simple. These are not mere silos operating independently; the accused CEO did not act in isolation or solely out of personal volition. A CEO often comes into the picture well after the establishment of their factories. From the top down, it becomes painfully apparent: workers' safety was never the priority.\nUnder standard practices, before even laying the first brick, factory owners are required to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucratic approval. A business must first secure a trade license from the local municipality or city corporation. Next, they need to register with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC). Following that, an Environmental Clearance Certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE) is mandatory, necessitating either an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) or an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), depending on the scope of the project. Furthermore, if the factory is to be situated in Dhaka, submission of the building plan to RAJUK, or the respective development authority, is required to ensure adherence to building codes and safety regulations.\nThe investigation exposed failures across multiple agencies. While the building lacked fire safety measures, the Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence (BFSCD) seemingly cleared it anyway. The Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE), responsible for factory layouts and safety compliance, also appears to have dropped the ball. This lack of due diligence by all agencies involved eventually led to the death toll.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, this laxity might be widespread. Many of Bangladesh's 46,000 factories likely have questionable paperwork. Through bribery and manipulation, factory owners exploit a corrupt system, escaping accountability for their negligence, which in this case, tragically resulted in deaths. This \"bhai-brother\" culture within the system, where approvals can be bought, leaves workers in a horrific situation. They sign on for a secure future, but end up signing their own death warrant.\nIn this intricate pre-operational phase, each step theoretically serves as a safeguard, a testament to due diligence. Yet, when disaster strikes, the spotlight narrows on the executives, leaving the shadowy complicity of owners unexamined. Why?\u00a0\nWhat's more troubling is negligence is not just a problem in factories. In March 2024, a massive fire at the Green Cozy Cottage Shopping Mall on Dhaka's Bailey Road resulted in at least 45 deaths. The fire started in a restaurant and spread quickly due to gas cylinders placed in the building's corridors. Many victims suffocated or were hurt while trying to escape the blaze.\nSimilarly, in June 2022, a major fire at an inland container depot near Chattogram's Sitakunda area killed around 50 people, including 10 firefighters. The fire was worsened by improperly stored hydrogen peroxide, causing a series of explosions that took days to control. In 2019, a series of fires in Dhaka's Chawk Bazar area and a high-rise building resulted in nearly 100 deaths. The fire started in a warehouse, that stored highly flammable chemicals and then spread to multiple buildings.\nThese incidents are just the tip of the ice-berg among many incidents that have caused irreversible harm to citizens. And what they highlight are recurring issues \u2014 inadequate fire safety measures, such as the lack of emergency exits, poor storage of flammable materials, and substandard electrical wiring, which contribute to the high incidence of fatal fires in Bangladesh.\u00a0\nThe frustration mounts as we keep hearing the same responses from our authorities. We've heard these empty promises of thorough investigations before. Which makes me think that perhaps it's the growing influence of the private sector, gaining dominance over the government since the 90s. And perhaps its cosy relationship weakens government oversight and accountability.\nWhat the Bangladesh government usually does in such scenarios is amend a few laws without focusing on the capacity building of those relevant departments responsible for safeguarding. And as a result, on paper it always shows \"something had been done\". But has anything really changed in our present status quo?\u00a0\nAfter the Rana Plaza incident, the Ministry of Labour and Employment released a document highlighting the steps the government took. The first step was amending the Bangladesh Labour Act of 2006 on July 16, 2013, to improve workers' safety, welfare, and rights, while promoting trade unions and collective bargaining. This amendment involved changes to 76 sections and added 8 new ones, complemented by the adoption of the National Occupational Health and Safety Policy. Critics argue that these legislative changes, though comprehensive on paper, have not been sufficiently enforced, leading to continued safety violations in the industry.\nAfter the amendment, trade union registration in the RMG sector gained momentum, with 351 new trade unions registered. The International Labour Organization (ILO) initiated training programs for union office bearers. While this is a positive step, the effectiveness of these unions is questionable, as they often face intimidation and resistance from factory owners, undermining their ability to advocate for workers' rights effectively.\nNew rules were published in the official gazette on September 15, 2015, containing 367 sections and seven appendices. These rules aim to strengthen regulatory compliance in the RMG sector. Despite this, enforcement remains inconsistent, and many factories still operate without adhering to these regulations, highlighting a gap between policy formulation and implementation.\nI fear that negligence has become so rampant in our country that it has seeped into our behaviours. Many of us walked past those restaurant corridors on Bailey Road without fire safety measures, only to sigh and not report it perhaps because of the bureaucratic processes involved in the reporting. When citizens are perpetually pushed into survival mode, how can we expect any better from them? How can we expect them to stand up? Perhaps it's time to scrutinise the systemic flaws that allow those at the top to dissociate themselves from the operational realities of the factories they own.\nNazifa Raidah\u00a0is a development practitioner.

This glacial and, frankly, ridiculous pace of work has been noticed in an undertaking meant to build 12 hi-tech parks in various districts. Considering its nature, you would have thought a government so intent on bringing about the country's digital transformation would take it more seriously, especially when most of the budget is being borrowed from outside the country, indicating its significance. But this is how the project has ended up, like so many others before it, according to a report citing findings of the planning ministry's Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED).\nThe government initiated the project in April 2017, with the strategically placed hi-tech parks envisioned to prepare the nation for the future by fostering a skilled workforce in the information technology sector. It was originally scheduled to be complete by June 2020, but has since seen its deadline extended multiple times. The latest proposal is asking for a 2027 deadline, and an increase from the original budget of Tk 1,796 crore to Tk 2,000 crore. Even though project authorities claim more progress than shown by the IMED report, the level of progress claimed to have been achieved is still miniscule and varies widely among the parks, with some barely even started.\nHow will the authorities justify this abysmal pace of work? As per our report, it has been attributed to various financial and logistical issues, including insufficient allocations, COVID-19 pandemic, land acquisition issues, etc. But this is hardly convincing. Those behind the project should have accounted for potential challenges and have contingency strategies in place to deal with them. A proper feasibility study would have resolved many of the issues that arose. Clearly, what has really slowed the progress is systemic neglect and mismanagement which, combined with a lack of accountability for public officials, have undone so many projects before. The economic implications of such frequent cost and time overruns cannot be stressed enough.\nThe hi-tech parks project was meant to be a cornerstone of Bangladesh's vision for a digital future. Instead, it has become a cautionary tale of how ambitious plans can falter without effective execution. We urge the authorities to put their foot on the accelerator and resolve all issues preventing the timely execution of this project.\n",

Huddled under a sea of colourful umbrellas, thousands of students stand defiant, their voices rising.\nWhat began as a localised protest in the heart of the capital has swiftly morphed into a nationwide movement. From Khulna University in the south to Rajshahi University in the north, students across Bangladesh are joining the chorus of dissent. Social media feeds are flooded with images and videos from campuses nationwide. In Dhaka, students have traded the comfort of dry lecture halls for the wet streets, their textbooks temporarily abandoned in favour of protest signs that run with ink in the relentless rain. As news of their stand spreads, it ignites similar actions nationwide. Students gather in solidarity in Chattogram, Sylhet, and beyond; their umbrellas are a colourful testament to their resilience and unity.\nBut this isn't just a student uprising. A parallel storm is brewing in faculty lounges and administrative offices nationwide. Professors and lecturers tasked with guiding the next generation find themselves locked in battle against a system they believe has failed them. It's as if the monsoon has washed away the thin veneer of normalcy, revealing the deep-seated frustrations that have long simmered beneath the surface of Bangladesh's academic world. Two distinct yet interconnected movements are unfolding, each threatening to reshape the foundations of higher education in Bangladesh. The students' grievances centre on the labyrinthine quota system that has long governed public sector jobs in Bangladesh, where 56 percent of government positions are reserved for various groups. It's as if the concept of affirmative action has been cranked up to eleven.\nThe students' demands are simple yet revolutionary. They want to tear down this quota tower, brick by brick, and build a new system where talent trumps all. They're calling for a return to a 2018 circular that promised a fairer shake.\nBut this isn't just about jobs. It's about a generation's hopes and dreams. These students envision a future where their hard work and abilities matter more than their family history or connections. They're fighting for themselves and the Bangladesh they want to see: meritocratic, fair, and full of opportunity.\nOn the other side of this academic coin, we find the teachers. These men and women have dedicated their lives to shaping young minds, only to be caught in a bureaucratic tangle. Their beef is with the \"Prottoy Scheme\"\u2014a new pension system.\nTo understand their fury, you need to know that these educators have long felt like the forgotten cousins of the civil service family. They've clamoured for a separate pay scale for years, recognising their unique societal role. Instead, they got lumped in with everyone else in the 2015 pay scale revision. This new pension scheme makes them feel like they're being pushed further into the margins.\nIt's not just about money, though. It's about dignity. It's about feeling valued in a society that often pays lip service to education while treating educators as an afterthought. The teachers' protests might be less visible than the students' because of the smaller number of umbrellas and the higher number of closed-door meetings, but they're no less passionate. So here we are, a nation caught between two waves of protest, each threatening to overflow the banks of our higher education system. It's a crisis, yes, but it's also an opportunity. It is an opportunity to reimagine how we value merit, support our educators, and prepare the next generation for the challenges ahead.\nThe solutions won't be easy. Reforming the quota system means navigating a minefield of vested interests and historical obligations. Addressing the teachers' concerns requires fundamentally reconsidering how we value education. But the alternative\u2014allowing this unrest to fester\u2014is unthinkable. There's a palpable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Bangladesh has been at a crossroads where the choices will echo through generations. The question is: Do we have the courage to make the right choices? The students and teachers of Bangladesh have thrown down the gauntlet. It's time for the powers that be to pick it up. The future of a nation's education and perhaps the country itself hangs in the balance.\nLet's hope wisdom prevails for all those young minds waiting to be shaped and all those dedicated educators ready to shape them. As the monsoon rains continue to fall, we're left wondering: Will these waters of discontent nourish the seeds of change, or will they wash away hope for another generation? Like the protests, the answer remains fluid and uncertain in the torrential downpour of Bangladesh's academic crisis.\nMeherab Hossain\u00a0is a young fellow of Oxfam, Bangladesh and a post-graduate student of sociology at Khulna University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The country that was once thought to be floating on gas is unable to make available sufficient volume of this fossil fuel to domestic consumers of various categories. The industrial consumers are worst-hit. The textile mills that need a large volume of gas in recent days have aired their grievances on a number of occasions through their associations. The domestic consumers don't have a voice for they are not organised under the umbrella of any such entity. The last fiscal year was a disappointing one for the industrial sector, as it recorded only 6.66 per cent growth, the lowest in last four years. The rate of growth was 8.37 per cent in the preceding year. Non-availability of sufficient volume of gas was one of the main reasons for such a poor performance. The gas crisis is still hurting the industries and the situation is unlikely to change for the better anytime soon. Quite a big number of factories in the key industrial belts like Narayanganj, Savar and Gazipur are dependent on gas for their operations. The gas crisis has been pushing up their cost of production, making it more challenging for manufacturers and exporters to ensure the supply of products in time. Industry leaders have already expressed their concern and written to the relevant ministries seeking an early resumption of gas supply to run their factories at an optimal capacity.The main reason behind the gas crunch is the flawed energy policy that the government has been pursuing over the years, demonstrating an inexcusable indifference to experts' suggestion to go for extensive domestic exploration for hydrocarbon. The government has been more interested in importing LNG since 2015 to produce power and feed domestic industries partially than putting in its best efforts for offshore exploration. The cost of LNG import, however, has increased sharply since 2022 as the global energy market became volatile amidst geo-political tensions like the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle-East conflicts. At home, foreign exchange reserves started depleting at a fast pace for both external and domestic reasons. The local currency also depreciated sharply, making the payments for the import of LNG in US dollar expensive. The crisis of greenback coupled with dwindling value of Taka forced the government to slow down the import of LNG. The net outcome has been a cut in the supply of gas to industry and power units. The government after a prolonged foot-dragging announced new oil and gas exploration move early this year. The results of the exploration work could go either way --- positive or negative. But the country would surely need uninterrupted supply of gas to help the wheels of industrial units running. And the government will have to ensure it, by any means. The immediate reason behind the current crisis is the damage caused to one of the two floating terminals at Maheshkhali in Cox's Bazar used for regasification of imported LNG. Cyclone Remal caused damage to a terminal on May 27, which was then sent to Singapore for repair. The Petrobangla authority is hopeful of terminal's return by the middle of this month, which it feels, will resolve the gas crunch problem. This particular development also underscores the risks and limitations of over-reliance on energy imports instead of exploring multiple options efficiently. It is expected that the authorities will revisit the energy policy and redesign it keeping in view the long-term needs of the country. The gas crisis is not only affecting the country's export market but it is also significantly pushing up the cost of living of the common consumers.",

        "full_article": "Iconic French military leader, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) emphasised the importance of logistics famously stating that his soldiers conquered vast tracts of Europe by \"marching on their stomachs\". Napoleon knew only too well the importance of a full belly. Just as a well-fed army is essential for victory, so is proper nutrition vital for the development of young learners' efficiency. If soldiers cannot perform their duty with an empty stomach, how can we possibly expect students to be anything different?Many students in Bangladesh, especially in rural and poverty-stricken areas, attend classes with an empty stomach, which greatly impedes their ability to concentrate and learn effectively. It is time to take heed and put into practice the wisdom of Napoleon Bonaparte.It has been reported that the government following a two-year hiatus, plans to reintroduce free midday meals in primary schools in 150 upazilas. This significant and commendable move is expected to provide nourishing food to young learners and help enhance school attendances and reduce school dropouts. This initiative, scheduled to kick-off in August, will embrace approximately 3.7 million students across 19,000 government primary schools mainly in poverty-stricken areas. Under the revamped scheme, the government will offer not only fortified biscuits, but also a variety of nutritious options such as seasonal fruits, bananas, eggs, and bread as a midday meal. This would perhaps be even more than what some students might get at home.The Midday Meal Programme is not a novel concept in Bangladesh. From 2001 to 2009, the World Food Programme successfully implemented a school-feeding project. Then from 2010 to June 2022, the government provided fortified biscuits to nearly three million children in over 15,300 primary schools across 104 upazilas, with some areas also receiving hot meals. The programme, however, provoked a public outcry and severe criticism in 2020 when the project officials proposed going overseas to have training on the preparation of Khichuri, a traditional local dish common to most Bangladeshi homes. The proposal was seen as an unnecessary foreign tour at the expense of the taxpayers. As a result, an extension of the Midday Meal Programme was ultimately abandoned.Now the re-introduction of the programme, perhaps, is going to be one of the most beneficial and humane acts the government has adopted for young school goers. A 2018 study by the World Food Programme revealed that midday meal programmes led to a 4.2 per cent increase in school enrolment and a 7.5 per cent reduction in dropouts. Given that the primary level dropout rate in Bangladesh stood at 13.95 per cent in 2022, down from 39.8 per cent in 2010, encouraging this downward trend is crucial.In the National Education Policy of 2010, the government incorporated implementation of a midday meal at schools. If implemented in a substantive and meaningful way, the MMP can yield a myriad of benefits. It can help remedy the problem of malnutrition, increase school enrolment, prevent dropouts, stop students from playing truant, contribute towards balancing the meagre family budget, and provide essential nutrients to needy members of the community.A midday meal program at school isn't just about providing free food. It can have a number of less obvious but beneficial effects. For example, it can make schools more attractive to students from lower-income families and help reduce child labour, as some children sadly take on difficult jobs just to earn a daily meal. For all these reasons, implementing a comprehensive midday meal programme in schools, especially for underprivileged children, can be a major step towards greater success in a country's education system.In 2018, when the midday meal programme was implemented on a limited scale, this scribe interviewed an Upazila Education Officer to understand its impact. It was learned that following the introduction of the midday meal scheme, the attendance rate, especially after lunch break, substantially increased. Children enjoyed their midday meals together in a festive and disciplined manner. After eating, they washed their plates and tiffin boxes, indicating a heightened sense of respect and responsibility. Previously, many students hesitated to bring tiffin, often ate unhealthy junk food during the lunch break or stayed hungry, while some went home for lunch and did not return to school. However, with the midday meal programme, these issues improved significantly. With their hunger satisfied, students could give full attention to their classes, and teachers felt more encouraged to teach due to higher attendance rates and enthusiastic participation. Overall, awareness of health, hygiene, and nutrition has increased, which will, in the long run, reduce the risk of malnutrition-related diseases among students.As Bangladesh aims to ensure that all children receive at least 30 per cent of their daily-required calorie intake by 2030, the mid-day meal programme will play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. By addressing hunger and malnutrition, the programme will help students focus better, learn more effectively, appreciate more the school system, and stay at school longer.The reintroduction of midday meals in primary schools will be a highly commendable move and those responsible for this initiative deserves praise. Not only does it help improve education and reduce poverty in Bangladesh, but it is also a clear visible investment in the nation's future, ensuring that children, regardless of their socio-economic background, have the opportunity to succeed academically and lead healthier lives. No child deserves to go to school hungry.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The megacity Dhaka's livability ranking as done by the global body engaged in the task, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), has never been uplifting. Dhaka has been ranked 168th out of EIU's list of 173 cities. To many experts, the city's livability index will continue to deteriorate without any hope of reversing the trend. In fact, the issue of livability has to do with the urban quality of life, which is measured by indicators like stability, healthcare, culture, environment and infrastructure. Given their high population densities, unplanned urbanisation and widespread poverty in the rural areas, the South Asian cities did never have the opportunity to grow in a healthy fashion. Dhaka is also not any exception. However, this is not to exonerate successive governments that assumed power since independence from their responsibility to improve the situation. Capital cities everywhere draw people not only from different corners of the countries where they grow, but also from abroad. The lure is in the opportunities for work they offer. Before the country's independence, Dhaka was a sleepy little town of about a million, a provincial capital of then-Pakistan. At that time, the city had its adequate green top cover, spacious playgrounds and many water bodies. But when it became the capital of an independent country, it woke up from the pre-independence slumber. Being at the same time the new nation's administrative headquarter and the commercial and industrial hub, people from every corner of the country made a beeline for the capital city. And when the entire country is a densely populated one, its capital cannot be otherwise. Backdropped by an overwhelmingly agrarian countryside, the city was yet to even think of the modern city amenities that industrial economies provide to their citizens. And as it has happened to most developing economies, except the few in Southeast Asia and Far East, Dhaka is yet to shake off the legacies of its colonial past.The politics and bureaucracy that run it are an extension of what it inherited from that past. So, it is loath to embrace any change. Small wonder that it does not bear comparison with European cities like Vienna of Austria or Copenhagen of Denmark or Zurich in Switzerland. Forget about those great cities that value their citizens. But can you believe that there are still cities in the world that are performing worse than Dhaka in terms of their livability ranking? They are Damascus, the capital of Syria, Tripoli of Libya, Algiers of Algeria, Lagos of Nigeria and Karachi of Pakistan. Except Damascus and Tripoli which have been destroyed by wars, there is no such excuse, like Dhaka, for Algiers, Lagos or Karachi to languish at the bottom of liveability scoreboard. It is the same old colonial legacies in which they are smugly ensconced. Is it not reassuring that we are not alone so stuck in a rut?Those concerned about Dhaka's well-being would come up with the oft-repeated explanations such as a lack of oversight and accountability on the part of the state and government agencies supposed to look after it. And why that is so is self-explanatory. Stressing the importance of good governance, some are also critiquing the ongoing development activities including infrastructure building rather as a problem than an answer to the city's woes. For these are happening at the expense of the environmental balance as the trees are being indiscriminately felled and wetlands filled up to expand the city.However, Rajuk (capital development authority), which is said to be coordinating the city's urban development efforts since it came into being close to seven decades ago, says it is working to decentralise Dhaka in a phased manner by 2030. Let's keep our fingers crossed that the next five year would make a big difference to the city's liveability status!\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Based on their press releases, it's evident that there is significant mismanagement and a lack of coordination between BCB management and the players.During every major tournament they participate in, things often deviate from the planned course, leading to a cycle of blame games. In contrast, other sports in our country like hockey, kabaddi, and women's football consistently achieve better results despite having fewer resources and facilities.
