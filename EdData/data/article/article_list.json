Conventional wisdom has been that high turnout numbers correspond to an anti-incumbency effect, and indeed, a sudden spurt in voting numbers could indicate a wave in a particular direction. But with voter turnouts, especially among the poor, going up significantly in recent years across India, changes in turnout numbers offer little by way of explaining the outcome. The drop in voter turnout in Punjab from 77.4% in 2017 to 71.92% in 2022, however, indicates a certain frustration with the polity in the State. In the last few months, there have been drastic changes in the party system following the removal of Captain Amarinder Singh from the Chief Minister\u2019s post, his leaving the Congress and joining hands with his erstwhile arch-enemy, the BJP. The anger over the farm laws that were later repealed, was felt the most in rural Punjab and the farm agitations against the Centre\u2019s policies should have provided a viable path for the ruling Congress to succeed. But the infighting within the Congress and its belated but logical promotion of incumbent Charanjit Singh Channi as the \u201cchief ministerial\u201d candidate complicated matters for the ruling party. Reports from the ground suggested that the Aam Aadmi Party was also able to capitalise on the general resentment with the two national parties and the Shiromani Akali Dal, but the fragmentation of the polity and a general lack of clarity among them over the issues that have affected the electorate seems to have dampened voter enthusiasm in the State. Also Read63.44% turnout in Punjab, 57.58% in UP as of 5pmIn the third phase of polling in 59 seats in central Uttar Pradesh, the voter turnout was 60.46%, marginally lower than the 62% voting in 2017 in the same seats. As with the earlier phases, there were a higher number of voters in rural areas compared to cities, a case in point being Kanpur city which registered only a 56.14% turnout. With identity politics, welfare and patronage dominating the narrative of the elections here, urban voters seemed less enthused compared to their rural brethren perhaps because of the lack of an adequate emphasis on civic issues in the political discourse. That said, ground reports from the three phases have indicated a closer contest in comparison to 2017 when the BJP had a field day sweeping district after district in the Assembly polls. Except in Bundelkhand, there has been enough of a wind behind the sails of the Opposition \u2014 the Samajwadi Party-led coalition in particular \u2014 and the high pitched third phase campaigns in the potato-growing areas are an indication that the election is not done and dusted. The relatively peaceful nature of the polls and the centering of socio-economic issues rather than religious identity bodes well for the next four phases of voting in India\u2019s most populous State.",

Under Rohit Sharma, the host\u2019s white-ball cricket proved far too superior to the men from the Caribbean. Scores were astutely defended, targets were successfully chased as India weaved a winning arc stretching from Ahmedabad\u2019s massive Narendra Modi Stadium to Kolkata\u2019s hallowed Eden Gardens. It was a welcome balm for a unit that was smarting under the defeats suffered in the previous South Africa tour in which both the Test and ODI series were lost. Those overseas setbacks, Virat Kohli\u2019s resignation from Test captaincy and the inevitable distraction of the recent Indian Premier League\u2019s mega-auction, were all pushed to the back-burner as Rohit\u2019s men prevailed over Kieron Pollard\u2019s troops. The results may be about the here and now but they do have a larger consequence as this is also an exercise to build sharp limited-overs squads for the ICC Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in Australia during October and November and the ICC World Cup to be held in India next year. For all its consistency in cricket across formats, India last won its significant ICC silverware through the 2013 Champions Trophy in England and it remains a sobering fact. Rohit now has the unenviable task of replicating the title-winning template that M.S. Dhoni specialised in.From the ODIs in Ahmedabad to the Twenty20Is in Kolkata, India found diverse heroes. Speedster Prasidh Krishna, who was named the player of the series in the ODI leg, caught the eye with his nine wickets. And in batting, Suryakumar Yadav topped India\u2019s run-chart with an aggregate of 104. Even without injured all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya, the host got its poise right as Rishabh Pant lent balance. Shreyas Iyer struck an 80 in the lone ODI he played and the new middle-order, revolving around Kohli, found its feet. In the Twenty20Is, India built on the confidence gleaned from the ODI series win. Suryakumar prospered while rookies like Venkatesh Iyer and Ishan Kishan had their moments. Seamer Harshal Patel found his mark and India\u2019s pace arsenal found another arrow. India ticked most of the boxes, even if the opposition, despite the odd flicker, offered no challenge. Going through a transition, the West Indies is building afresh under veteran Pollard. Batter Nicholas Pooran offered sustenance while a few others showed the odd spark, but that was not enough. In 1983 after losing the World Cup to Kapil Dev\u2019s men, Clive Lloyd\u2019s men landed in India seeking vengeance. The Test series was won 3-0 and the ODIs at 5-0. That West Indian swagger remains a distant memory while India aims to carve its own distinct winning quotient.",

        "full_article": "There was little cause for geopolitical optimism in 2021, and this grim trend has continued at the start of 2022. Almost every month over the last couple of years, a fresh emergency has dominated the news, contributing to a sense of a mounting tide of crises that threatens to overwhelm us.\nThe world is struggling to cope simultaneously with the seemingly endless COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of illiberal forces in many countries, the failure of international interventions that were supposed to stabilise conflict-ridden regions, rising great-power tensions, and military buildups in key territories. Beyond these immediate concerns, the impact of climate change, a major long-term threat to humanity, has become all too tangible\u2014and political leaders have yet to mount a sufficiently forceful response. Who could be blamed for feeling overwhelmed?\nIn the eyes of many citizens, politicians seem far from getting a grip on today's urgent problems and steering the world away from catastrophe. And the seemingly endless series of crises threatens to erode the public's confidence that they and their political leaders can shape a better future.\nThe current malaise arguably resembles \"learned helplessness,\" a phenomenon first described by the psychologists Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania and Steven Maier of the University of Colorado in the 1960s. In an experiment, Seligman and Maier were surprised to find that dogs that were conditioned to expect an electric shock after hearing a tone did not try to escape it, even when, in a later setting, they could do so by jumping over a small barrier. The animals, the psychologists reasoned, had learned that no matter what they did, they could not control their fate. So, they just gave up\u2014despite having the chance to escape.\nSeligman and his colleagues compared the dogs' behaviour to the symptoms exhibited by depressed people, and suspected that clinical depression results from a real or perceived lack of control over the outcome of a situation. The same may be true of groups. Smaller or larger groups of people, and perhaps even whole societies, may collectively come to believe that they are unable to effect positive change and, as a result, stop trying.\nIf so, the recent sequence of crises, and political leaders' apparent inability to cope with them, may be fostering a form of collective learned helplessness. According to new data from the Munich Security Index 2022, based on public-opinion surveys in the G7 countries and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), those who agree with the statement that they feel helpless in the face of global events constitute the largest group in all the countries polled.In the democracies surveyed, the \"helpless\" are in the majority: 57 percent of respondents agree with the statement, while only 12 percent disagree. China is the only country among the 12 in which more than a quarter of respondents (27 percent) disagree with the statement. Similarly, although the figures are in general slightly lower, majorities or pluralities of respondents in all 12 countries agree that their countries have no control over global events.\nOf course, one might ask why anyone should believe that they or their countries can steer global events. But the promise of control, even if an illusion, has been a crucial element of politics in the modern age, when human beings, rather than God or fate, are supposed to be pulling the strings.\nThis helps to explain why the widespread perception of a loss of control, and a longing to regain it, are key political themes of our time. Slogans such as \"take back control,\" \"America first,\" \"strategic autonomy,\" and \"European sovereignty\" all reflect the same underlying impulse.\nThe danger is that a widespread feeling of collective helplessness risks preventing the world from addressing the most important crises until it is too late. Societies overwhelmed by a wave of emergencies may end up meekly accepting what happens to them, even though they have the tools and resources to change it. In many countries, for example, people do not believe that the international community can successfully mitigate climate change, or do not trust others to do their fair share.\nBut while today's challenges are huge, our ability to cope with them will depend to a significant degree on our self-perception. Do we really believe that we are collectively helpless? Or are we willing to use our collective resources and intensify international cooperation because we believe we can turn the tide?\nAbove all, political leaders need to show that we can collectively \"unlearn helplessness.\" Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the challenges liberal democracy faces, leaders need to inspire a new sense of confidence at home and abroad that they can tackle the crises in front of us.\nAnd there is a silver lining. Notwithstanding all the angst about the future of democracy, Munich Security Index data also show that people still think democracies are better able than undemocratic countries to solve the problems of the future. Now they need to prove it.\n\u00a0\nTobias Bunde,\u00a0Director of Research and Policy at the Munich Security Conference, is a researcher at the Hertie School's Centre for International Security and co-editor (with Benedikt Franke) of The Art of Diplomacy: 75 Views Behind the Scenes of World Politics.\n",

        "full_article": "\"It will not be fair to look at the migrants only as economic actors. They have to be treated as human beings. They should enjoy the same rights and privileges as other citizens.\"\n\u2014 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\n\u00a0\nJohurul Islam of Gaibandha was a remittance fighter. He was barely 18 when he left Bangladesh to work as a construction worker in Malaysia. In the initial years, he would frequently send money to his family and visit home at regular intervals. There came a time when his parents passed away. This coincided with his legal status in Malaysia coming to an end. Thereafter, he never returned to Bangladesh, afraid that he would not be able to go back to Malaysia. He tried unsuccessfully to regain his legality, did any work that he could find and was still sending remittances whenever he could. It is to be noted that expatriates rarely lose their legal status through their own fault\u2014they are often victims of unscrupulous officials, agents and employers.\nAway from family and friends and not having access to proper healthcare, his physical and mental health deteriorated. He last spoke to his niece, Rumana, in early October, 2021. He said he had severe fever and abdominal pain but told her not to worry and that he would recover soon and send some money for her family. That was his last contact with his relatives. On October 21, 2021, he died a lonely death in a hospital in Ipoh, about 200 km north of Kuala Lumpur. A remittance fighter, who sacrificed all his adult life for the economic liberation of his country, fell on the battleground at the age of 55.\nJohurul Islam had no proper identification documents when he died. As a result, his relatives in Bangladesh became aware of his death much later when a picture of his dead body circulated on social media. A London-based organisation, Voice for Global Bangladeshis, requested its representative in Malaysia to seek the High Commission's assistance. The High Commission was extremely sympathetic but its position was that, as Johurul Islam had no legal status in Malaysia when he passed away, the government of Bangladesh would not be able to bear the repatriation costs. This was also confirmed in a newspaper report (Naya Diganta, November 2, 2021) quoting an anonymous official of the High Commission.\nJohurul Islam's relatives unsuccessfully contacted the officials in Bangladesh for financial help to bring back the body. Having no means, they sent a request to the hospital authority in Malaysia to bury him there. Being aware of this sad predicament, the diaspora in Malaysia raised funds for the repatriation costs. While they received support from the High Commission, the bureaucratic process in Bangladesh took a painfully long time for the preparation of the relevant paperwork. Finally, on January 1 this year, his body arrived at Dhaka. The government offered BDT 35,000 which was gratefully received by the bereaved relatives. His janaza was attended by hundreds of villagers.\nThe Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment has come a long way since its inception in 2001. It is committed to ensuring the welfare and rights of over one crore expatriates in 174 countries of the world. The ever-growing remittance flow in the country even in difficult times\u2014USD 25 billion in the year 2020/2021\u2014is an indictment of not only the hard work and patriotism of the remittance fighters worldwide, but also the visionary policies of the ministry. Indeed, Minister Imran Ahmed and his team have gained widespread respect, especially for their empathy and helpful policies during the difficulties of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhile this article applauds the ministry and, indeed, acknowledges it as one of the most successful ministries of the current government, it highlights the case of Johurul Islam to illustrate a grave concern that the ministry should consider addressing urgently.\nThe Overseas Employment and Migrants Act is the primary legislation that deals with migration and related issues. However, neither the legislation nor any relevant rules directly addresses the issues of the duty of the ministry regarding the death of an expatriate worker. There appears to be a policy, narrated in the annual report of 2020/21, indicating that the ministry ensures that the employer of the deceased pays for the repatriation of the body, subject to the wishes of the relatives. It also states that where such an employer is not found, the Wage Earners' Welfare Board, a branch of the ministry, takes the responsibility for such expenses.\nA worker, illegal at the time of his death, would unlikely have an employer willing to financially assist in any way. These workers are also unlikely to have family back home who would be able to bear the cost of their body being sent home. It also seems that the Board provides assistance regarding body expatriation only to those with legal status.\nThis situation appears to be morally and legally unsustainable. The legality issue of an individual abroad should not affect their rights as a citizen of Bangladesh. Discriminating between two citizens abroad on such grounds breaches the equal treatment rights guaranteed by the constitution. It could be the case that the ministry is failing in its statutory duty by denying responsibility in relation to such deceased persons. Furthermore, from a moral point of view, this particular group of remittance fighters is the most vulnerable and, therefore, deserving of extra help and respect from the state.\nIt is hoped that the ministry would look into this carefully and rectify its policy so that hundreds of families each year, like Johurul Islam's, do not have to go through the trauma of uncertainties. Indeed, as I pen this article, I receive the news of another fallen remittance fighter with \"irregular documentation\". Salim Bhuiya died in late January 2022, following a heart attack in Maldives. His body lays in the hospital morgue, while his family appeals for help to the Bangladeshi diaspora, who are trying to raise the money to return Salim Bhuiya's body to Bangladesh. These fallen remittance fighters and their families deserve to be treated with more dignity and respect by the government of Bangladesh.\n\u00a0\nNajrul Khasru\u00a0is a British-Bangladeshi barrister and a part-time tribunal judge in England.

        "full_article": "In the run-up to the budget for the 2022-23 fiscal year (FY), the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has initiated discussions with various professional and business organisations\u2014like the previous years. The finance ministry also does the same. The NBR's focus is mainly to seek fiscal proposals from the stakeholders. This is a commendable practice, which extends the opportunity to businesses and organisations to suggest not only how various sectors can get respite from tax burden, but also how to improve the revenue mobilisation by improving the collection system. It is widely discussed that despite Bangladesh's impressive growth, the domestic resource mobilisation is too poor. Unfortunately, the NBR is yet to gain any visible success in bringing all the eligible income earners under the tax net. It is hoped that, through such regular consultations between the NBR and stakeholders, a better tax system will come about in the near future.\nThe NBR has the most important role in creating fiscal space for the government to undertake its activities. However, the target imposed on it has remained unfulfilled in the last several years. Indeed, the targets seem to be unrealistic and beyond the NBR's capacity given its current institutional framework. One may recall that, in the budget for FY2021-22, the revenue income\u2014which includes both tax and non-tax income\u2014has been set to be 11.3 percent of GDP. Of the total revenue target, tax mobilisation is the highest\u2014about 85 percent. Also, in FY22, the revenue growth target has been set at 27 percent. But the trend of revenue growth in July-October of FY22 indicates that achieving this target will require more dynamic efforts, since revenue mobilisation has to grow by 30.7 percent in the rest of the fiscal year.\nThough several infrastructural projects are being financed through foreign loans, domestic resource mobilisation is crucial for achieving the government's short-, medium- and long-term objectives. With domestic resources, the government can prioritise its spending in line with policy priorities. But the constant shortfall of domestic resources creates a real challenge for the government in fulfilling such pledges. At the current level of domestic resource mobilisation, implementing its political commitments is difficult.\nAs Bangladesh is set to become a developing country by 2026, higher domestic resource mobilisation will become even more important. As a developing country, we will not be eligible for foreign aid and concessional loans. Of course, the country's image will be enhanced and the strength of our economy will help us source funds from the global market. But that may be expensive, since we have to pay the market rates of interest for securing such loans. This could increase the debt burden on the country. As the size of the economy is expanding, the need for additional finance will continue to increase. With the current effort for tax collection, it is not possible to meet the resource requirements.\nIt was reported in the FY22 budget speech that the number of taxpayers in Bangladesh was only 2.5 million. In a country of more than 165 million people, this number is astonishingly low. Reasons for tax avoidance are many. Some people feel once they have a tax identification number (TIN), they are stuck forever and have to pay tax even when they have income below the threshold level. Some feel there's no point of paying tax since they don't get their expected service from the government as citizens. Some feel since they need to pay bribes at levels of the government to get their jobs done, they shouldn't have to pay additional money as tax. So, while there is a lack of awareness regarding the responsibility to pay tax as a citizen of the country, there is also a strong argument for not doing so. The onus is, hence, on the government to eliminate such perceptions by providing hassle-free services to the citizens. The policymakers will also have to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted in the name of development or misappropriated through corruption. Good governance in the implementation of development projects and economic and social programmes is, therefore, key to mobilisation of higher domestic resources.\nAs for the NBR, a number of specific measures should be taken to increase revenue mobilisation. One is implementing e-governance. Technology can help establish an easy tax collection procedure and increased compliance as well. It can also be used to track people's lifestyle to determine their tax rates. Often, there is a mismatch between the declared income of individuals and their expenditure patterns. This is known to the NBR. With a modern system, more human resources and higher skills, NBR's efficiency can be enhanced in this regard.\nA number of reform measures proposed a few years back are yet to be completed. Among the proposed measures are the upgradation of Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA), consolidation and integration of Integrated Budget and Accounting System (iBAS++), electronic return filing, electronic tax deducted at source (e-TDS), automated customs risk management, and introduction of authorised economic operator system. These measures could help bring much efficiency in tax management. As the NBR formulates revenue measures for various sectors in the national budget for FY2022-23, the operationalisation of reform measures, some of which are already on the table, should not be sidelined.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).

        "full_article": "\"UK retailers ditch unethical suppliers,\" cried a recent headline in several international news outlets. Did I read that correctly? Apparently so. A new report from a major global commercial bank claims that the pandemic and an increasing focus on environment, sustainability and governance (ESG) issues are shifting business priorities among retailers in the West. The bank carried out a study on more than 300 retail decision-makers. The majority (51 percent) said sustainability was more important now than it had been two years ago, while 49 percent said the same about ethical standards.\nThe report highlights fashion buyers\u2014our customers\u2014as a key driver of the trend, with RMG retailers cancelling an average of 7.5 contracts compared to an overall average of six. The most common reasons for cancelling contracts were the use of unsustainable materials (39 percent), unfair working hours among suppliers (37 percent), and a lack of accreditation to an ethical or sustainable membership organisation (32 percent).\nThere are two ways of looking at these findings. Firstly, they reaffirm the belief that, as suppliers, we have to invest more heavily in environmental and social governance issues. As this report makes it clear, if we, as suppliers, are found wanting in this area, our customers will ditch us.\nI accept this argument to a large degree, and there is no doubt that RMG suppliers have spent heavily to meet the requirements of buyers in the past few years. The cost of auditing alone is quite frightening at times, and the trend for these costs is upwards. However, I do feel compelled to point out another aspect to this issue. The headline of this story was \"Retailers ditch unethical suppliers.\" What about the ethics of these retailers? I have to be honest: such headlines do grate on one's nerve, given the experiences of the past couple of years. When the Covid pandemic broke, many fashion retailers cancelled orders. Then they refused to pay for those orders, even when the orders were either complete or had already been shipped to the clients. In other cases, retailers demanded huge discounts on orders which had been completed. Suppliers were left with little choice but to agree to the discounts.\nWe all know that the pandemic was tough on everyone when it first broke out in 2020. Some retailers went bust, while others could barely afford to pay their bills\u2014just like their suppliers. But there were some others who refused to pay their bills simply to protect their balance sheets. Where was the \"governance\" in these cases? Missing in action, it would seem.\nThis is not just an issue around the pandemic\u2014the challenge of purchasing practices continues to be a huge concern for all suppliers. This is why there are so many different initiatives in this area. If the purchasing practices by brands were focused on ESG issues and were supportive of sustainability among suppliers, we wouldn't be constantly having conversations about this issue.\nBut we all know that this is not the case. While some fashion retailers are supportive and ethical where purchasing practices are concerned, others\u2014some of whom are big names\u2014continue to push the limits of what is fair, or even legal, in some instances.\nThe study mentioned above talked about unethical suppliers being ditched. Perhaps they deserved to be ditched. But, perhaps, there were also suppliers who simply could not afford to invest in the kind of accreditations that their buyers insisted they acquire. Or maybe the suppliers felt they had already jumped through enough hoops and felt aggrieved at being asked to pay for multiple audits, many of which checked the same thing.\nAs an RMG supplier, I will always beat the drum for a more sustainable industry, and I am pleased that ESG is now being discussed in our industry. There should be no place in our industry for businesses who treat their workers poorly, and the results of this survey suggest that there no longer will be, as we move forward.\nAt the same time, large retailers in the West surely cannot talk about the importance of ESG on the one hand, while using cowboy tactics themselves when doing business on the other. To take our industry as an example, it is only right and proper that we are all held to the same standards where ESG is concerned.\nFor a truly sustainable industry, with ESG at its core, we must all do our part (retailers and suppliers). We should all walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is Managing Director of Denim Expert Limited, and Founder and CEO of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange (BAE) and Bangladesh Denim Expo.\n",

        "full_article": "The government's decision to lift all Covid-19 restrictions, however poorly implemented, comes as a relief as it means resuming, with greater confidence, what has been a frequently halted journey back to normalcy. After two years of living with varied degrees of restrictions\u2014like maintaining social distancing, no congregation, no school or college, no public train/bus service, work from home, and so on\u2014people are set to feel the taste of unrestricted life. However, the rule of wearing masks outside home will remain as a safety precaution.\nThe government decision comes following a steady decline in coronavirus transmission, with a 7.82 percent positivity rate recorded on Sunday. We're hopefully seeing an end to the Omicron scare which saw cases shoot up since early last month. It makes sense then that instructions have been given to reopen schools (secondary and higher) from today and primary schools on March 1. Understandably, all higher educational institutions will follow suit and all offices, both public and private, will go back to their pre-restriction routine. This will provide the citizens with the opportunity to rebuild their economy and education sectors, the two worst affected areas after public health.\u00a0\u00a0\nTrue, there has been widespread criticism over the government's handling of the Covid crisis since its outbreak in early 2020, but its response after the emergence of the Omicron variant, especially the ramping up of the vaccination drive, has been largely satisfactory. So far, 10.25 crore people, or around 86 percent of the target population, have been vaccinated with the first dose. The government has already introduced booster doses, initially for senior citizens and frontline workers, and is mulling vaccinating children under 12. The latter move, once underway, will help pre-teen students get back to their classrooms.\nThe danger, however, is not over, far from it actually. Although the positivity rate has fallen, people are still vulnerable to infections and attendant health challenges. A total of 21 Covid patients died in the 24 hours till 8 am on Sunday, raising the total number of Covid fatalities to 28,965. This is a time when we, all of us, need to be careful to make sure the declining positivity rate is not turned around. The media must play its role to increase vaccine awareness. The public must continue to wear masks and follow other health guidelines with due seriousness. And equally importantly, the government must bring all citizens under the vaccination coverage as soon as possible\u2014thereby increasing the immunisation rate\u2014and send a clear message about the importance of continued mask-wearing and social distancing. Letting our guards down before the virus is fully eliminated may prove to be perilous.\n",

Two years have passed since then, but Myanmar has not taken any such measures yet. It has not taken any initiative to grant citizenship or ensure other basic rights of the Rohingya.\nAccording to Fortify Rights, in October 2016 and in August and September 2017, the Myanmar military deployed more than 11,000 soldiers who, along with police and civilian perpetrators, systematically massacred Rohingya men, women and children, raped Rohingya women and razed several hundred villages in all three townships of northern Rakhine. In August and September 2017 alone, some 750,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh and joined some 300,000 others who had fled waves of violence since the 1980s in Rakhine. The UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission also made a confidential list of more than 100 individuals suspected of being involved in genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. However, the UN Security Council failed to take any actions against Myanmar.\u00a0\nAgainst this backdrop, the case filed by the Gambia was seen as a big achievement. But the proceedings could not get momentum due to various reasons. The Suu Kyi-led government in Myanmar had raised objections early last year over the eligibility of the Gambia in filing the case. But later, after the country's military seized power, the National Unity Government led by Suu Kyi withdrew all preliminary objections to the case and accepted the jurisdiction of the ICJ for hearing the allegations. In fact, the NUG is now trying to gain international recognition by cooperating with the ICJ. Reportedly, it has many secret documents proving the military junta's genocidal intent, which can establish the genocide case in the ICJ.\nTherefore, the start of fresh hearings into the case gives us hope for justice. According to experts, the Myanmar military is now under serious international pressure, and even the ASEAN is not including it in its meetings. So, we think this is the right time for the international community to work together for the case of Rohingya justice, their citizenship and repatriation.\n",
