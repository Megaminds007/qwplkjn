But, it won\u2019t have any impact on election schedule\nAn election commissioner resigned less than a week before expected announcement of 2024 Lok Sabha elections. India\u2019s three-body ECI, heading into general elections, has two posts vacant. While some media reports indicate a PM-led meeting may be held mid-March to decide EC appointments, opposition parties have raised red flags about Arun Goel\u2019s departure. But worries articulated are, at this point, moot.\n\nTransparency helps |\u00a0It is certainly a matter of concern that Goel\u2019s sudden resignation surprised the institution itself. This speaks to the need for transparency within ECI, as much as with citizens and stakeholders. It\u2019s imperative that reasons accompany such high-level decisions, or rumour mills run amok. In this case, speculation on health and a falling-out with CEC \u2013 likened to Ashok Lavasa\u2019s resignation in 2020 \u2013 were strenuously denied.\n\nConstitutional check OK |\u00a0That said, there\u2019s no reason why elections should not proceed per schedule, either constitutionally, or operationally. CEC is in whom the Constitution (Art 342) vests power. Picking election commissioners is the job of a committee of PM, his chosen minister and LoP. This is not the best way to appoint ECs, there\u2019s an almost inbuilt 2-1 skew. But that\u2019s how the law was written, contrary to SC\u2019s judgment.\nIndia\u2019s most challenging election was its first one, in 1951-52. Only a CEC handled it, with resounding success. In 1990, the two EC posts were even abolished briefly. CEC is well within his right to single-handedly conduct the election.\n\n\nOperational check OK |\u00a0Every state election commission, which actually conducts the poll, is prepared to its teeth. As are railways and paramilitary. All told, about 1.5 crore poll personnel are involved. The system is ready, the gargantuan machinery waiting for word go. Jeopardising this carefully tuned detailed roll-out is not on the cards.\nIn 2019, elections were announced March 10, polls commenced April 11. Couple of weeks here or there matters little. That said, political parties\u2019 and candidates\u2019 campaigns are in full flow, and till election schedule is announced, they enjoy a free pass.\nOn disputes, fact is serious dispute resolutions are all settled by court, so an EC\u2019s resignation does not, in effect, impact that.\n\nCEC supreme |\u00a0CEC has tremendous powers, including deciding on matters where there is a gap in law. The post is above ECs \u2013 CEC can be removed only in a manner similar to removal of judges. But CEC can sack ECs. Goel\u2019s resignation came at an unfortunate moment. But there is little need to rush to fill the vacancies.\n\n",

That holds for even the most powerful ones. US is currently sending food aid to people of Gaza and bombs to Israel, which will most likely drop them on people of Gaza. This is not a matter of fine strategic thinking or tactical cleverness. It\u2019s a tragic farce born out of two things in conflict: America\u2019s seeming inability to call out Israel\u2019s aggression and its understandable concern at the human cost in Gaza. Of course, arms manufacturers are delighted.\n\nCynicism much |\u00a0Biden expressed much anguish about the Gaza situation in his state of the union speech last week. But so what? Netanyahu continues as before. Maybe Biden thinks he can fool all of the people all of the time. What\u2019s the plan here? Feed starving Gazans so that US-supplied Israeli bombs find them more easily? Yes, Mr President you have an election to win. But, surely, disciplining Netanyahu a bit isn\u2019t going to cost you a swing state.\n\n\nOthers are it, too |\u00a0But let\u2019s be fair. It\u2019s not just Joe. Putin is bombing Ukraine and killing and maiming thousands because, as per his logic, Ukrainians need to be saved from themselves. For US, Ukraine is atesting ground for new and old weapons. Oh, and who can forget that master strategist in West Asia \u2013 Qatar. It hosts the Hamas leadership, was home to Taliban\u2019s political office, and houses US and Turkish military bases. Not to mention the fact that it was an early investor in people who eventually ended up founding the Islamic State gang.\n\nWelcome to the grey-zone |\u00a0Then there\u2019s Africa. The world makes a song and dance about raising aid for beleaguered nations there, even as foreign govts secretly fund various militias to continue conflicts and expand their strategic footprint. The ongoing war in Sudan is a classic example. Dead Africans? Those are just numbers \u2013 and they don\u2019t make prime time news. Gazans, don\u2019t get yourself killed, your next meal is just about to be airdropped.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Rudyard Kipling could not be more correct when he wrote,\"East is East, West is West, and never the twain shall meet\". The implications of his vast oriental and occidental context are true on a mini scale in case of eastern and western parts of Bangladesh, a small country. Geographically, the 131-kilometre distance between the two parts is not even one-tenth of its counterparts in large countries. But communication-wise they are a world apart. Now the country's Roads and Highways Department (RHD) has taken up perhaps the most ambitious plan in the country's history to bridge the two wings by a highway to be named the National Highway 9 (NH9). The world has come a long way off from the time of Kipling and the socio-cultural difference between the East and West has also narrowed. People from once-colonies are now in key positions of power including the top job of the erstwhile most dominant colonial power. Such a development was once inconceivable. It has been possible because of shared scientific and technological advancement with information and communication prevailing over the rest. Bangladesh has already joined the bandwagon of emerging nations with its economy ranking 35th in the world. There has been phenomenal communication connectivity. Indeed, the two bridges on the Jamuna and Padma have catapulted the country out of the cumbersome and time-consuming communication between the capital and North Bengal, between the country's western-southern regions and the capital. Yet, it cannot be said the development in the communication sector has been rational and satisfactory. Its railways, the cheapest and most convenient mode of transportation, have not received the priority it deserved. Even the national highways, apart from the one connecting the Padma Bridge up to Bhanga on the one side and Dhaka city on the other together with the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway, leave much to be desired for qualification to the rank of true highways. Notably, NH has yet to enter popular lexicon for obvious reasons.So the new mega project, as envisaged to connect the country's east, west and south in between, can indeed bring the somewhat neglected southern and western regions closer to the east that has developed faster on account of its better communication with the capital and also because of the country's number one sea port. There is no doubt about the merit of the proposed highway but the cost involved may be a factor. In a riverine country with marine connectivity between Chattogram and Mongla ports, its priority certainly must be backed up by the benefits to be accrued, particularly when the Padma Bridge has facilitated road and rail connectivity. Preferably, the six-lane superhighway that has terminated at Bhanga should be extended further up to Barishal or even Kuakata, Khulna and Jashore. Even the Khulna-Barishal portion of the proposed NH9 can be considered with due importance because of much less cost involved in it. Now that the Payra seaport has been opened, the proposed bridge over the Meghna as part of the Barishal-Laxmipur segment of the highway can wait for some time. The required river training and river engineering will be highly costly. At this economic crunch time, a gargantuan amount of investment of this order may not be wise.",

        "full_article": "Migration is an all-encompassing title and needs to be unpacked into the contingent categories to observe its impact on society and the state. And it is not just the traditional external and internal migration but the elements within them. Migration has become a change factor beyond the parameters of most agencies, both formal and informal.Some scholars are asking if the conventional version of the State applies to Bangladesh or not if the majority is not connected to the national economy which migration has led to. Migration is increasingly pushing the walls of the state and insists that the key aspect that is the definition of the state of change be reflected in the formal instruments of statehood.That basically means the informal sector is pushing the formal structure. Prior to this, the formal left the informal alone and went ahead. That scenario is changing as the informal becomes more activist. And if the formal face of the State is the constitution, it's the informal behavioral structure of society that is the informal and both may be in conflict of sorts. And it's a meta one about who is in charge and who defines how the state should be described.One major difference between external and internal migration is that while one is dependent on the national economy the other is not. Hence, ill health hitting the RMG sector will impact on the internal migrants but the external migrant is part of the developed economy which in most cases is better off in crises such as the Covid phase. While reports suggest that a section of the Covid poor are still yet to recover, the external /global economy has generally recovered. And this is where there is a key difference between both. External migration can be organised around various destinations. The main zones are 1.European migration. 2. Middle East and South African migration. 3. South East Asian migration - Malaysia, Singapore etc. 4. South Asian particularly to India. In the last case we see some instances of social migration such as a section of the Hindu community having split family arrangements where income is earned in BD and India as well where the family lives in many cases of such migrants. This is also common in the UK and North American migration though without any social causation.While internal migration is limited in its capacity to ensure a better life, it's a positive option for many particularly women whose labour has funded the most popular wealth making in Bangladesh, the RMG sector. That move from the village to the city has of course led to significant changes in the lifestyle of women in both the urban and rural sphere. And it has led to an internal networking process similar to the global economic one in which external migration is located. Meanwhile, the gender factor in RMG related migration has already become one of the most significant triggers of social change. Villages are changing not just internally but externally and beyond the villages due to migration. As a result, the term \"change\" itself needs an expansion as change after a point becomes a transformation or transition. In almost all cases, the villages have gone global and migrants are sending /bringing home not just money but new approaches and lifestyles. It also is changing the internal dynamics of villages including the traditional family system. This is happening through three main processes:Remittances : It's not only the second highest source of foreign exchange earnings but an equal amount comes into the economy through the informal hundi network which remains outside formal /official calculations. Thus the impact of remittances is not just on the local but \"national \"economy. Consumption: Remittance is a major contributor to the expansion of the national economy and the market whether food, house building materials or electronic devices. The rise of consumption has led to overall economic opportunities for the non-migrant populations and produced a new culture where the rural urban divide is much less through common consumption patterns.State agencies: Local government's as representatives of the formal state have gone deep into the rural zones though there is little evidence that it has been able to exert dominating influences as the guardians of changes as desired by the State.Locating the relationship between informal needs and formal services delivery is therefore important.The size of the migrant population \u2013 migrants workers and an average family size of 5 -- would make it around 20-25 million x 5 = 100-125 million people. That makes it the majority population of the country of 170-175 million. Even a 20 million reduction would still not change the scenario. Thus they are not a segment but the majority living under the cluster of a new socio-economics.Similarly, promotion of cultural activities means expansion of their root culture which in this case would mean rural/village culture. Identification of their prime cultural and social activities, funding of the same, reasons for it and linkages with \"transitional hybrid\" cultural models showing emergence of new models particularly driven by digitalization. Whether the quantitative change is leading to qualitative change hence transition needs probing.It seems villages are changing within. They are also leaving an impact nationally. Migration has produced a \"global\" linkage across Bangladesh creating a new migration economics reality. This has produced extra-village linkages largely ending the old \"Village\". Meanwhile the State is not sitting idle.State agencies through local governments are trying to control the rural zones/migration through registration, supervision of informal networks, permissions etc. Its pushing for formalization of the traditional migration system using standard bureaucratic methods and offering some services too.Ultimately, the rural culture can't be ignored as the challenge grows bigger with an eye on its formalization. Thus a weak constitutional state has also meant a stronger social/informal one. The concept of the State-Village relations as the majority living under the umbrella of migration and the minority outside is pushing this as well. Has the village changed? Has the State changed as a consequence? Is it conflict or reconciliation due to change ?\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "On March 8, the International Women's Day (IWD), the national flag carrier, Biman, often the butt of criticism for its many failures, did something special that deserves praise. Though what happened had nothing to do with Biman's business performance, still it had a symbolic value. Actually, Biman on that day operated a flight from Dhaka to Dammam, the capital of Saudi Arabia's Eastern province on the Persian Gulf, in which all members of the air crew, from the cabin crew to first officer to pilot to even members of the ground staff working on the flight, were women. It was indeed an event of note for women of Bangladesh and for Biman because it hosted the event. Every year we hear of reports-- of how girls are doing better in public examination than boys. Even the results of last years' Higher Secondary Certificate Examination in which girls did better than boys not only in pass percentage, but they also convincingly outshined their male counterparts in scoring better grade points. And it was for the third consecutive year that girls outperformed boys. These results definitely show the progress the country has achieved in female education. Even so, these numbers do not say much about how those successful girls have been faring in higher education or in their professional life, if employed, after completing education. The all-female crew that flew the Biman's aircraft on the International Women's Day tell the real story of what women of Bangladesh are capable of. And they have demonstrated that in full view of their fellow men and women at home and others outside the country. It's a kind of feat that speaks for itself. Here no one will be asking how those women on the international flight number BG-349 of Biman did fare in their school, college or university exams. Of course, that does not mean that women's academic performance is not important. In fact, nowadays women have been declaring their proud presence in the academia, in research, in legal profession, in government jobs, business, politics, you name it, they are there. And in most cases, they are from the privileged class. But there are countless faceless others who did not ever get the opportunity to go to school and prove their potential. Even so, numerous unlettered rural women, many of them housewives, have proved their entrepreneurial skill by taking small loans from microcredit-providing NGOs. Becoming a flight attendant or a pilot needs a certain level of education. But becoming an entrepreneur, for instance, in farming, raising poultry or cattle what one needs most is the opportunity. The government is to create the opportunity by providing them with basic education, training and, of course, the seed capital to show their entrepreneurial talents. And the more women are trained in various trades, the more will they be able to prove their talent from farming to diving to flying aeroplanes. And these successful women will then be able to send their girls and boys to school where they will also be able to show their academic talents. But for that to happen, the entire education system would be required to be taken out of its elitist trappings and made affordable to all strata of the society. And it is such a society that can create more of aviators like captain Alia Mannan who flew the Biman plane to Dammam, first officer Fariha Tabassum, the flight attendants and other female staffs who made Bangladesh proud on the International Women's Day.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

While the Ministry of Education is striving to improve the education system by introducing hands-on learning, a growing number of parents are turning away from schools and enrolling their children either in madrasas or English medium schools.One significant reason for the rise of students in madrasas is that the new national curriculum has created a sense of uncertainty among parents. Parents are skeptical of the new system's adequacy in preparing their children for the future. Additionally, after the Shorifa incident, many have started thinking if the new education system is a threat to their religious faith and attempting to create confusion among their children.On the other hand, madrasas are offering a curriculum that combines both religious teachings and formal education. Many parents are placing their trust in this education system, believing that their children will receive formal education without having to compromise their beliefs. Consequently, madrasas are experiencing a surge in student admissions.Even though the claim that schools are going to be replaced by madrasas and Islamic schools might sound somewhat exaggerated, the trend of rising number of students in madrasas indicates that parents are losing faith in the traditional school system. The government should evaluate this trend and take appropriate steps to regain parents' trust in the new education curriculum.\nMohammed Omar AlamStudentDepartment of Management,Major in Management Information System,North South University[email\u00a0protected]",
