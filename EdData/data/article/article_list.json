        "full_article": "India\u2019s services sector seems to have had a great start to the financial year, if one were to go purely by the findings of the S&P Global Services PMI Business Activity Index. Based on surveys of around 400 firms across segments such as consumer services, finance and communications, the index reading stood at 62 in April \u2014 the highest seasonally adjusted figure in 153 months or nearly 13 years. A reading of over 50 on the index, constructed since 2005, indicates an expansion in activity levels relative to the previous month. To put the April number in perspective, the average PMI reading for services through 2022-23 was around 57.3. The increasing importance of the services economy to India\u2019s total output and job creation does not need to be reiterated much. As per the second advance national income estimates for 2022-23, the Gross Value Added (GVA) growth from industry as a whole slipped to 4.1%, with manufacturing tripping to just 1.6% \u2014 both of them had grown at around 10% in 2021-22. Services\u2019 GVA, on the other hand, is expected to have grown 9.1% during the year, accelerating from 8.4% in the previous year. Along with a pick up from the farm sector, services is expected to lift GVA growth in 2022-23 to 6.7% with GDP rising 7%.On the trade front, India\u2019s services exports are estimated to have hit a record $325 billion in 2022-23, reflecting a growth of almost 28% over the previous year. The strong uptick in such intangible trade and the resultant surplus vis-\u00e0-vis imports of services have significantly plugged the hole in India\u2019s current account deficit caused by a much sharper 40% widening of the goods trade deficit, which is reckoned to have hit $267 billion during the year. Growth in services exports during March had slipped to around 3% from 29% in February. However, as per the April PMI print, along with a surge in fresh demand and output for domestic services, outbound deals also increased at the highest pace in three months. That offers some comfort amid a strengthening global slowdown in major markets for India\u2019s IT-dominated services exports. Yet, the flurry of crises in U.S. and European financial institutions, a key clientele for India\u2019s tech majors, for instance, remains a worry. That services exports growth could moderate going forward is corroborated by the lower earnings guidance provided by IT companies as well as their extended dithering over on-boarding young recruits. The latter is part of an uncomfortable trend captured within the PMI reading \u2014 despite April\u2019s boom, job creation has remained negligible and input costs have resurged. Neither augurs well for sustaining domestic demand, which has already taken a hit from high inflation.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nexports\n\n/\n\nfinancial and business service",

The convicts were released last year. Justice K.M. Joseph\u2019s remarks that it was more than obvious that there was an attempt to avoid his Bench came in response to requests for adjournments on behalf of some of the convicts claiming they had not yet been served notice of Ms. Bano\u2019s petition challenging their release. The requests came on a day when the matter was listed for final hearing. No one can dispute the right of the convicts to be informed of hearings through proper service of notices, but it would be questionable if claims of not being served properly were made with an oblique motive. In the end, the Bench had to adjourn the hearing to July, long after Justice Joseph\u2019s last working day later this month. The release of the 11 convicts, who were serving life terms for multiple murders and the gang-rape of women during the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, had raised questions about the remission process. It became known later that the Union government had consented to their release. Justice Joseph had, at an earlier hearing, wanted to see the relevant files to ascertain whether the decision to release them was based on relevant considerations. The files were not produced on the stipulated day, but counsel for the Centre indicated that both governments may seek a review of the order to produce the files. However, in the latest hearing, the Solicitor General has agreed to produce the records.\rIt is debatable whether the outcome of a case will be different if heard by another Bench, but it is difficult not to see these developments in the backdrop of the influence the convicts seem to have with the incumbent regimes. They also seem to have considerable political support from the ruling parties at the Centre and the State. Their release itself came about as a result of another Supreme Court order which ruled, somewhat intriguingly, that the Gujarat government was the \u201cappropriate government\u201d to consider their case for remission, and that the 1992 remission policy, applicable at the time of their conviction, may be the basis. There is considerable interest in the outcome of this challenge as the question of jurisdiction on Gujarat granting remission \u2014 the trial took place in Mumbai and the appeal was heard by the Bombay High Court \u2014 and the correctness of the decision to release them prematurely based on a report of a committee that included political nominees have become contentious issues.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nriots\n\n/\n\nsexual assault & rape\n\n/\n\nprison\n\n/\n\njustice and rights\n\n/\n\ncrime, law and justice\n\n/\n\nGujarat\n\n/\n\nMumbai",

        "full_article": "In an extraordinary measure, the Supreme Court has asked the Allahabad high court to withdraw judicial work from a sessions judge and see to his retraining at the judicial academy. In truth, SC has only followed through on its repeated observations that judicial officers need retraining given the quality of recent decisions on bail. Its request of the high court of UP, the state that SC has earlier observed is also seeing a large number of \u201cillegal custody orders\u201d, is culmination of several instances over many months where SC has upped the ante from concern to displeasure to outright disapproval of two aspects. First, how trial courts handle bail hearings. Second, how high courts handle bail appeals and how they fail to discipline district or trial courts over whom high courts alone have supervisory powers. SC has no supervisory role whatsoever. While any law SC makes is binding on all courts as per Article 141 of the Constitution, SC can order a change in judicial practice. The onus thus is on high courts to ensure trial courts follow in letter and spirit what SC prescribes.\n\nThis underlines a complex remit. SC had months ago issued guidelines on bail and arrest. It has for long critiqued trial courts not following these guidelines, saying all too often that summons end up in arrests. Ignoring SC\u2019s bail guidelines results in unnecessary imprisonment and more litigation for overburdened courts. SC had said, \u201cEither trial courts are not appreciating\u2026 the ambit of orders of this court or for best reasons consider it appropriate to keep dismissing applications for bail. \u201d One SC bench viewed trial courts\u2019 predilection to deny bail as fallout of low conviction rates \u2013 that trial courts tended to view denial of bail as punishment. At the same time, SC has also frowned on a high court that directed a trial court to explain its grant of bail to an accused \u2013 SC said such \u201cunwarranted\u201d orders have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the independent working of judicial officers.\nIn a nutshell, pushing a high court to march off a judicial officer for retraining can make a section of the judiciary bristle on questions of remit. But focus solely on applying a principle of law \u2013 bail not jail. If retraining is required for making that good, so be it.\n\n",

The airline has resorted to a voluntary insolvency, which means that it can still operate once the process is over. However, for the time being India\u2019s aviation market is going to have a vacuum \u2013 Go Air\u2019s market share in February was 8%. Inevitably, already high air fares will rise further. That, however, shouldn\u2019t result in regulatory intervention to cap fares.\n\nThis development has come at a time when Indian domestic aviation is almost back to its pre-pandemic level. The passenger traffic in January-February was 24. 6 million, marginally lower than the traffic of 25. 1 million during the same period in 2020. With Go Air out of the picture right now, the domestic aviation market has a duopolistic character. Market leader IndiGo has a 56% share, while the different airlines controlled by Tatas together have about 26% of the market. Akasa is still in its operational infancy. India\u2019s aviation market, the world\u2019s third largest, is growing fast. What it needs is more competition.\nAviation is characterised by a low profit margin and high fixed cost. Therefore, once Go Air grounded around 50% of its fleet because of trouble with its Pratt & Whitney engines, it was in for turbulence. Leave aside IndiGo, the aviation boom of 2005-06 led by the low-cost carrier model has petered out. India at this juncture can ill-afford a market with inadequate competition. GoI needs to revisit its policy framework to look at changes that can catalyse new entrants. The aviation ecosystem, including airport expansion, depends on passenger traffic which, in turn, will hinge on competitive fares.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In September 2018, the most draconian, most criticised, and most objected to anti-media law was passed in Bangladesh, ignoring journalists. Today, its amendment process is on \u2013 according to the law minister \u2013 and once again the media professionals are nowhere in the consultation process.\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, at a meeting organised by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Anisul Huq, our law minister, said the DSA would be amended by September this year. Is he buying time till then, when he may say it is too close to the elections and there are many urgent things to do? This doubt is not based on unfair cynicism, but on the fact that he said the same thing so many times and on so many different occasions, including to the international community. For his credibility's sake, we hope he means it this time.\u00a0\nBut the process appears to be the same \u2013 ignoring journalists and letting bureaucrats run the show. And we can guess what they will produce, as they are trained to be against freedom of expression, freedom of thought, and freedom of the media.\nThe law minister said that \"we have nearly completed reviewing the technical recommendations on the law made by the UN Human rights wing,\" which were communicated by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk in March. The minister further revealed that a committee \u2013 comprising members from the legal and parliamentary divisions, from home and foreign ministries, from the ICT, law and justice divisions \u2013 is working on amending the law and have met \"two or three times.\"\nWe are delighted to hear it. But where are we \u2013 the journalists \u2013 in this process?\nThe group that has suffered many jail terms, innumerable arrests and most harassment, and the profession that has been devastatingly crippled, and which has most virulently objected to this law, have not been involved in this process. No representatives of journalist unions or editors' bodies have so far been invited to be a part of this discussion. Why this shutting out of journalists and editors? From the very start, amending the DSA has been one of the strongest and most persistent demands of the Sampadak Parishad.\nThe last time some of us were brought into the scene at the Parliamentary Standing Committee discussion stage was in 2018. All the objections we raised and amendments we pleaded for were totally ignored. Later, we realised the ritual was staged to enable the law framers to say that journalists were consulted.\nBut that was four and a half years ago. After our experience of oppression of journalists since the law was passed, the doublespeak that we saw the ministers indulge in, the numerous false promises that were made about processes to be followed before arresting a journalist and examining those who were victimised over the last four and a half years under the DSA, we have been forced to come to the conclusion that the DSA is such an oppressive law, such an anti-free-press law, and it is so structured that it would be better to make a new law focused on fighting cybercrimes than to amend this one.\nAnd here's why. The DSA has 20 provisions for punishment, of which 14 are non-bailable. Can a law start by punishing an accused without due trial? Denying bail means the accused has to suffer imprisonment from the moment he or she is taken into custody, even if he or she is found completely innocent by the court. Bail is denied only to habitual and hardened criminals whose staying out of prison poses a real and immediate threat to society. Are journalists considered to belong to this category? The sentences are on average four to seven years long, with the lowest being one year and the highest being life-term. Making 14 out of 20 sections non-bailable makes the purpose of the law abundantly clear \u2013 it is to punish and create fear, not dispense justice. And journalists are to bear the brunt of it.\nAt present, there are nine laws that directly or indirectly affect media freedom. Three more are in the advanced draft form. The draft of the amendment of the Press Council Act, which has not been shared with the media even after repeated attempts, brings the total to 13. In addition, there are initiatives by the Department of Film and Publications (DFP), an arm of the information ministry, to further jeopardise the prospect of print media's survival by attempting to restrict the online presence \u2013 especially of multimedia \u2013 of existing newspapers.\nSpeaking about the DSA, Information Minister Hasan Mahmud said on Wednesday that \"misuse of the law must be stopped.\" We welcome this statement and would like to know from when. As the minister directly dealing with journalists, his pro-action in stopping its misuse \u2013 which he himself said he wants \u2013 would be most welcome and earn him our gratitude. We bring to his notice that six global rights bodies \u2013 Amnesty International, CIVICUS, Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders, and International Federation for Human Rights \u2013 jointly stated that 56 journalists were targeted in Bangladesh in the first three months of 2023. This makes for more than 18 journalists per month. Dhaka-based Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) reported that, since its inception in 2018, a total of 339 DSA cases have been filed against journalists.\nOn the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the UN secretary-general said free media is a guarantor of all other freedoms and rights. Conversely, absence of free media sees a definite erosion of all rights, especially human rights and democracy. The whole world is an example of the above. Only countries that have free media provide stable and rights-based societies. The others show many prospects for a while, but generally falter later.\nJapan and South Korea provide interesting examples in Asia where democracy and free media played a crucial role in building their modern-day societies.\nJapan adopted democracy and free media immediately after its defeat in World War II, and stunned the world with its rejuvenating capacity, sustaining success in the 60s, 70s, all the way till the present day.\nSouth Korea adopted democracy after several bouts of military and quasi-military dictatorship, and proved that a rights-based society that enshrined all freedoms, including freedom of the media, was the best guarantee for sustained development. Being such a small country, it has proved what democracy and freedoms can do even though it has such an aggressive neighbour.\nBoth these countries allude their brilliant economic success to institutionalising democracy \u2013 not only making the appropriate laws but, more importantly, implementing them every day to every aspect of their societies.\nWe conclude with the two above examples because as we aspire to graduate from the lower-middle-income country status to the upper one, and advance to become a developed country later on. This cannot be achieved with physical infrastructure only. We need, and most crucially so, the infrastructure of the mind, of consciousness, of values, of the spirit \u2013 which only freedom can give, with media freedom being its inseparable component.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "April 24, 2023 marked the 10th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster. The progress that has since been made to improve safety in Bangladesh's RMG industry is praiseworthy, thanks to initiatives such as the sustainability compact, National Tripartite Plan of Action of Fire Safety and Structural Integrity (NTPA), formation of Accord and Alliance, Remediation Coordination Cell (RCC), etc.\nHowever, much of this success fades away when one considers that the country still lacks strong governing institutions that could effectively monitor safety issues in the RMG industry. On top of that, the emergence of new concerns due to the recent rise in workplace deaths and accidents has revived the age-old question: is the existing functionality and capacity of safety monitoring entities effective enough in ensuring industrial safety in our RMG industry?\nDepartment of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE)\nOver the years, particularly after the Rana Plaza collapse, the DIFE has expanded its technical and institutional capacity. Although still insufficient, the DIFE now has a bigger workforce and more skilled inspectors than before \u2013 the number of DIFE inspectors, for example, increased from 196 in the 2015-16 fiscal year (FY16) to 285 in the 2020-21 fiscal year (FY21). As such, the DIFE has been able to conduct more inspections in recent years than in the past.\nHowever, the number of DIFE inspections in the RMG sector decreased by almost 43 percent in FY22, compared to FY21. It is unclear what caused the fall in the number of inspections, particularly when the scope for them remains higher with a larger workforce as well as the recent introduction of the Labour Inspection Management Application, a digital inspection application of the DIFE.\nBut more than the number of inspections, the quality of safety inspection remains a major concern: the inspectors allegedly do not perform their inspections as per their mandate. On top of that, the extent of disclosure of information from the DIFE appears to be shrinking. Besides, the common concern for DIFE still persists \u2013 underreporting of accidents, injuries, and deaths of workers in the RMG industry, which mismatches with the data reported by other public and private agencies. DIFE does not have an M&E department either, which results in no internal evaluation of its performance and weak management of safety-related data.\nRemediation Coordination Cell (RCC)\n\nA specialised temporary unit of DIFE, the RCC was initiated in May 2017 to oversee the remediation of 1,549 identified National Initiative (NI) factories. The number of active NI factories reduced to 659 \u2013 some factories had to stop their operation due to safety non-compliances, others due to pandemic-induced bankruptcy. While the closure of unsafe factories has been a good sign, the slow remediation progress (at 54 percent) for the remaining active NI factories is still a concern.\nA number of factors are responsible for this slow progress of remediation, including: a) NI factories operating in rented buildings; b) comparatively weaker financial capacity; c) limited eligibility for availing credit support for remediation; d) the financial emergency induced by the pandemic; d) lack of self-interest for NI factories and pressure from the government, business associations, and their buyers (mostly non-European and non-North-American).\nMoreover, the remediation progress of NI factories is based on the original non-compliances identified during the initial inspection in 2013-2017. Understandably, new non-compliances have emerged in these NI factories, which are not considered for remediation progress. Moreover, the 54 percent progress does not necessarily mean remediation of the most hazardous safety compliances. This means that an NI factory can achieve higher progress in remediation while not addressing the most hazardous non-compliances. The data shows that the progress of remediation remained the least for non-compliances related to fire.\nIndustrial Safety Unit (ISU)\nThe responsibility of overseeing the remediation of NI factories has been shifted to the ISU, a newly formed unit of DIFE, transitioned from the RCC. Unlike the RCC, the ISU is a permanent unit, and its role is not limited to monitoring factory remediation of NI factories alone. Rather, the ISU is also dedicated to conducting safety inspections in non-RMG factories. However, till date, no distinct information and data could be availed from the DIFE regarding the current status of ISU. It is also unclear as to how the ISU will solve the many concerns that the DIFE and RCC had. For example, how the ISU will ensure that its inspector performs proper inspection, how its approach would differ from DIFE's inspectors, and how it will address the barriers mentioned above for the NI factory remediation are still not clear. Overall, sluggish progress can be observed in enabling the ISU to full functionality.\nRMG Sustainability Council (RSC)\nAlthough the RSC was expected to play a similar role as played by Accord, in reality, its functionality remains below par in many cases. As of January 2023, the RSC covered a total of 1,828 factories, for which the progress rate for the correction of initial findings was 91 percent. However, only 500 RSC-covered factories have completed full initial remediation. On top of that, the progress rate appears to be comparatively lower for a few common fire-related items.\nIt is alleged that there has been a lack of coordination between the RSC and other government agencies, resulting in slowed functionality. In addition, there is an allegation of indirect pressure (from employers and government agencies) on the RSC staff that prevents them from conducting independent assessments and resolving complaints actively, as they used to do during the Accord period. It is claimed that this is discouraging workers from reporting complaints through the RSC.\nAlthough one of the key mandated jobs of the RSC is public reporting, a downgrade could be observed in terms of the disclosure of information by the RSC. There was no continuous information update on its progress after May 2022 until recently; in March, the RSC updated all the information together up to January 2023. It is unclear what caused this delay in updating the information.\nIn addition, an inconsistency is observed in the regular reporting format of RSC data on its website. These include the disappearance of data for certain indicators, inconsistency in the reporting period (some monthly, some yearly), absence of a detailed breakdown, etc. It should also be noted that there is no reporting on remediation progress in boiler safety. Moreover, as per the licence of the RSC, it must report its update every three months to DIFE. But given the irregular data reporting of RSC on its website, to what extent it is maintaining this responsibility remains uncertain.\nWhat needs to be done?\n\nThe government's drive to increase the capacity of DIFE, including the ISU, must be continued. In parallel, the best utilisation of the existing resources needs to be ensured. In this regard, on the one hand, the accountability of its inspectors as individuals and the DIFE as an institution needs to be enhanced by increasing disclosure of information and taking action in case of violations of responsibilities. On the other hand, newly developed tools such as digital inspection, helpline service, priority inspections, etc need to be made fully functional. The current accident reporting mechanism of DIFE also needs major reform to capture real progress in terms of industrial safety.\nIn order to hold the RSC accountable, regular disclosure of its information needs to be ensured. The allegations of pressure from government agencies and businessmen need to be investigated. In this connection, initiatives need to be undertaken to increase the technical capacity and involvement of the workers' representatives on the RSC board. The collaboration between DIFE, RSC and MoC needs to be enhanced. Also, in order to hasten the remediation progress, timely implementation of the escalation protocol must be ensured.\nThis op-ed is based on the CPD RMG monitoring brief on \"Emerging Concerns of Occupational Safety and Health of the RMG Industry: Role of Public and Private Monitoring Agencies,\" published on April 13, 2023.\nDr Khondaker Golam Moazzem\u00a0is research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).\nTamim Ahmed\u00a0is senior research associate at CPD.\n",

According to the state minister for planning, much of the decline in the number of employed in the last quarter came down to seasonal factors. The period between January-March is usually a lean one for the agriculture sector, which is what has driven the rise in the number of unemployed people. Thus, the state minister said that the increase should not cause an alarm. While that may be true in one sense, if seen from a broader perspective, it should still be a cause for concern.\nAs evident from the numbers, agriculture continues to be our chief source of employment. In 2016-17, the sector accounted for 40.6 percent of employment, which increased to 45.33 percent in 2022. During this period, the share of manufacturing jobs declined from 20.4 percent to 17.02 percent, which raises a number of questions about the nature of our economic development. As an economy develops, traditionally, more and more people tend to move out of the agriculture sector and join the manufacturing sector. In the next stage of transformation, workers move out of manufacturing to join the service sector. The fact that such transitions are not happening in Bangladesh is puzzling \u2013 and not a good sign.\nIn 2022, the total number of people employed in the manufacturing sector stood at 1.21 crore, down from 1.24 crore in 2016-17. During that same period, industry and manufacturing in particular was the fastest growing sector in the country. The fact that production in the sector grew at nearly double-digits, while the number of employed decreased does not make any sense \u2013 especially since automation has not happened to an extent that could fully explain the decline.\nWhen there are no other employment opportunities, people tend to go back to doing agricultural work such as farming. And while there is no doubt that we need people to work in this sector, the fact that employment in other sectors of the economy is stagnating brings into question the quality of our economic growth.\nThis once again brings to fore the issue of whether Bangladesh is experiencing jobless growth, and why that might be. Clearly, these are issues that need thorough investigation. Without creating more quality and sustainable jobs for our people, what is the point of economic growth? The government needs to rethink its economic and developmental models so that they align with the aspirations of our people and provide them with better opportunities.\n",

        "full_article": "We are appalled by the news of torture of a 12-year-old domestic worker in Jashore. She was reportedly subjected to various forms of verbal and physical abuse at the hands of a couple over a period of nine months. Unfortunately, the case of the 12-year-old is one of countless such incidents that showcase the inhumane conditions under which domestic workers in our country are forced to work, in the absence of a proper policy framework and lack of goodwill from relevant stakeholders to implement concrete changes.\nA recent study by the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies and Dnet revealed that domestic workers are subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse (four percent), physical abuse (21 percent), mental abuse (67 percent), and verbal abuse (61 percent). But the sad reality is that an alarming 95 percent workers do not report any case of abuse. Many struggling parents send their children to work as domestic workers in the hopes that at least their meals will be covered, which means many don't have stable households to return to and are forced to tolerate the torture. Additionally, they either don't know who to reach out to for support, or don't believe the justice system can help someone in their economic position.\u00a0\nDomestic workers, constituting mostly women and children, are considered one of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in our society. It is alarming that we do not have any comprehensive law to protect them, other than the Domestic Servants' Registration Ordinance of 1961 which states that domestic workers in five metropolitan areas of Dhaka must register with the police. Although the Domestic Worker Protection and Welfare Policy was formulated in 2015, it is not legally binding, which may explain why we haven't seen any real results yet. The stakeholders of this policy \u2013 domestic workers, employers and law enforcers \u2013 are unaware that any such policy exists. It is extremely disheartening to see that the central monitoring cell, which was established three years ago under the labour ministry to oversee implementation of the policy, failed to convene a meeting even once during this time.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the policy itself is not watertight. In fact, just last year the High Court condemned the policy for being \"incomplete\" and \"vague\" as it did not specify the amount of compensation for victims of violations, payment method, number of leave days, and appeal process for domestic workers who were denied leave.\u00a0\nIt is high time the government took urgent steps to address the gaps in the policy, as suggested by the High Court, and ensure that it is implemented in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. It must also guarantee that law enforcement and the legal system provide necessary services to domestic workers if they are subjected to abuse. Meanwhile, NGOs and rights activists should focus on raising awareness among domestic workers regarding their rights and compensation. The government should also focus on establishing a minimum wage for domestic workers and sensitise law enforcement to better handle such cases.\n",

        "full_article": "That operation of brick kilns in most cases has remained not only non-compliant but also illegal has been confirmed by the Anti-Corruption Commission's (ACC's) annual report, 2022. The majority of the kilns illegally use firewood as their fuel for baking bricks and many of those are set up in areas which have been made off limit to such blast-furnace by law. This is, however, not all the malpractices that brick manufacturers use in their trade. Taking advantage of the loopholes in the Brick Manufacturing and Brick Kilns Establishment (Control) Act, 2013 and the Bangladesh Environment Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2010, some owners even take recourse to deception in misrepresenting their brick manufacturing units as factories for production of concrete or compressed blocks. Clearly, the ACC report on brick kilns conforms to the disclosure the minister of environment, forests and climate change made recently that only 41.2 per cent of kilns are running legally while the rest 58.8 per cent are operating illegally. What all this shows is that the problem is known to the authorities concerned but there is no effective action to bring order in this vital area of construction. The need was to ban brick making within a reasonable time frame in order to save the country's fertile agricultural land ---its top soil in particular, hills, ponds, pastures, fallow lands and above all the environment. Until June, 2022, there were 7,881 brick kilns on official count. Most likely, there are brick kilns in unlikely places, on which at times the newspapers report and hence the figure could be higher. One of the reasons for the world's worst air quality in the capital and deterioration in the same in other places in the country is certainly the rampant burning of firewood in brick kilns. If the illegally operating brick kilns are more than 4,000 and those along with the kilns posing as factories for producing concrete blocks use firewood and coal as fuel, the combined annual emission of particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, nitric oxide and sulfur oxide should be enough to poison this small country's environment and agricultural land which in turn has serious impact on human health and livelihoods.Now the billion dollar question is, why and how this can happen when the authorities and the operators all know of the malpractice and the irreparable damage caused to the environment, agriculture and health. In its observation, the ACC accuses the inspection teams point blank that they avoid mentioning irregularities in the operation of brick kilns in exchange for bribe money. Also, the Department of Environment (DoE) has neither the manpower nor the logistics and fund to monitor and enforce laws. The fact is that the teams in charge of inspection are abusing their authorities for personal financial gains. This means the virus is in the antidote. That it would be any different if the DoE were empowered may also prove illusive unless a crash programme is undertaken to demolish all the illegal brick kilns and the owners of the units are encouraged to manufacture concrete blocks. This has to be done in the interest of the land and its people.",

        "full_article": "The quarterly data from the Labour Force Survey unveiled by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) on Tuesday show that the number of the unemployed in the country rose by 0.27 million to 2.59 million in the first quarter of 2023 from 2.32 million in the last quarter of the previous year. Thus the rate of unemployment has also gone up from 3.2 per cent to 3.51 per cent during the period. This could be alarming but for two reasons: first, the total jobless people in the new year's first quarter is fewer than those of the corresponding quarter of the year 2022; second, this is the season when agricultural labourers have hardly any work. Notably, of the 71.10 million labour force in the country, 31.90 million ---obviously the overwhelming majority--- are employed in the agriculture sector.With the beginning of harvesting of Boro paddy in the first and second week of April, the unemployment in the sector eases off. In fact, there is a crisis of workers during the harvesting season. This has forced the introduction of combined harvesters in many areas including the haors where rains in the upper riparian regions always pose a threat to paddy harvest. Seasonal variations in unemployment are quite natural in almost every country. But where employs the lion's share of the labour force, employment situation is more fluctuating. So this quarterly ups and downs are not highly concerning. When the employment parameters of industries and service sectors are disrupted, there is cause for serious concern. This quarterly data of the Labour Force Survey do not give such details as the seasonal migration of rural workers to cities and towns for alternative employment such as rickshaw pulling and vending. The majority of them also go back to villages to reap Boro paddy. With large-scale mechanisation of agriculture, this process may be seriously affected. So the question centres around how the country's industrial and service sectors are faring in the post-pandemic and Ukraine's war-induced global recessionary regime. The forecast made by the World Economic Forum in its latest report, 'Future of Jobs', however, is hardly encouraging. In the next five years, 83 million employees in the world are likely to lose their jobs. The job market, including in India with the largest number of population, will be in turmoil. Until 2027, only 69 million jobs will be created. This means that the job market will shrink severely instead of expanding. But there is a need for providing for the growing army of workforce in the least developed and developing countries. True, in some highly industrial countries the number of employees, workers in particular, is declining. But with increasing automation and more particularly intervention of the artificial intelligence (AI) in human brain works, there will be a paradigm shift in the way industry and the service sector run. What is frightening is the dire prediction of Geoffrey Hinton, the 'godfather of artificial intelligence' to the effect that the advancement made in the AI poses, \"profound risks to society and humanity\". When the man who created the foundation technology for the AI system and was involved with the Google and OpenAI---the start-up behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, finds the AI marching on at dangerous speeds to eclipse human intelligence threatening jobs and spreading misinformation, there is no reason to take the warning lightly. His resignation from Google confirms his conviction of the catastrophic implications of AI on society and the makeup of humanity. The worst case scenario, as Hinton paints, is the misuse or abuse of the immense power of AI by bad actors or megalomaniacs. Even if this does not reach that stage, there is the fear of enactment of the Orwellian vision of big brothers ruling the roost. So there is no reason to go gaga over the AI as the tech giants would like people the world over to believe in its unlimited merit. In countries with oversize populations like Bangladesh, even extensive automation can bring about social disasters so far as livelihoods of the vast majority are concerned. Bangladesh has its awful incompatibility between its education system and the job market. The primary task for the government is to make education, higher education in particular, equal to the task of meeting the requirement of different sectors including the special requirements of different local situations. It is a fact that the percentage of the unemployed among youths with higher education is the highest in the country. As high as 33.19 per cent graduates and post-graduates are unemployed here. How the new education curriculum will be able to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of manpower at the higher and middle echelons of the job market is yet to be seen. There has to be a transition to green energy and technology in order to overcome the dependence on imported fossil fuels. So, the education ought to focus on developing knowledgeable manpower that can take up the challenge of building a green and eco-friendly Bangladesh in the future. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has been failing to pay money fallen due to the private power plants on account of power purchase and capacity payments in recent months. Its debt to power plants is a staggering one. Now, the Power Division is facing an even bigger problem having serious implications for the power supply situation during the ongoing summer season. The newly built 1,320 megawatt Payra thermal power plant belonging to the Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL) might go out of operation after a couple of weeks because of the non-availability of coal. The BCPCL does not have enough funds to import coal. The China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) has been making available funds to the BCPCL for importing coal. Now the CMC has written to the power company to pay USD293 million that has fallen due on account of coal import. It reportedly has refused to give any fresh loan unless and until the arrear money is paid. The Payra power plant authorities have raised the issue with the ministry concerned and are now waiting for measures. However, the problem though recent is not a unique one. One unit each of the Rampal power plant and Barapukuria plant is now closed for coal shortages. Two plants together generate 935 megawatts. Thus, if the Payra plant goes out of operation, the national grid will lose a supply of 2,250 MW of power. The dollar crunch that has given rise to a plethora of problems in the national economy is also responsible for the coal shortage. An identical problem had cropped up in the early part of the current year involving the supply of coal for the Payra power plant. But that was solved following payment of arrears in dollars. Now the problem has turned more complex with the dollar crisis becoming graver. The government surely will try to resolve the issue as early as possible. But, meanwhile, the power supply situation in some parts of the country might deteriorate because of the shortfall in generation. There are reports on power outages galore in different areas of the country. Since Dhaka is not experiencing frequent outages these days, the power problem does not get much importance in the media. The BPDB, naturally, is more interested in keeping satisfied the Dhakaites as far as the power supply is concerned. But, if the Payra plant goes out of operation because of a coal shortage, supplying power uninterrupted to all areas of Dhaka city might prove to be a daunting task. It will be possible only by keeping the people of most other parts of the country power-starved for longer periods. Since 2010 the power situation has improved remarkably due to higher power generation. But the strategy pursued to achieve the goal has not been particularly perfect. The private sector got a place in power generation but at the cost of subscribers who are paying far more than due because of the installation of so-called rental power plants in large numbers and with no checks. It is difficult to say that the policy adopted to ensure the establishment of large conventional power plants has also been a sound one. The country has seen a notable rise in power generation capacity during the past decade. But the supply of power is yet to be smooth and uninterrupted at an affordable cost. The power sector managers need to look into the problems and address those. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

In a quiz, which is also known as a mind sport, participants compete to answer questions either individually or in teams correctly. A quiz is an interactive avenue, where students learn, look for possibilities to succeed beyond the classroom, and secure their future. Also, students develop the habit of creative learning early on since questions are not focused on the curriculum and demand critical thought and in-depth study. The Thakurgaon wing of Bangladesh Betar used to broadcast a total of three popular quiz programmes back in 2008 and 2009. Akhtar Hossain was the anchor of these programmes, where the winners would get a chance of being awarded and interviewed by the radio station. These educational programmes used to get a lot of listeners. Students were especially interested to listen to those programmes. We do not know why such poplar programmes have been terminated. If the government wants to make radio popular once again, it definitely needs to organise these types of programmes. I hope Bangladesh Betar Thakurgaon will pay heed to my proposal and organise such quiz programmes once again. \nAshikujaman Syed,Research Assistant,Bioinformatics Research Lab,Center for Research Innovation and Development (CRID),[email\u00a0protected]",
