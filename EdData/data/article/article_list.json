As the entire process is an outcome of the Supreme Court judgment of November 2022 on the validity of amendments made in 2014 to the Employees\u2019 Pension Scheme (EPS), the matter pertains to two categories of applicants \u2014 those who retired from service prior to September 1, 2014, and those who left service after the date and those who are still in service. Nearly 16 lakh applications have been received so far. Yet another extension cannot be ruled out. After all, it is too early to indicate that higher pension disbursal will begin this financial year, even if applicants meet all the terms and conditions. The Union Labour and Employment Ministry, which oversees the EPFO, told the standing parliamentary committee concerned early this year that the implications of the Court\u2019s verdict on the EPS had not been factored in, while preparing the Budget estimates for 2023-24.The most important issue of concern is the lack of clarity on the amount pension members and pensioners will receive, should their applications be accepted. Their anxiety is understandable as they \u2014 particularly those still in service \u2014 give their consent to transfer a substantial portion of their PF savings to the Pension Fund. Though pensioners will have to make payments separately to be considered eligible for higher pension, they would also be keen to know how much pension they would get. It is against this backdrop that the EPFO has sent demand letters to about 1,000 pensioners and employees for collecting arrears. As the calculator on the EPFO\u2019s website only indicates the amount to be transferred, it is time that the EPFO gave an indicative figure of pension, at least to applicants who have been issued the letters. In the case of the pre-2014 retirees, it appears that the PF authorities have not yet officially commenced communication on the status of their applications, even though, under the rules, most of these may not stand the test of scrutiny. Employers have the Herculean task of producing physical records for every applicant. As not all establishments will have these records, the sensible option for the EPFO would be to share its database with employers for the limited purpose of establishing applicant authenticity. The situation is more complicated for establishments that are no longer in existence \u2014 there appears to be no way out for their employees and pensioners to apply for higher pension. Given that the spirit of the judgment is to provide a better social security net, the Union Ministry and the EPFO should be proactive in simplifying the process and ensuring that every deserving person gets the benefit.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npension and welfare\n\n/\n\nwage and pension\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)",

Previously, India hosted the championship in 1987, 1996, and 2011; and even if the 2023 edition\u2019s base was well known in advance, it was on Tuesday that the ICC, in tandem with the BCCI, announced the final schedule of matches that commence on October 5 and conclude on November 19, with Ahmedabad hosting both the inaugural game and the summit clash. The perception that the host nation never wins has waned over the last few editions as India (2011), Australia (2015) and England (2019) broke through the jinx. And as the World Cup returns to India during its festive season, it remains to be seen if the Men in Blue can add to the fireworks. The gimmicky unveiling of the cup up in the skies on Monday was part of the high-decibel marketing campaign, but what matters is the action on the turf. With domestic T20 leagues eating into the calendar, ODIs need the World Cup to stay relevant. The willow game, lost between the romance of Tests and the frenzied thrills of T20, has seemingly ignored the charms of the good old ODI. The latest World Cup may perhaps reboot ODIs.Cricket is a sport with a limited global footprint and the ICC\u2019s big ticket championships play a part in propagating the game beyond the former British colonies. In India, with its summers propping up the Indian Premier League, while domestic cricket draws in the proverbial two men and a dog, this World Cup offers another opportunity to attract the crowds and infuse life into ODIs. That former champions West Indies and Sri Lanka are jostling in the qualifiers remains a sad reality while it is heartening to see Afghanistan in the main draw. Closer home, Rohit Sharma\u2019s men have the difficult task of repeating what M.S. Dhoni\u2019s troops did in 2011. From that winning outfit, Virat Kohli remains an enduring link and he and his colleagues have to end the drought in ICC events. India last won a title \u2014 Champions Trophy \u2014 in 2013, and has subsequently failed. Off the field, diplomacy will come into play as Pakistan, upset with India\u2019s reluctance to tour, has been aloof; the least the Indian government could do is to smoothen the visa process. Australian Usman Khawaja with Pakistani roots and the Pakistan football squad had to wait for a visa till the last minute, and it reflects poorly on a regime fully aware of sport\u2019s soft power.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n \nRelated Topics\n\ncricket\n\n/\n\nICC World Cup\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nAustralia\n\n/\n\nBCCI\n\n/\n\nICC\n\n/\n\nPakistan",

When I last published the results in 2021, warnings were flashing red particularly for France, where billionaire wealth was rising fast and concentrating in family firms like LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate.\nBy early this year, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault was a prime target of Paris protests, his image showing up on placards. Last month, demonstrators rallying against pension reform stormed the head quarters of LVMH and Arnault, who has nothing to do with pension policy but has become a symbol of the new gilded age.\nThe 2023 Forbes list shows that, worldwide, billionaires are down slightly in numbers and wealth from the pandemic peaks but still up sharply over the last two decades. There were 500 billionaires worth a total of less than $1tn in 2000; now there are more than 2,500 worth over $12tn. Billionaires remain a potential protest target, particularly in countries where my warnings still flash red. Ironically, these include most prominently nations with deep socialist roots, including France, Sweden, Russia and India.\nRead full story on TOI+\n\n",

Of late, cross-country comparisons have stirred a debate in India. A paper by the PM\u2019s economic advisory council on GOI\u2019s problems with them, which was distilled on this page by Sanjeev Sanyal and Srishti Chauhan (\u2018How A Handful Measures The World\u2019, June 16) frames the underlying issues as those related to methodology and motivation.\n\nDifferences over methodology are not unusual. For example, CAG\u2019s calculation of GOI\u2019s fiscal deficit is sometimes more than what the finance ministry documents. It\u2019s on account of differences in the way some GOI expenses such as bank recapitalisation bonds are accounted for. Both estimates have their uses. GOI rightly critiques some aspects of methodologies that go into cross-country comparisons. However, the critique doesn\u2019t make those crosscountry comparisons irrelevant. To illustrate, the EAC\u2019s paper pitches for \u201cindigenous benchmarks\u201d ahead of WHO\u2019s standards in estimating child stunting. Indeed, there\u2019s work already done in India using such benchmarks. The catch here is that cross-country comparisons require standardised metrics. Comparisons of dissimilar national measures are meaningless.\nThe aim of quantification is to clarify, not pacify. Adjusting data to a desired end will defeat its purpose. Leave aside the predominantly opinionbased rankings, a lot of cross-country comparisons are based on each country\u2019s data generation. When seen through this prism, the charge that cross-country rankings are motivated is less convincing. For instance, another controversial area is the female workforce participation in India. It\u2019s lower than the global average and also much lower than the measure for most countries in southeast Asia. Here, the EAC paper finds fault with the approach of GOI\u2019s statisticians who have been slow to incorporate changes that ILO\u2019s statisticians have suggested.\nThat\u2019s the biggest problem facing India\u2019s data generation today. There are big gaps here and even an essential survey on national consumption expenditure was discarded by GOI on grounds of poor data quality. In an era dominated by quantification, India hasn\u2019t addressed problems at the primary stage of collection. Even the decennial census has been postponed. Therefore, upgrading the statistical system is the priority. Separately, India, now with a seat at the global high table, should work on influencing institutions which generate and use cross-country data. This aim will benefit from a robust domestic statistical system.\n\n",

It is as much about swinging the spotlight back on issues of retirement age for judges and the filling of vacancies, both long recommended to reduce pendency. SC judges retire at 65, HC judges at 62. Matters pending in SC are over 68,000; in the 25 HCs backlog is over 59 lakh cases. Yes, flawed probes, shoddy prosecution and bad lower court rulings contribute to the pile-up in HCs and appeals in SC. Quality matters, but vacancies only make it worse. HCs till six months ago functioned with 778 judges against a sanctioned strength of 1,108.\n\nThe justice department December last told a house panel that increasing judges\u2019 retirement age may have a \u201ccascading effect\u201d, with government officers demanding the same; that the move risked extending service years of non-performing judges, and that there will be a shortage of judges for tribunals. This is surely making too much of too little. The US Supreme Court for instance appoints judges for life. By setting aside a simple workable solution, GOI, which needs to amend the Constitution to implement the age tweak, slows disposal of cases. Filling of vacancies also continues to be a long-drawn prickly process, a quagmire of power and politics, and a GOI-SC tug-of-war we witness all too often.\nIt is admirable the retiring judge took the unusual step of delivering verdicts during court\u2019s vacation, ensuring the cases would not have to be heard afresh by new benches. This judge, like most others before her, will continue to work. No retired judge ever retires. It begs the question, would it not serve litigants better if they continued to be court judges for some more years?\n\n",

Since Eid-ul-Azha involves a lot of activities and preparations for both individuals and institutions, it is important that all of us do our part so that the spirit of the festival can be upheld.\nThere are three aspects that deserve particular attention.

According to a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), prepared for the period between FY2014-15 and FY2018-19, irregularities in budget spending by CMSD caused the government to lose Tk 459 crore in these five years. The report, placed at the parliament recently, revealed how this procurement agency had been involved in various malpractices.\nDuring this five-year period, the CMSD supplied medical equipment to medical colleges and hospitals which remained largely unused. In many cases, it supplied the machinery without following proper protocols. Among the institutions audited, three \u2013 Khulna Medical College Hospital, Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, and Rangpur Medical College Hospital \u2013 alleged that the CMSD supplied those products unduly and without their consent, while other auditees said that the machinery in question would be installed soon. Moreover, in FY2016-17, different government institutions acquired medical and surgical supplies from CMSD at prices that were up to 18 times more than that offered by the Public Health Institute and the Essential Drug Company for similar products, which is outrageous.\nThe question is, can the CMSD just supply machinery without consent or request by the hospitals? Also, why would government institutions take supplies from it if they do not need them, and also at inflated prices? Clearly, the CMSD has been conducting these illegal activities with help from inside the hospitals, which must be looked into.\nOur health sector has been riddled with corruption for long. The CAG audit report has just exposed it once again. Irregularities in medical equipment purchase are, however, just one aspect of the problem, with corruption permeating every level of the health sector, as the High Court has recently observed. We urge the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the irregularities done by the CMSD in connivance with public hospitals, and identify those responsible for such a waste of public money.\n",

        "full_article": "Do you feel, whenever the realms of books and bureaucracy converge, that something very non-bibliophilic is about to happen? I do, and my instincts tend to be accurate. After all, it is bureaucracy that is largely responsible for restricting the free flow of ideas and undermining academic freedom in Bangladesh. It is bureaucracy that punishes critical publications. It is bureaucracy that compromises the integrity of school textbooks through undue additions or omissions. It is bureaucracy that has reduced the quest for knowledge to a quest for BCS jobs. It is bureaucracy that has robbed the spirit of our Language Movement by marginalising mother languages \u2013 including Bangla. It is because of bureaucracy that once-revered state awards for writers are now objects of ridicule.\nI can go on and on about the detrimental effects of bureaucracy on the world of literary endeavours, but you get the point. There is something about the intertwining of paperwork, protocols and politics that can lead to a tragic loss in translation. As grand visions and initiatives of the government are filtered through layers of bureaucracy, they emerge altered, diluted, or even entirely lost.\nTake, for example, the case of Jatiya Grantha Kendro, or National Book Centre. Few people are perhaps aware that there is a specific government institution responsible for overseeing non-government libraries. There can be any number of reasons for its relative lack of familiarity. If I had to guess, I would say it's because this is how those in charge of it want it to be \u2013 less known, less scrutinised.\u00a0\nFor there is a lot about this institution that, bureaucrats would hope, is better left buried under the rug. As per a recent report by this daily, the centre, since its establishment following the enactment of the National Book Centre Act, 1995, has been consistently failing to fulfil its mandate due to poor infrastructure, a shortage of manpower and resources, and lack of care and planning. There it goes again: the bureaucratic mechanism being an Achilles' heel in literary initiatives. Everything about the centre is thus ill-conceived and poorly executed, ranging from the shabby, largely nondescript building in which it is housed, to its lack of promotional activities, to the way it engages with the recipients of its annual grants.\nIts pathetic state is perhaps best reflected in the management of its own library, which has over 11,000 books, including many rare reference materials. However, as the librarian himself admits, there hasn't been a visitor looking for books in years! What is a library for, then? To read newspapers? To play host to BCS crazies? To collect books (and dust)? The disorganised arrangement of the books in this library, with stacks of old newspapers and rare books piled haphazardly in dark corners, would be an eyesore to any bibliophile. The authorities couldn't archive them systematically, let alone digitise them, even after 28 years of its establishment.\n\nIt was only in 2018 that the government started to observe the National Library Day, on February 5. Given how the day is observed \u2013 through issuing a circular, some discussion, maybe a procession if someone is feeling outdoorsy \u2013 you cannot help but see \"perfunctory\" written all over it.\nIn addition to the poor management of its library, the centre is also being hamstrung by various problems in its handling of non-government libraries. For one, the financial assistance given to the listed libraries is woefully insufficient. The annual allocations \u2013 divided into categories A, B, and C \u2013 barely cover a couple of months' operational costs for them, leaving them financially strained. The bureaucratic hurdles involved in accessing the funds further compound their difficulties. There are also allegations of favouritism and lack of quality control when it comes to giving them books. Often, substandard books on political and administrative issues, written by ruling party leaders and bureaucrats, dominate the offerings, while books of diverse genres and perspectives are ignored. We have seen the same thing happening in August 2022 when a book reading programme for government officials included over a hundred books written by 25 high officials. Why select books that no one in the four hemispheres would want to read?\nAll this is quite hard to accept because the National Book Centre could be a vital player in building a strong library culture in the country, as is its mandate. Private libraries, built through voluntary initiatives all over the country, give us hope amid the deteriorating state of most public libraries. They have challenges of their own, of course, especially in terms of finances, quality of services and book collection. In this digital era, they also suffer from the prevailing apathy towards books. But their very existence is a defiant counterpoint to this situation. And with proper assistance and guidance, they could be moulded into genuine drivers of change in local communities.\nAlthough any private initiative must ultimately depend on its own strength for survival, government oversight, and grants, if properly distributed and followed up on, can help in a big way. Such assistance must be provided with a genuine interest in promoting a culture of reading and intellectual engagement among people, especially the younger generation. This interest is precisely what is lacking now. It was only in 2018 that the government started to observe the National Library Day, on February 5. Given how the day is observed \u2013 through issuing a circular, some discussion, maybe a procession if someone is feeling outdoorsy \u2013 you cannot help but see \"perfunctory\" written all over it. It almost seems as if bureaucrats merely wanted to tick a box. It makes them look good, and feel useful, except it is of no use in a practical sense. No change to our troubled interaction with books was sought, none achieved.\u00a0\nWhy should we read? Because books \u2013 the right kind of books \u2013 can educate, inspire, and transform. It is not for nothing that the pen is believed to be mightier than the sword. But don't expect much when bureaucrats wield their pens to shape the destiny of literary initiatives. Their ability to complicate the simplest of decisions, their blunders and misplaced priorities, and their interest in preserving the prevailing politico-administrative status quo can derail even the noblest of efforts. A reader-friendly environment that helps to think and critically engage is not in their best interest.\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n",

The report, placed at the parliament recently, revealed how this procurement agency had been involved in various malpractices.\nDuring this five-year period, the CMSD supplied medical equipment to medical colleges and hospitals which remained largely unused. In many cases, it supplied the machinery without following proper protocols. Among the institutions audited, three \u2013 Khulna Medical College Hospital, Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, and Rangpur Medical College Hospital \u2013 alleged that the CMSD supplied those products unduly and without their consent, while other auditees said that the machinery in question would be installed soon. Moreover, in FY2016-17, different government institutions acquired medical and surgical supplies from CMSD at prices that were up to 18 times more than that offered by the Public Health Institute and the Essential Drug Company for similar products, which is outrageous.\nThe question is, can the CMSD just supply machinery without consent or request by the hospitals? Also, why would government institutions take supplies from it if they do not need them, and also at inflated prices? Clearly, the CMSD has been conducting these illegal activities with help from inside the hospitals, which must be looked into.\nOur health sector has been riddled with corruption for long. The CAG audit report has just exposed it once again. Irregularities in medical equipment purchase are, however, just one aspect of the problem, with corruption permeating every level of the health sector, as the High Court has recently observed. We urge the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the irregularities done by the CMSD in connivance with public hospitals, and identify those responsible for such a waste of public money.\n",
