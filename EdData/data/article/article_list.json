        "full_article": "We are delighted that Jhumon Das finally walked out of prison on Tuesday, after being incarcerated for nearly seven months for a Facebook post in which he criticised Hefazat-e-Islam leader Mamunul Haque. Ironically, Mamunul is himself now in detention and has nearly 27 cases against him, including those for instigating violence, terrorism, torching vehicles, vandalising shops, etc. So why was a citizen of Bangladesh who criticised a person, against whom the state has lodged more than two dozen cases, sent to jail in the first place, and why would his bail take six months to materialise\u2014and that, too, necessitating his coming to the High Court for it?\nHere is a brief account of events that led to Jhumon's months in jail. On March 15, Hefazat organised a rally in Derai upazila of Sunamganj. The following day, Jhumon posted a status on Facebook criticising the Hefazat leader, whose supporters later demanded his arrest, threatening to attack his village\u2014inhabited by a Hindu community\u2014 otherwise. The local UP chairman obliged the protesters and handed Jhumon over to the police.\nStill, Jhumon's village was attacked on March 17 and several houses were looted and four temples damaged. On March 20, one UP member from Sarmangal union was arrested along with 18 others.\nThe prime accused in the case over vandalising and damaging temples was released on bail after two months, on June 21. Eighteen other arrestees were also granted bail at different times. Jhumon, whose wife and community suffered the violence and terror on March 17, was kept in jail till September 28, making for almost seven months in detention.\nWhile he was first charged under Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), at some stage during his detention he was also charged under the notorious Digital Security Act (DSA), the majority provisions of which are non-bailable, greatly complicating Jhumon's chance of getting bail. He was refused bail six to seven times before it was finally granted.\nWhen Jhumon was first arrested, it was said that he had been taken into police custody for his own safety and to protect his fellow villagers from attack by Hefazat activists. But his village was attacked, his wife faced assault, several homes including his own were vandalised, four of their temples were damaged. And yet, it was he who spent more than six months in jail, while his tormentors\u2014who actually committed criminal offenses\u2014were freed in two months, and are now roaming around posing further threat to Jhumon, his family, and his community. All this for criticising someone that the government itself has filed 27 cases against.\nIndividual freedom appears to account for so little in our system. More than six months of Jhumon's life has been lost forever for a \"crime\" he does not know about, and for a \"guilt\" that has not been established. Ultimately, he may be found not guilty. So, who will account for the loss of this period of his life, not to mention the cost, the hassle and the stigma of carrying on with this case, which may go on indefinitely? Cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore was in jail for 10 months, and his bail was rejected six times before he was granted bail. Photojournalist Shafiqul Islam Kajol also came out 10 months after his arrest, while his bail petition was rejected 13 times. Sirajum Munira, a highly respected teacher of Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, was arrested late at night from her home for an innocuous Facebook post, and got her bail after two months. She also lost her job.\nPolice have the unlimited power to arrest and detain a citizen, at least for the first 24 hours. During this period, how the police will treat him or her is anybody's guess. As cases of custodial deaths and torture have shown time and again, there is literally no guarantee of life, and certainly no certainty of personal safety while in custody. The Bangladesh Penal Code, Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, Explosive Substances Act, Arms Act, Narcotics Control Act, Human Trafficking Act, Special Powers Act, and the infamous DSA all give the police enormous power to arrest. Getting bail under all the laws above is difficult, complex and involves quite a lengthy process. Most of the punitive clauses under the DSA are non-bailable, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone to get bail once arrested under it.\nOnce Section 54 of the CrPC was known for its widespread abuse. This prompted the High Court to give clear directives on using this provision in order to reduce its misuse, including disallowing arrest by plain-clothed law enforcers\u2014which emerged as a tremendous source of fear when people used to be picked up at the dead of the night, without warrant and without specifying the reasons as to why they were being picked up. These plain-clothed law enforcers would refuse even to identify which agencies they belonged to. Insistence on knowing would lead to threats of bad consequences later. The High Court directives greatly reduced the use of this provision. Of course, in cases of enforced disappearances, these High Court directives hardly seem to matter as the victims are unable to register their complaint.\nThe third paragraph of the preamble to our constitution says, \"Further pledging that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process \u2026 a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.\" Part III of our constitution is titled \"Fundamental Rights\" and has many articles\u201426 to 47A\u2014covering a whole range of freedoms, starting from equality before law and right, to protection of law, right to life and personal liberty, right to freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of religion, freedom of thought and conscience and speech, and many others.\nThere is Article 32 that says, \"No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law,\" and Article 33 that deals with safeguards against unlawful arrest and detention. The later article, in Paragraph 1, elaborates that every person arrested must be informed as to the grounds for his arrest and be allowed to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice; in Paragraph 2, it states that every person detained in custody shall be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest, and that no person shall be detained in custody beyond that period without the authority of a magistrate.\nWith such clear guarantees for individual liberty, why is it that the citizens of Bangladesh have to suffer an unspecified amount of time in prison while their bail processes take place? With all these \"rights\" enshrined in our constitution, why are personal liberties such a plaything in the hands of our rulers, law enforcement agencies, and at the lowest practical level, in the hands of our police? The answer lies in some of the laws, but more so in their implementation. Like so many things in Bangladesh, what is written in the books is not what is practised on the ground.\nOver the years, the sanctity of personal liberty, the place of individual freedom, the centrality of fundamental right to life and liberty, and the right to freedom of conscience, thought and speech have greatly corroded in Bangladesh. We are not even aware of our rights given in our own constitution, and not too bothered when these rights are violated. What is most tragic is that we are far less inclined to fight for them as we were before, leading to an overall sense of pessimism about our state of democracy.\nEvery time a person's liberty is denied, our constitution is violated. We seem to have forgotten that laws exist to strengthen the hands of the citizens, and not that of the government. Today, we have too many bad laws in our books, whose main purpose is to curtail freedoms. And with their arbitrary implementation, all our freedoms stand significantly compromised.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam is editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Imagine it is the year 2050. In Asia Pacific, one in four people will be over the age of 60 years\u2014three times the number of older people in 2010. With close to 1.3 billion senior citizens in less than 30 years from now, are countries in the region prepared to fully address the needs of their older populations, so that they age with dignity?\nLet's rewind.\nToday, 72-year-old Ping sells three kilograms of sticky rice every day at her remote village in a Southeast Asian country, earning barely enough for a basic living. She's been doing this for more than 10 years, ever since her husband passed away. Her son died two months ago, and her two daughters have married and moved to another province. Ping gets some consolation from the health insurance she is entitled to, as maintaining good health in her old age is her main concern.\nBack in the day, Ping and other women in numerous countries across the Asia Pacific region might have been supported by their families and communities. But times are changing. Migration and urbanisation have shifted traditional support systems for the elderly, and more and more governments are grappling with increasing healthcare costs and a shrinking workforce. While less than a third of older persons in the region currently receive a pension of some sort, pension payments are increasing as the older populations grow, straining the governments further.\nAs the world observes the International Day of Older Persons today, there is an urgent need for policy reform in addressing population ageing now more than ever. This must be driven by a shift in mindset to convert the challenges into a demographic opportunity.\nPopulation ageing is not a threat, but an opportunity\nWe must rethink population ageing, celebrating it as the triumph of development that it truly is. More and more people are living longer due to the result of successive advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and economic and social well-being. Along with longer life expectancy, couples are having fewer babies. This is due to a variety of reasons, such as the challenges couples face in striking a work-life balance, and not being able to afford having more children. However, low fertility and longer life expectancy are not the problem. The real problem is not being ready to face this rapidly changing demographic shift.\nThis is why governments must act now. Policymakers must work together with academics and civil society to incorporate rights-based ageing policies and systems into national development plans. While some countries in Asia Pacific have already taken such steps, implementation must be strengthened, particularly within the contexts of Covid-19 and the escalating humanitarian crises that increase vulnerabilities of older people.\nAdapting a life-cycle approach with gender equality in focus\nIn Asia Pacific, with more than half of the older population being women, it is crucial to adopt a life-cycle approach to population ageing, grounded in gender equality and human rights.\nLife-long gender discrimination leaves women even more disadvantaged in an ageing society. Older women are often more financially dependent than older men due to generally lower education levels and unpaid work, having often carried the burden of being the family caregiver. Investing in each stage of life, starting from before a girl is born, determines the path of her life course. When a woman is able to safely deliver her baby, this in turn improves the long-term health of both mother and child. When a girl has access to quality education, including comprehensive sex education, it helps her make informed decisions about life-changing matters as she transitions from childhood to adolescence, and on to adulthood.\nWhen a woman has equal opportunity to contribute to the workforce and has bodily autonomy, she has the power to shape her own future. The decisions she makes, and is allowed to make, at every stage of her life paves the way towards a healthier and more financially secure silver age.\nThere is little time to lose\nWe need to take action now. The megatrend of rapid demographic shifts is altering Asia Pacific as well as the entire world. This is why the years 2021-2030 have been declared the UN Decade for Healthy Ageing, complementing the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA), the 20th anniversary of which is next year, and will bring together governments in Asia Pacific and the world to review the progress made and make better plans for the challenges ahead.\nWhile there is no single comprehensive policy that can address population ageing, we must invest in forward-thinking, rights-based and gender-sensitive policies that focus on the needs of people at every stage of their lives. In doing so, countries in the Asia Pacific region can aspire to and achieve a better future for all, where no one is left behind.\n\u00a0\nBj\u00f6rn Andersson is Asia Pacific regional director at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\n",

        "full_article": "Weighed down under the stacks of reports about crowding at vaccination centres, shortage of vaccine doses, and the rocky mass vaccination drives, is the story of how a section of Bangladeshi population is suffering from bias and a lack of access to the jabs, leaving them unprotected against the coronavirus. If this discrimination is not dealt with quickly, then not only will this community continue to suffer, but it will be seen as a grave medical and moral failure of the country as well.\nThe official figure for Bangladesh's third gender population, commonly referred to as hijra, is a perfectly\u2014and suspiciously\u2014rounded 10,000, according to a 2013 survey by the Ministry of Social Welfare. However, the real number has not only increased in the decade or so since then, but can also be assumed to be inaccurate, according to organisations working on the rights of the community.\nWhile Article 28 of Bangladesh Constitution dictates that there can be no discrimination against any citizen based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth, it was not until late 2014 that the government officially recognised the transgender community as the \"third gender.\" Those who had already registered for their national ID (NID) cards before that time had to do so using the name and gender specified on their birth certificate. Now that the NID is still the only document using which the general populace can register for the Covid-19 vaccine, third gender people are being subjected to even more discrimination and trauma on the basis of their gender identity.\nThe story of Tanisha Yasmin Chaity, as reported by this daily last month, is the epitome of what the transgender people fear they will have to face at vaccination centres. A young transwoman and a development worker based in Cox's Bazar, Chaity's experience tells us all we need to know about how unfair this country's treatment of this community still is. As she stood in the female queue at the vaccination centre, Chaity was anxious about being subjected to harassment at the inoculation booth itself, while those in line were uncomfortable due to their ingrained bigotry. And she was not wrong about being harassed: when the man at the desk called her by her registered birth name, Mamun Mollah, and she appeared, he seemed to be unaware of the term \"transwoman.\" Chaity argued with him, trying to justify why she should be able to get her vaccine too. This, unfortunately, only attracted taunting from others in the queue. When she was eventually able to convince the clerk to let her go to the inoculation booth for females, the same type of ignorance was displayed by the staff there, causing Chaity further humiliation.\nAs appalling as it sounds, the bias of regular people against those belonging outside the gender binary of male and female is somewhat understandable (for lack of a better word). After all, discrimination against transgender people is the norm of our culture, and they are essentially deprived of any decent treatment in everyday life. Most people don't know any better, and don't feel the need to peek outside of their bigoted cocoon either. But what excuse can healthcare workers of the state show for not even being aware of transgenderism, and consequently making an already cumbersome procedure even more difficult for people like Chaity? Given that those running the vaccination centres are representatives of the government, are they not also obliged to abide by Article 28 and equally accommodate all citizens of the country who want to be vaccinated?\nWhile Chaity did finally get her first dose, stories such as hers wherein people of this community managed to get vaccinated\u2014albeit with difficulty\u2014are few and far between. But since they don't attract much news coverage and the government is not very forthcoming about their plight, we don't know if remedial measures are being taken. We don't have updated figures of their rate of vaccination either. Most do not have the minimum digital literacy required to complete the registration process through the government's Surokkha platform. Many of them, because of this and the humiliation and harassment that come with trying to obtain this vital service, have likely felt discouraged to go for the vaccine themselves. As a result, one can assume, tens of thousands of members of this community\u2014a population whose choice of livelihood often requires them to be outdoors and in contact with many people daily\u2014are forced to remain unvaccinated.\nThere are a number of loopholes in place that can actively prevent the transgender people from getting vaccinated or even tested for Covid. For one, the daily vaccination update prepared by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) only provides an update of the number of men and women inoculated, with no room for counting the transgender population. This sort of discrimination and micro-biases may seem insignificant, but they play a vital role in making the systematic discrimination faced by them socially acceptable.\nThere seems to be a lot of backward and forward steps in terms of stopping transphobia from being the norm. The year 2020 saw the establishment of Dawatul Quran Third Gender Madrasa, in the Kamrangirchar area of Dhaka\u2014the first known school in Bangladesh dedicated to transgender students. However, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has yet to conduct the long-overdue sixth national census of the country, which was supposed to include people of the third gender community beside the male and female population of the country. Furthermore, the anti-discrimination law, which could have provided some legal protection to this community, has remained in a draft form for seven years now.\nIt is important to reiterate that hijras were granted legal recognition in this country almost a decade ago. Though they were incorrectly recognised as \"inborn sexually disabled people\" (exploring the layers of apathy concealed in the adoption of this definition alone will require another article), it was still a historic first step in the right direction. But official recognition alone can do little to counter transphobia if people in general are not educated to respect others regardless of their sexual identity, and if the state itself remains complicit in the practice of such discrimination.\nGiven how difficult it already is to acquire enough vaccine doses to vaccinate the entire population, the government must take every measure to make the inoculation process as inclusive and hassle-free as possible for all citizens. As well as allowing passports and birth certificates to be used for registration, besides the NIDs, the government must make an active effort to sensitise healthcare workers to the inclusion of all citizens and their right to proper treatment. If the stigma against third gender people is allowed to fester at vaccination centres, we may never reach our goal of ensuring universal access to healthcare services to all. Whatever happened to \"No one is safe until we are all safe\"?\nCertainly, non-profit, non-governmental, and rights organisations must keep doing their part in destigmatising transgenderism in social and medical spheres. But it is ultimately the government's responsibility to lead the change in eradicating transgender bias, through awareness campaigns and affirmative actions, and to help the transgender community be accepted as part of the wider society.\n\u00a0\nAfia Jahin is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Kamla Bhasin, a celebrated feminist, activist and social scientist, was born in 1946, in a village at Punjab in what is now Pakistan. She worked for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) from 1976 till she retired in 2002. Since the 70s, she had been an important voice not only for the women's movement in India, but other South Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal as well. She founded the feminist network Sangat in 2002. Her tools to raise awareness against patriarchy and violence against women, including rape and dowry death, often involved interactive methods such as plays, story-telling, music and art. According to the Indian Express, at Kamla Bhasin's funeral on September 25, everyone stood silently as her sister performed the last rites. Afterwards, a young woman began a \"conversation\" with her, addressing her as if she were alive. Words turned into a song, and soon the whole gathering of feminist activists\u2014people from diverse backgrounds and those whose lives Kamla had touched\u2014began singing along. Even in death, she showed us how to unite.\nKamla was actively involved in JAGORI, a women's training and resource centre in New Delhi, India, as well as One Billion Rising, the movement started by American playwright-activist Eve Ensler to end sexual violence against women, which spread out across the world\u2014including Bangladesh. She touched the lives of thousands of women through her trainings and workshops on understanding patriarchy and feminism. A few basic concepts that she taught\u2014which show her deep understanding of the feminist movement, but also cover issues affecting the world on a larger scale\u2014are as follows:\nBig words, but what do they really mean?\nWe need to ask about the basic definitions of patriarchy, masculinity, gender, and feminism. These words are often misunderstood\u2014oftentimes, even by the most privileged sections of our society. One of the terms that Kamla stated was toxic masculinity, and she used to speak about how it affects not just women, but men as well. In Bangladesh, men are taught to be tough and feel superior; they are expected to have all the answers, to be solution-driven, to earn more, to provide more. These predestined roles are burdens on men. As products of this toxic culture, most men, as heads of their households, do not allow their wives or daughters to work outside, which only adds to their burden.\nIt is the same with the word \"gender\"; gender roles are defined by society. As such, if men and women in our society could understand that, other than giving birth and breast-feeding their children, men could be equal participants in child-rearing, then life would be much easier for both parents. It is society that teaches men that childcare is a woman's job, and to this day it is the norm for women to take the sole responsibility of taking care of the children and elderly members in their families. This doubles the pressure on women who work: they have to meet their responsibilities at their workplaces, and then fulfil their role of caregiver at home as well\u2014something that remains unappreciated in most cases. If the concept of equal participation is introduced as part of education at schools, boys and girls will learn that household work and care-giving can be done by both.\nWe have normalised injustice\nKamla highlighted that injustice in society had grown so much because we tolerated it. There are plenty of examples around us: let's take the ongoing vaccine shortages in less developed countries like Bangladesh, for instance, where there are people who haven't been able to get even the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, whereas in the developed nations, a variety of vaccine choices are available, and they have stocked up the surplus. The Covid-19 crisis has shown how the informal economy workers have fallen further into poverty with reduced wages, unemployment, and the lack of wider social protection from the government. We have become used to a world that is unjust based on gender, race, class, and creed. In order to tackle this, we first need to acknowledge this flaw, and work towards making our country a just place by challenging the unjust system.\nFeminism is about equal rights, not taking men's rights away\nFeminism is a belief system that says women and men have equal rights. Giving equal rights to women as men doesn't mean that men lose their existing rights. Both men and women can be feminists, just as both men and women can be patriarchal. Feminism, in Kamla's opinion, has to be a powerful yet patient movement, and cannot be won without continuous dialogue. Patriarchy is so ingrained in us that we often don't realise when we practise it\u2014how it invades our thoughts and actions. However, feminist movements evolve with time. Fifty years ago, the fight to ensure that girls go to school was\u00a0 a feminist movement; today, demanding that women be able to be in the streets without the fear of sexual harassment is a timely feminist movement. It also varies from place to place, from class to class. Looking at the world through a woman's eyes is essential, because till now the world has been seen and explained from men's perspectives, and that only reveals half of reality.\nPersonally, I came to know Kamla Di through a workshop. Brac once organised a training workshop with her, and I had the good fortune to be a part of it. It was in early 2020. We were travelling together towards Rajendrapur one evening, but due to heavy traffic, we were stuck on the road for almost six hours. This is when I got to know Kamla Di\u2014the person behind the feminist trailblazer that she was regarded as. Apart from her lucid style of communicating her thoughts and ideologies, she was witty, warm, and very loving. There were three of us in our car, so she asked us to sing while we waited in traffic. She sang her songs of freedom and movement. Her songs were about the struggles of women and the hope for a new world, which I found quite captivating. At the end of the training, she took a selfie with each of us. I still remember her powerful presence and her warm hug\u2014the memories of which I will always carry with me.\n\u00a0\nTasmiah T Rahman is head of Brac's Skills Development Programme.\n",

        "full_article": "It has long been alleged that corruption and irregularities have become commonplace in our education sector. The media and other watchdog bodies have regularly covered specific instances of such depravity. But every time such reports come out, the government tends to hunker back into its denial mode. However, a recent bombshell study by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has once again brought to light just how morally bankrupt our education sector has become.\nThe study discovered that the secondary education sector is mired in different corrupt practices, including illegal financial transactions for the appointment of head teachers and officials in other positions. Aspiring head teachers or assistant head teachers had to pay between Tk 3.5 lakh and Tk 15 lakh to get employed in schools. Transfer of teachers, their inclusion to the Monthly Pay Order (MPO) scheme, schools' academic approval, school inspections, etc also involved plenty of instances of corruption, according to the study.\nDespite there being an online process for non-government teachers to apply for MPO benefits, the study found that they still had to pay money at four stages. This is just one example of how ingrained corruption has become in the sector. Another example of this lies in the fact that many government schoolteachers and upazila education officers have been working at the same place for more than 10 years, despite there being a provision that allows an officer to stay at the same station for a maximum of three years. And while all this is going on, there is a serious lack of manpower when it comes to supervisors of secondary schools at field-level offices, adding to the lack of good governance, transparency, and accountability in the sector that we see. How can we expect anything good for our nation to happen when our education sector has become so rotten to the core?\nWhen teachers, who are expected to instil values into our children, are involved in such systemic corruption, what values will our children learn from them? What ideals will our society embrace? These are questions that we all must ask, because so far, the authorities have shown a woeful apathetical tendency to such corruption, and have too often turned a blind eye. This environment of apathy and inaction has only emboldened the offenders.\nInstead of denying the allegations made in the study\u2014which the government has a habit of doing in the face of unflattering revelations\u2014it should launch an investigation into the matter and seriously start cracking down on corruption in this sector, as well as in others. Moreover, the government should listen to the recommendations made by the TIB, educationists and other experts, and try to plug the holes that are allowing corrupt individuals to take over and pollute the entire education sector.\n",

        "full_article": "The stories of corruption at the land offices are, unfortunately, many. Just on Wednesday, the state minister for rural development and cooperatives, Swapan Bhattacharjee, revealed in a public meeting in Jashore how he could not get a piece of land registered because he had not paid a bribe to the local sub-registrar's office. Being a public official\u2014he said in a video clip that has since gone viral\u2014he had kept the story to himself for a week due to his embarrassment at the state of the land office's services.\nShockingly, though, he is not the first high-level government official to come out as a victim of misdeeds in the land offices. Earlier in June, two employees of Kushtia Sub-Registrar's Office demanded a bribe of Tk 30,000 from Deputy Attorney General (DAG) BM Abdur Rafel for preparing the deeds of his family land. Even after learning of his identity, the employees had the gall to offer him a concession of Tk 5,000 instead of withdrawing their corrupt offer. The DAG's brother had to pay Tk 10,000 to get the job done anyway, while one of the two land office employees was later suspended.\nIf this is the state of professionalism (or lack thereof) displayed by land office employees towards government officials, one can only wonder at the extent of their corruption when it comes to ordinary citizens. In fact, the arrests by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Chakaria sub-registrar and another employee of the office in Cox's Bazar in April with Tk 642,100 of bribe money give us an inkling of just how much money these people are able to extort from the people, and how corruption goes on unabated in an environment of inaction\u2014and even complicity\u2014by those responsible.\nA report by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has found that people are made to pay bribes from Tk 500 to Tk 5 lakh at every step of the process of getting land-related services. One solution to this is to create a way for land disputes to be handled officially, and not informally through local arbitrators or land officers. The digitisation drive should also be expedited to make access to land services easier, and remove the scope for mid-level interventions. But most importantly, the government needs to make it a priority to take proper administrative and legal actions against corrupt employees at the land offices. These measures are long overdue, and can help create a culture of accountability and transparency at the land offices, so that people have hassle-free services.\n",
