        "full_article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s recent observations at a conclave of State Home Ministers contained a possibly unintended explanation for why academicians, students and lawyers are languishing in prison on terrorism charges. He called for the elimination of all forms of Naxalism, be it of the gun-wielding variety or the kind that uses the pen \u201cto raise international support\u201d and \u201cto mislead the youth\u201d. The remarks came alongside his emphasis on how the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act had given an impetus to combating terrorism. In effect, he has conveyed a disconcerting message that the police would treat armed militants and intellectuals alike, if the Government suspects a concordance in their outlook. Considering that the UAPA has been frequently and even unfairly invoked in cases that appear to have no nexus with terrorism, Mr. Modi\u2019s views raise a question whether his comments are a justification of sorts for the continued incarceration of many who do not seem to have indulged in any particular extremist act. Incitement to violence, especially mobilising support for armed insurgency, is indeed a grave offence, but unless there is a proven connection between the nature of the support given and an actual act of terror or a plot to commit one, it is difficult to treat the two things as one.Recent judicial orders declining bail to activist Umar Khalid in the Delhi riots case, and Jyoti Jagtap of the Kabir Kala Manch in the Elgar Parishad case are good examples of how the police straddle the huge gulf between the nature of their participation in a protest or an event and an actual act of violence by invoking UAPA, and thus eliminating the need to have concrete evidence to show their involvement in a communal or Maoist plot. While this may highlight the potential for misuse of UAPA and the impediments to liberty found both in the law and in its judicial interpretation, it also has a distinct side-effect: the manipulation of political discourse in such a way that those who question the actions, methods and processes of the state that cause mass resentment are criminalised. It is in such a backdrop that the use of political catchwords such as \u2018Urban Naxals\u2019, a term that even Mr. Modi has used recently, should be seen. Far from being linked to any terrorist or Maoist conspiracy, the term is merely used to tarnish those with an alternative point of view. The Government arming itself with more stringent laws is only part of the solution to the threat posed by violent extremism. Looking for remedies to the underlying causes is more important than conjuring up conspiracies in the name of dismantling its support structures.",

        "full_article": "At least 140 people were killed after a suspension bridge, a tourist attraction in Gujarat\u2019s Morbi town, collapsed, sending hundreds of revellers into the Machchhu river below. At least 47 of the dead were children, making it one of India\u2019s most horrendous tragedies. Inaugurated in 1879, the bridge was renovated and opened on October 26, four days before the tragedy. This raises several concerns. A company that seems to have had no apparent expertise or track record in the field was awarded the contract. There are questions about the fitness of the bridge; in any case, it was not intended to carry more than 150 people at a time, according to reports. Hundreds were on the bridge when it snapped as there was no crowd control. People were allowed to walk into a death trap. All these point to a major failure of governance at various levels. Gujarat is among the richer States of India, but it has often faced governance challenges \u2014 its poor management of the pandemic is a case in point. Human acts of omission and commission often cause tragedies, and significantly change the impact of natural disasters. The police have arrested nine people, including two officials of the company that is now under a cloud, and the government has announced compensation to the kin of the victims. A thorough inquiry and the fixing of accountability must follow quickly. The findings should be made public as soon as possible, and the guilty must face exemplary punishment.Coming out of the long restrictions on travel necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, people all over the world appear to be binging on travel and outings. A stampede in Seoul in South Korea killed 154 people last week. In India also, record numbers of people are thronging tourism and pilgrimage spots. While tourism and travel are powerful engines of the economy, there must be more attention paid to ensure that they are safe and sustainable. Tourist and pilgrimage centres around the country should carry out safety and environmental audits to ensure that crowd management and safety protocols are in place to avoid tragedies such as this. Development of new centres where large numbers of people are expected should account for such contingencies. The rapid pace of road and infrastructure development in ecologically sensitive areas such as the Himalayas should be in accordance with topographic limitations. More must be done to regulate the flow of travellers according to the infrastructure capacity of particular destinations. Tourism promotion campaigns must include creating safety awareness among visitors and local officials.",

        "full_article": "Accountability needs to be fixed for the tragic loss of over 150 lives following the collapse of a century-old suspension bridge over the Machchhu river in Gujarat\u2019s Morbi. The local police have filed an FIR and detained people in connection with the incident. Based on what\u2019s been admitted by local municipal officials, it\u2019s apparent that there was gross administrative failure as the bridge was thrown open to pedestrians without a formal fitness clearance after being closed for months to carry out repairs.\nThe accident at Morbi is a symptom of a crisis at the heart of India\u2019s urban governance. Across the country, there are a series of fatalities because of the poor state of urban institutions that oversee governance. The problem begins with a dispute over the size of the urban population, which influences the political importance and attendant flow of resources. Way back in 2010, a World Bank agglomeration index estimated that 55% of India\u2019s population lives in areas with \u201curban-like features\u201d. The estimate far exceeds GoI\u2019s estimate as the census sets a high threshold to categorise an area urban. The reality is India increasingly lives in towns, not villages.\nThe Constitution\u2019s 74th amendment enacted three decades ago aimed to transfer urban planning from states to elected urban local governments. In practice, it hasn\u2019t quite worked that way as state governments are unwilling to let go of control over urban infrastructure, a source of patronage and payoffs. For example, the municipal corporation of the greater Bengaluru metropolitan area shares responsibilities with state government agencies headed by bureaucrats who report to the political executive. It leads to multiple chains of command, lack of accountability and corruption. This pattern gets repeated across states, which shows up in the form of urban decay. Fitness certificates in India have a dubious reputation of being vehicles of extraction.\nIndia\u2019s urban economies are its growth engines, generating huge revenues for all levels of government. Municipalities, however, are the exception. Collectively, municipal revenue remained stuck at 1% of GDP between 2007-08 and 2017-18. Municipal revenues in South Africa and Brazil are around 6% and 7% respectively. Even as accountability is fixed for the tragedy at Morbi, state governments need to begin the process of empowering elected leadership of urban local bodies. Change will come when voters demand accountability from empowered urban bodies, not state governments with conflicts of interests.\n\n",

It ruled that the violators shall be guilty of misconduct. In 2013, SC said this so-called test violates the right of rape survivors. The verdict followed the sexual assault law amendments in 2013 that recognised other forms of penetration besides penile-vaginal as rape and made a woman\u2019s sexual experience irrelevant in determining the issue of consent. Though experts have long termed it unscientific, minor girls continue to face the two-finger test, also called a virginity test.\nIn 2014, the Union health ministry issued detailed guidelines stipulating the \u201ctest\u201d shouldn\u2019t be conducted as \u201cit had no bearing on a case of sexual violence.\u201d The guidelines also barred doctors\u2019 comments on \u201cpast sexual experience or habituation to sexual intercouse\u201d. However, many states didn\u2019t implement these guidelines. Gujarat HC in 2020 and Madras HC earlier this year have castigated its continuing use.\nStates have failed in disseminating and implementing what courts have repeatedly termed unlawful.

The lower judiciary and police seemed clueless that Section 66A, IT Act was quashed in 2015 and cases continued to be prosecuted under the provision. The 2014 guidelines advocated extensive training for medical personnel in dealing with rape survivors and a uniform method of examination through the SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence) kit.

No one wants a repeat of the pre-2014 political violence or the pre-2018 ennui and despair. Nor will the mere appearance of an election, minus a healthy competition, be convincing for the people after two highly controversial national elections. The sooner the political establishment, especially the ruling party, understands that, the better.\nSpeaking of a healthy competition, it is not just on election day that it will be expected but also, equally importantly, on the campaign trail leading up to that day \u2013 something that the Election Commission must remember. That includes equal opportunity to organise political activities without any hindrance, official or unofficial, and equal participation in decisions related to the election. We must admit that the rallies recently organised by BNP have gone reasonably well, albeit with no shortage of impediments put in its way by entities loyal to Awami League. It has ushered in a long-forgotten period of street mobilisation by the opposition.\nHowever, ahead of BNP's planned rally in Barisal on November 5, there were concerns that it might be denied permission to hold the rally in its preferred venue. The problem, apparently, was its failure to correctly name the venue in its letter to the deputy commissioner. What's in a name, you ask? But tension was allowed to linger for a while \u2013 and a senior AL leader even wryly suggested the possibility of application rejection \u2013 before permission was eventually granted. This attempt to latch onto a technicality could be interpreted as a desperate response to the massive showing in BNP's previous rallies.\nIt is perhaps no surprise then that what started as protests against hikes in prices of essentials and political repression would boil down to a contest of \"street power\", with Awami League holding/planning counter-rallies to flex its organisational muscle. An equally worrying fallout is BNP's hint, at its Rangpur rally, that its lawmakers are ready to resign from parliament \"anytime soon\".\nBNP has only seven members in parliament \u2013 a symbolic presence, really, but one that gives it the opportunity to make its concerns known officially. But if it indeed goes ahead with this decision, we fail to see how it will benefit the party or the constituents of vacated seats, which will be duly filled. It will create no crisis in parliament, and no palpable pressure on the government. BNP will be wise not to pursue this course of action and turn its back on its voters. Its decision not to participate in any election under the present government is a political one, and must be pursued through political means.\nWhile the recent vigorous opposition activities are a pleasant break from years of political hibernation, we must not lose sight of the bigger objectives: 1) restoring public trust in the electoral process through creating an ideal environment for election, with a level playing field ensured for all; 2) finding a solution to the lack of confidence over election-time government, and 3) enabling the EC to hold a fair election without any interference from the ruling establishment. The government and the EC must show their commitment to these overarching goals.\n",

        "full_article": "If we had to pick only one example of how money speaks louder than the law of the land, many would probably pick the practice of hill cutting in Bangladesh. As per the Environment Conservation (Amendment) Act 2010, hill cutting is a cognisable offence, and no government, semi-government or autonomous organisation is allowed to cut or raze hills without permission from the authorities concerned. And yet, hills across the country keep being axed down while state officials and law enforcers, in cahoots with the criminals, turn a blind eye.\nAs a report by this newspaper has revealed, influential individuals are cutting down hills in various areas of Moulvibazar's Barlekha upazila, and neither raids nor fines by the relevant authorities seem to be able to stop them. As such, claims by the Department of Environment (DoE) that they have \"zero tolerance towards hill cutting\" have, in fact, zero ground to stand on.\nThe soil that is excavated from hills is trucked away and sold for use by brick kilns or real estate developers. It is often used for road construction purposes or to fill up low-lying lands. But are these developmental activities really worth the environmental and human costs incurred by the rampant cutting of hills? As experts have stated, such indiscriminate hill cutting is one of the biggest culprits responsible for landslides in hilly areas, thus putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of people living there. At any given time, any of these violated hills could fall on top of homes situated near them.\nAs locals have told this daily, influentials still continue to cut hills. Police or land office officials reportedly \"meet\" them sometimes, but leave with money. Culprits often receive news of planned raids beforehand and halt any hill-cutting activity, but continue as soon as the threat passes. As per our report, despite there being ample information on who are behind such illegal operations, when confronted for answers, these owners of hills or contractors or police sub-inspectors get away by shifting the blame onto one another. Some local government officials are also aware of the sheer illegality and corruption involved in hill cutting, but seldom come forward to speak against the culprits.\nWe agree with the residents of these hilly areas that the local administration must be stricter in dealing with influentials who are cutting down hills. And the local political leadership must support any attempt at saving hills. This is important both for the sake of the environment and the safety of those whose lives and livelihoods depend on hills. The need for \"development\" is not a sufficient excuse for mindlessly cutting down hills. The DoE and the government must do better to protect the country's environment and protect people's lives from an impending climate disaster.\n",

        "full_article": "Very recently, the Labour Rules, 2015 has been amended, introducing as many as 101 changes. The 2015 Rules are meant to supplement the Labour Act, 2006, which authorises the government to formulate rules in order to enable better implementation of the Act. By adopting the Rules, the relevant ministry mostly set out detailed procedural provisions to facilitate implementation of the substantive provisions of the parent Act, and as such, Rules cannot override any provisions or curtail any substantive right given in the Act. However, right after the amendment to the Labour Rules was published in an official gazette, several workers' rights groups and activists expressed dissatisfaction over a number of new inclusions. In particular, the changes brought to the provisions related to maternity benefits deserve careful scrutiny as they have potentially curtailed the substantive rights given in the Labour Act.\nOver the past decades, poor implementation of provisions related to maternity benefits in the Labour Act has been emphasised in several forums. A number of studies highlighted complaints such as non-payment of maternity benefits, threat of dismissal, forced resignation on condition of joining again after giving birth, etc against expectant workers. Lack of breastfeeding breaks, nursing facilities and antenatal medical care at workplaces has also been highlighted in several reports in the past. It was naturally expected that the new amendment would perhaps address these concerns in the Rules, so that the maternity benefits prescribed under the Act could be more effectively enforced. The amendment did, in fact, introduce a positive provision by allowing four weeks' leave in the event of miscarriage. However, to the surprise of many, the amendment has introduced a new method of calculating maternity benefits, which in practice has the potential of effectively reducing the amount that the workers were otherwise entitled to under the Labour Act.\nUnder Section 48 of the Labour Act, to determine the amount of maternity benefit, the daily average wage has to be calculated by dividing the total wages earned by a worker during the preceding three months from the date on which she gives notice of pregnancy, by the number of actual days of work during that period. As such, all days of leave that a worker was entitled to get in the three-month period under the Act would be excluded from the actual days of work, while the wages paid for those days of leave would be added to the total wage count. In addition, payment for overtime in the past three months would also be added to the total wages of the previous three months. The new Rules, however, provide that wages of only the month immediately preceding the maternity leave would be taken into account and that, too, would have to be divided by 26 days \u2013 not the actual days of work \u2013 to determine the average daily wage.\nAs such, under the new Rules, on the one hand, in calculating the average daily wage, the days of paid leave are not counted as the total days of work are fixed at 26. Additionally, in the month immediately preceding the leave, chances of working overtime is also less as the worker is in her last trimester. Thus, applying the new method, the average daily wage would be naturally much less than what it would be previously.\nUnder the Act, workers on maternity leave are entitled to get maternity benefits for a period of eight weeks preceding the expected day of her delivery, and eight weeks immediately following the day of her delivery. The Act further provides that an employer shall not knowingly employ a woman during the eight weeks immediately following the day of her delivery. The new Rules, however, added another provision stating that if any worker on maternity leave delivers her child later than the specified date in the preceding eight weeks, those additional days would be adjusted with the following eight weeks of the maternity leave. The provision does not clearly state the purpose or method of such adjustments, and this ambiguity may create scope for the employers to reduce the mandatory two-month post-delivery maternity leave in breach of the clear provision in the Act.\nSome prominent workers' leaders expressed that the workers were not aware of such changes before they were published in the official gazette, and that the workers' written demands of specific changes to be brought into the Rules were also mostly ignored. Lack of unbiased and inclusive procedures in forming the drafting committees for amending the laws was also pointed out by a number of worker associations' representatives. What is particularly odd is the absence of female representation in the amendment of Rules, especially when such important decisions have serious impacts on female workers' participation. A larger level consultation beyond the drafting committees is also warranted when such significant changes are proposed.\nIt is crucial that the laws and policy frameworks are sensitive towards the rights of maternity protection, and there is effective implementation of the laws. It is essential that this new amendment is reviewed, taking into account the voices of the workers, to ensure a congenial work environment for women so that they do not have to quit employment for child-bearing. Instead of stepping backwards, we need to explore avenues where the existing challenges in ensuring maternity protection can be more effectively addressed, implemented and monitored.\nTaslima Yasmin\u00a0is associate professor at the Department of Law of Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In October 2021, when Covid-19 was still claiming lives, Rishi Sunak, member of parliament (MP) in the UK parliament, refrained from joining any Diwali parties, but lit up his official residence at 11 Downing Street in London beautifully. No one was caught by surprise as the chancellor of the exchequer always took pride in being a British-Indian. A year later, amid the festival of lights, he has been elected for the country's top job. Again, no one is surprised, as he is the obvious choice \u2013 so obvious that the Tories even avoided a vote. The New York Times observes, \"It was a head-spinning reversal of fortune for Mr Sunak, whose abrupt resignation from Mr Johnson's cabinet last July set in motion Mr Johnson's downfall and pitched Britain into upheaval, culminating in Ms Truss's brief, calamitous stint.\"\nThat Rishi Sunak's ascension to Britain's highest political office brings along a bunch of \"firsts\" is public knowledge \u2013 including him being the first former Goldman Sachs employee and first hedge fund manager. Who can set so many records in one go? (S)he must be someone extraordinaire!\nAmong other accomplishments, including being richer than the royals, Rishi's signature trait would be prudence \u2013 financial and beyond.\nCritics often label him as a jetsetter, having little or no first-hand knowledge of the lives of the masses. This, however, will not be a problem if he can bring changes to their lives in the coming weeks and months. What may rather continue to haunt him is the widespread scepticism about his wealth. Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, together have an estimated fortune of about 730 million pounds.\nThe biggest chunk of their annual income comes from Akshata's shareholding in her father's tech giant Infosys. She now pays tax as per the law of the land, but has been doing so only after being exposed as a \"non-domicile\" tax return filer. The couples' explanation on the status could not bury the tax scandal.\nAlso, why a chancellor of a national exchequer would apply for/hold a US green card ignited debate within the party. His spokesperson's statement that he returned the permit in 2021 could not settle the issue for good.\nBoris Johnson loyalists count Rishi as the former's political assassin. They have endorsed Rishi for now. But will they be persistent if things go south?\nRishi's first two days in office has set the tone for the next two years (UK's general election is scheduled for January 2025). He has carefully crafted a cabinet to combat the current crisis, retained Jeremy Hunt, who served Liz Truss, but reversed the policies of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. He brought back Suella Braverman, home secretary, who resigned earlier only for a procedural error. He even kept Nadim Zahawi who succeeded Sunak on July 5 as the new finance secretary, as a minister without portfolio. Penny Mordaunt continues as the leader of the House of Commons. She made it to the final three candidates for the prime minister eight weeks ago, and in the latest run, she withdrew after it became clear that she fell short of gathering the support of 100 Conservative lawmakers.\nThere are four more acts of prudence that has drawn worldwide attention. Rishi's seven-minute speech from the steps of 10 Downing Street was a humble yet bold beginning. The speech was an example of how one can be critical of a predecessor, yet pay tribute to them, how one can shed light on the past turbulence, yet focus on the future, and how one can put the economic woes wide in the open, yet make no fuss about them. The best was perhaps this part, \"The mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual. It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us. And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto. I will deliver on its promise.\"\nHis first two international calls went to US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nHe stalled the medium-term fiscal statement and set November 17 as the day to lay out new government's earning and spending plans.\nIn the face of a heated debate in parliament and opposition leader Keir Starmer's claim for a mid-term election, this whizz kid played to the gallery well \u2013 so well that no one would take him as a newcomer, let alone novice.\nMax Colchester and Paul Hannon of the Wall Street Journal wrote on October 25, \"Mr Sunak will likely face a winter of discontent as inflation, fuelled by rising energy costs from the war in Ukraine, increases faster than wages, and a possible recession takes hold that economists think could last a year.\"\nWe must wait till November 17 to see how Rishi formalises his plans to prevent a recession creeping into the world's sixth largest economy. His plan of action was vivid throughout the summer, though when he was campaigning for the top job, he lost to Truss. He criticised her plan to borrow funds to cut taxes as a \"fairy tale.\" He lost, but his arguments won six weeks down the line. Ms Truss' unfunded tax cuts had to be rolled back, and she had to step down.\nAs unrolled in the campaign, Rishi will deploy arms and ammunitions to guard inflation, which has crested at 10.1 percent.\nTough and unpopular decisions on spending are on their way to fill a 40-billion-pound (equivalent to USD 45 billion) deficit in public finances.\nWhile he lays his plans to build back Britain, he knows for sure that Labour leaders are not going to give it a smooth passage, as much of today's skyrocketing prices is of Rishi's own creation. Indeed, as the finance secretary, he dished out money during the pandemic even beyond their needs. Many Brits made more money sitting idle than working. He became hugely popular, but the economy suffered, so much so that it is yet to resettle on its pre-pandemic size.\nSomeone must fix it. Boris failed, Liz failed, Penny did not have a chance. Finally, the baton has been passed on to Rishi. Rishi Sunak, the man of the hour, is out to beat back the harshest economic head winds in a generation, reunite a divided party in power, draw investors' confidence in economic policies, and gain peoples' trust in the run-up to the next general election. Godspeed, Rishi!\nAl Mamoon is member of the Pacific Council on International Policy and a former commercial counsellor at the Los Angeles Consulate.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Amid a flurry of public rallies by major political parties and rekindled interest in the electoral fate of Bangladesh, it is cooler heads that must prevail. No one wants a repeat of the pre-2014 political violence or the pre-2018 ennui and despair. Nor will the mere appearance of an election, minus a healthy competition, be convincing for the people after two highly controversial national elections. The sooner the political establishment, especially the ruling party, understands that, the better.\nSpeaking of a healthy competition, it is not just on election day that it will be expected but also, equally importantly, on the campaign trail leading up to that day \u2013 something that the Election Commission must remember. That includes equal opportunity to organise political activities without any hindrance, official or unofficial, and equal participation in decisions related to the election. We must admit that the rallies recently organised by BNP have gone reasonably well, albeit with no shortage of impediments put in its way by entities loyal to Awami League. It has ushered in a long-forgotten period of street mobilisation by the opposition.\nHowever, ahead of BNP's planned rally in Barisal on November 5, there were concerns that it might be denied permission to hold the rally in its preferred venue. The problem, apparently, was its failure to correctly name the venue in its letter to the deputy commissioner. What's in a name, you ask? But tension was allowed to linger for a while \u2013 and a senior AL leader even wryly suggested the possibility of application rejection \u2013 before permission was eventually granted. This attempt to latch onto a technicality could be interpreted as a desperate response to the massive showing in BNP's previous rallies.\nIt is perhaps no surprise then that what started as protests against hikes in prices of essentials and political repression would boil down to a contest of \"street power\", with Awami League holding/planning counter-rallies to flex its organisational muscle. An equally worrying fallout is BNP's hint, at its Rangpur rally, that its lawmakers are ready to resign from parliament \"anytime soon\".\nBNP has only seven members in parliament \u2013 a symbolic presence, really, but one that gives it the opportunity to make its concerns known officially. But if it indeed goes ahead with this decision, we fail to see how it will benefit the party or the constituents of vacated seats, which will be duly filled. It will create no crisis in parliament, and no palpable pressure on the government. BNP will be wise not to pursue this course of action and turn its back on its voters. Its decision not to participate in any election under the present government is a political one, and must be pursued through political means.\nWhile the recent vigorous opposition activities are a pleasant break from years of political hibernation, we must not lose sight of the bigger objectives: 1) restoring public trust in the electoral process through creating an ideal environment for election, with a level playing field ensured for all; 2) finding a solution to the lack of confidence over election-time government, and 3) enabling the EC to hold a fair election without any interference from the ruling establishment. The government and the EC must show their commitment to these overarching goals.\n",

        "full_article": "If we had to pick only one example of how money speaks louder than the law of the land, many would probably pick the practice of hill cutting in Bangladesh. As per the Environment Conservation (Amendment) Act 2010, hill cutting is a cognisable offence, and no government, semi-government or autonomous organisation is allowed to cut or raze hills without permission from the authorities concerned. And yet, hills across the country keep being axed down while state officials and law enforcers, in cahoots with the criminals, turn a blind eye.\nAs a report by this newspaper has revealed, influential individuals are cutting down hills in various areas of Moulvibazar's Barlekha upazila, and neither raids nor fines by the relevant authorities seem to be able to stop them. As such, claims by the Department of Environment (DoE) that they have \"zero tolerance towards hill cutting\" have, in fact, zero ground to stand on.\nThe soil that is excavated from hills is trucked away and sold for use by brick kilns or real estate developers. It is often used for road construction purposes or to fill up low-lying lands. But are these developmental activities really worth the environmental and human costs incurred by the rampant cutting of hills? As experts have stated, such indiscriminate hill cutting is one of the biggest culprits responsible for landslides in hilly areas, thus putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of people living there. At any given time, any of these violated hills could fall on top of homes situated near them.\nAs locals have told this daily, influentials still continue to cut hills. Police or land office officials reportedly \"meet\" them sometimes, but leave with money. Culprits often receive news of planned raids beforehand and halt any hill-cutting activity, but continue as soon as the threat passes. As per our report, despite there being ample information on who are behind such illegal operations, when confronted for answers, these owners of hills or contractors or police sub-inspectors get away by shifting the blame onto one another. Some local government officials are also aware of the sheer illegality and corruption involved in hill cutting, but seldom come forward to speak against the culprits.\nWe agree with the residents of these hilly areas that the local administration must be stricter in dealing with influentials who are cutting down hills. And the local political leadership must support any attempt at saving hills. This is important both for the sake of the environment and the safety of those whose lives and livelihoods depend on hills. The need for \"development\" is not a sufficient excuse for mindlessly cutting down hills. The DoE and the government must do better to protect the country's environment and protect people's lives from an impending climate disaster.\n",

        "full_article": "A survey and review carried out by a research and advocacy organisation, Voices for Interactive Choice and Empowerment (VOICE) on and of e-waste (electrical and electronic waste) management in the country presents a highly disturbing picture. Bangladesh's tentative venture into the electrical and electronic industries in the late 80's and early 90's of the past century has now turned into ventures worth billions of dollars annually. Its electronic appliances alone account for US$1.36 billion, generating 2.81 million tonnes of e-waste which, according to a BUET study, is set to rise to 4.62 million tonnes by the year 2035. What is so galling is that the country follows no business model for electronic goods and recycling of the e-waste. Disposal and collection of e-waste are very important as they set the tone of handling of the rejected electrical and electronic devices and gadgets. Until the early 70s, e-waste ended in landfills even the Western developed countries, it does so today in some of those countries. In 1976, the US Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, setting the standard of e-waste disposal in order to protect human health and the environment from such materials' hazards. Then in March 1989 came the international treaty, the Basel Convention, aimed at reducing the movements of hazardous waste between and among nations and particularly its transfer from the developed to the less developed countries. But even all such measures failed to address the main problem of e-waste management. With the implementation of the first electronic waste recycling system in Switzerland in 1991, a viable option for safe disposal and management was found. Bangladesh's fledgling electrical and electronic industry has the added advantage of following such readymade systems in order to contain the e-waste pollution. The Voice's review finds the e-waste management rules 2021 good enough but wanting in their implementation. Rules are useless if illegal dumping of e-waste cannot be contained. In the European Union, member states also go by a common treaty on management of e-waste. What the majority of the developed nations have ensured is that the recycling industry has a safe way of keeping e-waste out of landfills and being burned in incinerators. The emphasis is on stoppage of leaching of hazardous materials like lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, beryllium and other materials. On the positive side, there are precious metals like silver, tin, gold, palladium and copper that are obtained from recycling. The proliferation of e-waste recycling industry in the West is not for nothing. Now that Bangladesh, a small but highly populous country, has concentrated on developing its electronic industry along with the allied electric one, it must have its recycling industry developed in order to protect its people and environment from indiscriminate disposal of e-waste. A study done recently has found high level of lead poisoning among children in this country. Electronic gadgets may be safe while in use above ground. But once dumped in landfills they continue to leach the hazardous toxic materials posing serious risks to soil, water, air, wildlife and human lives. It is time for putting in place a highly effective system of e-waste management by setting up the required sophisticated e-waste recycling plants.",

        "full_article": "After a phase of hit-and-run attacks on the Israeli soldiers decades ago, the disillusioned Palestinian youths appear to have changed their policy. Following their 'Intifada', targeting Israeli armed forces and the militia, the Palestinian militants have lately resorted to ambushes on the camps of the Israeli troops --- leading to killings. In retaliation, the Israeli armed forced resorted to killing Palestinian combatants in raids on the latter's hideouts.According to observers, the latest armed engagement between the two sides harks back to the days of the dreadful Fatah tactics. It witnessed the Palestinian youths and teenagers conducting clandestine attacks on the enemy forces. The protracted attacks, unique of their kind, involved Palestinians throwing sharp-edged stones using slings at the Israeli armed forces, fatally injuring many. The 'Intifada' attacks eventually underwent such an alarming metamorphosis that those were compared to the guerrilla forces' armed attacks. In fact, given the commitment to achieving their goal, they deserved to be called guerrilla fighters. Many senior guerrilla members as well as the de facto Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) authorities headed by their supreme leader Yasser Arafat, later divided into two factions, had the tacit backing to guerrilla warfare. The PLO's split into two factions and intra-party schism couldn't have come at a worse time in the struggle for a free Palestine. In 2006 PLC (Palestine Legislative Council) election, the PLO lost its majority to the radical faction of Hamas. It proved a great setback for the united struggle for the liberation of whatever is left from the earlier united Palestinian land. Although the acceptability of the hyper-active Hamas and its leaders getting stronger nowadays, especially in the Gaza Strip, in the larger occupied West Bank it is the Fatah leaders and the fighters who enjoy unalloyed support.Many tend to forget that the PLO is no longer a 'terrorist' organisation. It was recognsied by the UN General Assembly in 1974. This recognition had prompted many powerful countries to ponder the formal acceptance of the Palestinian statehood. During the tenure of the US President Donald Trump (2017-2021), the PLO office in Washington was asked to wind up. The action was alleged to have been prompted by Israeli instigation. To aggravate its ties with the Palestinians, the former US President opened his country's embassy in Israel's new capital, Jerusalem --- an ancient city long revered and contested by the followers of three Abrahamic religions --- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Earlier, the US President recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.The US administration knew that the move was, indisputably, a step which would infuriate the Muslims in the Israel-occupied Palestinian territory, and elsewhere in the world. But the former President's foreign relations advisors manning the White House behaved nonchalantly. Moreover, President Trump in the opening phase of his tenure was busy proving himself a tough head of state, although he also appeared to have in his mind the premonitions over a 'backlash' targeting the US. Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli Prime Minister, didn't fail to read the US President's mind. Without wasting time, he congratulated Donald Trump for his step on shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the new capital. A vital aspect of shifting the Israeli capital to Jerusalem was a 'vindication' of the 'Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel', in short the 'Jerusalem Law', mentioned at opening of the Israeli state's constitution.Despite recognising in principle the Palestinian National Authority or State of Palestine, many Western governments had yet to officially declare their position. The days of repeated wars are over. The world in general has started dreaming of peace in the vast area of the de jure ancient Palestine. Hadn't the Palestinian people been driven out of their land of hundreds of years, the orphaned and star-crossed people could have averted the sufferings they are being subject to in the 20th and the 21st centuries. Palestine was also home to a number of early Jews, who had been scattered in the ancient land for long. The curse of losing one's own land and being forced to the neighbouring lands and overseas far-away countries seeking refuge had been an absurd idea until 1948. In that year the independent Israeli state's flag was raised by the nation's first head of state and representatives of the 4-nation victorious Allied forces upon defeating Gemany-Italy-Japan Axis Forces in WW-II. A common feature characterising both Jewish and Palestinians' history: losing homeland and roaming for an indefinite period. It's true the Jews were persecuted for long in both ancient and modern history. Many might object to the placing of the Jews and the Palestinians within the same bracket. True the modern Jews passed through series of ordeals in the Third Reich, or the Nazi Germany. Apart from the Holocaust in the German-occupied Europe during WW-II, the Jews passed a long time as a stateless people. A similar fate befell the Palestinians after the questionable creation of the Israeli state in 1948. The Palestinians, the original inhabitants of Palestine, were ruthlessly driven out from their native land. Thus began the saga of the Palestinians roaming aimlessly throughout the world. The 1948 plan approved by the UN, to create two sovereign states, one for Israel and the other for Arabs, in the large territory got buried under the splinters of cannon shells fired by Israel. Palestine also took a defensive stance, with arms coming from Egypt and a few Arab states. Thanks to Israel's pathological hatred for the Palestinians and the latter's response with similar rancour, a war of attrition and the creation of Fatah, followed by the radical Hamas and other guerilla factions define the Israel-Palestine ties. The seeds of the escalation in armed conflict between Israel and Palestine lie in the big powers' failure to create two independent states in the Palestinian-dominant vast territory. Palestinians should brace for more Israeli ferocities, with Israel watching out for fresh guerrilla activities in the occupied West Bank.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) is reported to have identified another immune-evasive COVID variant, XBB, which has already spread to 26 countries. The infection rate of this new version of the COVID is increasing among the populations of both Singapore and Bangladesh. This only points to the immune-dodging potential of this variant of the pathogen as the population of Singapore is fully vaccinated with booster doses. The level of vaccination is also high in Bangladesh. Researchers at the Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Chittagong University have meanwhile found the existence of XBB as well as BM.1.1.1 subvariants of Omicron from samples taken from 12 patients. The patients of these subvariants, however, did not show any severe symptoms except slight fever and cough.In this connection, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) has also reported the findings of its research done between September 10 and October 14, 2022. In the research, the organisation sequenced 92 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and found that the virus was still evolving. During the first two weeks of their genome sequencing, the icddr,b scientists identified 84 per cent of the viruses as Omicron BA.2, while 16 per cent as BA.5. But those subvariants were soon replaced by the earlier noted new variant, XBB, and in the last three weeks (September 24 to October 14) of the study, this subvariant was found to be prevalent (85 per cent of the viruses) among the population. The previously mentioned other subvariant (BM.1.1.1) as found by the Chottogram University researchers was also identified by the icddr,b researchers. However, 78 per cent of the cases were infected with XBB, according to icddr,b findings. And the disease symptoms were found to be moderate among those infected with the virus (XBB). But the few who had severe symptoms were hospitalised. 66 per cent of those hospitalised had fever, 50 per cent had cough, 44 er cent had headache. 41 per cent of the patients complained of body ache and pains, 37 per cent had runny nose, while another 37 per cent had reported that they were feeling weak. And 47 per cent of the patients were found to be cases of reinfection. The hospitalised cases, though they represented a small percentage of the XBB-infected patients under the study, should be cause for concern. This is for the simple reason that the subvariant (XBB) of the Omicron is still in the process of evolving. According to Global Initiative on Sharing Avian influenza Data (GISAID), descendants of XBB like XBB.1, XBB.2 and XBB.3 have been identified in the US, especially in the New York State. WHO, on the other hand, reports that the number of XBB.1 cases were more prevalent. Actually, they (XBB.1 patients) were three times the number infected with the parent XBB. However, whether XBB spin-off such as XBB.1 is more evasive or transmissible than their parent-- XBB, is still not known. Time will tell, if the small change in the spike protein found in XBB.1 gives it any advantage over its parent variant, the XBB. Though the level of threat posed by XBB and its progeny are not clear, its extraordinary ability to evade immunity is keeping scientists on their toes.Epidemiologists, especially, the US's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, is expecting a wave of COVID infection in the US during this fall and winter. But scientists are not still sure which of the different COVID variants would trigger the wave. Omicron XBB cases are reportedly on the rise in different countries including India, England, U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia and Denmark. Since Bangladesh is also among the countries experiencing XBB infection, the health department here should be on the alert and take necessary measures to control the pathogen's transmission among the population. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, the authorities who are supposed to ensure that no vehicle gets away with this offence are apparently unable or unwilling to address the issue. Most of the traffic police do not stop vehicles violating traffic rule if they have government stickers or carry the national flag. In fact, many of the vehicles which ply the wrong side belong to various agencies of the government including law enforcers themselves. Sometimes, buses belonging to educational institutions also breach the law and drive on the wrong side. Isolated measures have been taken to stop driving on the wrong side. But it is going on unabated in broad daylight. The offenders are often some influential persons, including ministers, civil and high police officials and students. It is putting pedestrians at high risk and creating further congestions on roads. Apart from cars, motorcycles and rickshaws also try to drive along the opposite direction through a lane to reach a destination quickly. Following the traffic rules is the hallmark of a civilized society. Enforcing the law without discrimination is interlinked to this. Law enforcement agencies must enforce the laws to stop errant drivers-whoever they may be -using the wrong side of the road to avoid traffic congestion. And an awareness raising campaign should be launched so that no one violates the traffic laws. \nAbir Hasan Suzon, Student of Department of Land Management and Law, Jagannath University, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
