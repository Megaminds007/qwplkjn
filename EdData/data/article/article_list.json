        "full_article": "The demand for a ban on The Kerala Story, a film apparently based on the instances of a few women joining the Islamic State, is ill-conceived. It is to the credit of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of Kerala and Madras that they did not yield to the clamour for proscribing the movie. It garnered adverse publicity because of a teaser that made an exaggerated claim that 32,000 girls have gone missing in Kerala, presumably to join the terrorist group. However, the film-makers have agreed to withdraw the teaser and carry a disclaimer that the film\u2019s content is fictional. The film\u2019s more notable feature is that it has been denounced as undisguised propaganda. Those seeking the ban accuse its makers of trying to stoke communal passions and the projecting of a fake narrative against Muslims. However, even if that is true, any ban on the film will be counter-productive. Bans can be overturned by courts, and they tend to evoke curiosity about the film and often end up making more people form opinions on its content. In effect, it enhances the propaganda value, and furthers the ulterior motive, if any. It is now legally settled that once a film has been certified by the statutory authority, there is really no case to ban one. Laws pertaining to public order indeed empower the police and local authorities to stop a film\u2019s screening, but it will be perilous to do so every time a group demands a ban.Reports from Tamil Nadu and Kerala suggest that threats of protests have resulted in multiplexes and some cinema owners choosing not to screen the film. It is normally the local authorities who have a duty to provide adequate security, as ruled by the Supreme Court. However, rather than the law, it is prudent assessment of the ground situation that helps them make a decision. What is also condemnable is the attempt to make political and electoral capital out of The Kerala Story. The Prime Minister himself has alleged that only those who support terrorism will criticise such a movie. It does not behove high constitutional functionaries to communalise the debate over the film. Protests against an allegedly false narrative about a State or a community will not amount to backing terrorism. The fear that the film purportedly grapples with \u2014 that young people may be targeted for radicalisation \u2014 should be addressed by isolating extremist elements and fostering better understanding among communities. The mischief wrought by a false projection of reality is best undone through exposing the falsehood and the underlying motive, and not through hasty bans.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\nfilm making\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nIslamic State\n\n/\n\nterrorism (crime)\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi",

        "full_article": "In the first coronation in the country in 70 years, a lavish ceremony comprising 2,300 guests including more than 100 heads of state, Charles III has been crowned King of the United Kingdom. The event marked the culmination of plans that were set in motion last September upon the passing of King Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II. During the seven decades of her reign, emerging post-colonial nations grew in self-confidence, and some challenged the idea of the Commonwealth, while at home, the traditional public deference to the monarchy faded, requiring the members of the royal family to reposition themselves as good Samaritans working towards the greater good of British society. King Charles, in his prior avatar as the Prince of Wales, was quick to embrace the successive waves of change, particularly when it came to climate change and the environment. As a passionate supporter of sustainable ecosystems and architecture, he has advocated for organically maintained parks and natural reserves in the U.K. Under the aegis of the Prince\u2019s Trust, which operates under a royal charter to help disadvantaged youth in the U.K., more than a million young people had benefited by 2020.While the new king has made a name for himself in the climate and social welfare spaces, he will have to work hard to tackle rifts within the royal family, potentially deal with an independence movement in Scotland, and face up to the long-standing challenge of Commonwealth nations that no longer wish to have the U.K. monarch as their head of state. Within the Windsor clan, King Charles\u2019s younger son Prince Harry has renounced his royal trappings and moved to California with his American wife Meghan Markle, and his recent novel, Spare, does not mince words in spelling out deep-seated resentment that he claims they felt while at the palace. The King will have to either make peace with the new arrangement forced by Prince Harry or build bridges with his second son. In Scotland, Humza Yousaf has now taken the reins of the Scottish National Party after the long tenure of Nicola Sturgeon. While the party has numerous internal issues to resolve, there is a distinct possibility of another independence referendum, which would pose sharp challenges to the U.K.\u2019s economy and society, particularly in a post-Brexit context. King Charles would also have to engage with Commonwealth nations such as Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica and St. Kitts and Nevis \u2014 nations that have signalled their intention to appoint their own heads of state. To tackle and effectively deal with these challenges, King Charles III will have to continue to embrace modern values while carrying the mantle of hoary royal traditions.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\n Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nimperial and royal matters\n\n/\n\nenvironmental issues\n\n/\n\nwildlife\n\n/\n\nnature and wildlife\n\n/\n\nwaste management\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

        "full_article": "Temperature gauges in the Pacific Ocean point to an El Ni\u00f1o developing this year. Despite the warnings, many of us overlook the phenomenon that has reshaped India time and again. The El Ni\u00f1o or \u2018Little Boy\u2019 (referring to Baby Jesus), is so named because Peruvian fisherman noticed their fishing catch fall around Christmas every few years. By the 1960s, scientists discovered that fish harvest fell because of a rise in ocean temperatures off the Peruvian coast \u2014 a rise that was part of vast Pacific Ocean-air temperature see-saw between Australia and Peru. Every few years, this see-saw would bring rain to Australasia, and when it swung the other way, rain to the Peruvian coast. Moreover, whenever Peruvian fisherman saw poor fishing, the Indian monsoon faltered. While scientists have discovered more such ocean-air see-saws that affect the Indian monsoon, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s influence, though nuanced, remains strong. Every major drought that has struck India has been during an El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 and the truly massive El Ni\u00f1os have transformed India.\nWarning bell: India has shown resilience but depletion of groundwater can trigger famines\nConsider the 1877 El Ni\u00f1o. India was then the crown jewel of the British Empire, and its wealth was being systematically and ruthlessly transferred to England.\nMuch of India\u2019s forests had been cleared and a fixed, payable-in-cash tax had coerced farmers to shift from climate-resilient millets to cash crops like indigo, opium and cotton, unsuited to India\u2019s rainfall and inedible in a drought. By 1876, a powerful El Ni\u00f1o was forming, and India\u2019s rains began to fail. Soon, millions left their withered fields in the Madras Presidency to beg for food. British tight-fistedness in granting relief \u2014 historian Mike Davis said the calories offered by the relief camps at the height of the famine were less than those given in Nazi concentration camps \u2014 caused public outrage to erupt.\nProtesting the unfairness of the conditions, 102,000 people refused to attend relief work (which, given the lack of alternatives, was tantamount to accepting a death sentence). The British administration termed this strike \u2018passive resistance\u2019 because there was little violence \u2014 a term that would come to define India\u2019s independence movement. Over five million Indians died in that famine, leaving the country seething in resentment. This anger fuelled organisations like the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and the Arya Samaj, whose leaders like Ranade, and later, Tilak and Gokhale, played key roles in the country\u2019s Independence struggle. The famine also unleashed a wave of dam-and-canal building in a desire to control water.\nFast-forward to 1965. While India had shed its imperialistic yoke, Nehru believed that India could never be truly free as long as it lacked food security. In the 1950s and \u201960s, India had become addicted to cheap American wheat. It seemed a sweet deal: pay for cheap grain in Indian rupees and save dollars for industrialisation. But when the El Ni\u00f1o struck, India\u2019s grain production suffered, particularly in Bihar where the situation became dire. Early in 1966, a new prime minister, Indira Gandhi, confronted a nation that had just emerged from a war and was staring at famine. Importantly, her party was staring at electoral defeat in Bihar\u2019s elections. Mrs Gandhi visited Washington in March 1966 to plead for aid, which the American President promised to provide. But then, India dared to condemn the American bombing of Vietnam. Pissed, America kept India on a short leash, and released its grain, tonne-by-precious-tonne, to ensure India behaved and made policy changes. India devalued its currency by 57% in June 1966, and opened up some of its economy to private forces. Smarting but hungry, India vowed to become food secure. In the background, the Green Revolution was just getting started, sparking a borewell revolution in dry Punjab and Haryana, making that dry land spew forth unbelievable quantities of grain. The mid-1960s saw the creation of the Food Corporation of India to buy grain and the Minimum Support Price to motivate farmers to make more grain. Within decades, India became food secure and truly independent. Ask yourself, could India have been able to buy Russian oil so easily today if it depended on European grain to feed itself?\nLet us move ahead to a monster El Ni\u00f1o and the back-to-back droughts of 2015-16. Surprisingly, India has shown resilience. Have we conquered the El Ni\u00f1o? Hardly. Our groundwater reserves have bought us climate wiggle room. But when those reserves begin to sputter, especially in India\u2019s dry breadbaskets, the El Ni\u00f1o will be waiting. Even in 2015-16, India saw thousands of heat wave deaths, devastating floods, Day Zero in cities, power plants shut down by lack of water and farmer suicides spike in Maharashtra and Karnataka. When groundwater runs out, add famine to this list. Metaphorically, it\u2019s only when the tide recedes do we see who has been swimming naked. El Ni\u00f1os, by pulling the tide back and exposing vulnerabilities, force change. What will it show us this time?\n\n",

        "full_article": "After the enactment of the Digital Security Act (DSA) in 2018, the Sampadak Parishad published an elaborate Section by Section analysis of the objectionable parts and gave a detailed response as to how this law impinged on the operation of free and independent media and why DSA should be repealed or fundamentally amended.\nThe experience of the last four and half years proves the correctness of our initial concerns and strengthens our demand for repealing the Act.\nOriginally, we reproduced the Bangla versions of the Act along with our translation as the official English translation of the DSA was not available. In the present reprint below we have replaced the Bangla text (and translation) with the official English version of DSA. For the sake of brevity and improved readability, we have also made some modifications. (Please refer to the original article through this link: https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/why-sampadak-parishad-oppose...)\n1. The Act ends up policing media operations, censoring content and controlling media freedom and freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed by our constitution.\n2. The Act gives unlimited power to the police to arrest without warrant, enter premises, search offices, bodily search persons, seize computers, computer networks, servers, and everything related to the digital platforms.\n3. The Act suffers from vagueness and uses many terms that can be misinterpreted and used against the media. Laws must be clear, specific and meticulously defined. A vague law is a weapon of misuse and as such oppression of the media.\n4. DSA will create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation which will make journalism and especially investigative journalism virtually impossible.\n5. The law will not only create panic among media professionals, but also among all users of computers, computer networks, and related technologies.\n6. The purpose of the law as mentioned in its preamble is \"ensuring digital security and identification, prevention, suppression and trial of offences committed through digital device and for matters ancillary thereto\".\u00a0 However, its use over the last four and half years provide irrefutable proof that its purpose has been to curb freedom of the media, freedom of expression and all related freedoms.\n7. The law goes against the very nature and practice of independent journalism that stands to protect people's right to know and exposes abuse of power and corruption.\n8. While other fields, like cyber security, may require \"regulations\" media needs \"freedom\". The DSA is focused only on the \"regulation\" and totally neglects the \"freedom\" aspect that the media needs.\n9. A frightening aspect of the DSA is the enormous arbitrary power given to the police who may arrest, without warrant, a journalist just on suspicion of a so-called crime that police think may be committed in the future. In practical terms, this will bring journalism under police control.\n10. It is alarming that out of the 20 or so provisions of the law that deal with offences and punishments, 14 are NON-BAILABLE. Five are bailable and one can be negotiated. The lowest punishment is 1 year in prison and the highest life-term but mostly in the range of between 4 and 7 years. This will inevitably create an atmosphere of FEAR and INTIMIDATION under which normal functioning of journalism will become extremely risky if not impossible.\n11. Another flaw of the DSA is the level of punishment meted out to \"offenders\". Let's take the case of the Road Safety Act which was passed along with the DSA. The former provides for a maximum punishment of 5 years for killing people in road accidents while a journalist can be punished up to life-term for violating the colonial era Official Secrets Act (1923).\nSECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS AND OUR OBSERVATIONS\nBelow we present a detailed analysis as to why Sampadak Parishad (Editors' Council) considers this law to be anti-free press, against freedom of speech and antithetical to democracy. To ensure the accuracy of our analysis, we have referred to the official English text of the Act, which was published on October 6, 2019.\"\nSECTION 8\nPower to remove or block some data-information. (1) If any data-information related to any matter under the jurisdiction of the Director General, being published or propagated in digital media, creates threat to digital security, the Director General may request the Bangladesh Telecommunications and Regulatory Commission, hereinafter referred to as BTRC, to remove or, as the case may be, block the said data-information.\n(2) If it appears to the law and order enforcing force that any data-information published or propagated in digital media hampers the solidarity, financial activities, security, defence, religious values or public discipline of the country or any part thereof, or incites racial hostility and hatred, the law and order enforcing force may request BTRC to remove or block the data-information through the Director General.\n(3) If BTRC is requested under sub-sections (1) and (2), it shall, with intimation to the Government of the said matters, instantly remove or, as the case may be, block the data-information.\n(4) For carrying out the purposes of this section, other necessary matters shall be prescribed by rules.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\n\nThere are two issues of concern here -- the power of the Director General and the power of the law enforcement agencies. The power to block contents will hit the heart of publication either in print or online. Any report may be blocked or a photograph may be confiscated that may lead to disruption of any media outlet.\nThe justifications needed to remove or block content are too vague and subject to individual interpretation, leaving room for the abuse of the law. For example, if a journalist exposes corruption in a project, and this leads to the project's financing being stopped by a donor or private investor, the journalist can be accused of \"disrupting financial activities\" under this law, which can then lead to the blocking or removal of their content.\nSECTION 21\nPunishment for making any kind of propaganda or campaign against liberation war, spirit of liberation war, father of the nation, national anthem or national flag. (1) If any person, by means of digital medium, makes or instigates to make any propaganda or campaign against the liberation war of Bangladesh, spirit of liberation war, father of the nation, national anthem or national flag, then such act of the person shall be an offence.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nWe are fully committed to the preservation of the dignity and correct history of our Liberation War and given the past experience of attempts at its distortion we understand the need to do something in this regard. However, \"Spirit of Liberation War\" is a rather vague term. Without further defining the \"crimes\" under this section and clearly specifying what constitutes a \"crime\", we run the risk of serious abuse of this law and harassment of journalists and the punishment is up to life-term or (and) Tk 3 crore in fine or both.\n\"Mukti Juddher Chetona\" (Spirit of Liberation War) is a vague term and is very subjective and cases can be brought against journalists as interpretations can vary.\nWe reiterate that we are in favour of protecting the great legacy of our Liberation War for the future generations. However, when laws are being framed, we need to be very clear and specific. Given its present form, not only journalists but historians, researchers and even creative writers like novelists will also suffer. It may even result in people not writing or researching much on our Liberation War fearing misinterpretation and the possibility of punishment.\nSECTION 25\nTransmission, publication, etc. of offensive, false or threatening data-information. (1) If any person, through any website or any other digital medium, (a) intentionally or knowingly transmits, publishes or propagates any data-information which he knows to be offensive, false or threatening in order to annoy, insult, humiliate or malign a person; or (b) publishes or propagates or abets to publish or propagate any information, as a whole or partly, which he knows to be propaganda or false, with an intention to affect the image or reputation of the country, or to spread confusion, then such act of the person shall be an offence.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nThis will directly affect all investigative reporting in the media. Such reports are usually about some irregularities performed by institutions and individuals. Corrupt people will use this law to intimidate journalists and media organizations and try to prevent publication of such stories on the pretext that the reports have attacked or intimidated them. Actually, every such report can be said to fall under one or more of the above categories and can be used to harass the media.\nAny investigative report that reveals corruption about a person or an institution is bound to \"irritate\", \"embarrass\" or \"humiliate\" someone. This provision will make it impossible to publish any negative report about any corrupt person. This will reduce newspapers to PR outfits. Journalism of even the most rudimentary investigative nature will become impossible.\nThe second part of this provision talks about \"spreading confusion\". Without specifying the meaning of \"confusion\", it may become a weapon of media harassment. What is confusing to one may not be confusing to another. This will surely create a new avenue to intimidate the media.\nThen again, what constitutes damaging the \"image or reputation\" of the State? Recently we have reported about the corruption in the banking sector by unscrupulous business groups. We have reported that the banks face grim crisis. Does it constitute damaging the \"image or reputation\"? We have reported corruption in the law enforcement agencies. We have reported on \"custodial deaths\" \"disappearances\", and \"extra-judicial killings\". If someone interprets all these reports as damaging to the \"image\" of the State then this law legalises punishment of journalists and newspapers for making such reports, as all newspapers have websites.\nSECTION 28\nPublication, broadcast, etc. of information in website or in any electronic format that hurts the religious values or sentiment. (1) If any person or group willingly or knowingly publishes or broadcasts or causes to publish or broadcast anything in website or any electronic format which hurts religious sentiment or values, with an intention to hurt or provoke the religious values or sentiments, then such act of the person shall be an offence.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nThe term \"religious sentiment\" is an undefined term. How can a reporter know how and when religious sentiment has been hurt? This term lends itself to diverse interpretations and no journalist will feel comfortable about reporting on such issues. This will prevent journalistic scrutiny over a large area of the society. The recent reporting on the sexual harassment by catholic priests would not have been possible if those countries had a law preventing reporting that \"hurts\" religious sentiments. Criticizing unlawful fatwa or women's property rights may be interpreted by some as \"hurting\" their religious values. This section can lead to widespread harassment of journalists.\nSECTION 29\nPublication, transmission, etc. of defamatory information. (1) If any person publishes or transmits any defamatory information as described in section 499 of the Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) in website or in any other electronic format, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 (three) years, or with fine not exceeding Taka 5 (five) lac, or with both.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nA law already exists to deal with defamation and so a separate law for digital media is not needed. Furthermore, there is no justification for imposing harsher penalties for the same offense committed through digital media than for print media.\nSECTION 31\nOffence and punishment for deteriorating law and order, etc. (1) If any person intentionally publishes or transmits anything in website or digital layout that creates enmity, hatred or hostility among different classes or communities of the society, or destroys communal harmony, or creates unrest or disorder, or deteriorates or advances to deteriorate the law and order situation, then such act of the person shall be an offence.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nA news concerning discrimination of Dalits, or ethnic groups and exploitation of disadvantaged groups may be interpreted as causing disaffection between different sections of the society. Any news highlighting plights of the people of Chittagong Hill Tracts may be interpreted as \"creating unrest\" among different communities. Similarly, news about possible labour unrest, impending hartal or demonstration can be construed as reports that are \"creating law and order situation\" and thus bring action under this law.\u00a0 There could be a story that a person has died in a demonstration which may later prove to be untrue. Will the media be \"guilty of spreading rumour\"?\u00a0 Such errors regularly occur in reporting which are corrected immediately. In Bangladesh death figures from floods, cyclones or even roads accidents vary. Government figures are always at variance with privately gathered figures. In such cases according to the DSA, media can be sued for \"spreading rumour\".\u00a0 Sometimes reports may forecast certain developments which may not exactly happen later. That also can be considered as \"spreading rumour\". Thus, we find this section as seriously jeopardizing freedom of journalism.\nSECTION 32\nOffence and punishment for breaching secrecy of the Government. (1) If any person commits or abets to commit an offence under the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (Act No. XIX of 1923) by means of computer, digital device, computer network, digital network or any other digital means, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 (fourteen) years, or with fine not exceeding Taka 25 (twenty-five) lac, or with both. (2) If any person commits the offence referred to in sub-section (1) for the second time or repeatedly, he shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with fine not exceeding Taka 1 (one) crore, or with both.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nThis is a sweeping restrictive law from the colonial times that was promulgated to protect the British administration from any sort of accountability. It is shocking to see it being incorporated for digital platforms. Anything that is not made public by the government is deemed an \"official secret\". Let us take one example. We have published dozens of reports about bank defaults based on Bangladesh Bank's findings. All such reports can be said to have violated the Official Secrets Act. All government reports which have not been made public, say, on pollution or child nutrition, are a part of the Official Secrets Act. Is journalism of any worth possible without the use of such official reports? And why should using them be a \"crime\" as people have a \"Right to Know\" under the RTI Act, especially when all such reports are funded by public money.\nCould we have done any of the reporting on default loans, gross irregularities in Farmers' Bank or Basic Bank without Bangladesh Bank or government departments' reports which were yet to be made public? And our reporters often use their mobile phones to take pictures of such documents. So, under this law, journalists can be thrown in jail up to life-term?\nSECTION 43\nSearch, seizure and arrest without warrant. (1) If any police officer has reasons to believe that an offence under this Act has been or is being committed, or is likely to be committed in any place, or any evidence is likely to be lost, destroyed, deleted or altered or made unavailable in any way, then he may, for reasons of such belief to be recorded in writing, proceed with the following measures, namely:\n(a) to enter and search the place, and if obstructed, to take necessary measures in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure;\n(b) to seize the computer, computer system, computer network, data-information or other materials used in committing the offence or any document supportive to prove the offence;\n(c) to search the body of any person present in the place;\n(d) to arrest any person present in the place if the person is suspected to have committed or be committing an offence under this Act.\n(2) After concluding search under sub-section (1), the police officer shall submit a report on such search to the Tribunal.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nThis is by far the most dangerous of the provisions of the law.\nThis empowers the police to enter any premises, search any computer system, seize any computer network and its servers, bodily search any body and also ARREST anybody on suspicion.\nFirst, the threat of arrest without warrant will naturally prevent a journalist from doing their work. When police get the power to arrest without warrant, and on mere SUSPICION then media freedom will be buried under this law. Given the fact that 14 out of 20 provisions of punishment are NON-BAILABLE the threat of arrest becomes like the \"Damocles' Sword\" constantly hanging over the head of every journalist, causing mental stress. This will prevent all forms of real journalism and make our media nothing more than public relations and propaganda outlets.\nEven if the law is not implemented (and why not if the law exists?) the environment of fear will prevent journalists from doing their job. The fear of arrest will become a regular part of the \"mental environment\" and desist a journalist from taking legitimate risks that he or she regularly take to file their stories. The \"emotional stress\" that it will create should not be underestimated. It can easily be expected that people in power will abuse this law, provoke or \"manage\" law enforcers to threaten or even arrest journalists for any story that will reveal something that the rich and powerful will want to hide.\nThe most dangerous side of this law is that since every newspaper and TV station works on digital system, by giving the power to confiscate a computer, a network of computers including servers, the law enforcing agencies have been given, in effect, the power to shut down a newspaper or TV station or a news portal by confiscating its computers, computer system, computer network and other equipment. Thus, without closing down a media outlet, this clause opens up the possibility of stopping the publication of a newspaper or the operation of a TV station by the law enforcing agencies.\nSECTION 53\nOffences to be cognizable and bailable. --In this Act --\n(a) the offences specified in sections 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 shall be cognizable and non-bailable;\n(b) the offences specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 18, sections 20, 25, 29 and sub-section (3) of section 47 shall be non-cognizable and bailable;\n(c) the offences specified in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 18 shall be non-cognizable, bailable and subject to the permission of the court, be compoundable; and\n(d) the offences, if committed by a person for the second time or more, shall be cognizable and non-bailable.\nSAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT\nUnder this law out of the 20 or so provisions dealing with crimes and punishment,14 are cognizable and NON-BAILABLE. Given the fact that police have the power to arbitrarily arrest without warrant and on mere suspicion, this law presents a real threat to media freedom as so many offences have been made cognizable and non-bailable.\nCONCLUSION\n1. The Digital Security Act (DSA) clearly violates the citizens' Constitutional Right to freedom of speech and expression and freedom of the press, guaranteed in our most sacred document, the Constitution, with reasonable restrictions.\n2. This law violates the spirit of our Liberation War and the high ideals of freedom that our martyrs laid down their lives for.\n3. This law is against the fundamentals of democracy, democratic governance and all the rights that our people fought for repeatedly during our struggle against the Pakistani rule and against all martial law regimes after 1971.\n4. The Digital Security Act is against all the fundamental values of ethical and independent journalism.\n5. The Digital Security Act is in contradiction with the Right to Information Act.\nWe have explained in detail and made a section-by-section analysis as to why the Digital Security Act is against our Constitution, against our fundamental fights, against freedom of speech and freedom of press and as such against democracy.\nIt is thus that the Sampadak Parishad is forced to reject this law.\nThe quotation from the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (published in the highlighted box), must guide us in the matter of protecting the freedom of the press.\n",

        "full_article": "The world is going through several challenges including the fallout from the Covid pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, soaring inflation, and climate emergencies. Despite decades of progress, we are now in a situation where growth and poverty reduction have slowed down. Climate change has exacerbated these problems as millions of lives face displacement, poverty, and hunger.\nThe new World Bank (WB) president pick, Ajay Banga (who is set to take over on June 2, 2023) will have to address these emerging issues and the existing ones, as expectations from the world's largest multilateral bank are high. Indeed, the Indian-American businessman and former CEO of Mastercard has a lot on his plate.\nOne of the first things Banga would have to tackle is reforming and modernising the institution, something that stakeholders have asked for across sectors. For a long time, member countries have been urging for designing the WB as a fit-for-purpose institution. The reason behind this is that the 20th century organisation cannot address 21st century issues as their nature, dimension, extent, and scale have changed a lot. So, solutions have to be changed radically from what they would have been 80 years ago.\nThe WB has recently published \"Evolution of the World Bank Group: A Report to Governors,\" which aims to propose ways to enhance its mission and strengthen its operating model. While this is a welcome move, reforms have to go much deeper in order to deal with multidimensional problems that pose existential threats to our world.\nAgainst current geo-economic and geopolitical realities, the World Bank's programmes should be much more comprehensive in order to capture the interconnectedness of developmental and other sectoral goals. The magnitude of problems requires not just the addition of new issues on the programme list, but the integration of these issues in the overall mission and operating model of the organisation.\n\nAgainst current geo-economic and geopolitical realities, the World Bank's programmes should be much more comprehensive in order to capture the interconnectedness of developmental and other sectoral goals. The magnitude of problems requires not just the addition of new issues on the programme list, but the integration of these issues in the overall mission and operating model of the organisation.\nTake the example of climate change. The World Bank's efforts in this case have been fraught with limitations. At the leadership level, the inertia in recognising the severity of the problem and guiding the climate action agenda holistically has been absent so far. This limitation is reflected in the country offices of the WB. There are some initiatives by the organisations on climate change at the country level. However, those are still \"add-ons\" to the overall programme. They are not designed as part of the overall development programme of each country office. Hence, these programmes are implemented on a piecemeal basis. The country-level programmes are often not aligned with national goals on climate change, either. There are, of course, the Country Climate and Development Reports of the World Bank, which aim to guide countries on how their national development priorities can be aligned with international climate goals. But the inclusiveness in consultation while designing programmes is limited to only a select few stakeholders.\nSeveral climate-vulnerable and poor countries do not have the capacity to design their own programmes and have to accept what is offered to them. So, programmes need to be packaged with capacity development in mind. Also, the continuity of programmes is crucial as climate programmes must be ongoing and will continue to impact people's lives and livelihood. The investment requirements for climate issues are massive and the WB must play the catalytic role to mobilise the incremental resources from various sources.\nFor climate change issues, Banga will have to make tough choices in order to create a radical shift in the way the World Bank Group (WBG) funds projects. Among the five WBG institutions \u2013 namely the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and International Centre for Settlement of Disputes (ICSID) \u2013 some have been accused of continuing to finance fossil fuel-based projects even after the Paris Agreement. Hence, the WBG has to be transparent and accountable in regards to direct and indirect energy financing, the emissions due to such investments, and their impact on the community.\nWhile focusing his attention on climate crises, there is no scope for the new World Bank president to shy away from other difficult issues such as fighting poverty, tackling inequality, and reducing the debt burden of low- and middle-income countries. New and additional resources should be generated to confront the existing and new challenges. The mounting debt crisis in several countries must be addressed, too. Debt as a percentage of countries' gross national income (GNI) has increased significantly during the last decade. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North Africa have experienced a sharp increase of their debt-GNI ratio during 2010-2021. And though South Asia has seen only a two percent average increase of its debt-GNI during this period, countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka are facing difficulty due to high debt.\nThe G20's \"Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks\" launched last year called for improving the balance sheets of multilateral development banks and making lending restrictions flexible and affordable for lower-income countries so that they can recover from the pandemic and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To match this, the WB needs to mobilise private-sector finance to meet both developmental and climate goals.\nAs part of its reform, the efficiency of the WB itself needs to be invigorated. The processing time for projects is lengthy as bureaucratic requirements are high and so are the transaction costs. This may discourage countries from borrowing from the WB to invest in infrastructure. The institution has to find ways to eliminate such limitations without compromising on the standards and quality of the bureaucratic process. Coordination with other multilateral institutions is critical for priority-setting so that resources are allocated and used efficiently, without duplication of programmes. Such collaboration has to be initiated from the top levels, which can help overcome institutional rivalry.\nTherefore, the new president of the World Bank will be settling into the hot seat during a turbulent period in a new world. His task is not only to consolidate what has been achieved so far, but to also help the institution evolve into one that can face the ongoing crises. Member countries await to see how well Ajay Banga can live up to their expectations.\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue.

        "full_article": "On March 26, 2023, US President Joe Biden greeted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the occasion of Bangladesh's Independence Day. Biden also reminded Hasina to hold free and fair elections in December 2023. \"As Bangladesh approaches its next election, I am reminded of the deep value both of our nations' people place on democracy, equality, respect for human rights, and free and fair elections,\" he said.\nThe United States has placed a strong emphasis on human rights and democracy in its foreign relations. The promotion of these values has been a key part of US foreign policy, and has been pursued through a variety of means, including diplomatic efforts, economic incentives and sanctions, and military intervention in some cases \u2013 even though its relations with some authoritarian states put question marks on its declared policy of upholding democracy and human rights. The US under the Biden Presidency has also been focusing on these two values to deal with Bangladesh, which was partially absent during the Trump administration.\nSince 2014, Bangladesh has been grappling with the challenges of upholding democratic values and human rights, which have been exacerbated in recent times. The two most recent elections, which were held under the Awami League government in 2014 and 2018, were heavily criticised by the international community, with widespread human rights violations occurring during this period. The regime has employed various means to suppress dissent, including the Digital Security Act (DSA).\nThe United States and Bangladesh have had diplomatic relations since 1972. The US has become one of Bangladesh's largest trading partners, with over $8 billion in bilateral trade in 2021, and has provided development assistance in areas such as education, health, and economic growth. The US and Bangladesh also work together to combat terrorism and promote regional stability through joint military exercises and training for Bangladesh's security forces.\nThe US-Bangladesh relationship has had some tensions due to human rights concerns. The US has criticised Bangladesh's government for cracking down on political opposition, and limiting freedom of speech and assembly. The US has imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) for violating human rights. The US human rights reports of 2021 and 2022 have highlighted issues of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, political marginalisation, and election rigging. As a result, Bangladesh was not invited to the Biden Democracy Summit, signalling a shift in US policy towards Bangladesh.\nUS' push for democracy and human rights has definitely angered the Bangladesh government. Its bottled rage has bubbled up in various ways. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina considers US sanctions on Russia as a form of human rights violations. \"I don't really know what rationale there is for making people suffer like this. In a way, this is another violation of human rights. Depriving people of what they are owed\u2026 I hope the US sees the necessity of stepping aside from that decision [of putting Russia under sanctions]. We hope they prefer to punish a single country instead of the people of the world and see that everyone wants it withdrawn.\" Recently, Hasina commented in the parliament that, \"It (US) has the power to topple the government in any country and particularly the Muslim countries.\"\nLiberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque blamed the US for not recognising the genocide against Bangladesh in 1971. He said that the United States has recognised the genocide of the Rohingya in Myanmar. But it did not recognise the genocide that took place in Bangladesh, because it had direct involvement in it. At that time, the governments of the US and UK were not in favour of our Liberation War. But the people of those countries and the world were on our side.\nThat said, Bangladesh's apathy towards the US is quite clear. Meanwhile, China and Russia have extended their hands with \"baskets of money\", while Bangladesh is facing serious economic crises. Geopolitical interests for both US and China-Russia are well noted in the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe US invited Bangladesh to join the Quad in October 2020, citing the country as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region, and later invited it to the US-led IPS (Indo-Pacific Strategy). China responded by warning that Bangladesh's relations with China would be harmed if it joined the Quad, while also offering Bangladesh the chance to join its Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative. The US and Russia have also engaged in a war of words over Bangladesh, with the Russian Foreign Ministry accusing the US ambassador in Dhaka of trying to influence the domestic process of the country, and the Russian Embassy in Dhaka criticising countries with \"hegemonic ambitions\" that interfere in the internal affairs of others under the pretext of protecting democratic values.\nThe ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict has resulted in a surge of high-level visits from China and the United States to Bangladesh, highlighting Bangladesh's growing importance in the Indo-Pacific region. This geopolitical reality is crucial for Bangladesh's future trajectory. For the first time, Bangladesh has articulated its distinct objectives in the Indo-Pacific region, aligning with the conceptual framework advocated by India, the US, Japan, and Australia. While Bangladesh has traditionally pursued a non-aligned foreign policy, recent developments suggest a potential shift towards aligning more closely with the IPS promoted by the United States and its regional allies. However, it remains to be seen how China and Russia will react to this shift and how Bangladesh will navigate its relationships with them.\nIt is unclear how successful Bangladesh's \"pleasing all\" strategy has been. An agreement has been reached between Bangladesh and Russia to use the Chinese yuan to pay for a nuclear power plant, but the United States has raised objections to this arrangement. Amid this situation, Bangladesh is attempting to manage the US through other Quad members like India and Japan. On April 26, 2023, under the agreement for the use of Chittagong and Mongla ports for the transportation of goods to and from India, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) released a standing order pertaining to the transhipment of Indian goods. During her visit to Japan in April 2023, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that, \"We are happy that Bangladesh and Japan have successfully elevated the bilateral relations to a 'Strategic Partnership' from the existing 'Comprehensive Partnership'.\"\nIt appears that the relationship between the United States and Bangladesh is going through some strain. Bangladesh is endeavouring to handle its relations with the US in the lead-up to the next election. Navigating this dynamic geopolitical situation will require astute diplomatic strategies and judicious decision-making on Bangladesh's part. While attempting to maintain relationships with China, Russia, and the US, Bangladesh will also need to prioritise human rights and democratic principles, particularly in the context of potentially embracing the IPS.\nShafi Md Mostofa (PhD)\u00a0is associate professor of World Religions and Culture at Dhaka University's Faculty of Arts and an adjunct lecturer at the University of New England, Australia.\n\n",

        "full_article": "That increasing numbers of people are getting priced out of receiving life-saving cardiac treatment, after the government hiked the price of cardiac stents by 20-35 percent from February 1, is heart-wrenching. At a time when ordinary people are struggling heavily with the rising costs of living, this increased cost of a critical surgical component, which was costly to begin with, is making it impossible for many people to afford such treatment.\nThe government's reasoning for increasing the price of cardiac stents was the steep depreciation of the taka against the dollar. However, a deeper look into the matter reveals that there are more reasons why prices of stents in Bangladesh is much higher than in countries such as India and Nepal. Compared to India, the price of stents in Bangladesh is nearly double. A Xience Xpedition stent made by Abbott, a US manufacturer, costs about Tk 47,000 in India and Tk 70,000 in Nepal. But in Bangladesh, its maximum retail price is Tk 125,500 after the hike by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA), up from Tk 108,628. Such massive price differences were found in the case of stents made by other companies as well.\nThe price of stents in Bangladesh is determined as per the markup set by the DGDA's price-fixing committee. The markup was set at 1.42 percent, which includes the taxes and profit margin of the suppliers and the dealers, and also includes an 11.5 percent \"retail commission\" for middlemen. According to a former director of the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, who led the 2017 expert committee for fixing stent prices, it is high time to revisit the markup formula to ensure transparency in the stent supply chain. To start, Bangladesh needs to bargain with foreign companies to get stents at a discounted price \u2013 which foreign stent companies have done for Nepal.\nBut aside from that, prices of cardiac stents would be much lower if suppliers did not need to pay a commission to the physicians, health staffers, and various middlemen. And this is something that needs to be urgently cut out of the equation. According to local suppliers of cardiac medical devices, it is mainly the physicians who are getting a commission of around 20-50 percent from the stent price. In some cases, stent suppliers are also paying other health staffers involved in the process. This is pushing prices up to much greater levels for patients seeking treatment, and is an extremely unethical practice that is literally causing people to die instead of being treated.\nWe are shocked that this is something that the government has not yet addressed. How many people over the years have had to lose their lives so that a few middlemen \u2013 including physicians who are supposed to be saving lives \u2013 could pocket extra profit? The government urgently needs to revisit its stent pricing policy. It needs to bring the cost of cardiac treatment within the reach of ordinary people on an urgent basis.\n",

        "full_article": "The two earthquakes with epicentres close to Dhaka, in a span of 11 days, have certainly caused many citizens to fear what may happen next. And their anxiety is justified as leading experts are also concerned and have given rather ominous indications of the possibility of a major earthquake happening \"anytime\". What they are most worried about is the unbelievable level of unpreparedness for such a petrifying disaster. So why have the authorities not been jolted into action?\nThe Daily Star's report informs us that in the last month we have already had 14 earthquakes within 300 km radius of Dhaka according to the National Center for Seismology of India. Research by experts in Bangladesh has found that these foreshocks could indicate a major earthquake, which would cause the entire capital to crumble. Unplanned urbanisation over the last few decades has led to a chaotic, congested concrete jungle where most of the buildings are not earthquake-proof. A survey by the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) has predicted that around 865,000 buildings may collapse in an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 originating in the fault line in Tangail. The death toll has been estimated to be around 210,000, with 229,000 sustaining injuries if the disaster happens during the daytime. The survey was done between 2018 and 2022.\nWe have very recently seen the horrific consequences of major earthquakes in Turkey and war-torn Syria this February that killed more than 20,000 people. After knowing all this, what have we been doing? The answer is, not enough. It's true the government has carried out risk assessment and mapping for earthquakes in major cities such as Dhaka, Chattogram and Sylhet, as well as set up more earthquake observatories and specialised equipment to detect tremors in vulnerable locations. It has a National Earthquake Contingency Plan that includes anticipating future risks and disaster management after a major earthquake. The government is supposed to have trained 62,000 volunteers.\nThis is all impressive. But the government needs to make sure that in the event of a major earthquake these measures actually work on the ground. Experts have given many recommendations regarding how we should prepare. The overall message is to have extensive awareness and practical training. This includes regular drills in schools, offices, departmental stores, etc., retrofitting risky buildings, enforcing earthquake safety technologies in new buildings and implementing the government's guidelines on how to deal with the aftermath of an earthquake.\nWe must build capacity for prompt response, rescue and evacuation operations and treatment facilities in hospitals. Volunteers need refresher courses. The Fire Service has to be equipped with sophisticated machinery and trained personnel for rescue operations.\nIt is virtually impossible to predict when exactly a major earthquake will occur. The only thing to do is to be as prepared as we can be. The government must now consult with our local and international experts and start implementing a strategy that will work to reduce as many casualties as possible, in the event that the earthquake nightmare comes true.\n",

        "full_article": "If Kalbaishakhi is frightening enough, the accompanying lightning and thunder are now increasingly striking terror in the hearts of people in this part of the world. During April-May the incidence has become particularly higher in recent years. A total of 340 people were fatally struck by lightning during the period. Among these people, 274 including 239 men and 35 women died in lightning strikes during the December-April period, according to the Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum (SSTF) which disclosed the death toll during an awareness programme on May 4.Amid the global weather-related irregularities, nearly 3,000 people in Bangladesh were killed in lightning strikes in the last one decade. The majority of them are farmers. Weathermen have started interpreting an increase in the lightning deaths as a phenomenon linked to climate change. According to climatologists, as carbon emission builds in the earth's atmosphere and average global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of powerful storms increase in the northern Bangladesh, leading to frequent lightning strikes. Unfortunately, Bangladesh is a lightning-prone country. In 2017, Sunamganj district was ranked the most lighting-prone place in the world, thanks to the lightning strikes between March and May that year.The South American county Venezuela is considered the most lightning-prone in the world. Given its status of being a country frequently hit by thunderbolt, Bangladesh should have a vigorous lightning awareness campaign in place. Except periodic government promises of coping with the scourge affecting the rural farming community, effective actions in this regard are yet to be taken. They remain ever elusive. The SSTF has been stressing proper knowledge about it among villagers, especially farmers, for the last four years. The vulnerable people also include the fishing community in rivers and 'haors'. It demands effective and practical steps on the part of the government. The forum puts forward two suggestions: creating lighting awareness among people by including the topic in the school and college-level textbooks; and erecting lightning-resistant towers along with planting tall and fast-growing trees in the fields adjacent to croplands. The death of 66 people and injury to another eight people from lightning strikes between March and May 3 give a clear picture of the pattern of falling victim to these deadly strikes. Fifty-one died while working in the field all alone, 11 people died while on boats or fishing. So, if there was an early warning system to alert people of the coming danger even an hour or two ago, people could avoid such deaths by taking shelter in a safe place. Alongside this, lightning-resistant towers can be installed in the most lightning-prone areas. Already the government has started setting up such intercepting devices called arresters on steel poles 30 feet high, within 300 feet of which man and animal will be safe from lightning strikes. The programme should be extended to all lightning-prone areas within a short time. At the same time, planting trees like palms can be of help. Before all the districts are brought under the programme of intercepting towers, farmers on their own initiative can plant palm trees on the dividing lines of their agricultural plots.",

        "full_article": "The earthquake that the residents of the capital city woke up to on Friday (May 5) morning was of 4.3 magnitude on the Richter scale. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) was the first to detect the seismological activity, its source as well as measured its magnitude. The epicentre of the earthquake was not far from the capital city (at Dohar, which is only 23.4 km to the southwest of Azimpur area of the city) and it originated at a shallow depth of 10 kms below the earth's surface. Seismic events like this are not new in this country. In fact, only 10 days before May 5's tremor, on April 25, Rupganj under Narayanganj district adjacent to Dhaka was the epicentre of another earthquake of similar strength (magnitude 4.0), whose focus was 17 kms below the earth's surface. In recent years, between 2008 and 20012, Dhaka and its surrounding areas including Cumilla and Chandpur were shaken by some six earthquakes of moderate strength. Other quakes that followed had their epicentres in Sylhet, Chattogram and Cox's Bazar. Evidently, the frequency of the earthquakes, especially around Dhaka, is on the rise. The strengths of those earthquakes including the last one as measured on the Richter scale have been of moderate magnitude. And so, as told by some experts on earthquake, there is no reason for alarm. Especially, a Dhaka University teacher, Masud Kamal, who teaches at the Department of Disaster Science and Climate Resilience of the university, is reported to have told the media that the May 5's temblor was part of the process called neotectonics (movement and deformation of Earth's crust). And the tremor might have been caused by the activity of geological fault-lines that change the flow of rivers (in this case, the river Ichamati or any of its branches or canals could be the source). And he further viewed that big earthquakes from such neotectonic activity originating from shallow depths are rare. This is no doubt reassuring for the dwellers of this megacity. In fact, there was also no report of casualty or damage to property following the tremor. However, many residents of the city reported that though the shaking lasted for 10 to 15 seconds, the perception of the jolt with which the tremor ended was anything but mild. What is still concerning is that the epicenters of the mentioned tremors were not very far from the capital city of Dhaka, which is a jungle of concrete with hundreds of thousands of buildings, many of those are high-rise structures. And what send chills down the spine is if the National Building Code (BNBC)-2015, which provides some guidelines for building earthquake-resilient structures, was at all adhered to while constructing those structures. The question arises seeing the poor state of monitoring by the agencies concerned. The helplessness of fire service and civil defence personnel was particularly evident during the recent devastating fires in the city. It was clear that little attention was given to the need for keeping adequate space between the buildings of the shopping complexes for the fire service vehicles and rescue workers to move. And no one noticed it, not even the monitors, to be specific, until the damage was done. One would do well to remember at this point that there is a huge risk of fire during an earthquake in modern cities. The power lines and gas pipes which often make a tangled mess all across the city will be a potential source of fire when buildings would start to collapse.Forecasts abound about how many people may die and get injured if and when such a disaster strikes. But the issue is not just about the numbers. The very prospect of a cataclysm happening in this unplanned urban maze, where around 25,000 people live within an area of one square kilometer, gives one the jitters. But is not such a fear misplaced so far as the earthquakes in question are of moderate magnitude? So, let us see what is a magnitude on Richter scale. It is the largest amplitude of a quake (the wiggle of highest size in the graph representing the quake).But there are also other ways of measuring an earthquake. For instance, there is the so-called, Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MMI), which measures an earthquake in terms of its intensity. Intensity is a concept that is quite different from magnitude. It actually measures the amount of shaking (caused by the earthquake) and the damage caused by it at a particular location. In fact, the closer a place is from the epicentre of an earthquake, the greater its intensity (the amount of shaking) and, hence, the potential for causing damage. Earthquakes of moderate magnitude can be destructive, if they originate from shallow depths and are close to populous human settlements. Seismologists need to do more research in light of this to moderate seismic events as in recent times their frequency around the capital city of Dhaka is seen to be increasing. Worse yet, earthquake experts fear of stronger temblors of magnitude 8.0 or more in Bangladesh. Predictions about the earthquakes are in fact probabilities. It is said that earthquakes may occur at intervals of 200 to 250 years, especially along the fault lines (at locations where there are fractures in the rocks that make Earth's crust).But that does not mean that an earthquake will happen exactly after that time span. In fact, it can happen any time. Therefore, adequate preparations should be afoot to face an earthquake of cataclysmic scale that can strike all of a sudden without prior warning.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Even the eruption of a volcano is detected hours or even days before, leaving enough time for people living in its vicinity under grave threats to move away to a safe place. But a tremor---mild or severe---alerts not even the most sophisticated device man has invented even minutes before the particular area of the planet Erath is in turmoil. It is because of this element of unpredictability, earthquakes are most dreaded and often prove incomparably fatal. Yet there is a gross cycle of quakes, experts in seismology have arrived at on analysis of the phenomenon's incidences in different areas, that it is likely to recur once in 200-250 years. On that count, the two mild quakes felt in Narayanganj on April 25 and Dhaka city on Friday, May 5 last should have completed their rounds. It is because two such earth quakes struck Dhaka and its surrounding in these months way back in 1982. Had it been the case, the inhabitants of the capital and its neighbourhoods would feel free to heave a shy of relief. But instead of assuring that the lurking danger is over, experts warn that the increasing frequency of mild tremors may be a rehearsal of the ominous stage show of the phenomenon. This is scary. Is the ticking bomb waiting to explode any time soon?The pictures of and reports on the devastation wrought by the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Sudan courtesy of electronic and print media were unnerving. Let it be remembered that the area in Turkey affected by the Earth's convulsion is highly quake-prone and the buildings were constructed to withstand quite powerful of its kind. In a few instances where the buildings came badly crumbling, accusing fingers were pointed to violation of specifications in construction. In Dhaka city where violation of building codes is rampant and many tall buildings were constructed well before the authorities came out of their hibernation to make some attempts at enforcing the building codes, the consequences of a powerful quake will be no less an enactment of a doomsday scenario. The old part of Dhaka is likely to be the hotspot of the worst catastrophe. Clearly, the authorities run short of ideas and actions in order to meet the challenges. A series of fires in buildings has woefully exposed the weakness and inadequacy of preparation. Even measures could not be taken to avoid repeat of fire incidents in market buildings vulnerable to fire tragedies let alone the buildings at high risks to quakes. If the mild tremors are a warning of a far greater danger, preparation should be afoot now. First the buildings most vulnerable to quakes must be demolished without any letup and then there has to be various other measures such as retrofitting, if possible, to make buildings a little bit safer. So far as the new construction is concerned, quake-resistant plans and designs have to be followed. If the experts are to be believed, the tall residential buildings in areas where the soil is soft and brittle, even compliance of building codes may not be enough to avoid tragedies if a powerful quake of 7.0-8.0 magnitude strikes. This shows that the expansion of Dhaka on its periphery with housing complexes, particularly in water retention or flood plain zones, has not been well advised. There is need for stopping further such development in the future. This once again brings to the fore the issue of stopping the rural migration to Dhaka. Now comes the issue of rescue operation immediately after a quake. The Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence trained volunteers quite a few years before. Now is the time to go for recruitment of an army of fresh volunteers from among the youths. Then there is a need for conducting drills block-wise in residential areas in order to make people aware of the do's and don'ts in time of a quake.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The incidence of suicide in Bangladesh is on the rise. Those who are attempting or committing suicide are young in age. According to a survey, suicidal tendencies are most common among those aged between 15 and 29. The rise in its incidence among the youths is happening for a number of reasons. Of them, academic pressure is a prominent cause. Many students put some extra pressure on themselves for getting a GPA-5 in public examinations like SSC and HSC. When it does not happen, they try to take their lives. Every year when SSC and HSC exam results are published, we come across a number of such tragic incidents. There are some students who commit suicide after they fail to get admitted to their desired universities. Sometimes, people attempt suicide out of frustration originating from financial crisis and break-ups. The growing tendency to take one's own life across Bangladesh needs immediate attention. Now is the time to raise awareness about suicide prevention. If we want to get rid of the terrible social problems like suicide, we should increase religious and moral practices in the family. Parents should keep watch over when their children are leaving and when they are returning home and what they do in their room. To prevent suicide, every educational institution should have facilities for regular counselling. In every institution, students should be kept busy in various social activities. They should also be informed of the importance of life. Everyone must realise that suicide cannot be a solution to any problem.\nNoor Muhammod Student of Shahjajl University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, [email\u00a0protected]",
