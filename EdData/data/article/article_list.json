The 5.66% retail inflation level recorded in March was last seen in December 2021. That was followed by a sustained spell of high inflation that escalated after the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began in February 2022, and peaked at an eight-year high of 7.8% in April. Including last November and December, March marks only the third occasion in 15 months when inflation was within the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) mandated tolerance range of 2% to 6%. The RBI, which had to send an explanation to the government on why the target was missed for three successive quarters \u2014 for the first time since the inflation targeting framework was introduced \u2014 hit a pause on interest rates this month after a streak of hikes. It now expects inflation to average 5.2% in 2023-24 (lower than the 5.3% it projected in February). As it stands, the average inflation between January and March has turned out to be 6.21%, far higher than the RBI\u2019s February projection of 5.9%. For the full year gone by, inflation averaged 6.66% vis-\u00e0-vis the 6.5% the RBI expected.The central bank and the government may now be sanguine about headline inflation staying below 6%, but that is in no small measure due to the statistical effects of higher numbers from the previous year\u2019s base. In the April to June quarter, the RBI expects inflation to average 5.1%, up from 5% predicted two months ago \u2014 the same quarter had clocked a mean inflation of 7.28% in 2022. While the pace of price rise may slow down, prices are still rising at a fairly significant clip, on top of price hikes effected in the past year. There is no medium-term reversal likely in amounts people shell out for most goods and services, barring seasonally triggered changes in items such as vegetables. In fact, excluding vegetables whose prices have been falling year-on-year since November 2022, the inflation faced by consumers in March was still 6.6%. Imported inflation fell to its lowest level since November 2019 at 2.8%, which means domestic factors are still spurring prices around 6%. Fresh global shocks from oil prices and other unknowns may cause imported inflation to spike again. With cereal, spices and milk prices on the boil and worries about crop losses due to recent unseasonal precipitation (as well as fears of El Ni\u00f1o effects this year), food prices may continue to pinch households. There is no room to let the guard down on inflation, even if propping up growth is the priority. Squeezed consumption is hardly going to inspire investment.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncentral bank\n\n/\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nAgriculture",

        "full_article": "Myanmar\u2019s military did it again. On Tuesday, the junta, notorious for its attacks on civilians, carried out air strikes on an opposition gathering in the rebel-held Sagaing region, killing over 100, including women and children. The National Unity Government (NUG), the parallel administration formed by opposition groups, as well as witnesses, said a fighter jet and a combat helicopter bombed the gathering, which was celebrating the opening of an administrative office of the NUG; the regime, led by Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, calls it a \u201cterrorist entity\u201d. The junta later confirmed the strike, but said most of those killed were resistance fighters. The strikes actually show the junta\u2019s growing vulnerabilities rather than strength in the country\u2019s ongoing civil war. In the past, the main opposition that the military regimes had faced was the non-violent democratic movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. But after the February 2021 coup, which toppled an increasingly popular Ms. Suu Kyi (her National League for Democracy had won back-to-back elections), the country slipped into a civil war between the regime and the NUG. The NUG and its armed wing, the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF), have joined hands with ethnic militias to oust the military. The military has lost swathes of territories, mostly sparsely populated rural and jungle areas. Unable to recapture lost land, it has relied on air strikes to weaken the opposition.The junta faces pressure from the resistance groups, but it still controls most of the country\u2019s population centres. The current approach of the generals is to hold on to territories under their control while continuing to use disproportionate force against opposition fighters and civilians in rebel-held areas. With the tacit support of Russia and China and silence from India, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing does not face any regional pressure either. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had earlier proposed a five-point peace plan, urging an end to hostilities and starting inclusive dialogue. But the generals have refused to talk to the opposition and are not ready to share power. The status quo, however, is unsustainable. Regional powers cannot look away when a thuggish regime keeps killing its people with impunity. A peaceful resolution in Myanmar is essential for the stability of Southeast Asia, and, hence, ASEAN and regional powers such as Russia, China and India should not see the civil strife as an internal problem of Myanmar. They should use their economic and political clout to force the generals to stop the violence and enter into talks with the opposition. The only sustainable, long-term and just solution for Myanmar\u2019s myriad woes is the restoration of its democracy under a federal constitutional order. The first step to achieve this goal is to end the violence.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMyanmar\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\ncivil unrest\n\n/\n\nASEAN",

        "full_article": "Two separate cases in the Supreme Court this week highlighted the abuse of India\u2019s web of preventive detention laws that confer the executive with extraordinary powers. In one case, SC ticked off the UP government for inappropriately invoking the National Security Act in a case with political undertones. In another case (Pramod Singla vs UoI), the bench pointed out that India\u2019s preventive detention laws are a colonial legacy with a potential to be misused.\nPreventive detention laws are used in anticipation of a crime. At the central level, they have existed in different forms from 1950, with the draconian NSA introduced over four decades ago. Between 2017 and 2021, annual detentions under NSA ranged between 483 and 741. Keep in mind that SC has said that laws with arbitrary detention powers must be used only in the rarest of rare cases. Also, since it centres on a potential crime, courts must give every benefit of doubt to the detenu. This cardinal principle is not followed often enough. In the case pertaining to the UP government\u2019s detention under NSA, the detenu was forced to approach SC following a delay in Allahabad HC in deciding his plea.\n\nGoI data shows that in 2021, preventive detention cases increased by almost 24% to 1. 1 lakh. States, which have their own preventive detention laws, are among the worst offenders, no matter which party is in power. Last year, Madras HC criticised the state for indiscriminate use of the Goondas Act to trigger preventive detentions. Given the politicisation of the police, inevitably the abuse of preventive detention laws has political undertones. The colonial legacy of preventive detention laws means they are often used in cases catalysed mainly by political differences.\nThe root of the problem is both the intent and wording of laws which provide a broad reading of circumstances under which constitutional rights can be suppressed. This has been the case since 1950. A recent example is the IT Rules 2021 and its amendments that can open the door to action against views deemed officially \u201cunfavourable\u201d. Given that SC rulings have unambiguously stated that conditions under which a fundamental right can be suppressed have to be narrowly defined, shouldn\u2019t some of the most egregious portions of India\u2019s web of preventive detention laws be read down? As long as they are part of the statute, they are bound to be abused.\n\n",

But with improvements in sanitation, nutrition and healthcare, successive cohorts of children and adolescents have narrowed the rural lag. That\u2019s the glass half full. On the half empty side, children growing up in cities are not showing the expected growth. Interestingly, as a global analysis conducted by Imperial College London, published in Nature, and highlighted by TOI yesterday finds, this is a trend across middle-income countries and emerging economies. They are beginning to mirror high-income countries\u2019 relatively small urban-rural height differentials.\n\nThe cause for worry for India is that the rapid decline in nutritional deficiencies and malnourishment in rural areas is going hand in hand with certain urban environments destroying all benefits of better access to healthcare and education in the city. Indeed, the risks of being either undernourished or obese rise here. Particularly in city slums, children grow up amidst poor sanitation and polluted air and without enough space to play. A 2021 ICMR-INDIAB study indicates that the risks are even higher for rural-urban migrants. Loss of social networks and support in an unfamiliar environment contributes to their low levels of physical activity, worsened by increased intake of junk food.\nLearning the right policy lessons from these findings is critical because going ahead, India shall see more villages urbanise and more villagers migrate to cities. The learnings fall broadly into two categories. We must have planned urbanisation rather than the slummification of rural India. And we must do a lot more consciousness-raising about healthy lifestyles. Better schooling is not more critical to our children\u2019s future than more physical activity and more fruits and vegetables.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The last two years have been exciting for the renewable energy sector, as the energy market turmoil stoked by recent events, like the Russia-Ukraine war, gave an impetus for an accelerated green transition.\nFor example, 2021 saw the largest annual capacity additions worth 175 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic power, bringing the total global solar PV capacity to 942 GW. Developing countries led this rapid transition, with China leading the race by\u00a0adding the highest annual amount of solar power capacity, while India and Brazil ranked among the top five countries.\u00a0\nOur neighbour India has moved ahead with ambitious renewable energy goals. It has targeted to source half of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. The Indian government adopted the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in 2010 with the goal of achieving a projected 20 GW by 2022. However, India accelerated its transition and as of early 2023, the country has already raised its installed solar capacity to 64 GW. In short, India surpassed and upgraded its renewable energy ambitions in the last one decade. Not only India, but the world is also headed towards renewables. Since 2013, renewables are surpassing conventional power generation in terms of new capacity additions. In 2022, renewables formed 84 percent of all new power plants.\n\nBangladesh's existing natural gas reserves are inadequate for meeting the estimated growth in energy needs given the expected GDP growth in the coming decades.\nBangladesh, which is graduating to the status of a developing country, must take note of the recent progress by other countries and revisit its own progress and vision for renewable energy deployment. The country has demonstrated its ability to bring transformative changes by enhancing overall power generation capacity and ensuring access to power for the entire population. The energy mix, however, remains heavily dominated by fossil fuels.\u00a0\nBangladesh's renewable energy policy of 2008 set the goal of 10 percent total electricity generation from renewable sources by 2020. However as of 2022, we have managed to get only three percent of the power from renewable energy sources, including off-grid solar home systems. This is unsustainable in the coming years due to several factors.\nThe nation's existing natural gas reserves are inadequate for meeting the estimated growth in energy needs given the expected GDP growth in the coming decades. Import of fossil fuels like liquefied natural gas has been increasing, but LNG bought in the international spot market can be costly, owing to its fluctuating price and growing competition from importers like Europe and other Asian countries.\u00a0\nIn 2021, the government took the commendable step of canceling 10 coal power plants that were under consideration, which were meant to run on imported coal. Expanding domestic coal extraction is not viable due to social considerations. According to the draft integrated energy and power master plan (IEPMP) being prepared by the government, coal plants under construction may increase the share of coal in the energy mix in the near-term, but eventually coal's share will be cut back. Even with ultra-super critical technology, coal remains a high-emission option that cannot be adopted as the main source of energy.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether it comes to LNG or imported coal, recent events in the last two years, such as the depreciation of Taka against US dollar and price fluctuations in international energy market illustrate the risks of inflation and debt burden that a heavily import-dependent energy mix poses for Bangladesh. This led to a situation where despite having a surplus installed power generation capacity, we could not supply electricity, as we were unable to buy fuel at a high price. In 2021, Bangladesh has provided subsidies of around USD seven billion to the energy sector, which is around six percent of the country's GDP (IEA, 2023).\nYet, Bangladesh made its mark in spearheading climate action among developing countries. The country has pledged to increase the share of renewable energy under the Paris climate agreement. The government has also approved the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan in February 2023, that vows to take mitigation measures. Bangladesh could realise its vision for sustainability by making a timely shift to renewable energy without undue delay.\u00a0\nFor a green energy transition, Bangladesh needs ambitious goals and smart strategies. The IEPMP makes some affirmative assertions about promoting clean energy in Bangladesh and brings the target of 40 percent clean energy by 2041 to the forefront. But actual targets about attaining renewables remain vague. The plan names hydrogen or ammonia as potential clean energy sources, but these technologies still remain unproven.\u00a0\nSolar and wind are proven as high-potential renewable energy sources for Bangladesh. There are varying estimates of potential solar power generation, but setting up solar panels in industrial rooftops and fallow and unused land could enable us to generate more than 20,000 MW of solar power without harming agricultural production. Moreover, after years, Bangladesh has finally started to build wind energy plants. A 60 MW wind park at Cox's Bazar is expected to connect to the grid by the second half of this year and construction of another 55 MW wind park is expected to start soon at Mongla. Bangladesh has also started a feasibility study for exploring the potential of offshore wind energy. The demonstration of success with the initial wind projects could open the door for considerable expansion of wind energy capacity.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs practitioners, we recognise that renewable energy sources available in Bangladesh have high variability in relation to base load. However, such shortcomings of renewables are being increasingly mitigated by up-and-coming, increasingly affordable technology solutions. The concerns about limited availability of sunlight for a few hours of the day could be addressed by better storage technology, an area that merits more policy attention.\u00a0\nWe have proven that with the right vision and political will, we can bring transformative change in our development scenarios, including in the power sector. Now we need to have a strong commitment to make a decisive shift to renewable energy - in line with the global trend on evidence-based analysis and prudent, coordinated implementation.\u00a0\nShahriar Ahmed Chowdhury is the director of Centre for Energy Research at United International University (UIU). \u00a0\n\n",

It is much more than that. It is an idea that brings a renewed awareness of what we are, what we used to be, and what we can achieve if we start together. It gives us a chance to renew our commitment to our collective wellbeing. Bangladesh, in the past year, has seen much suffering thanks to the combined fallout of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. It has also seen deep divisions along religious and political lines threatening to rip apart the very fabric of our society. These issues may continue to trouble us for a while more. But as we have seen many times in the past, when faced with apparently insurmountable challenges, we as a nation are capable of doing what's necessary to overcome them.\nRight now, what we need more than anything else is unity, despite all our differences. Pahela Baishakh, which, unlike any Eid or Puja, comes without a religious tag, teaches unity through diversity. Its secular message guides us to find common ground so we can live with some degree of respect for each other and work together for the greater good. On this day, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and people of other faiths come out in unison celebrating their common ancestral roots. Meanwhile, Mangal Shobhajatra and other festivals serve as a call for peace, harmony and good tidings. All this can strengthen and reaffirm the bond shared by all of us, regardless of what faith or community we come from. As a symbol of resistance against intolerance, bigotry and communal hatred, the celebration of Pahela Baishakh has become all the more significant in our present climate.\nSo let us all join together to bid farewell to 1429 and welcome 1430, wherever we may be and in whatever manner we feel comfortable. Let us focus on our strengths and utilise them, while trying to minimise our weaknesses and differences. Let us strive together to take our nation to greater heights.

We welcome the familiar sights and sounds of festivities at the historic Ramna Batamul, and elsewhere in the country, and hope that the pluralistic spirit that these represent will endure and carry us through to a better future.\nPahela Baishakh is not just an occasion to rejoice. It is much more than that. It is an idea that brings a renewed awareness of what we are, what we used to be, and what we can achieve if we start together. It gives us a chance to renew our commitment to our collective wellbeing. Bangladesh, in the past year, has seen much suffering thanks to the combined fallout of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. It has also seen deep divisions along religious and political lines threatening to rip apart the very fabric of our society. These issues may continue to trouble us for a while more. But as we have seen many times in the past, when faced with apparently insurmountable challenges, we as a nation are capable of doing what's necessary to overcome them.\nRight now, what we need more than anything else is unity, despite all our differences. Pahela Baishakh, which, unlike any Eid or Puja, comes without a religious tag, teaches unity through diversity. Its secular message guides us to find common ground so we can live with some degree of respect for each other and work together for the greater good. On this day, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and people of other faiths come out in unison celebrating their common ancestral roots. Meanwhile, Mangal Shobhajatra and other festivals serve as a call for peace, harmony and good tidings. All this can strengthen and reaffirm the bond shared by all of us, regardless of what faith or community we come from. As a symbol of resistance against intolerance, bigotry and communal hatred, the celebration of Pahela Baishakh has become all the more significant in our present climate.\nSo let us all join together to bid farewell to 1429 and welcome 1430, wherever we may be and in whatever manner we feel comfortable. Let us focus on our strengths and utilise them, while trying to minimise our weaknesses and differences. Let us strive together to take our nation to greater heights. This should be our goal going forward.\nWe wish our readers and patrons Shubho Noboborsho!\n",
