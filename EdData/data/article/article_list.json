Personality clashes and the sectional interests of leaders and outfits are also at play in the State, that has seen considerable political churn since the last Assembly election five years ago. Key political actors are trying to make sense of the new landscape and shape it to their advantage, as was evident at The Hindu\u2019s conclave in Mumbai that brought them all together this week. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are concentrating on national topics, the regional parties, particularly the two factions of the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party, are more focused on regional issues. In a speech on Friday (November 8, 2024), Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised Kashmir, accusing the Congress of echoing Pakistan\u2019s view. He said the Congress, which has the demand for a nationwide caste census as a central piece of its current politics, was creating a caste division. There is competitive welfarism at play between the ruling Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has alleged that the BJP was undermining the State\u2019s interests in development projects and private investments.The MVA\u2019s gains in the 2024 general election were largely based on a national narrative such as protecting caste-based reservation and the Constitution. The Assembly election involves contests in 288 seats, and the BJP-led Mahayuti has the advantage of a national narrative and the capacity to organise ground campaigning. Caste dynamics also could play out differently. The MVA is seen as a Maratha-dominated platform, while the BJP has room for accommodating a wider coalition of communities. All parties are invoking Shahu Maharaj, Jyotiba Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar, iconic figures revered in Maharashtra, but with their individual twists. The BJP\u2019s campaign touches on caste justice by subtly challenging Maratha dominance and loudly proclaiming Hindu unity. The party is fielding Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as a star campaigner, while its partner Ajit Pawar has declared fealty to secularism as a guiding principle. Appeals to regionalism are a double-edged sword as Maharashtra is home to migrant populations from several States. The changing demography could reshape the politics of Maharashtra in the decades ahead. The polity is fragmented across six major parties in the two opposing coalitions. Additionally, numerous rebel candidates of all parties are in the fray. The ongoing campaign is a reflection of confusion and contradictions; the results may begin to settle the churn.

        "full_article": "Myths cherished by America\u2019s right & left explain its politics\nThe election is definitively won, but the nation feels itself tearing at the seams. Rift between Red and Blue America, between the right and left, seems impassable. A Great Disorder: National Myth and the Battle for America by Richard Slotkin analyses this bitter culture war by tracing the stories that are meaningful to each political tribe. Right and left don\u2019t just clash over abortion or gun control. In fact, these issues are rooted in different foundational beliefs about the country, and what patriotism means.\nWhat are these myths, which have been overlaid with new meanings through decades of political change? Conservative Americans make much of the myth of the frontier: Idea of a white America that restlessly travels forth, expanding its territory and economy, exploiting resources, subjugating racial others who stand in its way.\nThe civil war can be seen either as American idealism to abolish slavery, as federal govt bringing about emancipation, or as the longstanding myth of the \u2018lost cause\u2019 that sold out white interests. The myth of America\u2019s founding is one of revolutionary violence for the sake of independence, and of intelligent, virtuous \u2018founding fathers\u2019 of European descent. The myth of the \u2018good war\u2019 is about America as a defender of freedoms everywhere in the world.\nLiberals also seize this \u2018good war\u2019 myth, as shown in countless military platoon movies, but in a way that showcases plural, racially integrated America. Wartime celebration of an America united across races and ethnicities spurred wider acceptance of the civil rights movement. It has endured from World War II to the war on terror, justifying American interventions in global conflicts.\nToday, Maga warriors play on all these myths, as they mix American exceptionalism and Christian nationalism. This American form of fascism is less Nazi, and more Confederate South, the book argues. The myths of frontier and lost cause can be clearly spotted in Maga mobilisations of \u2018real Americans\u2019 against racial others or a corrupt federal govt or \u2018woke\u2019 initiatives like critical race theory.\nMeanwhile, the liberal/progressive side does not have such a clear set of myths that connect the past to the present. Their cherished stories have been about FDR\u2019s New Deal or the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Biden-Harris Democrats tried to strum both these chords, stressing on infra projects and issues of race, gender and sexuality.\nAll of these stories are selective retellings of the past, and they serve different political visions. Restless pushing of the frontier, with white settlers subduing indigenous tribes, has been cast in a romantic light, as all-American grit. George Bush\u2019s global war on terror relied on this trope.\nThese scripts inform political themes. For instance, gun-control emotions are clearly shaped by the founding myth of a rightful insurrection against an oppressive govt. The left casts nonviolent civil rights movements as liberation, the right sees them as cause of a national degeneration.\nMany of the old myths of the frontier or the lost cause come from a troubled, bloody past that lets slavery be seen as freedom, dispossession as progress, and hatred as heritage. These stories cannot provide common ground for a diverse nation, the book points out. To address the dysfunction of American politics, or continue to be coherent as a nation, it is necessary to reconcile these mythologies, or reform and revise them.\n\n",

        "full_article": "When people say \u201cbanana republic,\u201d they\u2019re talking about a country where the government is very weak, and big companies (sometimes foreign ones) have too much control. This term comes from the past when a few wealthy people in power worked with fruit companies to make money, often ignoring what was good for everyone else.\nCan Bans Really Stop People?\nGovernments sometimes ban books, movies, and ideas to stop people from seeing or hearing things that are controversial or that challenge their beliefs. But banning something often has the opposite effect! When a book or movie is banned, people get curious and want to see it even more. It\u2019s like telling someone not to press a button\u2014it makes them want to press it!\nA Famous Book Ban\nIn India, there was a book by Salman Rushdie called *The Satanic Verses* that got banned in 1988. The government didn\u2019t want people reading it because they thought it could be offensive. But now, so many years later, the courts couldn\u2019t even find the official document explaining why it was banned in the first place! This shows how sometimes bans don\u2019t last or get lost in government paperwork.\nBans as \u201cFree Advertising\u201d\nIn fact, bans often act like free advertising. When a book or movie is banned, it gets a lot of attention, making even more people curious about it. For example, a movie called *Padmaavat* faced a lot of controversy, but all the drama around it made more people want to watch it! It\u2019s like when a new toy is super popular\u2014people want it even more when they can\u2019t get it easily.\nHidden Desires\nThe famous psychologist Sigmund Freud once said that people sometimes want something more when it\u2019s forbidden. This is like when you\u2019re told you can\u2019t have dessert, and that just makes you want it even more! Governments banning things don\u2019t stop people; they just make them want those things even more.\nThe Lesson We Keep Forgetting\nDespite how many times this has happened, we humans keep forgetting that banning things doesn\u2019t make them disappear. Throughout history, bans haven\u2019t erased ideas or stopped people from being interested in \u201cforbidden\u201d topics. The things that people really want tend to stick around, no matter what. So while governments and leaders might try to control ideas, people will always find ways to explore what they\u2019re curious about!\n\n",

        "full_article": "People will always find ways to find what they desire\nI know what a ghost is, said an old woman in The Satanic Verses. Unfinished business, that\u2019s what. But in the case of India\u2019s 1988 ban of this Rushdie novel, has the ghost now been successfully exorcised? With govt respondents unable to produce a copy of the relevant notification, Delhi HC this week had \u201cno other option except to presume that no such notification exists.\u201d A book ban is just one of countless things that get lost in the dingy cobwebs of bureaucracy. But even when proof of a ban is available, a govt ban is an illusion \u2013 for govts. Anyone who\u00a0 really wants to read a banned book, finds a copy. Also, bans are free advertising. Those fatwa years were excellent for growing Rushdie\u2019s readership. Films subjected to a censorship controversy, be it a glammed up Padmaavat or a gritty Udta Punjab, often end up gaining eyeballs from the noise.\nThe illusion that bans work has played out since ancient times, and across geographies. Caesar went as far as to exile Ovid after the publication of Ars Amatoria. But the poem got readership, and its subject \u2013 adultery \u2013 never lost attraction. In India adultery got decriminalised just a few years ago. But all\u00a0 literature indicates that its practice has flourished across time and regimes here as much as in Rome.\nFreud, who talked a lot of silly things, got this right. Self-proclaimed guardians of the \u2018forbidden\u2019 don\u2019t realise that their bans often make humans discover their hidden desires. But since we are humans, we are incapable of learning this simple thing about us. Thus it is that the outrage industry is no longer just public sector. It\u2019s also private enterprise. And all of it\u2019s a waste of energy. Every fatwa ultimately meets history\u2019s dustbin.\n\n",

Our endless festival calendar seems matched by our election calendar. At least we get to party during festivals. Poll-time, only parties party. And, boy, are those parties noisy. In a tightly knit always-online world, one fractious like rarely before, with ideologies morphing in ever new ways, it\u2019s little wonder there\u2019s a storm over every chai. And blaring TV news doesn\u2019t help \u2013 everything\u2019s a fight, every neta\u2019s slamming another neta. So, are there too many elections?\nFact is, the election calendar has barely moved. Like clockwork, in any democracy worth its name, elections transfer office from one govt to another. In India, the\u00a0 number of elections has increased only incrementally the last 25 years, with three new states \u2013 Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. Why then this fatigue, this sense of an always-on election? It\u2019s not their number really, but more the heat & noise elections generate, outsized spending from secret coffers that create this impression. In India, even municipal polls are seeing party brass campaign, making local elections as torrid as state and general elections. Should we crib? Sure we should. But let\u2019s not diss elections. Let\u2019s recognise it\u2019s really the cacophony we dread. Sometimes, there\u2019re even Afterparties. They drag on \u2013 whether a Jan 6 insurrection there or a Maharashtra chaos here.

        "full_article": "A recent study by British Council, conducted before Bangladesh's 12th parliamentary election, has revealed a concerning trend: that 55 percent of our youth want to move abroad due to unemployment, corruption, as well as various discriminatory and authoritarian practices. This reflects the deep frustration that has taken root in society over the years. For too long, young people have had to contend with obstacles in government hiring, insufficient jobs for an ever-growing pool of graduates, and limited politico-economic opportunities, all coalescing to create a suffocating environment for them. This eventually boiled over during the 2024 quota reform movement, leading to the ouster of the Awami League regime.\nThe survey, held among individuals aged 18 to 35 across diverse backgrounds, found that 37 percent identified corruption and nepotism as the primary causes of unemployment, while 20 percent pointed to discrimination in hiring practices. Another notable, if unsurprising, finding is that 72 percent were eager to vote in the January 7 election, before the autocratic regime again deprived them of this basic right. The cumulative effect of these grievances very much remains, even after the political changeover on August 5, pushing many to continue seeking opportunities abroad. Despair and desperation still accompany many who have seen their aspirations come unstuck.\nReversing this trend and engaging our young workforce in rebuilding the nation stands as a formidable challenge for the interim government. It, therefore, must give them hope by generating more jobs and creating an ecosystem that rewards merit, hard work, innovation and entrepreneurship. Moreover, the government must undertake reforms in key institutions to serve greater public interests. In the survey, the top priority identified by young respondents was education reform. In that respect, modernising our education system by making it more skills-based and market-oriented remains a priority. Corruption, too, must be uprooted across all sectors. Furthermore, an environment must be established where people, regardless of social class, religion, or ethnicity, can voice their opinions freely and without fear.\nThe government has initiated its state reform agenda by setting up various commissions for various sectors. We hope these commissions can operate independently, without interference from vested interests. Only through genuine political and institutional reforms can we empower our youth and inspire them to contribute to the nation's progress. This is crucial to fulfil the promise of a brighter, more equitable future for Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "Acclaimed Palestinian writer Adania Shibli's novel\u00a0Minor Detail\u00a0was selected for the LiBeraturpreis Prize 2023 by German literary organisation LitProm. Based partially on historical facts, the book recounts the rape and murder of a Palestinian girl in 1949 by Israeli soldiers, who were later convicted of murder (but not rape) by an Israeli court. Originally, the award ceremony at the Frankfurt Book Fair had been announced for October 20, 2023. A few days before the scheduled date, LitProm cancelled the ceremony in response to protests by German journalists who said the novel expressed antisemitic attitudes. The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas was also mentioned as another reason for the cancellation, although the writer had nothing to do with Hamas or its actions.\nShibli, who has a PhD from the University of East London, lives in Jerusalem and Berlin, speaks Arabic, English, Hebrew, French, Korean and German, has taught at the University of Nottingham, and has never supported violence. Despite her international reputation, recognition, and widespread support from more than 1,000 high-profile writers, including Nobel laureates, LitProm could not appear to support antisemitism. The slightest hint of doing such a thing is an absolute no-no in the West, regardless of the prevailing political, social or cultural scene. We must see the outcome of the US election through this lens. The winner in the race for the White House is now already known, but that has nothing to do with the US policy towards the decades-old Israel-Palestine conflict.\nLet's revisit the genesis of the current situation. Part of the broader Middle East crisis, last year's escalation started when Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, involving a rocket barrage and a few thousand militants breaching the Gaza\u2013Israel border, attacking Israeli civilian communities and military bases. Israel retaliated with ultimate lethal force. Its sophisticated military machine, aided by the most advanced weaponry, unleashed a brutal terror campaign of indiscriminate killing in Gaza.\nWhile continuing its support for Israel's right to act in self-defence, Washington has been mediating peace talks and proposing ceasefires. For instance, in May 2024, President Joe Biden announced a three-phase plan aimed at ending the conflict, which included a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of hostages. The US also urged the UN Security Council to support this plan. However, such efforts have faced significant challenges. Negotiations have been stalled, and the warring parties are unwilling to withdraw from their demands. Hamas has demanded a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel insists on maintaining control over parts of the territory. Notwithstanding Washington's efforts to find a peaceful resolution, its iron-clad commitment to Israel's security and the continued supply of weapons question its sincerity.\nThe irony of history is stark in this conflict. For a thousand years, Jews were oppressed by Christian ruling powers across Europe, culminating in the Holocaust, perhaps the largest recorded genocide in human history. On the other hand, Arab Muslim rulers in Iberia and Africa were relatively more tolerant of the Jews, often appointing them to high government positions. Today, the roles have reversed, with Jews as the oppressors and the Arabs as the oppressed.\nRegardless of the election outcome, the US policy will almost certainly remain the same: to support and arm Israel while largely ignoring the Palestinians' plight. Too many people benefit from this conflict, making it difficult to stop the war. We must also note that it was Israel who had long nurtured Hamas to counter the moderate and secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hardline government need a war to remain in power. Hamas benefits from violence as it can appear to be the saviour of the Palestinians. The US government can't afford to lose the Israeli lobby's support. Powerful defence contractors in the US must continue the highly profitable war. No one in the region has the military might to match Israel's, and perhaps most crucially, the West's collective sense of guilt for the many centuries of dehumanising the Jewish people forces them to blindly support Israel.\nAdania Shibli's work often highlights the everyday realities and struggles of Palestinians under Israeli occupation. In\u00a0Minor Detail, she poignantly captures this sentiment, \"By the way, I hope I didn't cause any awkwardness when I mentioned the incident with the soldier, or the checkpoint, or when I reveal that we are living under occupation here.\" This quote underscores the daily hardships and emotional toll of living under occupation. Oppression and the constant presence of occupation in the lives of Palestinians are now normalised, leading to an immeasurable human cost.\nWill Trump's second term be able to change it?

        "full_article": "What prompted the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) to undertake the Karnaphuli tunnel project?\nThe Karnaphuli tunnel project was, frankly, a decision taken on a whim. The bridges authority moved forward without a proper feasibility study. We already had a bridge over the Karnaphuli River\u2014the Shah Amanat Bridge\u2014so the argument was that a second bridge would create congestion and disrupt the river flow due to the gathering of silt around bridge pillars. Thus, the decision to build a tunnel was made to avoid these issues, with much hype about it being South Asia's first underwater tunnel. But the decision wasn't well-thought-out or technically sound. The ambition of being the first at something outshined the need for the conversation about feasibility.\nWhy do you think there are challenges in bridge construction in Bangladesh?\nBangladesh has yet to master modern bridge construction. Most of our bridges are built with short spans and many pillars, which isn't ideal. This results in structures that interfere with river navigation, especially as vessel sizes and river traffic increase. In countries like Vietnam, bridges are constructed with spans exceeding a kilometre. Here, however, even major bridges like the Padma and Jamuna bridges have spans of only 150 to 200 metres. This limits clearance, hinders river traffic, and reflects the outdated design. It's almost impossible to call these structures \"modern bridges\" in the 21st century.\nWhat are the specific advantages of bridges over tunnels in a river environment like the Karnaphuli?\n\nBridges are advantageous because they use natural elements, making them more sustainable and easier to maintain. For example, a bridge benefits from natural ventilation, sunlight, and rain drainage, reducing the need for energy-intensive maintenance. If a bridge gets wet, rainwater drains off naturally, while exhaust disperses into the open air. Tunnels, however, require constant maintenance for ventilation systems, lighting, drainage, and emergency firefighting equipment, among other things, which is also costly. Essentially, a tunnel is on life support from day one. The need for artificial lighting, ventilation, and drainage makes it far more resource-intensive than a bridge.\nWhen tunnels were built in the past, there was less emphasis on sustainable development, but that has changed. Now, everyone is focused on green development with minimal carbon footprints. The Karnaphuli tunnel, however, runs contrary to this goal, which is why it's so costly and difficult to maintain. In fact, its operation is causing us a daily loss of Tk 27 lakh. It is akin to being a \"white elephant\" for the country.\nWas there sufficient planning for the tunnel's long-term maintenance and revenue generation?\nNo. A tunnel requires continuous ventilation, lighting, and firefighting measures. Moreover, the revenue potential is limited due to certain vehicle restrictions. For example, vehicles carrying hazardous materials or those powered by CNG are not allowed to enter, which narrows its use. This decision makes the tunnel less accessible, which impacts revenue.\nOn top of this, toll rates for the tunnel are much higher than those for the Shah Amanat Bridge, which deters many vehicles, particularly commercial ones, from using it. Private cars, which don't generate substantial revenue, may still use it, but commercial vehicles will seek cheaper alternatives. This combination of high maintenance and limited revenue doesn't bode well for the tunnel's future.\nWhy are bridges considered more efficient for revenue collection, and how does the Karnaphuli tunnel fare in comparison?\n\nTypically, tolls from commercial vehicles like buses and trucks drive revenue for infrastructure projects like this. These vehicles prefer routes that are both affordable and accessible. Here, the high toll and restrictions on certain vehicle types reduce the tunnel's attractiveness and revenue potential. Since it was costly to construct and is expensive to maintain, the toll rate is considerably high\u2014up to five times more than other options. But with a cheaper, parallel alternative, many commercial vehicles will likely avoid the tunnel, which further reduces its revenue-earning.\nWas there any oversight of the planning and feasibility studies for this project?\nThere appears to have been limited accountability in the project's planning stages. Those conducting the feasibility study approached it as a formality. A consulting company was hired, but the process was minimal. Consequently, the projected traffic figures fell far short of reality. Since the consultants are third-party contractors, they simply completed the report, collected their fee, and left. Neither the BBA nor the consultancy firm is being held accountable for this shortfall, despite the substantial use of public funds. Ideally, action should be taken against these lapses to ensure better practices in the future.\nWas the idea of building a \"twin city\" around the tunnel realistically considered?\n\nThe notion that this tunnel would enable a \"twin city\" across the river is overly simplistic. We have seen no such development even with long-established bridges, such as the Jamuna Bridge. In other countries, twin cities are built around integrated road networks and thoughtfully planned infrastructure on both riverbanks. Creating a twin city requires much more than just building a tunnel or bridge; it demands accessible transport systems for all types of vehicles, including pedestrians, cyclists, and local modes of transport.\nHowever, such plans need close collaboration between the BBA and the Chattogram Development Authority to create cohesive urban development. This coordination is absent, and without it, the idea of a twin city remains just a vision.\nWhat further planning and coordination issues have you observed in the tunnel project, and what could be improved in future projects?\nThere were various critical oversights in planning this project. For one, the bridge authority doesn't have a dedicated planning or research department, so they have always relied on external consultants rather than building internal expertise. It also treats these infrastructure projects as isolated tasks rather than as part of a larger transportation network. For instance, even when a bridge or tunnel is completed, the approach roads are often still under construction, which makes them inefficient. Ideally, approach and exit roads should be part of the planning from the beginning, with consideration given to traffic flow, multiple access points, and connections with other transport systems. For future projects, Bangladesh needs to consider sustainable, long-term solutions that integrate bridges or tunnels with other infrastructure. This may mean consulting international experts in infrastructure planning or sustainable development. As a small, densely populated country, Bangladesh has limited resources and land, so every development must be three times more efficient and carefully planned. Sustainable development should be the guiding principle.\n",
