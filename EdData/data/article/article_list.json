The police and authorities in Srinagar and New Delhi remain tight-lipped about the incidents. It is evident that the perpetrators intended to spread maximum terror among the Hindus in the area. They barged into houses on January 1 and fired indiscriminately, killing four civilians and injuring 10 others. Just within 15 hours, an improvised explosive device went off outside the house of one of the victims, leaving two minors dead and five others injured. The Jammu region has been relatively insulated from the conflict in recent years, but the recent incidents portend the return of a grim past. Rajouri had turned peaceful, and the last major targeting of Hindus was 16 years ago. It has a long penetrable Line of Control with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and remained an active route for militants to cross over to the Kashmir Valley. In 2022, there were clear signs that the district was becoming a new theatre of violence, with at least four grenade attacks, and multiple encounters between security forces and militants. There were also indications of local involvement.J&K parties in one voice condemned the attack on minorities and targeted the Lieutenant Governor (LG)\u2019s administration for its failure to secure civilians. LG Manoj Sinha has promised strict action to curb terrorism and address the security needs of the region. There is fresh demand to revive Village Defence Committees, which were constituted in 1995 in 10 districts of the Jammu region to fight militants in remote places where security presence is thin. These were disbanded following allegations of high-handedness by armed volunteers. While the Centre is eager to portray its strong-arm policy in Kashmir that has shunned political dialogue as a success, new trends in terrorism, including frequent targeting of migrant workers in the Union Territory, act as grim reminders of the volatility. At least 29 civilians were killed in J&K in 2022, most of them migrant workers or local Hindus. While new experiments may yield different results in J&K, the old approach to allow multiple processes of engagement to address issues in a democratic way might still work. In the absence of an elected government in J&K since 2018, even the mainstream of the region is drifting away from New Delhi. A continuing political process is not a sufficient guarantee against Pakistan-backed terrorism, but it is a necessary condition in any resolution of the Kashmir conflict.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\nterrorism (crime)",

The Kremlin\u2019s version is that it ordered the ceasefire, from Friday noon till Saturday midnight, as Orthodox Christians in both countries celebrate Christmas on January 7. Ukraine has questioned Russia\u2019s sincerity, saying the Kremlin would use the pause in fighting to replenish and rearm its forces and move more soldiers to the line of contact. Yet, if observed by both sides, this would be the first ceasefire on the entire front line since the war began on February 24 last year. Mr. Putin\u2019s move appears more like a sign of weakness than any serious push for peace. On New Year\u2019s day, Russia lost at least 89 soldiers when Ukraine targeted the eastern city of Makiivka where hundreds of troops were temporarily stationed. In Bakhmut, the eastern city that has been under attack for six months, Ukraine says its troops pushed back the Russians.Russia, which made some territorial gains in the early phase of the war, has been struggling to build battlefield momentum ever since Ukraine, armed and bankrolled by the collective West, started its counter-offensive in late August. Ukraine recaptured swathes of territories from Russia, including much of the Kharkiv Oblast in the north-east and Kherson city in the south. Faced with battlefield setbacks, Gen. Sergey Surovikin, the new commander for the war, changed strategy \u2014 he redirected the offensive focus towards Donetsk, started building stronger defence lines across the vast front line, and launched a heavy bombardment campaign targeting Ukraine\u2019s critical energy infrastructure. The air strikes have partially damaged Ukraine\u2019s energy grid and disrupted power and water supplies to millions, but they have not changed the ground reality. If Ukraine survives winter, fighting could pick up pace. The U.S. and Germany have already announced that they would send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. The U.S., France and Germany would also be sending armoured vehicles, to better prepare Kyiv for the coming land war. Cornered in the war theatre, Mr. Putin might come under enhanced pressure to escalate the conflict. But continuing this war will be costly for all sides. If the ceasefire holds for 36 hours, Mr. Putin should extend it further and seek dialogue, without preconditions, with both Ukraine and its backers in the West. The temporary truce should be the beginning of a lasting one.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUkraine\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

After the Uttarakhand high court directed Railways, which claimed the land, and the state to use the paramilitary forces to evict families, the Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the order. The underlying issues have a long history of jurisprudence, with the SC\u2019s landmark 1985 judgment in the Olga Tellis case providing guidelines. In that case, while SC said that encroachment cannot be automatically legalised, the right to livelihood imposes checks against arbitrariness in evictions.\nLivelihood lies at the heart of encroachments or slums. Census 2011 said 13.7 million urban households were in slums, with as many as 41.3% households in Greater Mumbai in that category. Slum dwellers are intrinsic to the economic life of urban areas. To illustrate, 70.2% of slum households are owned, a percentage point higher than urban average. It\u2019s a proxy indicator of two aspects. Slum dwellers have livelihoods and aspirations like the middle class. Also, some government bodies formally recognise claims and provide paperwork. Given this context, the core question is why are there slums when their residents are integral to the urban economic landscape?\nThe answer to that lies in the failure of urban planning and governance, especially the master plans that become irrelevant soon after they are accepted. Urban planners and the attendant governance framework are out of sync with the speed with which urban economies evolve. One of the symptoms of this failure is slums. As India\u2019s jurisprudence has spelt out, occupation doesn\u2019t mean ownership. However, the livelihood factor comes into play here mainly because of state failure in providing pathways to a better life in cities, which are India\u2019s growth engines.\n\n",

After the Indian women peacekeeping force left, Liberian women made up 17% of the country\u2019s security sector, up from 6% before their arrival. Scholarship has established that when women make decisions, the risks of war and conflict reduce. But women\u2019s role in conflict resolution and stability is only lately being acknowledged and boosted. And there\u2019s a long way to go.\nAs of 2020, out of 95,000 UN peacekeepers, women made up only 4.8% of military contingents and 10.9% of police units. A Swedish study found that civil society groups including women\u2019s organisations make a peace agreement about 64% less likely to fail. And when women participate in peace processes, the agreement is 35% more likely to last at least 15 years.\nWomen face the worst brunt of war, in terms of sexual violence and abuse as well as displacement. To see fellow women in authority can encourage women to reclaim public life without fear. The same lesson holds for India at home. Women will be safer if there are many more women in all ranks in various government branches, including police.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are concerned for the thousands of farmers who depend on the flow of water in the Teesta River for their livelihoods. Only a couple of weeks ago, farmers could rely on the Teesta's water flow for their farming activities. Now, however, as this newspaper reported on Friday, the mighty waterbody has completely dried up in many places of Lalmonirhat. As a consequence, many farmers in different char areas of the district, who cultivate various crops on the sandy char lands, are being compelled to use diesel-run shallow machines to irrigate their croplands. This, of course, is pushing up the production costs of farmers who can afford to set up such machines, while others do not even have that luxury, making farming impossible for them.\u00a0\nAccording to the Lalmonirhat Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) deputy director, about 20,000 farmers in different upazilas are growing various crops on vast char areas along the Teesta and Dharla rivers. These farmers have managed to change their fates by growing potatoes, maize, pumpkins, and other crops on sandy land. This crop production would cost little if there was enough water flow in the Teesta river. The flow, however, is not enough because the riverbed is full of silt, and it seems the river has been divided into five or six narrow channels.\u00a0\nLalmonirhat's Patgram Upazilla is the entry point of the Teesta into Bangladesh. But India has built an irrigation barrage at the Indian side of the Teesta, specifically the Malbazar Town in Jalpaiguri. The Teesta Barrage, unfortunately, is working as a blockade and diverting the water. As a result, the Bangladeshi portion of the river tends to dry up. Authorities from India and Bangladesh have held talks about the river situation with practically no results. The drying up has been so severe that farmers are cultivating pumpkins in the dried-up land. As an additional concern, the natural biodiversity and the ecosystem of the area are also at risk.\u00a0\nGiven the circumstances, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is for Bangladesh to find a sustainable solution to the long-drawn-out Teesta water sharing saga with India. Despite decades of negotiations and numerous promises from our Indian partners, the Teesta water sharing agreement between Bangladesh and India is nowhere near being settled. We understand the primary reason for this has been the complex domestic politics in India. However, Bangladesh cannot be its victim forever and watch its farmers continue to lose their livelihoods because of it for decades on end.\n",

        "full_article": "We are worried about the increase in fertility rates in urban areas of the country, as highlighted in a recent survey by the National Institute of Population Research and Training (NIPORT). According to the survey, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), or the number of births per woman, in urban areas increased from 2.01 percent in 2013 to 2.14 percent in 2021, and in non-slum areas, from 1.74 to 1.91 during the same period. Semi-urban areas also saw an increase from 1.93 in 2013 to 2.22 in 2021.\nSuch findings should worry us because, up until now, we had no clue about such a scenario in the urban areas. In fact, the Population and Housing Census 2022 found that our population growth rate had actually slowed over the past four decades. Our health experts had even praised the government's rigorous family planning campaigns for such improvement. But the increasing TFR in urban areas indicates a grimmer picture of our population growth, if the current trend continues.\nThe question that naturally arises is: what has contributed to this situation in our urban areas? Health and population experts have identified a number of reasons, such as the rising rates of child marriage, teen pregnancy, and low use of contraceptives for the rising trend in birth rates. Several other government and private surveys done in the past two years have also found an alarming increase in child marriage rates, particularly during the first two years of the pandemic. For instance, a report by the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, based on information provided by 11,769 secondary schools \u2013 almost half of all such schools in the country \u2013 found that around 50,000 female students became victims of child marriage in 2021. From this data, we can easily gauge the real number of child marriage victims in 2021 alone.\nAs child marriage rates increased, so did teen pregnancy rates. The NIPORT survey has found that the rate of teenage pregnancy has increased from 13 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2021 in non-slum areas, while in slum areas, the rate increased from 21 percent in 2013 to 22 percent in 2021. The survey has also found that the use of contraceptives is low among teenagers and in non-slum areas.\nNow that the problems have been identified, it is time for the authorities concerned to plan proper interventions to reduce the TFR rate in urban areas. As a first step, the government must go all-out to prevent child marriages across the country and provide families of adolescent girls with incentives, including stipends, to bring them back to school. It must also strengthen its family planning programmes in urban areas by creating awareness among the targeted populations, particularly adolescents. Only combined efforts from all the government agencies concerned can reverse the current scenario.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's National Education Policy acknowledges that \"autonomy is a must\" for higher educational institutions. The first four public universities, governed under a set of laws enacted in 1973 which set the standards of university autonomy in Bangladesh, offer no \"prejudice to the freedom of any faculty member or officer to hold any political views.\" Subsequent public university legislation, too, protects faculty members' right to hold any political views, but forbids them from propagating their political views and from being associated with political organisations. The National University, where government control is absolute, also promises to hold no \"prejudice to [faculty members]\" civil and other rights.\nHowever, our recently published study on academic freedom in Bangladesh has found several alarming factors contributing to declining academic freedom in the universities of Bangladesh.\nOur research found that notable factors fomenting the decline of academic freedom in Bangladesh include a persisting fear of professional repercussions, legal harassment, and physical assaults among academics, the intimate relationship between the government and the university administration, the ruling party's student affiliates, and partisan roles of the teachers' associations in public universities. In private universities, challenges to academic freedom have an additional layer: faculty members participating in our research told us that their jobs are at the mercy of the board of trustees.\nAcademics participating in our research shared their uneasiness about research \u2013 as to what to and not to talk about in classrooms and what research questions they should explore. Such fear is widespread and, unfortunately, normalised.\nAcademics are concerned about teaching and researching issues related to gender, religion, the ruling party, the government, and politics in general.\nOne interviewee stated, \"There is a potential risk of losing my job if I talk about some issues in class settings, especially the issues that are [a] religiously and culturally sensitive topic that goes against the dominant ideologies within the state.\"\nAnother added, \"Direct criticism of the government's actions [is] taboo. If agents of the ruling party [learn about our] criticism, they may exert damaging pressure on the teacher's career.\"\nWhen we asked, \"Are you afraid to talk about some issues in the class?\", one interlocutor responded: \"Very much. Given the fact that Noakhali [a south-eastern district of Bangladesh] is a highly conservative area, and I was teaching gender, it was tough to discuss issues regarding gender equality and women empowerment.\"\nAnother interviewee, a social science professor at a private university, added that they avoid discussing pressing and relevant topics in classes if they perceive them to be sensitive: \"Every semester, I get calls from the head of the department and the vice chancellor and am strongly charged as to why I always spoke in the classroom against government interests,\" said the private university faculty member.\nAnother respondent noted: \"I remain very careful not to write [on an issue] that would create a debate (controversy). For example, I avoid being very critical about the roles of the [government] on human rights and CVE (countering violent extremism), extrajudicial killings, political violence, and enforced disappearances.\"\n\"I know it's a shame, but I do not see anyone protecting me. My university will not protect me,\" the respondent added.\nJudging by contemporary precedents, their fear is entirely justified.\nIn 2019, a senior professor affiliated with the University of Science and Technology Chittagong, a private university, was physically assaulted by a group of students for delivering \"obscene\" lectures involving \"male-female relationship and Freudian psychoanalytic theory\" (Some of the students had first attempted to prevent the professor from discussing these issues in class, pressured the university to terminate his contract, and subsequently threatened him with dire consequences.)\nSince the Digital Security Act (DSA) regulates online content, the pandemic-era remote learning settings only added to these woes.\n\"Among faculty members, including me, there is a fear of falling victim to the DSA. And it's particularly true during the Covid-19 pandemic when we are conducting online classes,\" one faculty member told us at the time. \"This is why I do not give the recorded lecture to students. Our university also takes written consent from students that they must not abuse lecture content.\"\nAs the pandemic restricted everyday life, the government's attention shifted to online speech, which affected academics, too. In 2020, authorities arrested two public university faculty members in Rajshahi and Rangpur for criticising a deceased former health minister, holding him responsible for the country's dismal healthcare system.\nThe same year, the government suspended two teachers at the National University for making \"unwarranted and inciting\" remarks on social media. They had merely pointed out the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in health facilities.\nIn 2021, Khulna University, a publicly funded institution, suspended one faculty member and terminated the contracts of two others because they had expressed solidarity with an apolitical student movement that demanded a reduced rate of student fees and sufficient residential facilities for students.\nWhile these examples do not always demonstrate a direct link to freedom to research and teach, these events have left a profound psychological impact on Bangladeshi academics, including those we interviewed. Our interlocutors say they live in a fearful climate, the chilling effect of which ultimately impacts their choice of research topics and teaching material.\nThe resultant self-censorship, in turn, is an affirmation of unfreedom. We, therefore, argue that self-censorship out of fear of persecution or repercussions restricts the free agency of academics.\n\"Instead of following the rules, [vice chancellors] are being appointed through executive orders,\" Professor Abu Naser Md Wahid, a senior academic with Rajshahi University, commented to the media in 2021. \"Such orders result from serious lobbies by individuals affiliated with political leaders. Once appointed, the VCs remain loyal to the [political] leaders who lobbied for them. This is how the corruption starts.\"\nBut the root of corruption and associated governance challenges lies even deeper.\nPublic university laws vest varying powers to the university senate, governing bodies, and student bodies. But the lack of elections in student and governing bodies allows the government to exert its executive powers, thanks to flawed laws, to nominate and appoint its preferred academics to senior academic positions. The preference is determined by the academics' loyalty to the ruling party, such as whether \u2013 and how intimately \u2013 they are involved with the ruling party's politics. Once appointed, these officials feel indebted to their political benefactors, who want them to hire their activists, even if that amounts to corruption.\nIt is a vicious cycle: legal loopholes and the lack of democracy in the senate and student bodies allows the government to bypass them and position loyal academic officials in key posts, who then become corrupt \u2013 either by choice or under pressure from their political benefactors \u2013 which further invites government interference.\nAnd no one better exemplified this cycle than Professor Abdus Sobhan, who served as vice chancellor of Rajshahi University until May 2021.\nSobhan appointed more than 100 teachers and officials on the last day of his tenure. Some media reports suggested that those appointed included his relatives and personal staff. The VC, who was previously leader of the ruling party-affiliated academics, admitted that most of those appointed at that time belonged to the ruling party's student wing. He defended the move as a \"humanitarian\" gesture and suggested that he was not obligated to follow the education ministry's recruitment moratorium.\nAs evident in this case, the failure of the respective university authorities to self-regulate, the misuse of autonomy to shield corruption, and the sheer dependence on government funds pave the way for government intervention, direct or otherwise.\nOur interlocutors said that officials from intelligence agencies function on university campuses.\nHistorically, public universities offered spaces for protests against the incumbent government. The proctor (as a general rule) determines whether the university needs to summon the police to maintain security and order. However, public universities \u2013 especially Dhaka University, which is situated at the heart of the capital city and is thus considered a political hotspot \u2013 have often witnessed a heavy presence and heavy-handed approach of security forces and intelligence agencies during student protests.\nCampus branches of the ruling party's student wing also violently act against protesting students or those belonging to opposition groups. Police incursion into student dormitories is not uncommon, either.\nWhen a new party comes to power, the supporters of the previous governing party are evicted from dormitories \u2013 which are generally used by students affiliated with political parties as a political base \u2013 by supporters of the new ruling party, aided by security forces. Those who are publicly aligned with the opposition parties rarely find a seat in student dormitories.\nDuring extraordinary periods of political instability, student activists with known ties to the political opposition hesitate to join classes or sit for exams, fearing reprisals by rival groups, with university authorities reluctant to intervene in these cases. Since the current ruling party has been in power since 2009, with few signs of change in the status quo in the foreseeable future, the balance of power has been tilted to the incumbent party and its affiliated student organ.\nMajor public universities in Bangladesh have long been at the forefront of political and social justice protests. It is not uncommon for campuses to be shut down to curb the intensity of student protests, although such incidents have become less intense and less frequent over the last few years. Thanks to its long stay in power, the Awami League-led government has maintained a sense of stability on campuses, where its student wing remains the most dominant force. The last major protest that disrupted academic life at Dhaka University was in 2018, when university students protested the quota system in public jobs and university admissions that overwhelmingly favoured certain sections.\nThe right to assembly, including on campus, is at present seriously suppressed by agents of the state and the ruling party activists. Activists belonging to the political opposition, the BNP, are routinely targeted by ruling party cadres and not allowed to hold protest rallies or organise partisan events. In April 2021, an activist with a group that opposed the quota system in public jobs was reportedly detained by plainclothes detectives on the Dhaka University campus.\nPrivate universities do not allow partisan political activities on campuses. They also strictly suppress internal student movements, such as when the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) filed a criminal complaint against its students who demanded tuition fee reductions during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDespite active efforts by private universities to disassociate themselves from partisan politics, students have in recent years engaged in social and political, if not overtly partisan, protests.\nIn 2018, when students at East West University and North South University joined a popular movement initiated by schoolchildren for better road safety, they were violently assaulted by cadres associated with the ruling party, backed by law enforcement agencies. Some of the dozens of students arrested by police on and around campus were denied bail repeatedly.\nAlthough prestigious universities located in major cities are often at the forefront of political movements, any repression of students and scholars at these urban universities invites relatively more resistance and protests, thanks to the presence of vibrant progressive groups.\nIn addition, the capital city of Dhaka wields outsized power compared to the rest of the country. All major government offices and buildings are located in Dhaka, which also hosts cultural and media headquarters. Therefore, any adverse events that take place in Dhaka garner more attention and media coverage. Civil society sometimes calls out the harassment of students and scholars by authorities and discrimination by university authorities.\nHowever, in district cities or rural towns, irregularities and violations of academic freedom are rarely challenged. Respective university authorities are more centred around the VC, with power centres dominated by their allies. The removal of students or even scholars is more easily carried out, with little protest from the external civil society or academic groups. In the absence of a strong civil society and press in regional areas, universities are under tighter control of the government apparatus and ruling party of the day.\nPrivate universities, where the government does not intervene in specific cases, provide limited space for students and scholars to raise concerns about how the respective university functions and is run. The very nature of private universities, where students pay hefty tuition fees with almost no public subsidies, discourages students from getting involved in protests that may cost them their admission. Private universities also disproportionately employ part-time scholars (more than 26 percent, according to UGC statistics), unlike public universities, where most positions are tenured except for some adjunct faculty positions. Less stringent job security makes scholars in private universities more reluctant to get involved in robust activism and academic work than their counterparts in public institutions.\nSince Bangladesh's academics, scholars, and students are mainly targeted for their activism, disciplines such as law, sociology, and political and social sciences are more vulnerable to undue interference, as evident from our interviews with faculty members. Other scientific disciplines, whose works affect business interests, are prone to restrictions such as efforts to discredit their research. Those who deal with sensitive topics such as militancy or Islamic fundamentalism are also found to be treading carefully with their work.\n***\nOur findings are aligned with the declining environment for free speech and democracy in Bangladesh. While universities are traditionally considered strongholds for fostering critical inquiry, free speech, and democratic culture, and centres for resistance to democratic backsliding, our findings paint a grim picture.\nOversized influence of government agencies and ruling party members, draconian laws such as the DSA, and university administrations and teachers' associations tied with the government have formed a control structure in universities where a culture of fear and mistrust prevails. These alone are severely detrimental to the free agencies of academics and students. Our findings also point to another uncomfortable reality: not just external actors but certain groups of academics and students are also actively suppressing academic freedom.

It is difficult to cope with it and even more difficult to function around it.\u00a0\nFor someone with a serious mental health issue, getting up from bed every day is a great challenge. But the fact that a large number of people with mental health issues still wish to have gainful employment is very telling. It tells us that much of our self-worth is derived from employment and much of our self-preservation also relies on staying employed. Unfortunately, people with mental health conditions such as clinical depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia have to combat many internal difficulties to even get to work. Hence, the work they need to do should be as easy and acceptable as possible to them.\nFrom my own personal experience, I can say that having a mental health condition hinders one's daily life to a great extent, and having a supportive work environment goes a long way in aiding an individual to function well in life.\nThe modern workplace has the commendable ability to adapt to the needs of employees, if employers and supervisors are supportive.\u00a0\nWorkplaces around the world have responded to mental health crises in various fashions, including through laws. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the US and the Equality Act 2010 in the UK are examples of this. It is unfortunate that we do not have such laws in Bangladesh that can protect people with mental illnesses in the workplace. A piece of legislation called the Mental Health Act 2018 was passed recently, replacing a century-old law. But it fails to specifically address the issue of protection for people with mental health issues in the workplace.\u00a0\nIdeally, there should be a national-level policy on accommodating people with mental illnesses. There should be policies barring exclusion and discrimination based on one's mental health and compelling institutions to take necessary steps to create a safe space for those facing mental health challenges.\nIn the absence of such laws, people with mental health issues have to live a life of deception. Because of the stigma surrounding mental health in Bangladesh, people often do not disclose their mental health conditions during their selection process for a job. There is a fear that they would not be hired if they disclose their conditions because of the societal misconceptions that dictate that people with mental health issues are unproductive. This is unfortunate. In the spirit of full disclosure, and because the office may need to make adjustments for the person, employees should be able to freely disclose their mental health condition if they choose to do so or keep it private if they so choose as well.\u00a0\nEmployers should know that having a mental health condition does not mean that an employee will become a burden for the institution. In fact, people with mental health challenges often make great employees, as they have the drive to prove to themselves and others that they are able to overcome their mental health challenges. For example, people with bipolar disorder are likely to be more creative than others according to a study published in the\u00a0British Journal of Psychiatry.\u00a0\nPost the hiring process, there are a number of things that an employer can do to make life easier for an employee with mental illness. Initiatives like mental health days or weeks, where people are encouraged to discuss their mental health conditions with each other in the presence of a mental health professional, can be helpful. Employees should also be able to take days off for mental wellness, besides sick days for physical illnesses. This is important not only for people with diagnosed mental health issues, but for others as well. In the modern workplace, it is possible for anyone to be stressed or be burnt out. Having the opportunity to rest and an avenue to vent and seek redress for their mental health issues may be exactly what employees need to cope with an exceedingly stressful work environment.\nModern workplaces have become a source of stress, depression, and anxiety for workers, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The best way for workplaces to avoid this and ensure the productivity of their workers is by implementing policies that are cognisant of the mental health of employees. This will not be an expense in vain, but a step towards a more effective and productive workplace.\nMaking sure that a healthy work-life balance exists in the employee's life can go a long way in ensuring their mental well-being. Employers must reexamine their management style to make sure that nobody in the organisation is stretched too thin to achieve the desired outcomes. Overall, the employer needs to care about the employees. That is the only way that mindsets regarding mental health can change. Without a caring employer who is willing to make necessary accommodations to ensure the well-being of their employees, we cannot expect the situation to change for the better.\nWe need an overhaul of the system to ensure better care for workers. We need to make sure that nobody's mental health is ignored. That is the only way we can ensure better mental health for everyone in the workplace.\nAnupam Debashis Roy\u00a0is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

Only a couple of weeks ago, farmers could rely on the Teesta's water flow for their farming activities. Now, however, as this newspaper reported on Friday, the mighty waterbody has completely dried up in many places of Lalmonirhat. As a consequence, many farmers in different char areas of the district, who cultivate various crops on the sandy char lands, are being compelled to use diesel-run shallow machines to irrigate their croplands. This, of course, is pushing up the production costs of farmers who can afford to set up such machines, while others do not even have that luxury, making farming impossible for them.\u00a0\nAccording to the Lalmonirhat Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) deputy director, about 20,000 farmers in different upazilas are growing various crops on vast char areas along the Teesta and Dharla rivers. These farmers have managed to change their fates by growing potatoes, maize, pumpkins, and other crops on sandy land. This crop production would cost little if there was enough water flow in the Teesta river. The flow, however, is not enough because the riverbed is full of silt, and it seems the river has been divided into five or six narrow channels.\u00a0\nLalmonirhat's Patgram Upazilla is the entry point of the Teesta into Bangladesh. But India has built an irrigation barrage at the Indian side of the Teesta, specifically the Malbazar Town in Jalpaiguri. The Teesta Barrage, unfortunately, is working as a blockade and diverting the water. As a result, the Bangladeshi portion of the river tends to dry up. Authorities from India and Bangladesh have held talks about the river situation with practically no results. The drying up has been so severe that farmers are cultivating pumpkins in the dried-up land. As an additional concern, the natural biodiversity and the ecosystem of the area are also at risk.\u00a0\nGiven the circumstances, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is for Bangladesh to find a sustainable solution to the long-drawn-out Teesta water sharing saga with India. Despite decades of negotiations and numerous promises from our Indian partners, the Teesta water sharing agreement between Bangladesh and India is nowhere near being settled. We understand the primary reason for this has been the complex domestic politics in India. However, Bangladesh cannot be its victim forever and watch its farmers continue to lose their livelihoods because of it for decades on end.\n",

        "full_article": "We are worried about the increase in fertility rates in urban areas of the country, as highlighted in a recent survey by the National Institute of Population Research and Training (NIPORT). According to the survey, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), or the number of births per woman, in urban areas increased from 2.01 percent in 2013 to 2.14 percent in 2021, and in non-slum areas, from 1.74 to 1.91 during the same period. Semi-urban areas also saw an increase from 1.93 in 2013 to 2.22 in 2021.\nSuch findings should worry us because, up until now, we had no clue about such a scenario in the urban areas. In fact, the Population and Housing Census 2022 found that our population growth rate had actually slowed over the past four decades. Our health experts had even praised the government's rigorous family planning campaigns for such improvement. But the increasing TFR in urban areas indicates a grimmer picture of our population growth, if the current trend continues.\nThe question that naturally arises is: what has contributed to this situation in our urban areas? Health and population experts have identified a number of reasons, such as the rising rates of child marriage, teen pregnancy, and low use of contraceptives for the rising trend in birth rates. Several other government and private surveys done in the past two years have also found an alarming increase in child marriage rates, particularly during the first two years of the pandemic. For instance, a report by the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, based on information provided by 11,769 secondary schools \u2013 almost half of all such schools in the country \u2013 found that around 50,000 female students became victims of child marriage in 2021. From this data, we can easily gauge the real number of child marriage victims in 2021 alone.\nAs child marriage rates increased, so did teen pregnancy rates. The NIPORT survey has found that the rate of teenage pregnancy has increased from 13 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2021 in non-slum areas, while in slum areas, the rate increased from 21 percent in 2013 to 22 percent in 2021. The survey has also found that the use of contraceptives is low among teenagers and in non-slum areas.\nNow that the problems have been identified, it is time for the authorities concerned to plan proper interventions to reduce the TFR rate in urban areas. As a first step, the government must go all-out to prevent child marriages across the country and provide families of adolescent girls with incentives, including stipends, to bring them back to school. It must also strengthen its family planning programmes in urban areas by creating awareness among the targeted populations, particularly adolescents. Only combined efforts from all the government agencies concerned can reverse the current scenario.\n",

        "full_article": "The country's central tax authority, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), is learnt to have extended the existing tax concessions that the importers of edible oil, especially, soybean and palm oils, had already been enjoying for another four months until April 30, 2023. Similarly, the existing tax waiver provided at all the stages of production and trading of the edible oils will also continue for the period mentioned. The measure, it is said, has been taken with an eye to keeping the price of this key essential commodity under control during the upcoming Ramadan. Thus the tax regulatory body reportedly took the decision following a recommendation to that effect from the ministry of commerce.Notably, the NBR, last March drastically cut the Value Added Tax (VAT) on the import of unrefined soybean oil and refined and unrefined palm oil from 15 per cent to 5.0 per cent. At the same time, it withdrew the VAT on producers and sellers of those oils. The measure would remain effective until June 30, 2022, so went the NBR regulatory order. The government measure was meant to give some relief to the consumers, especially, those in the low-income bracket who were reeling from the uncontrolled rise in the prices of edible oil and other key essential commodities. And not without any justification, the runaway price hike of edible oil and other essentials was blamed largely on stockpiling of those commodities by dishonest trade syndicates. Unsurprisingly, there was no improvement in the edible oil's price situation despite the tax benefits offered to its importers, refiners and traders. Even so, the tax authority decided to extend the VAT concession and exemptions for the second time till September 30. Later, on October 4, the NBR continued the VAT exemptions on all types of refined edible oil at the production and supply stage and the concessionary tax benefits remained valid till December 31, 2022.Now the question is, will the NBR's fresh extension of the VAT concessions including exemptions provided to the importers, refiners and distributors of the key kitchen item finally benefit the consumers? To go by the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB)'s data, retail prices of loose soybean oil in the Dhaka market at the beginning of the New Year ranged between Tk 167 and Tk 180 per litre. That was an increase by 2.9 per cent over the prices of loose soybean oil a week before. The picture was similar for the prices of packaged soybean oil which was selling between Tk 187 and Tk 190 per litre registering a 3.2 per cent increase over what those were in the previous week.So far, the consumers could hardly draw any benefit from the measures the government took to tame the volatile edible oil market. For example, when the price of palm oil declined markedly in the international market in the first week of November last year, the price of the same went up in our domestic market as reflected by the commodity's price levels in the country's largest wholesale market at Khatunganj in Chattogram. But given the VAT concession the palm oil importers and distributors were enjoying, it should not have been the case. Against this backdrop, the government would be required to mount a strict monitoring regime so that any devious syndicate out to manipulate and thereby destabilise the edible oil market during Ramadan might be busted and penalised then and there.",

        "full_article": "From a report published in this newspaper on January 4, it is known that China has come up with US$ 400 million for \"upgrading the Mongla seaport that holds potential to promote sub-regional cooperation.\" The project termed 'Expansion and Modernisation of Monga Port Facilities', which would be facilitated through a Chinese government concessional loan (GCL), is likely to have far reaching impact on the economy. As it would significantly cut down time taken to reach goods for export from factory to a port since Mongla is about 100 km nearer to Dhaka than Chattogram Port.Indeed, going by media reports published elsewhere, it is already clear that the south-western seaport has seen an uptick of incoming ocean-going vessels. With the inauguration of the Padma Bridge, Mongla port's viability and future have apparently been secured and maritime commerce using this port will only increase. The port authority has completed dredging of the \"outer bar of a nearly 140-kilometre channel to improve navigability and enable the movement of vessels that require a higher draft\", an activity that was completed back in 2020. The Mongla Port Authority (MPA) has made substantial investments in the procurement of different types of equipment and machinery which will enable the port to receive and handle larger vessels at a certain point of time. By all indications, Mongla is destined to become a regional port because of it is location.The GCL framework will oversee the funding of the project. It is evisaged that Mongla seaport will serve as a backup to the BCIM (Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar) arrangement. As stated before, given the 100km shorter distance from the capital than any seaport, exporters and shipping lines are bound to take full advantage of the port as time is literally money. As per documents available, the government has asked its Chinese counterpart to come up with a consortium led by Chinese business entities / enterprises to act as implementer once business contract is signed and sealed. This is at the initial phase. One can only hope that the bidding process and loan agreement will not take an inordinate amount of time, as time is of the essence.It is understood that China wishes to have the responsibility of implementation, operation, maintenance and management of the port. Frankly speaking, this makes sense, because it would bring a level of expertise and efficiency that are not present here currently. Should things go awry during operation, the MPA can take the agencies responsible to task for it. The negotiation to upgrade Mongla port has been under discussion since 2019 and now that the feasibility study is done, it is imperative that a decisive move was there to ink the deal so that the ball could roll in the right direction.Our policymakers need to act fast. Years have been lost because of indecision on long-term policy for crucial sectors like energy. Let us hope there is no wavering whatsoever on Mongla Port's modernisation. The MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) between the MPA with a Chinese company CNCEC was signed on August 12, 2015 and an agreement reached on October 6, 2016. This dragged on till 2019 when the deal was scrapped. This time around, the MPA has signed an agreement with CCECC. Now the need is to take the matter seriously and work for a speedy implementation of the project under consideration.Looking at the data, it is seen that in 2020, Mongla saw a turnaround of 170 ships ---the highest in its history --- and earned a profit of Tk1.30 billion from the existing facilities. With the modernisation plans that sre being undertaken, the volume of cargo handling and revenue generation could be much larger. When one takes into account the volume of cargoes that could potentially be coming from landlocked Bhutan and Nepal - which could use a much-expanded and efficiently-run Mongla port. Thus the impact it would have to make BCIM a reality will definitely provide the required momentum. Bangladesh has the potential to become a regional hub for trading. There is international consensus on this. What has been lacking is the political will to make it happen. Perhaps this time around, policymakers will go about the business seriously in order to make it happen. According to a recent article published in The Financial Times of London, the IMF has predicted that a third of the global economy may go into recession in 2023. Bangladesh has always defied world pundits on economics as being a nation of paradoxes that continues to grow despite all indicators stating that it ought to be going in the opposite direction. The country can ill afford to sit on past laurels as the world has become an uncertain place. Regional connectivity, regional business opportunities and increasing revenue generation need to become realities today instead of tomorrow. The country's strategic location gives it an edge over many of its neighbours and it should not be allowed to go abegging.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "People across the world welcomed the New Year with joy and fanfare. Bangladesh was also not an exception. From five-star hotels to street-side tiny shops and luxury apartment buildings in posh areas to tin-shaded houses in villages, people gathered and celebrated the 31st night to welcome 2023. Parties were organised where invited people gathered and enjoyed food, drink, music, dance, fun and games. To prevent untoward and objectionable incidents, law enforcement agencies put some restrictions on the movement of people and open space gatherings. However, people were also encouraged to celebrate the New Year's eve in their homes. There is nothing wrong with celebrating the event, provided the festivity is modest, and there is little disturbance to others. The parties inside hotels and resorts are usually confined to the premises where only the guests are allowed. Events organised in the residences are also mostly restrained. Nevertheless, in many cases, the celebration turned rowdy and devoid of common sense. High-beat music on loudspeakers rent the nightly silence creating extreme noise pollution well beyond the zero hour. So-called DJ parties on some rooftops were just torture for neighbouring residents. Those who organised and attended these parties either wilfully or ignorantly forgot that many children, older adults and patients live nearby. Due to high decibel sounds at midnight, they could not sleep, and some even became sick. The explosion of crackers, coupled with fireworks, intensified the sound and air pollution. Another indifferent attitude is the careless ignition of sky lanterns which caused the breaking out of fires in many places and damaged property. The most visible damage is the suspension of the operations of the newly introduced metro rail for two hours on Sunday. As many doused sky lanterns that landed on the overhead electricity cables during the 31st night celebrations, the authorities suspended the operation and removed the entangled polythene covers of sky lanterns to avoid any possible accident. This single incident shows that any nonsensical behaviour of a few could bring serious trouble for many. The ignition of sky lanterns, the explosion of crackers and any firework was banned by the police. Many, however, defied the ban without any difficulty. As the police couldn't reach every corner and monitor the ignition of the sky lantern, it is the responsibility of the citizens to follow the ban and discourage others from igniting it. Unfortunately, most people do not want to do so for fear of backlash and harassment by the wrongdoers. They care little about the disturbance to others and become aggressive when someone protests any wrongdoing. Instead of acknowledging their faults, they want to justify their actions. The negative trend has been growing day by day. The rise of youth and juvenile gang culture, mainly due to political backing, reflects this negativity. Moreover, a culture of impunity has developed in the country where political power coupled with money plays a vital role. The net result is the erosion of mutual respect and cooperation regarding social values. All these lead to a distorted social bonding and indicate an ominous future.[email\u00a0protected]",

The world is gradually transitioning to a knowledge-based economy, where individuals learn new things, comprehend concepts, and put them into practice to create new things. Adopting certain efficient strategies can help us attain this goal. To educate youngsters with new abilities and concepts, the public and private sectors should develop institutions based on intellect and arts. For this reason, the government should offer financial incentives and other benefits to private firms.Additionally, children and youth should have appropriate access to the internet so that they may explore and learn new concepts. Last but not least, there should be a robust network of academics, researchers, organisations, and private firms that can keep pace with the world, hunt for new ideas, and then implement them.
