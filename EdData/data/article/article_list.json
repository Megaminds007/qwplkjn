From southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is exchanging fire with Israeli troops. Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq have attacked U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq. The Houthis, the Iran-backed rebels of Yemen, have turned the Red Sea into a battlefield. The U.S.\u2019s air strikes in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, seek to retaliate against Shia militias. As chaos and instability spread, Sunni Islamist militants attacked Iran, killing at least 100 people. In the latest escalation, Iran claims to have destroyed an Israeli intelligence outpost in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan and training camps of Sunni Islamists in Syria and Pakistan, in air strikes. This is now a classic case of regional anarchy where countries are taking unilateral military measures to address their perceived security challenges, throwing international laws and the idea of sovereignty, the bedrock of the international system, to the wind, thereby risking a wider all-out war.Just weeks before the October 7 attack, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. National Security Adviser, had said \u201cthe Middle East is quieter today than it has been in two decades\u201d. The Abraham Accords were on a strong footing, and Saudi Arabia and Israel were moving closer towards normalisation. Iraq had become quieter; Gulf Arabs and Iran had reached a rapprochement; and a ceasefire was holding in Yemen. Most of these changes, however, ignored the oldest crisis in the region \u2014 Israel\u2019s continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories. The October 7 Hamas attack and Israel\u2019s subsequent vengeful offensive in Gaza have not only brought Palestine back to the centre of West Asia but also lit fires, triggering perhaps the deepest security crisis in the region since 1967. The involvement of non-state actors and the absence of an off ramp complicate matters. After 100 days of war with Hamas, Israel has achieved little in Gaza. The Houthis, a militia that survived seven years of Saudi bombing, are unlikely to be deterred by America\u2019s strikes. Even though Iran wants to showcase strength and boldness, it cannot mask its inherent weakness, which also makes it unpredictable. The old order, anchored by America\u2019s domineering regional presence, is in tatters. What West Asia needs is a new security equilibrium. There has to be an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and peace between Israel and Palestinians could be used as a springboard for further talks aimed at regional security between the main stakeholders \u2014 Israel, Arab nations, Iran, the U.S. and their respective allies and proxies.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nIran\n\n/\n\nSyria\n\n/\n\nIraq\n\n/\n\nYemen\n\n/\n\nUSA",

        "full_article": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has established a significant lead over other Republican Party candidates in the first formal event of the election season, the Iowa caucuses. This puts him in pole position to be the Republican nominee for the November 2024 presidential election, even though the nomination process through state-level primaries and caucuses is usually hard-fought and can produce surprise outcomes. While the 45th President scooped up 20 delegates in Iowa, far ahead of the nine delegates of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and eight delegates of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, in order to win the Party\u2019s nomination a candidate would require a total of 1,215 delegates. Meanwhile, the next Republican presidential debate was cancelled after Ms. Haley declined to appear on stage unless Mr. Trump participates too, something he has refused to do so far. Indeed, it is Ms. Haley who perhaps represents the greatest possibility of posing a challenge to Mr. Trump, and the next Republican contest in New Hampshire, a swing state, will be her best opportunity to dent his momentum. The state has a more white and rural population and nearly 40% of its electorate is comprised of independent voters who may prefer a more moderate candidate than Mr. Trump.Regardless of what twists of fate might lie ahead for the three candidates in the Republican primaries, it is clear from the Iowa results that Mr. Trump has bounced back from what some consider the political embarrassment and legal quagmires of the four indictments that he has been slapped with for alleged improprieties of conduct during his time in office. The latest voting suggests that his popularity among conservatives has not dwindled much; contrarily, he appears to be their candidate of choice more than in previous elections. The Iowa caucuses surveys suggest that nearly 50% of Republican considered themselves to be members of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, and the breadth of his victory included older and younger age cohorts, men and women, and far-right and evangelical caucus-goers. Reports from Iowa indicate that nearly 90% among this group believed the Trump campaign falsehoods that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and thus tend to overlook federal and state charges that he faces relating to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and election interference in Georgia. An early assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s overall position suggests that he would be well placed to win his party\u2019s nomination and perhaps successfully challenge his Democratic rival, incumbent Joe Biden, in November. Whether this will be a positive development favouring the U.S.\u2019s long-term national interest is an entirely different question.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nUS PRESIDENTIAL POLLS",

UNESCO anointed Kozhikode \u2018City of Literature\u2019 just weeks before the 7th edition of Kerala Literature Festival. It could well be the latter. After all, it\u2019s Asia\u2019s largest with 500 speakers and a hundred times as many people crowding its seven venues spread across 500 metres of beach. Yes, one of its hashtags is #festivalonthebeach. It was really quite surreal. This was no ivory tower \u2013 or even sandbar \u2013 requiring the usual registration process. Whether seethingly complex or seemingly simple, all litfests involve a degree of queuing up at a counter. But I\u2019d never been to one with no boundaries, literal and literary.\u00a0\nThe beach didn\u2019t just segue into the venue. It was the venue. So, the weekend beachies mingled with those wending their way to the venues. Perhaps even singled out a speaker who caught their attention \u2013 and simply merged into the overflowing audience. It also meant that the usual beach blandishments became part of KLF. Unscripted but far from unwelcome.\u00a0\nThe formal food, book and promotional stalls, panipuri-wallas, pineapple-pickled-in-brine vendors, peanut sellers, pamphlet distributors, petty-donation seekers all eddied together like wrappers in the evening breeze.

Nor one as democratic. True, the love of books transcends class. But seeing the demography here, I was hit by the full impact of Kerala\u2019s decades-long record of near-100% literacy in meaningful read-write terms, not the token so-called proficiency needed to check development boxes. That mature literacy was reflected in the riveted response to the writers, film fraternity, activists and other thought and conscience-leaders who addressed the sardine-packed venues.\u00a0\nRavi Deecee\u2019s KLF is every litfest creator\u2019s dream.

        "full_article": "For a very long period of time \u201cGareebi Hatao\u201d was a mere political slogan but did not translate into much, except for political dividends for the parties that used such empty slogans. In fact even third and fourth generations of the very same family run parties continue to make the same promise \u2013 in a sense testifying that the Naara has never been backed by Niti or Niyat of Gareebi Hatao.\nSince 2014 however the approach has changed. Slogans have now been replaced by concrete action. One outcome of that is India\u2019s remarkabale stride in alleviating poverty over the last 9-10 years. According to a Niti Aayog discussion paper, multidimensional poverty in India declined from 29.17 per cent in 2013-14 to 11.28 per cent in 2022-23, a reduction of 17.89 %, with about 25 crore people being lifted out of the bracket during this period.\nThe report states that\nMore than half of India\u2019s population (55%) was multidimensionally poor in year 2005-06.\nThe proportion of multi dimensionally poor persons in total population has fallen from 55.34% in 2005-06 to 29.17% in 2013-14 and to 11.28% in 2022-23\nThis means that the rate of decrease in headcount ratio of poverty was 7.69% under UPA & 10.66% under Modi government\n2013-14. So the pace of decline became much faster (10.66%) under Modi Govt i.e., between 2013-14 & 2022-23.\nPoverty in rural India fell from 32.59% to 19.28% while in urban areas it declined from 8.65% to 5.27%. Thus, rural population witnessed a larger decline in poverty as compared to urban population.\nThe World Bank defines the international poverty line at US $2.15 (in 2017 purchasing power parity [PPP] terms) a day to measure monetary poverty. The latest World Bank data indicates that the poverty headcount ratio at US $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) decreased from 18.73% in 2015 to 11.9% in 2021 in India (Poverty and Inequality Platform, World Bank).\nWith the ongoing rate of decline in India\u2019s Multidimensional Poverty, the country is expected to reach single digit level of poverty by the year 2024-25.\nThe multidimensional poverty index that has been used measures deprivations across three equally weighted dimensions of health, education, and standard of living that are represented by 12 sustainable development goals-aligned indicators. These include nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, maternal health, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets, and bank accounts. While, the MPI covers 12 indicators the global MPI covers only 10 indicators. So this index is more comprehensive.\nBut how did this transformation take place? For that one must deep dive into the interventions by the Modi Govt in achieving poverty alleviation\nSignificant improvements were observed in all 12 indicators.\n\u2022 Deprivations in sanitation decreased by 21.8 percentage points between 2015-16 & 2019-21\nThis is thanks to transformative campaigns under Modi Govt like Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) that have led to a nationwide wave of improved sanitation facilities providing 14 crores tap water connections and construction of 11 crore toilets\n\u2022 Deprivations in cooking fuel decreased by 14.6 percentage points between 2015-16 and 2019-21.\nThis has been made possible due to PM Ujjwala Yojana which has provided clean cooking fuel to an impressive 31 crore individuals, distributing 10 crore LPG connections.\n\u2022 Electricity Deprivation reduced to 3.2% in 2019-21 from 12.16% in 2015-16 due to Initiatives like Saubhagya have improved electricity coverage for almost 100% of the population, benefiting an additional 2.86 crore households and rendering kerosene lamps obsolete, thus improving respiratory health and eyesight.\n\u2022 The PM Awas Yojana has facilitated the construction of over 4 crore homes for the underprivileged.\n\u2022 The PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has been a driving force for change, witnessing the opening of over 50 crore bank accounts in recent years. This mammoth initiative has played a central role in bringing a significant section of the population into the formal financial system, providing efficient access to government schemes, savings, and credit.\n\u2022 Under National Food Security Act (NFSA), foodgrains are provided to 81.35 crore beneficiaries covering 75% population in rural areas and 50% population in urban areas. Recently, Modi Government has extended free food grains to NFSA beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 1st January, 2024.\n\u2022 Mission Poshan 2.0 and Saksham Anganwadi have significantly contributed to fostering a healthier India, impacting millions of lives through key schemes like Poshan Abhiyaan, Anganwadi Services, and the Scheme for Adolescent Girls. Through around 14 lakh Anganwadi centres, the programme is touching lives of nearly 10 crore beneficiaries which includes around 8.87 crore children under 6 years and 1.1 crore pregnant and lactating mothers. With hot cooked meals given to 93 lakh beneficiaries and take- home ration to 2.7 crore beneficiaries, the programme has immensely contributed to a healthy India.\n\u2022 The Programme instrumental in improving maternal health is the PM Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, offering assured, comprehensive, and quality antenatal care to all pregnant women universally on the 9th of each month. The programme has conducted 3.94 crore free antenatal checkups.\nWhat is most heartening is that the fastest reduction in the proportion of multidimensional poor was observed in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan & Bihar and the state with the highest MPI value in NFHS-4 (2015-16), experienced the largest decline in the headcount ratio. Following closely, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh demonstrated the next largest reductions in the headcount poverty ratio.\nIn terms of the number of MPI-poor individuals, Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 3.43 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty over the past five years, followed by Bihar (2.25 crore) and Madhya Pradesh (1.36 crore).\nNaysayers & cynics may continue to peddle half truths and negativity but facts speak louder than propaganda. As we enter the pious week of Pran Pratishta of Prabhu Shri Ram at Ayodhya , the idea of Ram Rajya where Gareeb Kalyan & Samajik Nyay are essential features , seems like it is becoming a reality already.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The delayed start of the annual trade and commerce event Dhaka International Trade Fair (DITF) slated to be on January 21 instead of the New Year's Day is hardly going to make much of a difference in the life of the citizens of the capital, least of all to that of the rest of the nation. It is because the fair with an international tag has hardly lived up to that soubriquet. A trade fair of international order is one that draws quite large number international entrepreneurs, companies and buyers alongside the local manufacturers and traders together in order to explore and initialise sourcing and collaborative ventures. How much this purpose has been served over the years since the DITF's introduction in 1995 is unclear. With the venue shifted to its new site in Purbachal, even the presence of local retail customers has declined. This year will be no exception to the fall in the number of visitors to the trade fair. The number one disincentive will be the wintry chill and then the middle class which forms the major part of the visitors to the event, has experienced a drastic income erosion and is hardly left with the extra money to spare for what has turned out to be a luxury beyond the basic needs. Although arrangement of special BRTC (Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation) buses between designated city hubs and the fair venue has been made for the convenience of visitors, there is no guarantee the crowd will feel particularly tempted to visit the place for this reason. When an international trade fair depends on retail customers for its success, it is frustrating. If local and foreign factories, manufacturers and industries had taken full advantage of showcasing their products for export and import orders and also inked collaborative ventures of products as part of transfer of technology for mutual gains between them, only then could the DITF script a success story.By the look of it, this year's event is not going to be any different from its predecessors. But here was an ample opportunity to reshape the core content of the DITF, particularly against the backdrop of a slump in industrial production and business. Bangladesh has to seize every opportunity that comes its way and also invent opportunities to advance its economic interests. The private sector in particular has to take the lead in this regard because there are more areas than just the readymade garment (RMG), where the country's cheap labour and other favourable conditions can prove lucrative for foreign investment and joint ventures. There are hardly any better occasion than the DITF to host a large number of companies in diverse fields at the same venue and same time. Unfortunately, such an event has to be planned immediately after the conclusion of one at the outset of the year. Clearly, no such comprehensive plan for a grand commercial get-together is devised. That the government has gone through a transition is no excuse for not planning for such an august gathering. A tradition had to be created for addition of new ideas and breakthroughs in business deals in order to make the economy vibrant.",

        "full_article": "American democracy can be quite perplexing. Here we are, people who inhabit countries away from America and yet are interested in how its politics shapes out, especially through a regular four-year cycle. Donald Trump has just won 51 percent of support at the Republican caucus in Iowa, which is a strong sign that despite his many legal woes he could still be his party's nominee against President Joe Biden. In other words, in November this year, it may well be a rematch between these two aged men, neither of whom is willing to call it day.Trump has been under indictments in these past few months. He could go on trial in March. Accused of inciting insurrection and trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, he nevertheless remains the favourite to clinch the Republican nomination again and perhaps go on to reclaim the White House. The dilemma is not that Trump could be President again. It is that even if he is convicted in a case or two before November, as his party's nominee he could win the election from prison.That poses the disturbing question of how a President-elect, convicted of criminal activities, will take the oath of office if he remains in jail between the election and inauguration day. He can pardon himself, but that will not happen before he takes over at noon on 20 January. What are the procedures for the release of a President-elect who is a convict? How does he go to the Capitol to be sworn in, to promise to uphold the constitution the violation of which has landed him in prison?Assuming that his legal difficulties are put aside for some time, once the prisoner-President-elect takes the oath of office, he will pardon himself. That is again a quixotic aspect of American democracy. A President can not only pardon himself but also everyone who has been convicted besides himself. And Trump has promised, should he be elected in November, to pardon all the men, mobsters really, who stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021. One will recall that President Richard Nixon, before taking the decision to resign in the aftermath of Watergate in 1974, did not exercise the option of pardoning himself. It was his successor Gerald Ford who pardoned him.A queer aspect of American democracy is that it raises questions about the way the country's Supreme Court is constituted and functions. Every time a justice retires or dies, it is for the President to nominate his or her successor. The decision is based on the political ideology of the man in the Oval Office. A conservative President, assuming there is an equally conservative Senate to go along with his decision, will appoint conservative justices on the bench. Those justices will rarely, if ever, shift loyalty from the President. At this point, three of the serving justices are those appointed by Trump when he was President. But note here the hostility the Senate, if it is controlled by a party opposed to the party the President belongs to, can ignite around the appointment of Supreme Court justices. Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland as a justice, but Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell committed the outrage of not permitting the nomination to be considered by the Senate. Garland currently serves as Attorney General in the Biden administration. America's presidential campaigns are a four-year affair, with speculations about future candidates beginning to be aired once a new President has been elected. In 1968, after Nixon was elected President, news reports began focusing on Senator Edmund Muskie, who was Hubert Humphrey's running mate at the election. The probability of Muskie challenging Nixon in 1972 was widely discussed in the media. Unfortunately, Muskie never became a presidential candidate in 1972, which distinction went to George McGovern. Muskie's career ended with his becoming Secretary of State in the Carter administration.An inexplicable fact about pluralism in the United States relates to the choice of vice presidential nominees before an election. The presidential candidate spends nearly an entire year going through the caucuses and the primaries before eventually winning the nomination of his party. And then comes that moment when he chooses the individual who will be his running mate as the vice presidential nominee. None of the vice presidential hopefuls have to conduct a campaign to come by the position. Those who wish to be Vice President simply have to convince the presidential candidate that they are qualified to be on the ticket with him. It is, of course, entirely up to the presidential candidate as to who he will finally select for the vice presidency.Vice Presidents of the United States have by and large not had a pleasant experience in their jobs. They enjoy little power, unless the President is willing to delegate some responsibilities to them at his discretion. The Vice President is certainly a heartbeat away from the presidency, meaning that when the President is incapacitated or dies, he steps into office as the new occupant of the White House. Lyndon Johnson became President within moments of President John F Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. But such transfers of power are rare. Vice Presidents have been dumped by Presidents before a new presidential election. Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his long presidency had three Vice Presidents, the last one being Harry Truman, who succeeded him on his death in April 1945.Sometimes Presidents and Vice Presidents make good teams. They lunch together on particular days and discuss policy. A couple of examples here are the bonding between President Jimmy Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale and President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. But that has not always been the story in other administrations. Kamala Harris, once a vocal Senator, is today Vice President with not much to do. And yet there have been politicians who have craved being Vice Presidents or vice presidential nominees. In 1956, John Kennedy and Estes Kefauver, both Senators, wished to be chosen as Adlai Stevenson's running mate. Kennedy lost but went on to be elected President in 1960. Stevenson expected to be appointed Secretary of State in his administration, but was sent to the United Nations instead as ambassador.A couple of American realities have left many perturbed about the political process in the United States. In the first place, how much authority does the Supreme Court have in deciding the outcome of a presidential election? In 2000, a lengthy vote count in the Gore-Bush contest finally was beginning to indicate a victory for Al Gore. But then the Supreme Court weighed in, giving the presidency to George W. Bush.In the second place, popular votes lose meaning at presidential elections. The electoral college stands as an impediment to the actual results of an election. In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 2.87 million votes. The electoral college, with each state having a certain number of votes, decided that Trump was the victor. In other words, the winning candidate lost to the losing candidate.A final question: what happens when a presidential candidate dies before the election? Who picks up the party banner at that point?\n[email\u00a0protected]",

It is ironic and sad that when so many among us exhibit pomp and gaiety with extravagant spending during the winter, that many of the poor are left out literally in the cold with, perhaps, only a cardboard box home on roadsides. Rural people in the north, where the country's lowest temperature is recorded, are also among the worst-affected. The piercing northern wind cuts through their skin.The cold-related death toll has reached at least 45 so far this winter and thousands have been hospitalised with cold-related diseases up and down the country. This is a manifestation of how harsh and cruel the winter is, especially for the have-nots. Many of these deaths could have been prevented if the poor had warm clothes in time to combat the cold. Amidst this bitterly harsh winter for the poor, which has already claimed 45 deaths so far, couldn't we, the privileged section of society, provide them some comfort? When they are left out so miserably in the cold, and often with children, shouldn't our sense of humanity be offended? We have no control over the rise or fall of the winter temperature, but we can stop it from becoming a season of misery and death for our fellow brethren. We see some big corporations, educational institutions, charities and voluntary organisations, NGOs, or groups of big-hearted people distribute winter clothes. Such private and individual efforts are praiseworthy and save lives. However, only a fraction of the neediest, those living on the streets in the city and elsewhere in the country benefit from such efforts. A much greater response is necessary. The more people respond to this call of humanity, the better. More importantly, what about the government's responsibility for the needy? We are yet to see any comprehensive initiatives from the government level to address the plight of the poor suffering from biting cold. Typically, politicians beseech and even embrace them during election season, soliciting their support. But when the elections are over, most of the politicians and even elected public representatives give them the cold shoulder.No doubt, individual initiatives are commendable, crucial, and even lifesaving. But a more comprehensive and widespread approach is needed. If the government were to set up rehabilitation programmes for the homeless or open temporary shelters in cold-prone areas, the misery of cold-hit people and children could be reduced considerably. To that end, the authorities must act now, to prevent more people from freezing to death.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "I am writing to express my concern about the well-being of school children during the cold spell and to propose a temporary measure that could significantly contribute to their safety. As the temperature drops, it becomes increasingly challenging for students to navigate to and from school in extreme cold weather conditions.In light of this, I propose a thoughtful consideration for temporary school closures during periods of severe cold. This would not only prioritise the safety of our children but also mitigate the risks associated with exposure to harsh weather conditions. Extreme cold weather poses significant health risks, including pneumonia, especially for young children who may not be adequately dressed for such conditions. By temporarily closing schools during severe cold snaps, we can reduce the likelihood of students being exposed to these dangers.In many rural areas students have to go to school on foot. During severe cold weather, it is very unsafe. Closing schools temporarily would alleviate the pressure on families to navigate through hazardous conditions, ensuring the safety of both students and their caregivers.Not all families have the means to provide their children with adequate winter clothing or reliable transportation during extreme cold. Temporarily closing schools would ensure that every child, regardless of their family's socioeconomic status, is protected from the potential harm caused by severe weather conditions.While I understand that closing schools is not a decision to be taken lightly, I believe that the short-term inconvenience is a small price to pay for the long-term safety and well-being of our children. I hope district-wise education authorities, school committees and parents will engage in a thoughtful dialogue on this matter, exploring ways to ensure the protection of our most vulnerable members in our family during the harsh winter months.\nNahida Nishi, mother of two school-going children, Dhaka.",
