Any prospects of a sustained turnaround with better global demand for this Christmas season, have, however, come undone with November\u2019s trade estimates released on Monday. In a double whammy of sorts, not only did the value of outbound shipments sink to the lowest in a little over two years at just $32.1 billion but the import bill also hit a record high of $70 billion, rising 27% year-on-year which is the fastest uptick in more than two years as well. Relative to October, goods exports were 18.1% lower. Three of the last four months have now clocked record-breaking import bills, with $64.3 billion in August and $66.3 billion in October. As in August, November\u2019s import bill spike was led by gold imports that jumped 331.5% from last November to a whopping $14.9 billion. Overall gold imports are now up 49% this year, and while higher prices and seasonal spikes for the festive and wedding season explain some of the uptick, this warrants some examination, especially as exports of gems and jewellery are sputtering, including in the employment-intensive businesses such as diamond polishing and gold ornaments. Gems and jewellery exports are down 10.2% between April and November, while imports have widened over 30%, with November seeing a record high deficit of $14.4 billion in the segment.The overall gap in merchandise trade also expanded to a fresh high of $37.8 billion in November, perhaps the first time that the deficit is higher than the export tally. Apart from precious metals, petroleum also played a key part in this widening, with exports halving to $3.7 billion while imports rose 7.9% to $16.1 billion. Officials have sought to downplay concerns by linking the export slump to lower oil prices, but the same should also hold true for imports. It may well be that the discount gains on Russian oil India had capitalised on to ramp up its exports, are fading, and domestic demand is stronger than before, but economists are a tad puzzled at this phenomenon of recent months. The Commerce Ministry top brass has often argued that rising import bills are not a worry because India is growing faster than the world, much of the imports are directly correlated to, or are inputs for exported goods, and non-oil exports that are rising should remain the focus. But oil and jewellery remain among India\u2019s top tradables, and policymakers must glean a better sense of the dynamics behind this tumult, even if they are unfazed by the expanding trade deficit.

        "full_article": "Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s visit to India, also his first overseas trip in keeping with tradition, marks a continuity in India-Sri Lanka bilateral relations. The joint statement, after his meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, covered aspects similar to the one subsequent to the visit of his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in 2023. Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s assurance that Sri Lanka will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to India\u2019s security and regional stability, on the face of it, appears to be a reiteration of Colombo\u2019s long-standing position, but it was significant in view of a perception that Mr. Dissanayake\u2019s Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is a Left-leaning pro-China party. India viewed his observation as one that could have a bearing on the clearance for Chinese ships visiting Sri Lanka in the light of the Wickremesinghe government\u2019s one-year moratorium (after India\u2019s concerns) on all \u201cforeign research vessels\u201d visits ending next month. In the last 10 years or so, the frequent presence of Chinese ships became the main irritant in bilateral ties. It remains to be seen how far the dispensation will be sensitive to India\u2019s concerns \u2014 the Wickremesinghe\u2019s regime took a stand about six months ago that it \u201ccannot only block China\u201d.That the statements of the two leaders or the joint statement did not touch upon the status of projects by the Adani Group was expected. The joint statement talked of India\u2019s commitment to help Sri Lanka in areas such as agriculture and the digital economy. The proposal to have a joint working group on agriculture is a welcome development. There was a mention of the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement \u2014 14 rounds of negotiations have been held so far. On the fisheries dispute, the two sides apparently stuck to their stated positions but Colombo should help facilitate an early meeting between the fishermen\u2019s associations in both countries. More importantly, there seems to be a nuanced shift, going by the English version of Mr. Modi\u2019s statement at the joint press conference. There is no reference to the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which envisages a measure of autonomy to Provincial Councils, despite Mr. Modi covering matters such as reconciliation, the need for Sri Lanka fulfilling its commitments towards \u201cfully implementing\u201d its Constitution and conducting Provincial Council polls. The JVP ran a virulent campaign against the Amendment, an outcome of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka Accord. As the coalition that Mr. Dissanayake heads secured a massive mandate across the country in the November 14 parliamentary election, he is in a comfortable position to show a new direction to ties with India. It is an opportunity for both countries to resolve their differences.\r Published - December 18, 2024 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Sri Lanka\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        diplomacy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        political parties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        China\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        agriculture\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economy (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        technology (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        constitution\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        fishing industry",

        "full_article": "The state loves playing Big Daddy. It\u2019s beyond its constitutional remit\nOn the last leg of his 10-city India tour, Diljit Dosanjh continues to swat off trolls and tribulations, the latest being the political reading into his spelling Punjab as Panjab. Trump\u2019s Assistant AG-designate Harmeet Dhillon moved things along with her tweet \u2018Pnjab\u2019. In his shows, the headline-making singer-lyricist-actor has taken on TV anchors and authorities on govt\u2019s blind moralistic diktats.\nIt started with a complaint against Dosanjh\u2019s songs\u2019 \u201cimpact on children\u201d that resulted in Telangana govt issuing him directions ahead of his Hyderabad event to avoid numbers on alcohol, drugs and violence. Chandigarh\u2019s child rights body ahead of the Chandigarh concert played school-teacher, advising him against performing songs \u201cpromoting alcohol\u201d. Dosanjh complied, tweaked bits, but also made his point onstage, comparing treatment he\u2019s received to the diet of violence/alcohol depicted in movies \u2013 \u201cyou trouble artistes and singers because they\u2019re soft targets.\u201d He has a point. Stopping Dosanjh singing certain numbers on stage will not even be a blip on Punjab\u2019s triple trouble of alcohol-drugs-violence that\u2019s flourished for decades to benefit the criminal nexus of peddler-police-politician. But authorities opt to view such issues through a lens of morality.\nThe Indian state loves dispensing virtue lessons. Govts, municipalities, certainly panchayats, draw from every regressive norm of extra-judicial and extra-constitutional outfits (every state has its own version) to impose a misplaced morality on the public; actions simply beyond state\u2019s constitutional remit. It\u2019s a loooooong list. Crackdowns on Valentine\u2019s Day, which didn\u2019t stop people falling in love outside social norms. Dress codes in colleges. Teenagers\u2019 sex lives. Banning adult sites. Banning Maharashtra\u2019s dance bars. Banning women in pubs. Restricting nightlife. Mindless censorship of films, books, art. What people won\u2019t eat. No eggs in midday meals. Surveillance of online \u2018behaviour\u2019. Prohibition. Yet, no \u2018morality inspired\u2019 policy has ever served its \u2018cause\u2019, misguided as it is. Point is the state doesn\u2019t let up \u2013 it believes it can issue such diktats. Of course, there are always exceptions \u2013 300 passes for a Judges Lounge in Dosanjh\u2019s Chandigarh concert was quite the VIP treatment. Worth noting also is all directives/rules are imposed on the public \u2013 nary a word on ethics and probity of public office.\nThis is neither in defence of any song or singer, nor endorsing children\u2019s unfettered access to adult material/content. Issue is that in 75 years, govts are still mai-baap mode, basking as a bad parent \u2013 not listening but repeatedly barking \u2018Don\u2019t\u2019. Dosanjh dedicated his Chandigarh concert to Gukesh. Authorities, go figure.\n\n",

Nobody should have a quarrel with celebrity look-alike contests\nA bakery in rapper Drake\u2019s hometown Toronto held a contest to pick his closest look-alike Saturday. A woman with a sprayed-on beard won. Over at Univ of Toronto, professor emeritus Jordan Peterson probably winced. Snobs groaned, for Oct saw a similar contest in NYC for Dune star Timothee Chalamet. Nov had more for Paul Mescal, Harry Styles, Dev Patel, to name a few. World coming to a silly end? Actually, look-alikes aren\u2019t a silly subject. Saddam Hussein had at least three, maybe 10, to dodge assassins and TV appearances. CIA had a psychological profile unit looking at videos to tell the OG Saddam from xeroxes.

Facial recognition software is also notoriously error-prone. Basically, man or machine, we are good at imagining doppelgangers. But there can be too much of a good thing, as when killer cyborgs assume any shape they want in Terminator flicks, or when Agent Smith clones an army of look-alikes in The Matrix Reloaded. That does stretch credulity, but does not boggle as much as the face-swapping in Face/Off that gives a whole different meaning to \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d.

No one wants to know, no one cares about your 4 par saga on the seventh.\nIn a group | Buss, you have had two samosas, then you will whine about acidity, he always overdoes it (Go on then share my medical history with the world).\nThe car is another battlefield | Watch it, don\u2019t go so fast, you just went through a stop sign, change the lane, slow down, you are such a bad driver, watch it, there is a truck 200 metres away.\nIn the house | On complaining about leaving the lights on: You have become old and crusty and grumpy and your memory is falling to pieces. On meeting some friend of hers: Don\u2019t embarrass me and don\u2019t tell those boring old jokes, they are not funny.\nTo the children | Your father did it again, he forgot the name of the host, can you believe it, I mean how can you be so disinterested in those around you, you cannot keep saying boss, tiger, champion, hero to cover up.\nWhich husband has ever said that?\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a welcome decision, the High Court on December 17 restored the provision for the non-party caretaker government system in Bangladesh and the provision for holding referendums to approve any constitutional amendments. The court rightly observed that the 15th Amendment of the constitution\u2014which abolished the non-party caretaker government system\u2014contradicted the constitution's fundamental framework and undermined key democratic principles. Emphasising that there is no legal bar to reinstating the caretaker government system, the court ruled that while the 15th Amendment is not entirely void, it has compromised the fundamental structure of the constitution. In its observations, the court stated that the core of the constitution lies in democracy, which can only be ensured through free, fair, and credible elections.\nUnfortunately, since the passage of the 15th Amendment on June 30, 2011\u2014which annulled the 13th Amendment\u2014Bangladesh has not witnessed a single free or fair election. This has severely damaged the nation's democracy. In fact, it can be argued that democracy effectively ceased to exist under the Awami League regime, which enacted the amendment amid widespread controversy and outrage from nearly all other political parties.\nThe irony is that the 13th Amendment, which introduced a non-party caretaker government system on March 28, 1996\u2014to ensure all possible aid and assistance to the Election Commission in holding general elections\u2014was passed following intense agitation and mass street protests primarily led by the Awami League itself. Yet in 2011, despite extensive consultations carried out by a parliamentary committee led by senior lawmaker Sajeda Chowdhury, which unanimously recommended retaining the caretaker government provision, Sheikh Hasina, the sitting prime minister at the time, chose to abolish it.\nSince then, three parliamentary elections have been held in Bangladesh\u2014in 2014, 2018 and 2024\u2014all of which were either flawed or outright farcical. The 2014 election was boycotted by the main opposition parties; the 2018 election was marred by massive vote rigging the night before polling day; and the 2024 election featured dummy candidates put forth by the Awami League to compensate for the absence of major opposition parties, that once again boycotted it.\nThrough these farcical elections, the Awami League government grew increasingly authoritarian over time, eradicating all political space for opposition parties and turning the country into a one-party state. Given this history and the consistent failure of partisan governments to hold credible elections, it has become evident that the caretaker government system is one of the main safeguards for ensuring free and fair elections in Bangladesh.\nIn light of this, we hope the High Court verdict will restore people's voting rights, establish a system for holding free and fair elections, and re-establish democracy in Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "Seven years. That is how long it has been since hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children were forced to flee their homes in Myanmar, leaving behind everything they knew. In the makeshift camps of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, these children have spent nearly their entire lives in displacement, trapped in a cycle of trauma, poverty and uncertainty. Born into this crisis or carried as infants through borders of despair, they have witnessed horrors no child should ever know. And yet, their future\u2014one full of hope, dreams and opportunity\u2014remains hopelessly out of reach.\nWhat is it like to be a child who has never known peace? Who has never experienced the simple joys of a stable home? This is the cruel reality for the Rohingya children of Bangladesh's refugee camps. They live in a perpetual state of limbo, victims of a political conflict not of their making, with no end in sight. These children, whose futures should be filled with possibility, are instead robbed of the basic rights every child should have\u2014security, education, health and a sense of belonging. In this heartbreaking silence, they are waiting for a future that seems increasingly uncertain.\nThe crisis: A lost childhood\nThe Rohingya refugee crisis is one of the most pressing humanitarian disasters of our time. Nearly a million refugees, half of whom are children, have fled Myanmar's brutal military persecution to seek shelter in Bangladesh. Among them are thousands of children who have known nothing but the confines of overcrowded camps, where survival is a daily struggle. They are caught in a never-ending cycle of displacement, poverty and neglect, facing challenges no child should ever have to endure.\nIn Cox's Bazar, where more than 400,000 Rohingya children live, basic needs such as food, water and safety remain constantly at risk. These children live in shelters made of tarps and bamboo, constantly threatened by natural disasters, fires and violence. The camps are overcrowded, with limited access to essential services. But perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is the lack of opportunity\u2014particularly in education.\nTake, for instance, Shakeera Bibi, a twelve-year-old girl who dreams of becoming a doctor. Shakeera's story is emblematic of the millions of Rohingya children who have been denied the right to grow, learn and thrive. Shakeera, like so many others, is far behind in her studies. While children in her home country would be in the sixth grade by now, Shakeera is still in the second grade, struggling to keep up. The education system in the camps is based on the Myanmar curriculum, which was designed for children who would one day return to Myanmar. But with no clear path to repatriation, this education system has become increasingly irrelevant. The children are receiving a curriculum that doesn't prepare them for a future beyond the camps, leaving them at a profound disadvantage.\nThe education they receive is not only outdated, but also inadequate. Teachers, like Nazim Ullah, work under extremely difficult conditions, often lacking the necessary resources, training and certification to deliver quality education. The classrooms are overcrowded, with hundreds of children crammed into small spaces, often with no proper desks, chairs or even basic teaching materials. For many children, going to school has become a distant dream and their hopes of a better future seem impossible to achieve.\nMalnutrition and health crisis\nThe tragedy doesn't stop with education. Rohingya children in the camps are also suffering from severe malnutrition. They receive three meals a day, these meals are far from nutritious. The lack of access to fresh fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods have left children with stunted growth, weakened immune systems and an increased risk of disease. Malnutrition, particularly in the first years of life, has lifelong consequences, hindering cognitive development and diminishing the chances of these children ever reaching their full potential.\nIn addition to malnutrition, healthcare services in the camps are limited. Many children suffer from preventable diseases and the lack of proper medical care exacerbates their already fragile health. But it's not just physical health that is at risk\u2014mental health has also become a silent crisis. Many of these children have witnessed violence, loss and trauma that no child should ever experience. They have seen their homes destroyed, their families torn apart, and their futures shattered. Yet, there is a severe lack of mental health services to help these children process their trauma and begin to heal.\nThe psychological toll of living in constant fear, uncertainty, and deprivation is immense. Child welfare experts emphasise the urgent need for psychological support, yet the international response has been far too slow and inadequate. Without addressing the mental health needs of these children, we are condemning them to a future marked by the scars of war, poverty and displacement.\nThe safety of children: A constant threat\nThe safety of Rohingya children is also a growing concern. The camps, already overcrowded and poorly maintained, are breeding grounds for violence, trafficking and exploitation. In recent years, reports have emerged of armed attacks on children, including killings and abductions. Many children, like Shakeera's younger siblings, are not allowed to leave their homes because of the dangers they face outside. The camps are increasingly unsafe for children, and parents live in constant fear of what may happen to their children if they venture too far from the shelter of their homes.\nThe lack of legal status for the Rohingya refugees only exacerbates these dangers. As stateless individuals, Rohingya children are denied basic rights, including the right to education, healthcare and protection from exploitation. The absence of legal recognition means these children are more vulnerable to trafficking, early marriage and forced labour. Many children are sent to work to support their families, including Rashid Ullah, an eleven-year-old boy who sells betel leaves to contribute to his family's income. But working in dangerous conditions, with no access to education, only prolongs their suffering.\nA future lost in limbo\nFor these children, the future seems increasingly bleak. They are living in a state of limbo, caught between the trauma of the past and the uncertainty of the future. Many of them, like Rima, a fourteen-year-old girl, express a deep sense of hopelessness. \"We fled for our lives, but we're still in the midst of war. Here, we have no life at all,\" she says, capturing the despair that so many children in the camps feel. The future they once dreamed of now seems impossible to reach, and the world is failing them.\nBut the future doesn't have to be this way. The international community has a responsibility to act. Humanitarian aid is not enough. These children need education, mental health support and legal recognition. They need to be given the tools to break free from the cycle of poverty and displacement. They deserve the opportunity to grow, learn and achieve their dreams. The world cannot afford to forget them.\nThe ultimate solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in repatriation. But until that day comes, we must not let these children remain forgotten. We must not allow them to live in limbo forever. The time to act is now. The world must rise to the challenge and ensure that every Rohingya child can grow, dream and thrive once again. Their future depends on the actions we take today.\nDr Rakib Al Hasan is a young physician, author, activist & international award-winning youth leader of Bangladesh.

        "full_article": "We are both perplexed by the government's decision not to form a committee right now to reinvestigate the 2009 killings at the Pilkhana headquarters of the erstwhile Bangladesh Rifles (BDR). The government's backtracking from the issue is devastating not only for the families who lost their loved ones during the February 25-26, 2009 massacre\u2014in which 74 people, including 57 army officials, were killed\u2014but also for the nation.\n\nAfter Sheikh Hasina's fall, the issue of reinvestigating the carnage came up as many questions regarding the massacre remained unanswered during the Awami League regime. Most of the 152 people sentenced to death, and more than 300 people handed down imprisonment of various terms in relation to the BDR mutiny, were BDR jawans or soldiers. The real culprits and the mastermind were never identified. With a non-political government at the helm of the country, the aggrieved families hoped for a proper investigation, and the interim government initially responded positively.\nFollowing a petition by two lawyers on October 20 seeking the Supreme Court's directive to the government to constitute a national independent committee to investigate the massacre, Home Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told the press on November 4 that the government would do so. Even on December 2, during the first hearing of the petition, the attorney general (AG) said that the process of forming the commission was underway and they would require two weeks to finalise it. However, during the second hearing on December 15, the AG told the court they could not form the commission at this moment because two criminal cases related to the BDR massacre are still pending\u2014one with the Appellate Division and the other with a Dhaka court. It is not clear why the government needed more than a month to divulge this information.\n\nThe Pilkhana massacre, in which the country's top-tier army officials were killed, had a direct implication on our national security. So, it calls for rigorous investigation and a resolute mind to do so. While the interim government may not be able to complete the reinvestigation during its term, it should at least start it. As we look forward to the Supreme Court's order on the issue on January 5, we hope that the enormity of the massacre, its implication on national security, and mostly the suffering of the families of the victims will be taken into account to pave the way for justice.\n",
