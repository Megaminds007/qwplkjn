As Israel tightens its grip over the West Bank, where Jewish settlements have gradually mushroomed, new, local Palestinian resistance groups such as the Jenin Brigade have emerged, carrying out attacks on Israeli soldiers and settlers using home-made weapons and low-tech bombs. Jenin, in the northern West Bank, has emerged as a hotbed of violent Palestinian resistance. Israel carries out raids in the region almost on a daily basis, causing casualties on the Palestinian side. According to the UN, Israel has killed at least 114 Palestinians, including civilians and militants, this year (as of June 12) in the West Bank, while at least 19 Israelis have fallen to Palestinian attacks. Tuesday\u2019s raid was carried out a day after the Israeli cabinet approved plans to build new settlements in the West Bank. After the Eli attack by Palestinian gunmen, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to build 1,000 new settler homes.The West Bank has been burning for quite some time. Israel, which has established checkpoints that criss-cross the occupied territories, has managed to prevent, so far, the rise of another organised resistance after the second Intifada even while deepening the occupation. As hopes for a political solution waned, Palestinians began launching isolated, often suicidal, knife attacks against Israeli soldiers (in what some call the \u2018knife intifada\u2019). But in the latest phase of violence, local Palestinian groups are carrying out bigger attacks and in retaliation, Israel would rain fire on Palestinian villages and demolish the houses of the attackers, with impunity. The Palestinians are divided, with Fatah controlling the West Bank and Islamist Hamas ruling Gaza. The Arab world, which once supported the Palestinian aspiration for nationhood, is now focused on improving ties with Israel. The U.S. and Europe, who are sending billions of dollars and some of their most advanced weapons to Ukraine to help it fight Russia, hardly raise a voice when Israeli troops are killing Palestinians in the occupied territories every day. The status quo in the West Bank and Gaza (blockaded by Israel for over a decade) is a recipe for disaster. Unless there are genuine efforts to freeze the Israeli settlements and open a dialogue between the two sides, the cycle of violence will continue endlessly.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\nPalestine\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

        "full_article": "The Manipur High Court, on Tuesday, granted limited Internet access in designated places in the State after a petition seeking the restoration of net access. Shutdowns began following the violent conflagration on May 3 and there were extensions of restrictions since then, the last one being an extension order on Wednesday, till June 25. The request made is legitimate as shutdowns have a crippling effect on many an economic activity and livelihoods. Citizens have been unable to access vital services such as e-commerce-related activities, except for those who can get exemptions from the shutdowns with government permission. Violent incidents have occurred in the State since May 3 and relations between Meiteis and Kukis remain tense. But the orders seeking to extend the shutdown cite threats to \u201claw and order\u201d and the role of \u201canti-social elements\u201d \u2014 a euphemism for extremists indulging in violent acts or the posting of violence-promoting material \u2014 rather than explicitly seeking to retain these bans because of a public emergency or in the interests of public safety, as required by Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and Telegraph Rules. The Manipur government also told the High Court that the shutdowns were needed to block websites where inflammatory material could be published, but such a sledgehammer approach is clearly problematic.The Supreme Court, in Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India (2020), had held that an indefinite suspension of Internet services was in contravention to the law as freedom of speech and the freedom to carry out commercial work using the Internet was a fundamental right. It also held that such suspensions should adhere to the \u201cprinciple of proportionality and must not extend beyond necessary duration\u201d. Continuing a dragnet suspension in Manipur in this fashion suggests that the government is merely using the shutdown as a substitute for enforcing law and order \u2014 another ploy that the Court had come down heavily upon in this judgment. The situation in Manipur can be tackled effectively by a regime that seeks to restore the confidence of all stakeholders, engages with civil society actors in restoring inter-community dialogue, isolates the extremists and pursues a step-by-step approach towards restoring peace and normalcy. But with a beleaguered Chief Minister at the helm \u2014 a leader who has lost the confidence of many of his colleagues \u2014 and the intransigence of many community representatives and their inability to rise above their ethnic identities to pursue peace, sporadic violence continues even as those displaced are unable to return home. This, however, does not lend to the continuation of the Internet shutdown that has been in place for over a month-and-a-half, and which must end.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\ninternet\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war",

        "full_article": "Overlapping interests between India and US show that a formal alliance is not necessary for a solid relationship:\nPM Modi\u2019s ongoing state visit to the US should finally bury the framework that seeks to understand geopolitics through the prism of alliances. Handy during the Cold War, it\u2019s now irrelevant. Even where formal alliances do exist, such as the one between the US and Japan, their essence has changed since the days of the US-Soviet rivalry. Here, credit\u2019s due to political leadership that read the tea leaves and moved towards prioritising alignments over alliances.\n\nIndia-US relationship over the last 18 years has taken place in the shadow of China\u2019s economic ascent and its subsequent revisionism. India has an unsettled border dispute with China, which makes for overlap of interests with the US. Across administrations in both countries, political leadership has shown the foresight to adapt to an emerging situation with a different playbook. It\u2019s not an isolated example. Across the world countries are showing flexibility in adapting to an era of two economic giants locked in a strategic rivalry.\nIndia itself brings a lot to table today. Four decades of brisk economic growth have put India within striking distance of being the third largest economy after the US and China. At the current rates of growth, India\u2019s economic size should overtake Germany by 2027-28 and Japan by the end of the decade. Modi\u2019s meetings in the US, which include CEOs, are a testament to the global interest in both accessing India\u2019s growing market and also its supply capabilities. The India-US initiative on critical and emerging technologies (iCET) would have been inconceivable a few decades ago as we did not possess the capabilities to generate the interest.\nIndia is at a sweet spot today both because of its own capabilities and the unique aspect of the current big power rivalry. Unlike the Cold War, today\u2019s poles, the US and China, have intertwined economies. This will unravel to some extent. India, therefore, is ideally placed to grab economic opportunities coming out of this process. It\u2019s the confluence of many interests between the two countries that makes for an alliance without formal trappings. It benefits both sides as India has the latitude to pursue its interests, some of which will benefit the US and its allies. Think, for example, of India\u2019s burgeoning diesel and ATF exports to the EU in 2022-23 that cushioned the fallout of Russia sanctions there. That\u2019s why a \u201cswing state\u201d like India is no less important than an ally.\n\n",

This is a particularly sharp question since there\u2019s even a designated body to help raise funds. HEFA, founded in 2017, is a non-profit lending company for higher education institutes\u2019 infrastructure projects. By the end of last year, HEFA had approved 141 projects worth just `46,700 crore, against the target of `1 lakh crore. HEFA would raise funds from private sector \u2013 that was the plan, but no details are available. GOI as equity contributor put in `1 lakh in 2022-23, and zero in 2023-2024. That\u2019s how slow the take-off is.\n\nFunds crunch is hobbling higher education \u2013 11,000 teaching posts are vacant across institutions, including central universities. When fees are jacked up, students either drop out or move overseas, as in the case of medical students. Since 2017, over 30 lakh students have gone abroad, 7. 5 lakh in 2021 alone. GOI last year asked central universities to set up endowments, including FCRA accounts. Even the national capital\u2019s Delhi University is struggling to get funds. The reality is that if institutions want to grow and want to become world-class, reliance on only government funding will get them nowhere.\nThe source to tap is private wealth. India has 169 billionaires; 1,103 individuals with `1,000 crore-plus wealth. NRI corporate leaders and tech czars are more than generous in giving endowments to American universities. But most of them have contributed little to India\u2019s institutions. One reason for that is that the latter don\u2019t have effective sales pitches. IIT Bombay is holding roadshows. Others should follow.\n\u00a0\n\n",

On Thursday, a Dhaka court extended the deadline for submitting a probe report for an unbelievable 101st time, after the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) failed once again to produce it. It may be recalled that after Sagar Sarowar and Meherun Runi were killed on February 11, 2012, the then home minister had said that those involved would be arrested within 48 hours. That initial deadline has now stretched over 11 years, making a total mockery of our justice system.\nSince 2012, journalists and rights advocates have repeatedly demanded answers, but all they got were empty promises and failed deadlines.

        "full_article": "Earlier this month, CNN reported that a British court has denied Wikileaks founder Julian Assange \"permission to appeal an order to extradite him to the United States, where he faces criminal charges under the Espionage Act.\" Although Assange's legal team will continue to explore its options, the snare around his neck is clearly tightening. Time is not on his side. The US and British authorities who are pursuing him can afford to wait for any remaining public interest in his case to dwindle in the face of wars, climate change, anxiety about artificial intelligence, and other global issues.\nBut if we want to manage such challenges, we will need people like Assange. Who else will expose all the abuses and inconvenient truths that those in power want to keep secret \u2013 be it war crimes or social media companies' internal findings about what their platforms are doing to teen girls?\nThe recent small-scale drone attack on the Kremlin is a case in point. While the Ukrainian government denied any involvement (attributing it to the Russian opposition forces), Russian President Vladimir Putin promptly denounced it as a \"terrorist act,\" and some Western observers complained that the Ukrainians were pushing the war too far. But what actually happened? The fact that we do not know means that events are playing out under a dangerous fog of war.\nBut one is also reminded of the last lines in Bertold Brecht's The Threepenny Opera: \"And some are in the darkness / And the others in the light / But you only see those in the light / Those in the darkness you don't see.\" How better to describe today's media age? While mainstream media are full of news about Ukraine, notes journalist Anjan Sundaram, \"enormous wars\" in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and elsewhere receive almost no attention.\nThis asymmetry does not mean we should offer anything less than full support for Ukraine. But it does oblige us to think about how we frame that support. We should reject the idea that Ukraine merits assistance mainly because \"such things should not happen in Europe,\" or because we are \"defending Western civilisation.\" After all, Western civilisation not only ignores the horrors occurring outside its borders; it is often complicit in them.\n\nWar forces us to consider what we do not know, what we do not want to know, and what we know but do not want to care about. We need people like Assange to force such reckonings \u2013 to make us see \"those in the darkness.\"\nInstead, Europeans and other Westerners should recognise that, with the invasion of Ukraine, we have gotten a taste of what has been playing out elsewhere all along \u2013 just beyond our scope of concern. The war forces us to consider what we do not know, what we do not want to know, and what we know but do not want to care about. We need people like Assange to force such reckonings \u2013 to make us see \"those in the darkness.\"\nOf course, one can criticise Assange for focusing exclusively on the liberal West and ignoring even greater injustices in Russia and China. But those injustices are already highly visible in our media. We read about them all the time. If Assange is guilty of applying a double standard, so, too, are Westerners who condemn Iran while turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia.\nAs Matthew 7:3 asks: \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\" Assange has taught us to acknowledge not only the plank in our own eye but also the hidden connections between it and the sawdust in our enemies' eyes. His approach allows us to see anew many of the big struggles that consume our media and politics.\nConsider the conflict between the new populist right and the woke left. In late May, the Davis School District in Utah removed the Bible from its elementary and middle schools after a parent complained that it \"has 'no serious values for minors' because it's pornographic by our new definition\" under a book-ban law passed last year. Is this just a case of Mormons waging a culture war against Christians? On the contrary, the district has since received a request also to review the Book of Mormon for possible violations of the law.\nSo, who is behind these demands? Is it the woke left seeking revenge for bans on material about race and LGBT+ issues? Is it the radicalised right applying strict family-values criteria to its own cherished texts? Ultimately, it does not matter, because both the new right and the woke left have embraced the same logic of intolerance. For all their ideological animosity, they mirror each other. While the woke left wants to dismantle its own political foundation (the European emancipatory tradition), the right may finally have mustered the courage to question the obscenity contained in its own foundational texts.\nIn a cruel irony, the Western democratic tradition of self-criticism has descended into absurdity, sowing the seeds of its own destruction. What issues are languishing in the darkness while this process hogs all the light? The biggest threat to Western democracies is not Assange and the transparency that he represents, but rather the nihilism and self-indulgence that have come to characterise their politics.\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek, professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School, is international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London and the author, most recently, of Heaven in Disorder (OR Books, 2021).\n",

In this connection, a comparative study on the subject points to some attractive features that the local labour market offers the prospective foreign investors. For an example, in the apparel sector, the workers' wage in Bangladesh is 74 per cent cheaper than the minimum wage in China and 35 per cent lower than that in India. The condition evidently provides a considerable cost advantage vis-\u00e0-vis its regional peers. By granting tax payment exemptions for up to three years, relaxing work permit for project-related foreign nationals and employees, giving the advantage of repatriating invested capital, profits, dividends and so on as the government has done should work as inducements for the intending foreign investors in the economy.Then its huge youth force, if oriented properly, can turn Bangladesh into a veritable outsourcing powerhouse, the PwC report further observed. In recognition of the fact that IT and the IT-enabled services are the present-day as well as the future goldmine for outsourcing work, the government already offers 100 per cent tax exemption to this sector until 2024 and the provision could be further extended up to 2030. So far as the capabilities of its working age population's potentialities in this sector are concerned, the country's move two notches up to the 35th position in the A T Kearney's Global Service Index 2021 ranking speaks volumes for that. The government's target of creating over 2,000,000 direct and 50,000 indirect jobs and thereby making it possible to earn to the tune of US$5.0 billion annually through outsourcing is achievable if only, the idea is amply backed up by appropriate policies and fiscal support. To that end, a large number of training centres and hi-tech parks have to be established for developing a professional roadmap with an eye on producing high-tech IT professionals.The population's proven abilities to sustain and forge ahead against all odds are best highlighted by the way Bangladesh emerged stronger from the recent devastating pandemic. The country stood out posting a growth of 6.9 per cent in the thick of the pandemic-wrought fiscal year 2020-21 and beyond in the next fiscal (2021-22) when the rest of the world had been struggling to restore its pre-pandemic state of growth.But there is more to do. Given that the export is still mainly a single-product (apparel, to be specific) sector, the government needs to widen its corridor of incentives to encourage diverge segments of the industry to expedite export diversification. At the same time, to meet the upcoming challenges, especially to mitigate the loss of the preferential trade benefits in the post-graduation dispensation, the government would do well to expedite its ongoing efforts at negotiating Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with its major trading partners. While the nation's growth potential is a dormant asset, the real task will be to translate that possibility into reality. Let the government be up to the task.",

        "full_article": "A post-haste introduction of any system, much as its merit may be, not only fails to achieve the desired results but may also be counterproductive. The introduction of the new education curriculum looks all set to embrace the latter fate. After elapse of almost half of the academic year of the secondary education, there is all-round chaos and anarchy in the imparting of lessons and evaluation of students' performance. Let alone the teachers who are yet to receive training, those received the 5-day training under a special programme called the Dissemination of New Curriculum Scheme of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) are found to be non-compliant of the DSHE directives. Not only are they teaching in the conventional method they were accustomed to before but also subjecting students of class VI and VII to half-yearly examinations for evaluation of student performances. Let it be noted that the curriculum has been introduced to class I and II of the primary schools and class VI and VII at the secondary education level. Now an organising joint-secretary of the association of the headmasters of the country's private secondary educational institutions, according to a report carried in a Bangla contemporary, claims that to his knowledge only 10 per cent schools are following the guidelines of the DSHE for evaluation of students' performances. The rest 90 per cent schools are arranging half-yearly examinations for the classes concerned.His contention is straightforward---the system has been imposed without enough preparation. One could not agree more with him. Here was an excellent system with the potential of revolutionising education in the country but for the putting of the cart before the horse. This was done when the structured questions (otherwise called creative system) were introduced for evaluation of students' merit. A large majority of teachers failed to set questions let alone guide students to use their individual originality and perception for appreciation of an idea---realistic or abstract, subject, situation or occurrences. This time the new system is even more challenging and the 5-day training ---of which two days are spent on introduction and conclusion ---are much too insufficient. Also, a good number of the trainers themselves were not up to the task of making things clear to the trainee teachers. The majority of teachers, a product of the old system with little or no further study to hone their teaching skills, are incapable of grasping the new method. Nor are they keen to learn the art of a novel and demanding system requiring full devotion to it. Unsurprisingly, their eagerness to revert to the old system of teaching and evaluation of student performance is quite understandable. They suddenly find themselves out of their comfort zone and therefore dare take the risk of drawing the ire from the higher authorities.The DSHE is unlikely to take the non-compliance by teachers easy. It issued a notice cautioning the non-compliant teachers and directing headmasters to send the list of such teachers through the district education officers. Here the organising joint-secretary has cited quite an astonishing fact. The fact is that there is a pressure on the headmasters to hold examinations from vested quarters. If exams are not held, note and guide books will have no demand. This goes against the interests of the publishers of those unapproved supplementary books and the teachers involved in writing those. The DSHE has every right to serve notices against non-compliant teachers but does it not also have to do some soul searching? It took a long time to prepare a guideline for students' performance evaluation by which time teachers grew restive. How were the teachers supposed to evaluate the day-to-day classroom performance? For months confused teachers were clueless about it. This was frustrating for the teachers who were looking for directions on how to evaluate students' performances. This further shows that the assignment part was left unattended. If the purpose of the new education curriculum were to serve in letter and spirit, not only teachers but also parents and other local people's occasional involvement in the system is necessary. Because students must talk to the elders to know about the subjects they have for their assignments from both guardians and elders who have practical experiences of the events or situations. Without doing such practical tasks, how can students complete the learning process under the new system? So the crux of the problem lies in the knowledge and skills of teachers who are to undertake the venture of guiding their charges. It is exactly at this point, the 5-day training falls short of requirement which together with the 137,000 teachers yet to be brought under the scanty training only exposes the vulnerability of the system introduced without required preparation. Of the total selected teachers, 30,000 teachers could not receive training for various reasons. Under the programme, 418,000 teachers were supposed to be trained but so far 280,000 teachers have received training and 137,000 teachers could not be brought under the training programme at all. But training was of utmost importance. Better it would be to make fresh recruitment of qualified teachers and give them extensive training before their posting so that they could help teachers not smart enough to be equal to the task. If every school had one such teacher, it would serve the purpose well. Or, otherwise roving teams of trainers could be deployed in every district, if not upazilas, for assisting teachers in carrying out their duties.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "\nAn amendment proposed by a ruling party lawmaker moments before adopting the Bank Company (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday infuriated the otherwise 'accommodative' opposition Jatiya Party members. The amendment that proposed to raise the bank directors' tenure from nine years to twelve drew flak from some JP MPs, who eventually staged a rare walkout in protest. The JP lawmakers alleged that the original amendment bill, or the one recommended by the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry, did not contain any such provision. The amendment in question, they complained, was the outcome of the pressure exerted on the government by a section of powerful sponsor-directors of banks. The amendment in question also suggested that banks did not treat the subsidiaries of 'unwilful' defaulters as defaulters while extending loans. The central bank is to determine whether a borrower is a wilful or unwilful defaulter. The parliament (Jatiya Sangsad) accepted the amendment along with others and passed the bill. The extension of tenure and the provision to extend loans to subsidiaries belonging to the so-called 'unwilful' defaulters must have surprised many. No one expected such amendments when questions have arisen aplenty about the role of a section of directors of different banks. So, suspecting the involvement of some influential quarters in the inclusion of the amendments is quite natural. Experts feel that allowing some people to continue as directors for 12 years would promote instability in the banking sector and reduce the scope for other shareholders to get a place in the bank boards. The adoption of the controversial provision in the Bank Company Act coincides with yet another concession extended by the central bank to the borrowers. In a circular issued on Tuesday last, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) said the borrowers whose loans were not treated as classified until April last will remain unclassified if they repay 50 per cent of their due instalments by June 30 next. The latest relaxation on loan repayment has not gone well with most banks that are now amid a liquidity crunch. Many banks are continuing their daily transactions by taking loans from the money market. However, the relaxation of rules is nothing new. The central bank has been offering concessions even before the Covid-19 pandemic that struck the country in early 2020. The pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine war have only intensified the pace and rate of such concessions. The BB is found extending concessions to the borrowers some days ahead of June or December book closures. The move is aimed at meeting a couple of goals--- helping banks to window dress their non-performing loans (NPLs) and saving some influential borrowers from becoming defaulters. This practice is a proven disaster for the banking industry which finds it truly difficult to bear the huge burden of NPL. Responding to the JP members' criticism of the bank sector management and regulator's role in Parliament, the finance minister, took satisfaction saying that the NPL ratio to outstanding loans had come down to 8.6 per cent in 2023 from more than 13.2 per cent recorded14 years back. The latest monetary policy however terms the NPL in the banking sector as a big burden. The 8.2 ratio is the second highest in South Asia after Sri Lanka. The ratio does not tell everything. The volume of NPL, according to the latest Monetary Policy Statement, was Tk1.31 trillion at the end of March 2023. The amount was Tk 226 billion in 2009. The actual volume of NPL is always more than what the central bank data show. The amount under the rescheduling facility and written-off interest if considered, the total NPL size would be far bigger.Given the current state of affairs in the banking sector, one can hardly pin hope on the much-expected reforms taking place anytime soon. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

The city has been named the seventh least liveable city in the world for the second consecutive year in the Global Liveability Index for 2023. Dhaka city reportedly shares the spot with Zimbabwe's Harare, according to the annual global survey by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a sister organisation to The Economist. The worldwide league table ranks 173 cities on a range of factors, including political and social stability, crime, education and access to healthcare. Dhaka ranked the third worst liveable city in the Global Liveability Index 2019, and the second worst in 2018 Index. It is not difficult to understand that Dhaka has not acquired this position suddenly. It was a gradual process. While other city dwellers and officials concerned were sincerely carrying out their respective duties to upgrade the condition of their cities, we, as a nation neglected this matter. Time has come to ask ourselves: Have we played our roles? We have failed to chalk out any short-term or long-term plans for making Dhaka city more liveable and creating public awareness in this regard. Many people have compromised the interest of the city for personal gains. We hope everyone of us will one day realise the importance of a liveable city and, someday our collective efforts will make this historical city liveable again.\nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
