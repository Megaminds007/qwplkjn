The spectacular fall of the US-backed government has caught everyone by surprise, although for years it was conventional wisdom that the war was lost in Afghanistan. Yet, the US continued its presence and pursued a failed policy of engagement. However, within the past weeks, city after city fell like dominoes to the advancing Taliban forces as members of the Afghan Army either surrendered or abandoned their posts. This led to the fall of the capital without any resistance. The hasty and unplanned evacuation of the US embassy in Kabul was reminiscent of another ignominious defeat of the United States\u2014Saigon in 1975. Often referred to as the \"Saigon Moment\", this came to life one more time, bringing an end to the US military operation launched 20 years ago after the terrorist attacks in the US by Al Qaeda, which was hosted by the then ruling Taliban. The Taliban was dislodged from power in a few weeks and two decades of US presence began.\nSince the fall of Kabul on Sunday, the events leading to the moment have been analysed in extensive detail all around the world, and there have been emotionally charged discussions in the Bangladeshi media as well. Many have expressed their delight at the defeat of the US; some praised the Taliban for their success. Since the Taliban blitz began a few weeks ago after US President Joe Biden declared the timeline of the US withdrawal, and it became evident that the Taliban's victory is all but certain, security experts and analysts of Afghan politics expressed an array of concerns.\nThese fears have been rejected by those who are optimistic of a new beginning in Afghanistan and want to give the Taliban the benefit of the doubt. They are suggesting that this is Taliban 2.0. Implied in the statement is that the Taliban has transformed. They argue that these concerns are only a part of the anti-Taliban campaign on behalf of the West. These explanations and concerns warrant our attention, particularly now that Taliban rule has become the reality.\nA common explanation of the Taliban's victory is that the people of Afghanistan have rejected the foreign power, as they did the British and the former Soviet Union before. Instead, they have chosen their political representatives. This characterisation of the Taliban as a nationalist force has some merit to it. To some extent, the support for the Taliban among Afghan people can be traced back to their nationalist ethos, but it is not clear whether this brand of nationalism has transcended the deep-seated ethnic divide in Afghan society.\nHowever, nationalist ethos alone does not explain the entire phenomenon; the failure of the US-backed government in Kabul bears some responsibility. The parochial nature of the Afghan elite, the lack of inclusive governance, the incessant factional wrangling among them, the rampant corruption and utter disregard for the larger segments of society\u2014all of this together contributed to the emergence of the Taliban as the alternative. While trillions of dollars of US taxpayers' money was poured in, there was a disconnect between reality and perception.\nThe nationalist explanation is also fraught with the problem that the Taliban alone does not represent Afghanistan\u2014those who oppose the Taliban ideology are also part of the national fabric. Afghanistan cannot be imagined without Taliban followers, neither should it be imagined excluding those who do not subscribe to the Taliban ideology. But the most serious inadequacy of the interpretation is that it ignores the political disposition of the Taliban and its record of five years in power between 1996 and 2001.\nExplanations of the Taliban's victory without considering its history and ideological position only offer a partial account, laced with emotion and devoid of the implications. There are those who are elated from ideological considerations, describing the Taliban's victory as a victory of Islam. Whether Taliban rule is consistent with Islamic precepts is an open question at best. The Ulama have long rejected this claim.\nThe concerns about the future of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan can be broadly divided into three strands. First, the nature of governance to be introduced within the country. Second, whether Afghanistan will become a safe haven for international terrorist groups. Third, whether Afghanistan will emerge as a threat to regional peace and stability.\nTaliban rule during 1996-2001 was marked by the absence of inclusivity in politics and governance. The notion of citizenship was absent, let alone their consent in governance. The basic human rights of citizens were absent. The so-called code of conduct was imposed by force, women's fundamental rights were taken away, cultural activities were banned, the education system was restricted, and only religious education was given the status of education, and independent intellectual exercise was admonished. These were justified on the pretext of being distinct characteristics of Islam and Afghan society.\nA particular interpretation of Islam was imposed as the only authentic and acceptable version. The Taliban did not acknowledge the presence of diversity, multidimensionality, or plurality of Islamic thought. Thus far, the Taliban has not given any indication that it would abandon those practices. This is not only a concern of Western nations, but is widespread among Afghans too. The possibility of such austere measures has already frightened people within the country. Even if the Taliban leadership make promises, is there a guarantee that their followers will not continue the old practices in different parts of the country?\nIt is needless to say that Afghanistan was once an al-Qaeda base and training centre. Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan from Sudan around 1996 and under his leadership, al-Qaeda engineered and implemented attacks on US interests, in the United States and elsewhere. Although the Taliban has assured the United States, China and Russia that they will not allow Afghan soil to be used by terrorist groups in the future, experts on Afghanistan believe that it will continue to maintain contacts with al-Qaeda, and the link is \"unbreakable\". Dr Asim Yousafzai, a Professor of International Relations at the University of Maryland and an expert on Afghan politics and security, told the BBC that \"no matter how much Taliban promises, their relations with al-Qaeda are still intact and al-Qaeda is fighting alongside the Taliban in battles against Afghan forces\".\nBesides, such organisations can emerge without state support. There is no guarantee that the Islamic State or al-Qaeda will not build their bases, taking advantage of a chaotic situation and finding ungoverned spaces. This has happened in Sahel and Western Africa. Whether the Taliban will have the capacity to launch operations against such organisations is quite a valid question, as is the question of whether it will cooperate with any international initiative against such organisations. Will those within the Taliban with more extremist proclivity refrain from patronising the regional or transnational terrorist groups? These are the second strand of the concerns.\nThe third concern is how much will be the ideological impact of the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan on countries in South Asia and Central Asia. Harkatul Mujahideen (Huji), a Pakistan-based violent extremist organisation, came into being in support of the Mujahideen. Although the organisation was named Huji in 1988, it was already in existence for quite some time. By 1992, it had expanded into a regional terrorist organisation. Its official journey to Bangladesh began on April 30, 1992\u2014after the fall of Kabul. The Taliban's victory will energise the followers of its ideology throughout the region. In the past 20 years, the Taliban has been able to recruit members without being in power; now, their success is likely to attract more. Pakistan's Taliban, which has helped the Taliban in Afghanistan so far, will gain further strength, and may seek return of their favour.\nIt is imperative to highlight and be vigilant about the use of the manufactured threat of terrorism by states in South and Central Asia to justify the persecution of opponents and silencing of contrarian voices. Authoritarian rulers of the region have been using the presence of violent extremist organisations as an excuse to consolidate their power and legitimise the use of various tools of intimidation. Two decades ago, authoritarian rulers around the world joined the bandwagon of the so-called War on Terror as it provided a carte blanche to engage in unlawful acts. It is necessary for the members of civil society and international community to remain vigilant and resist any kind of attempt to take advantage of the situation.\nThe ball is in the court of the Taliban. It is incumbent on them to behave as a responsible political actor and ensure that Afghanistan is not going back to 1996. It is also imperative to watch what the followers of their ideology are doing. And it is necessary to watch what other governments are doing under the pretext of the Taliban victory.\n\u00a0\nAli Riaz is a Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the Illinois State University, a non-resident Senior Fellow of the Atlantic Council, and the President of the American Institute of Bangladesh Studies (AIBS).\n",

        "full_article": "For nearly a decade, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been promising to deliver \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\" This promise\u2014which he dubbed the China Dream\u2014took a clearer form with the introduction of the two centenary goals: building a \"moderately prosperous society\" by 2021 (the centennial of the founding of the Communist Party of China, CPC) and becoming a \"modern socialist country\" by 2049 (100 years after the founding of the People's Republic). Now, China is one centennial down\u2014and, according to Xi, it has achieved its first goal. Is the China Dream within reach?\nWhile the second centenary goal specifies goals like strength, prosperity, democracy, harmony and cultural advancement, it also represents a vision of China as a global economic and political power. Ultimately, Xi seems to want to build a Pax Sinica, which would compete with\u2014and even replace\u2014the Pax Americana that has prevailed since the end of World War II.\nThese are ambitious goals. But China is no stranger to ambition\u2014or achievement. While the CPC made serious mistakes during the People's Republic's early years, it has since led the country in a remarkable economic and social transformation. For more than three decades, China achieved double-digit annual GDP growth. Hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.\nThis transformation was made possible by \"capitalism with Chinese characteristics\"\u2014a system that has proved far more effective and durable than many expected. The Chinese state played a central role in mobilising resources, building national infrastructure, supporting export firms, and facilitating inflows of foreign capital and technology.\nChina's record proves that an authoritarian political system does not preclude development and in fact can drive rapid progress. In fact, on the question of which political system\u2014dictatorship or democracy\u2014is better suited to economic development, the evidence is ambiguous.\nDaron Acemoglu and James A Robinson have made the case that \"extractive political institutions,\" in which political power is concentrated in the hands of a small group of people, lead to \"extractive economic institutions,\" in which the ruling class exploits the majority. The result, they argue, is weaker incentives for most economic agents to engage in productive economic activities.\nYet China's extractive political institutions have built inclusive economic institutions. Like authoritarian governments in East Asia\u2014such as Lee Kuan Yew's regime in Singapore and Park Chung-hee's government in South Korea\u2014China's one-party, authoritarian government used its power to implement good economic policies, thereby achieving both political stability and strong economic growth.\nThis does not, however, guarantee that the China Dream will become reality. As many commentators have pointed out, China faces tremendous internal and external challenges, which could hamper economic development and fuel political instability.\nFor starters, after decades of strict family-planning policies, China's working-age population is set to shrink by 170 million over the next 30 years. Meanwhile, rates of return on investment have fallen, productivity growth has stagnated, and China's underdeveloped financial system does not necessarily allocate resources to the most productive uses, with unprofitable \"zombie\" enterprises and highly indebted local governments receiving far more than they should.\nToday, China's per capita income\u2014USD 10,484 in 2020\u2014remains far below that of advanced economies, such as Japan (USD 40,146) and the United States (USD 63,416), and the chances of continued rapid gains are fading. The GDP growth rate in 2012-20 averaged 6.5 percent per year\u2014far short of the double-digit figures of the past\u2014and it is expected to decline to three to four percent over the next 30 years.\nMoreover, China's fast-growing private sector could pose a challenge to China's state-capitalist model. Already, large private enterprises are reluctant to follow government directives as they once did.\nChina's leaders are cracking down on those that defy them\u2014most notably, Alibaba founder Jack Ma (for publicly criticising government regulation) and ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing (which flouted the government by going public on the New York Stock Exchange). But, while tech giants do need to be better regulated, this harsh approach could impede entrepreneurship and stifle innovation.\nAll of this could undermine the CPC's legitimacy. With GDP growth flagging, widening income and wealth disparities across regions and social groups threaten to fuel popular frustration, and even political unrest. And this comes at a time when the CPC's capacity to impose its will is dwindling, largely because of the Party's own success in creating a strong middle class, which now comprises more than 700 million people, and it is growing fast, not least because of rapidly expanding education. Over the last 20 years, the enrolment rate in tertiary education skyrocketed, from eight percent to 54 percent.\nAccording to the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset's modernisation theory, the growth of an educated middle class often leads to democratisation, as this group demands the rights, liberties and political participation they come to realise are possible. That is what happened in Korea in the 1980s, and the same could happen in China, though it is difficult to predict what could catalyse such a shift, and when.\nThe external environment is not helping. To sustain economic growth\u2014and thus the CPC's legitimacy\u2014China must retain its position as a major global manufacturer. It needs to continue securing raw materials and intermediate goods, such as semiconductor chips, through a stable global supply chain, and it must continue exporting finished products to the US and other global markets. This will be very difficult to do, unless China can find a painless way out of its ongoing trade and technology war with the US.\nFinally, to gain the world's respect, China will need to start upholding democratic values and norms, and cultivating peaceful relationships with other countries. Pax Americana has survived for so long, because many countries, including China's neighbours, rely heavily on the US for trade, finance, technology and security. They will be reluctant to accept Pax Sinica, unless China offers them something better. And that must begin with pax.\n\u00a0\nLee Jong-Wha, Professor of Economics at Korea University, was chief economist at the Asian Development Bank and a senior adviser for international economic affairs to former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2021.\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "For a significant number of people, including those who had ventured to understand the causes of the historic Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, the Indian Muslim psyche and the supportive separatist politics of that community (propounded and pursued by the Muslim League) were predominantly instrumental in the territorial divide along communal lines. However, it is important to also discuss the political ideology and tactics of the numerically dominant community who were in no small measure responsible for the hugely unsettling Partition as well.\nFrom a historical perspective, it can be seen that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Indian political scene was dominated by mainly Hindu politicians. On the crucial question of mobilising Muslims, the Congress demand for elected councils was not liked by prominent Muslim leaders owing to the fear of Hindu majority rule. The Hindu dominated Congress leadership were not particularly concerned about these apprehensions, as no rival Muslim political organisation came into being until 1906.\nIn From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India, Sekhar Bandyopadhyay wrote that the Hindu revivalism of the 19th century was marked by \"a conceptualisation of a glorious Hindu past, believed to have been degenerated under Muslim rule and threatened by the British\". This revivalism had a strong political overtone, \"dictated by the historical need of sculpting a modern Indian nation\". The use of orthodox Hindu religious symbols for political mobilisation took a more militant form in North India through the Arya Samaj and the Cow Protection Movement, which led to widespread communal violence in 1893. According to Bandyopadhyay, \"the Muslim practice of cow sacrifice at the Bakr-Id festival further increased Hindu veneration of the cow as a sacred symbol\", though in ancient times the cow was not regarded as sacred or inviolable. To the politician, \"the cow question was merely a war cry to arouse the lethargic Hindus\".\nThe increasing need for mobilisation along community lines marked by Hindu revivalism gradually became an established political force. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, nationalism came to be associated with Hindu religious revivalist ideas. Such developments inevitably led to the unhappy consequence of alienating Muslims, who became suspicious of Hindu majority rule.\nPolitical programmes naturally necessitated mass mobilisation and religion was seen as a means to reach the masses. Hindu religious revivalism, therefore, was a main feature of the then emerging politics. The Bhagavad Gita became a source of spiritual inspiration for \"Swadeshi\" volunteers and Hindu religious symbols and imagery were frequently used. This quite clearly alienated the Muslims, who felt that the Hindu religion was expected to become the bond of unity for the whole nation.\nIt is significant to note that mainstream Indian nationalism under the stewardship of the Indian National Congress could not maintain its separation from the blooming Hindu nationalism. Interestingly enough, the Muslims, by no means a homogeneous community with a visible political opinion in the late 19th century, had sectarian differences, linguistic barriers and economic disparities. It was the colonial authorities who largely helped the Muslims in building an image of a homogeneous \"religio-political community\". As Mushirul Hasan explains in Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community and the Politics of Democracy in India, many Muslims \"began to see themselves in the colonial image of being unified, cohesive, and segregated from the Hindus\", and the efforts to homogenise started to construct a Muslim community identity that was later \"enlarged into Muslim nationhood\".\nThe Muslim political leaders largely influenced by the \"Ulama\" rediscovered the inspiration of Islam as a mobilising force. This resulted in a gradual Islamisation of Muslim politics. They demanded an All India Muslim University as a cultural centre of Pan-Indian Islam. The older Muslim leaders and the colonial bureaucracy felt the urgent need for a political organisation for mobilising the Muslim community against the Congress, and also to offer an independent political platform. A clear shift of emphasis from community based on common descent, to a community based on allegiance, to a common faith, became noticeable. Added to this was a fear of the Hindu nationalist demand of annulment of the partition of Bengal, to the disadvantage of Bengali Muslims.\nIn such circumstances, at the Dacca Educational Conference on December 30, 1906, a new party by the nomenclature of All India Muslim League was launched to safeguard the political rights and interests of Muslims. At this point, the majority of educated Muslims had already decided to tread a different path, quite distinct from the so-called nationalist agitation.\nIt would be relevant to recollect here that the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 provided for reserved seats for Muslims in imperial and provincial legislatures. The granting of a separate electorate provided an official legitimacy to their minority status and the separate political identity of Indian Muslims, with the Muslim League representing its public face. However, according to Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, it was the resounding victory of the Indian National Congress that \"gradually brought all\u2026 divergent groups together under the banner of a revived and revitalised Muslim League under the leadership of Jinnah\".\nNoted historian Joya Chatterji in Bengal Divided wrote that, in Bengal at least, the larger and powerful segment of Hindus preferred Partition to avoid being ruled by Muslims (in a similar vein to how many Muslims in other regions feared Hindu majority rule). To prevent this, Hindu leaders exhorted their fellow community members of Hindu majority districts to press for a separate state in the Indian Union. In Bengal, the Hindus created a distinct parallel separatist tone and the Bengal Congress successfully led the movement to divide their own province on a communal basis. Even the last ditch attempts of prominent leaders like Sarat Chandra Bose, KS Roy and HS Suhrawardy to create a united sovereign Bengal was deliberately foiled by the Bengal Congress, which was being aggressively prodded by the communal outfit of the Hindu Mahasabha.\nThe electoral arrangements introduced by the British colonial rulers in India in the 20th century, along with the Communal Award (which extended the separate electorate to Depressed Classes and other minorities), caused significant loss of political power and privileges hitherto exclusively enjoyed by the bhadralok (Hindu Bengali gentry). The emerging assertion of other political powers had to be challenged, and the spectre of Hindu communalism manifested as the most effective weapon. The irony is that the same quarter that waged an all-out movement and succeeded in unsettling the settled fact of the Partition of Bengal in 1911, succeeded once more in 1947, in playing an important role in the fateful Partition of the entire subcontinent.\n\u00a0\nMuhammad Nurul Huda is a former IGP of Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "On two successive days on August 14 and 15, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the 1947 Partition of the subcontinent and its catastrophic fallout on millions of people. On the first day, he took to his official Twitter handle to announce the observance of August 14 as \"Partition Horrors Remembrance Day\" every year. The next day, he reiterated the same during his customary address to the nation from the rampart of the Red Fort in Delhi on the occasion of the 75th Independence Day of India, and described the decision as an \"emotional\" one in memory of all the victims of Partition.\n\"While we celebrate our freedom today, we cannot forget the pain of Partition that still pierces through the heart of all Indians. This has been one of the biggest tragedies of the last century. After attaining freedom, these people were forgotten too soon. Those who were subjected to inhumane circumstances, suffered torturous treatment, they could not even receive a dignified cremation. They must all remain alive and never get erased from our memories. The decision of celebrating Partition Horrors Remembrance Day on the 75th Independence Day is a befitting tribute from every Indian to them,\" said Modi in his Independence Day speech. This was the first time Modi gave such a call since assuming power for the first time more than seven years ago.\nThe significance of making the announcement on August 14 cannot be missed. The independence of India and Pakistan was born out of a two-nation theory based on religion, effected by the British colonial power, that tore asunder the lives of people in the subcontinent, leaving indescribable pain and a deep sense of loss of families, friends, relatives, and home and hearth.\nUnderstandably, Modi's remarks evoked mixed responses and set off discussions in both the traditional and social media. The main question emerging from those discussions is: why did he choose August 14 and 15 to raise the Partition issue? Why did Modi dig up the past to look at India's future, 75 years after Partition? The Indian Express, in its report on August 15, quoted an unnamed \"highly-placed official\" drawing \"a parallel with how other countries mark dark chapters of their history: Holocaust, Slave Trade and Bangladesh's March 25 as Genocide Day\u2026\"\nThe reaction of leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party, including its President JP Nadda, left little doubt about the political context of Modi's decision. Nadda talked about \"appeasement politics\" in a reference to criticise the Congress party. Another senior BJP leader, BL Santhosh, was more forthcoming when he tweeted that the \"Nehruvian legacy and its proponents tried to whitewash the (Partition) tragedy fearing accountability.\" This was clearly aimed at the legacy of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. \"Appeasement\" has been a key component of BJP's anti-Congressism over the decades and an important part of its nationalistic agenda.\nPredictably, the Congress and other opposition parties accused Modi of playing \"polarising politics\" over the sacrifice and trauma of the Partition. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala cited a letter from Modi written to Pakistan PM Imran Khan congratulating the neighbouring country on March 22, the day Muslim League passed the Partition Resolution in 1940. Surjewala suggested that the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day call was made keeping in mind the coming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab early next year.\nThere is nothing wrong in delving into the past to take lessons from it, especially from how the colonial power drew an arbitrary line to divide a subcontinent and injected seeds of religious strife to rule. Remembering the past should also be an occasion to introspect if a section of the people and parties played into the hands of the colonial rulers over Partition. The prime minister made a cogent case for revisiting Partition in order to \"remove the poison of social divisions, disharmony and strengthen the spirit of oneness, social harmony and human empowerment.\"\nHowever, it must be recognised that any discussion on Partition has the potential to make passions run high, with trading of blame for the sufferings that make up the collective trauma in all countries of the subcontinent. To remember the sufferings of only one side of Partition and ignore the other is selective amnesia. How fruitful would it be to recall the horrors of Partition after 75 years, particularly for new generations?\nA society that does not learn from the past is susceptible to faltering again. That is why the utility of the annual exercise of recalling Partition depends, to a large extent, on how and to what end it is used. In looking back, there should be no reopening of old wounds (though some of it may not be altogether unavoidable). Instead, there should be a sober reflection as to how the scars of Partition can be healed.\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent of The Daily Star.

The spike in dengue cases has been a double blow at a time when the healthcare system has been completely overwhelmed by Covid-19, particularly in the capital. What is baffling, however, is the fact that dengue has been visiting us with increasing regularity over the last several years, and yet we were inadequately prepared for it.\nAccording to the DGHS, as of August 17, a total of 6,321 patients have been diagnosed with dengue this year, and 221 dengue patients were admitted to hospitals in the country during the 24 hours ending August 16. All but 22 of them are from Dhaka. Thus, in an attempt to justify the inadequate and delayed response of those in charge of public health, the buck is being passed\u2014conveniently, one may add\u2014on to the public.\nThe adage that prevention is better than cure seems to have been forgotten by the two city administrations of the capital. It seems that the city administrations started their anti-dengue operations later than they should have. And we echo the opinion of the experts that instead of going for timely preventive actions, the operations, which started with fanfare, commenced after the Aedes mosquitoes had ensured the multiplication of their progeny\u2014that is, after their eggs had been hatched and when the cases were on the rise.\nAdmittedly, every health crisis requires the combined efforts of the public and the authorities. However, there is only so much that individuals on their own can do. A vast swathe of spaces in the city, much of which provide the breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes, are public spaces that only the city administrations can attend to. Evidently, the city corporations have not properly cleaned, sprayed or fogged these areas regularly.\nWe would hope that the city corporations would be more proactive in fighting the dengue menace before it gets even more dangerous.

        "full_article": "The news that the government is planning to initiate a phased return to in-person classes starting in September is indeed an encouraging one. According to a report by The Daily Star, education ministry officials said the government is preparing to reopen all educational institutions beginning with universities, where a large number of teachers and students are said to have been fully or partially inoculated. Colleges and schools will follow shortly, again beginning in phases and subsequently increasing class numbers depending on the Covid-19 situation. While talking to reporters, Education Minister Dipu Moni also appeared to confirm the plan, saying \"If the Covid-19 infection rate drops to the lowest level, we can have a situation to reopen all educational institutions.\" Deputy Education Minister Mohibul Hassan also said the government is working on reopening schools, but it all depends on the Covid-19 situation.\nApparently, two factors that will play the decisive role in this regard are the vaccination of enough teachers and students, as well as the Covid-19 infection rates reaching a level safe enough for in-person class attendance. The question is, what chance is there that both will happen at the same time? So far, according to an estimate provided by a ministry official, till the first week of August, 30,000 out of 34,000 public university teachers who registered for the Covid-19 vaccine have received their jabs. Around 1.79 lakh university students also registered, of whom around 80,000 received the first dose and 6,000 received both doses. Meanwhile, all government schoolteachers and 2.78 lakh out of 3.63 lakh non-government teachers at the secondary level have been administered both doses of the vaccine. Still, a lot of teachers and students remain unvaccinated. And even if all of them are inoculated on a priority basis, there is no certainty that the countrywide infection rate will simultaneously go down to create the ideal situation.\nSo for both targets for reopening (vaccination and reduced infection) to reach fruition, it will take a massive effort to tackle the coronavirus through mass vaccination and rigorous infection containment measures countrywide, which, unfortunately, didn't happen since the pandemic began last year. What this means is that we may once again miss the deadline of reopening educational institutions. The fact is, it is because of such unclear and, frankly, unrealistic plans that the government has frequently missed reopening deadlines. The safety of teachers and students is of course paramount, but tying a reopening plan with the rise or fall of infection rates has proved to be ineffective.\nAt this point, many of the decisions seem to be based on mere conjectures rather than sound data. If the September deadline is to work, we must come up with better policies. The government needs to engage experts in formulating a plan that incorporates blended learning as an essential feature of pandemic-time education, relies more on enforcement of health guidelines than on divine intervention to curb infections, is flexible enough to apply to specific areas and situations instead of a fixed, ideal scenario for the whole country, and equally importantly, ensures that there's no digital divide to disrupt learning should re-opening bids fail. After nearly 17 months of all education institutions remaining closed, we must be brave, realistic and at the same time innovative about reopening them, rather than leaving the fate of students to chance.\n",
