The court has taken on the task of distinguishing genuine film criticism from attempts to destroy a movie\u2019s prospects of success through malicious comments, or by threatening to post negative reviews with a view to extorting money. It appears that the court is aware of the implications of any move to restrict or curb disparaging reviews for free speech and freedom of expression, but it remains to be seen how it will be able to balance the commercial interests of film-makers and the freedom of reviewers. Film director Mubeen Rauf had approached the court for a direction to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry and the State Information Technology Department, among others, to ensure that social media influencers and film reviewing vloggers do not publish any reviews of his film Aromalinte Adyathe Pranayam in social media for at least seven days from the date of its release. Remarks and observations made so far in interlocutory orders suggest that the court\u2019s focus is mainly on those who either post anonymously or vloggers with unknown credentials who trash films within hours of their release with apparently malicious intent, and do not threaten the freedom of film reviewers with acknowledged expertise and experience.In an order on October 25, Justice Devan Ramachandran directed that \u201ca close watch on the online platforms shall be maintained, to ensure that anonymous mala fide content is not allowed to circulate; and necessary action under the provisions of the \u201cIT Act\u201d [Information Technology Act] shall be taken and implemented scrupulously without delay\u201d. Interestingly, the order also notes that apparently due to the very pendency of these proceedings, the film made by the petitioner had a good run at the box office as it was spared \u201creview bombing\u201d, the term that has gained currency for the phenomenon of deliberate spoiling of a film\u2019s prospects. The Union government is expected to file its response soon, but a word of caution will be in order. The court\u2019s observation in its latest order that the freedom of those involved in making a film should not be sacrificed at the altar of the \u201cunbridled freedom of expression\u201d of those acting under the impression that they are not governed by any parameters or regulations should not lead to a verdict either curbing the freedom to critically analyse a film or an attempt to restrict the art of criticism. After all, making and reviewing a film are both two aspects of the same right to free speech. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nfilm making\n\n/\n\nreviews\n\n/\n\nonline\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ncomputing and information technology\n\n/\n\nhuman rights",

        "full_article": "The Union government\u2019s move to extend the free foodgrains scheme for the next five years is welcome as it will continue to provide food security to large sections of vulnerable people. Based on National Food Security Act (NFSA) entitlements, the scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), benefits about 80.4 crore people, under the categories of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (poorest of the poor) and priority households. They will continue to receive five kg of rice or wheat or coarse grains a person every month. The provision of free foodgrains was introduced at the all-India level during the COVID-19 pandemic, though in vogue in States such as Tamil Nadu. At the time, the entitlements of NFSA beneficiaries were doubled and the nomenclature of PMGKAY was affixed. Between April 2020 and December 2022, 1,015 lakh tonnes were distributed at a subsidy of \u20b93.45 lakh crore. At the end of 2022, the Centre announced free grains under the normal entitlements to States and Union Territories for a year while discontinuing the enhanced entitlement.On the flip side, the way in which the latest move is sought to be implemented raises questions. At an election rally last week in Durg, Chhattisgarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement, which should be viewed as a violation of the model code of conduct as Mr. Modi used his official position to talk about the extension of the scheme (due to lapse at the end of next month). There was no urgency on his part to have made the announcement then, and in an election rally, especially when there was sufficient time to do so even after the declaration of results, scheduled for December 3. The purpose seems to have been to impress voters, and reap political dividends. There is a view linking the PMGKAY\u2019s previous avatar to the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s victory in the 2022 Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. Even the Congress, which criticised the announcement as an \u201cindication of the continuing economic distress and growing inequalities,\u201d did not find anything amiss. The scheme is meant for the entire country and not just the five States facing elections \u2014 they account for roughly 17% of the total beneficiaries. On the fiscal front, the extension may not cause serious problems as the food subsidy bill is about 7.5% of the revenue receipts of the Union government. On an average, the economic cost of rice and wheat grew by 5.7% annually over the last seven years. Also, the extension will cost about \u20b915,000 crore more each year, which is manageable. However, governments, Centre and States, should ensure the elimination of leakages in the Public Distribution System so that the benefits of the extension go to the deserving.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nChhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2022\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus",

        "full_article": "By Sant Rajinder Singh\nOn November 12 this year, people around the world will celebrate Deepavali, the festival of lights, to mark the victory of good over evil, of light over darkness. There exists another type of light studied by saints and mystics since time immemorial \u2013 the inner Light. This inner Light can be experienced without the help of any technology or outer aides, because it resides within us.\nDeepavali has the ritual of lighting candles and lamps. It illustrates the importance of lighting the lamp within us \u2013 and celebrating the festival of the light of the soul. Experience of this inner Light helps us unravel the deepest mysteries of life.\n\nSo, how can we experience this inner Light? Each of us is born with a spiritual eye, a gateway between and behind the two eyebrows that opens into the inner spiritual world. When, through the process of meditation, we withdraw our attention from the distractions of the outer world and focus it at this gateway, we can connect with the inner Light. As we do so, we awaken to the realities of this existence.\nLiving at the level of our physical senses, we take ourselves to be the body and we focus our attention on the attractions and distractions of the outer world \u2013 a world of impermanence, where lasting happiness and peace are unattainable. It is only when we take our attention away from the outer world and focus it on the spiritual eye, the gateway between the inner and outer worlds, that we can experience the light and love of the inner worlds. Love and light dispel all darkness and enlighten us. In this light, clarity of our vision sets in, and we are able to find our way back to God.\nAs we embark on the inner journey through meditation, we connect with the light of God and are imbued with divine love. We awaken to our true nature as spirit, and having experienced God\u2019s love, we become fearless in the face of all difficulties. Life takes on new meaning as we learn to live in a manner that brings us peace, that brings us closer to God.\nThe Divine is the source of all love, joy, and bliss, and when we connect with His love and Light, we bathe in this same joy and bliss. Like a fluorescent object that glows long after it has been exposed to light, we, too, glow with divine love and Light long after our meditations. Contact with His Light transforms us, and we become ambassadors of divine love, radiating it to all in our orbit as we steadily make our way back Home. To succeed on this journey, we need to patiently perfect our meditation technique and be regular in our practice.\nThis human birth is our opportunity to bask in the inner Light so that we can glow with God\u2019s love. All it takes is the desire to do so. We all carry this light within, and it is through meditation that we can experience it and share it with others, truly celebrating the festival of lights.\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "That the country's food inflation in the past month was the highest - in fact at its record high of 12.56 per cent---in 11 years and nine months could be confounding to both laymen and financial experts but for the dubious business mechanism prevailing here. Last month, globally the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation) Food Price Index was estimated at an average of 120.6 points compared with 121.3 points of September. More significantly, when the index has consistently been declining from its peak of 159.7 points in March 2022, the one of Bangladesh has gone exactly to the opposite direction. Food inflation is, however, not the only economic adversity confronting the nation, particularly the low- and middle-income segments of society, the overall high commodity inflation is giving them a nightmarish time. The overall inflation rose to 9.93 per cent in October from 9.63 in September. Strangely, inflation in rural areas last month almost hit the double digit at 9.99 as against 9.72 in urban locations. What is the explanation then of the Bangladesh market's inflation trend contrary to that of the international market? The fact is that economic slowdown even in the most consumerist societies has curbed demand leading to a drop in prices. But people are forced to rein in their consumerism by slashing first the luxurious and less essential commodities from the family budget. When it comes to basic food items, those are not dispensed with or even cut in quotas unless in desperation. The other conditions remaining more or less same, Bangladesh market ought to have followed the global trend. But it has not. There is no proof that the people here have not curtailed their demand for luxury items, particularly the imported ones, and are ready to pay extra bucks to maintain the living standard they were used to. The domestic trade regime here is unregulated and corrupt to the extent that traders can hold the entire nation hostage. Taking advantage of the government's laxity they have only flexed their muscle until they can even arm-twist the authorities. Free market economy does not give traders the licence to resort to malpractice and create market volatility for lining pockets. The glaring examples of manipulation of market to atrociously raise prices of egg, broiler chicken, onion, spices, cooking oil, sugar and lately potato and once again egg and onion indicate how business circle can contravene trade and commercial rules and consumer rights with impunity.This is what exactly explains the inflation close to the double digit. It would have been much lower ever since the energy prices started falling in international market. In this country, there is no limit to profit making and resorting to dishonest means to achieving that objective. True, supply disruption of energy, raw materials and capital machinery following the Ukraine war was initially responsible for rising cost of production. But when energy price fell and international supply chain restored to a great extent, the positive impact was not at all reflected on the prices of commodities in the domestic market. Had the country's industrial products and agricultural produce followed the global price trend, inflation would be much lower. That the price of coarse flour has declined by 23 per cent is a proof of how the market could get tempered. Remarkably, wheat is mostly imported. Last but not least, if an egg is currently priced at Rs5.52 in India, why should it cost Tk 12-14 in Bangladesh? There is also a need to look into the production system here.",

        "full_article": "How do politicians and generals who order the murder of innocent men, women and children sleep at night? Or is it that over time they become psychologically inured to any feeling of pity, of regret?In our times, many have been the instances of powerful men unleashing their forces against not merely enemy elements arrayed against them but against simple people, who have had no ties to the conflict in question, as well. Is that part of human nature?But if that is human nature - that brutality with no regrets is the characteristic of the human race - how is it that there are men like Antonio Guterres around to demand that the collective punishment being inflicted on Palestinians by Israel should draw to a close? Men like Guterres keep our faith in humanity alive, but when men like Anthony Blinken make it known that a ceasefire cannot go into effect in Gaza until Hamas has been fully destroyed, it is the angry visage of humanity we come up against.Hamas killed 1,400-plus people in its strike on Israel early last month. That was a shame, for Hamas was not waging war against the Israeli army but was crudely going into action against people and families who had nothing to do with its conflict with the state of Israel.If Hamas is guilty of mass murder, it is the state of Israeli response to its act which shocks us all by its barbarity. As many as 10,000 Palestinians, and that number includes 4,000 children, have died in relentless Israeli bombardment of Gaza and the occupied West Bank. So here is a higher degree of mass murder, but Netanyahu will not stop. He is looking for Hamas in Gaza, not caring that his offensive is causing collateral damage of monstrous proportions in the region.So where does war crime begin? Is it with a hundred deaths, with a thousand, with tens of thousands, with millions? The plain principle ought to be one: that where a single innocent individual is murdered by an organised force, where a single woman is raped by an occupying army, it is a war crime. In the later 1980s, General Tikka Khan, asked by a Bangladesh journalist visiting Lahore why his soldiers had murdered so many students and teachers of Dhaka University in cold blood on the night between 25-26 March 1971, the general deadpanned: 'Only two persons were killed as they had been caught in crossfire.'That was of course a lie, for under Tikka and Niazi death and destruction in occupied Bangladesh were of vastly unimaginable proportions. It was a war crime or a series of war crimes which defined the year, criminality that would never be punished by any international tribunal or by the state of Pakistan. Bangladesh, so determined to try the war criminals, eventually was persuaded to let them go. When war crimes are not taken into cognisance by such bodies as the International Criminal Court, it is global politics, the sophistication one expects to be associated with it, which takes a mauling. In Rwanda, the theme of war crimes was properly addressed when the global community ensured the punishment of those responsible for the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994. Rwanda has returned to being a normal country under President Paul Kagame.There are war crimes. And there are crimes against humanity. The ageing collaborators of the Pakistan army who went on trial in Bangladesh in the 2000s were guilty of pushing their fellow Bengalis to persecution and death in 1971. Justice was served when they walked the gallows. And justice was served as well when the Khmer Rouge, having murdered two million of their citizens, were pushed back into the jungles. But Augusto Pinochet and his gang were never punished for the crimes they committed against Chileans following the September 1973 coup against the elected government of President Salvador Allende. It is painful when mass murderers die in bed, are given decent burials and leave behind followers immodest enough to look up to them as saviours of nations. General Suharto and his army systematically engaged in crimes against humanity through murdering anywhere between a million and two million Indonesians suspected to be communists or communist sympathisers. They were never brought to trial for their crimes.War crimes were committed in Iraq and not only by Saddam Hussein in Kurdish Halabja. When Tony Blair and George W. Bush sent their armies into Iraq in spring 2003, they committed war crimes not only because they invaded a sovereign country without provocation but also caused, by their act, a long string of destruction of the civilizational heritage Iraq represented in human history. The International Criminal Court did not take these crimes into account and Blair and Bush have continued to walk around and travel as free men.When war crimes and crimes against humanity are not punished, often in the narrow international interest, it is hypocrisy which issues out of all the noble sentiments voiced on assurance of justice for those who suffer. For decades, thousands of youth in Pakistan's Balochistan province have been killed as well as disappeared by the army. Human rights organisations have questioned such action by the military, but the army has remained untouched. The Taliban have consistently indulged in crimes against women but have remained impervious to any criticism. Myanmar's military has engaged in an ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas, with not the slightest hint that the regime will be in the dock someday.And this general inability or reluctance on the part of the international community to punish those who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity leaves the world open to the commission of misdemeanours by states or those who happen to be their decision-makers. Harry Truman felt no qualms in dropping the atomic bomb on unarmed, innocent Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. That was a clear instance of a war crime, but Truman remained beyond the pale of international law. The Nazis destroyed lives and countries and subsequently were tried at Nuremberg. So were Tojo's imperialist war criminals in Japan.Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic could not escape the law after the crimes they committed in the Balkans. Given the double standards on which the law or international convention has operated in relation to such crimes, there are questions whether or not there will ever be action against Netantahyu and his cohorts over Gaza. The ICC has served an arrest warrant against President Putin. Why is it silent on Netanyahu?War crimes are not merely the deaths of the innocent. They are also an invasion of a country, the continued occupation of land not belonging to the occupiers, the deprivation of food and medicine and water to besieged civilians. War crimes and crimes against humanity, when not punished, are a hint that the world's leaders are complicit in them. Antonio Guterres' is the lonely voice of sanity in these dark days as the bombs and missiles fall on the Palestinians.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Science education is the key element for the future of a nation. An effective science education during early school years should be considered as a stepping stone to produce quality higher education. We have to produce not only doctors and engineers but also quality researchers in core sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and other fields. They will serve as drivers towards further research in sciences, engineering, home-grown technologies and in boosting our knowledge economy. If this is not done, we will remain just technology implementers and consumers rather than become creators of new science and technology. The much-talked-about new curriculum, which will be introduced to school education from January 2024, however, does not seem to have given priority to science education. In this curriculum, there will no longer be separate streams of education for XI and X. With this drastic new reform, a ninth grader will not be able to choose a stream from science, humanities and business studies. And all students will have to study the same curriculum comprising a total of 10 common compulsory subjects. In the existing system, students are required to specialise and study in depth about their areas of interest from ninth grade. Currently, a ninth grader who has selected science as his/her preferred course of education has to study a total of 400 marks science subjects namely physics, chemistry, biology and higher mathematics. But in the new curriculum, all the subjects of science stream will be merged into 100 marks and taught as a single subject titled science. From 2017, a student has to sit for 1300 marks in secondary school certificate (SSC) exam, where science subjects have 400 marks. And it is 31 per cent of the total marks. But in the new curriculum, students will have to study one 100-mark science subject which represents only 10 per cent of the total marks. This new curriculum may create a new problem. After studying only 100-mark science in school, a higher secondary student may not be interested in studying 800-mark science subjects in college. Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students now have to study 200-mark physics, 200-mark chemistry, 200-mark biology and 200-mark mathematics separately. This may decrease the number of science students in HSC and higher levels of education. The new curriculum may make students fear science rather than love the discipline. As a result, we will no longer find doctors, engineers and science researchers the way we get them now. In many countries, students have the opportunity to decide on the subjects of their choice at the secondary level. And physics, chemistry and mathematics are taught separately, not as an integrated science subject. Education system of China requires completion of junior secondary school between 12 and 15 years of age and students there are taught mathematics and physics separately and in detail. Similarly, the UK's secondary students can study the subjects of their choice and choose any subject related to science, arts or social science according to their choice. We need to make core science subjects popular and interesting among our school students so that they can fulfil their dream of becoming a scientist, a doctor or an engineer. The new curriculum should create schoolchildren's interest in science. But condensation of core science subjects like physics, chemistry and biology may make them indifferent to these subjects in the future. [email\u00a0protected]",

They should be drawn towards education and recreational activities so that they can contribute to our society. Unfortunately, many children in Bangladesh are forced into labour mainly because of poverty. The number of labouring children labour is increasing day by day in the country. And it can pose a grave threat to our prosperity and progress. One can find working children about everywhere. Some of them are engaged as transport workers while others work as street vendors and many are seen as trash collectors. The average age of these children is 10. They are supposed to go to school at this age. But they have started working. With the rising levels of inflation, the poor can no longer meet their basic needs even if all members of a family work. Earnings from child labour may provide some relief to these families for the time being. But in the long term, this will be detrimental to both the child and the society at large. Most of the children who work either do not go to school at all or are taken out of school and sent to work. Children are an asset for any nation. However, we are wasting this asset by engaging them in labour. We should follow developed countries like Japan regarding nurturing our children. Sometimes, we focus on various issues rather than prioritise the upbringing of our children. This should come to an end. And we all should create a better environment for our children.
