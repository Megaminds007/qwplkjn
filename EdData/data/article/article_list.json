Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 meet in Bali, served as a reminder of the curious state of affairs in India\u2019s relations with China. That the two Ministers had their second meeting in four months \u2014 Mr. Wang was in New Delhi in March \u2014 indicates both sides see value in continued engagement and remain dissatisfied with the current low level of relations. The problem, however, is that the commonalities appear to end there. Mr. Jaishankar reiterated India\u2019s stand, conveyed to China on numerous occasions since the start of the LAC tensions in 2020, that normalcy would not be possible without a resolution of the boundary crisis and full disengagement from all friction areas. The MEA said the External Affairs Minister called for an early resolution of all outstanding issues, and reiterated the need to sustain the momentum to complete disengagement from all the remaining areas.It is, however, clear that Beijing does not appear to share that view. On the contrary, recent actions suggest Beijing has no desire to resolve the row immediately, which India reasonably sees as a prerequisite for restoring normalcy in relations. Indeed, the official Chinese readout of the Bali talks failed to make a single mention of the LAC crisis, suggesting it is not a priority for Beijing. Instead, it emphasised Beijing\u2019s current interest in engaging with India on multilateral groupings such as BRICS and the SCO, which China and Russia see as valuable platforms to counter the West, and to promote, as Mr. Wang put it, \u201ca fairer international order\u201d. The Chinese military, meanwhile, has dragged its feet in responding with dates for the 16th round of military talks, marking the longest pause since the talks began. At the last round, that was held as long as four months ago on March 11, both sides failed to achieve a breakthrough to disengage at Patrolling Point 15 in Hot Springs. Depsang and Demchok also remain unresolved. There is little expectation in New Delhi for an imminent breakthrough, particularly with domestic politics in China on edge before the Party Congress this fall when Xi Jinping will begin a third term and the military leadership will also see sweeping changes. The Chinese Foreign Minister, in Bali, said both countries \u201cshould push for the early return of bilateral relations to the right track\u201d. That aspiration, however, contrasts sharply with Beijing\u2019s continued unwillingness to restore the status quo of April 2020. The apparent goal appears to be aimed at testing India\u2019s resolve to sustain its forward deployments and to force New Delhi to accept a new normal at the LAC. Until that changes, the stalemate along the borders, and in the relationship, is likely to endure.",

        "full_article": "Bird hits, cracked windshields, component failures, engine compressor surges and blade failures, flight deck indicator and system-related warnings, flight diversions, mid-air engine shutdowns, pressurisation problems, and a case of severe turbulence in the monsoon \u2014 these aviation-related occurrences in Indian skies in recent months, reaching a crest over the last 30 days, with most of them affecting one airline, have raised concerns about air passenger safety. In its \u2018show cause notice\u2019 issued recently to SpiceJet, the carrier in focus, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has highlighted some of the reported events. In its tersely worded observations on the low-cost airline\u2019s operations \u2014 a fleet of narrowbody jets and turboprops \u2014 the aviation regulator has pointed to a \u2018degradation of safety margins\u2019, and touched on 'poor internal oversight\u2019 and \u2018inadequate maintenance actions\u2019. Further, the DGCA has added, a financial assessment (September 2021) could point to a shortage of spares and, therefore, the \u2018invocation\u2019 of flying with a minimum equipment list. In its initial response, the airline management has put forward a defence of being an IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) air carrier. And, second, given the scale of flight operations in India \u2014 according to Ministry of Civil Aviation data, there were 5,268 aircraft movements in the domestic sector, on July 10 \u2014 such incidents are not an aberration. It has even cited an average of 30 such episodes a day, which some official sources have backed, though feebly.The metric is problematic \u2014 even aviation experts concur on this. There is no comparison with a global standard, or even a category breakup. Even worse, and dangerous, is not having the acknowledged root causes addressed. In the DGCA\u2019s Annual Safety Review 2020, edition V, for example, under \u2018Deficient maintenance\u2019 (the objective is to improve the maintenance of Indian registered aircraft), for a target of 2.16 for incidents involving component/system failure per 10,000 flight hours, the achieved performance is 2.39. Similarly, under the number of maintenance errors per 10,000 flight hours, for a target of 1.43, the performance is 1.46. Repeated snags are a red flag, pointing to faults in the safety oversight system. In an ideal ecosystem, issues with safety would be analysed in terms of the rate of occurrence using tiered categorisation, with the goal of reduction to the minimum level. Troublesome too is how an airline continues its operations despite a \u2018show-cause notice\u2019 and during the monsoon. With passenger numbers climbing back to pre-COVID-19 levels, the entry of new airlines, the existing players indicating aggressive fleet expansion plans, and an international safety audit that is happening once too often for India, the regulator needs to be nimble and more vigilant. The industry watchword \u2014 safety \u2014 cannot be glossed over.",

The duo, EPS and OPS, respectively, had commenced the arrangement in 2017. EPS as Tamil Nadu chief minister and party co-convener and OPS as deputy CM-cum-AIADMK convener had joined hands to oust an imprisoned VK Sasikala. She had taken over the party leadership following Jayalalithaa\u2019s death in 2016 but a four-year jail term commencing in February 2017 led to the reins slipping away from her hands.\nThe twists and turns in AIADMK have few parallels in Indian politics. Both OPS and EPS were one-time favourites of Sasikala. Now down-and-out OPS was the first choice for the CM\u2019s post when Jayalalithaa was on her deathbed as he was her handpicked successor on two occasions when she stepped down. But it is dark horse EPS who has shown better realpolitik sense in the three-cornered struggle. After ousting Sasikala, EPS strengthened his control over the government and then clinically marginalised OPS by wooing his loyalists.\nBut if history is any precedent the game of thrones for AIADMK\u2019s top post isn\u2019t over. The executive committee and 2,000-odd-strong general council comprising leaders and office bearers may have spoken but OPS can still test his strength among the cadre. In 1989, this was how Jayalalithaa clawed back after the post-MGR AIADMK split, with most of the then seniors siding with MGR\u2019s widow, Janaki. But then again neither EPS nor OPS has Jayalalithaa\u2019s charisma and the cadre could still be restive that the party lacks a leader with a cult following for the first time in decades.\nNew caste or regional divides could emerge in this situation. OPS joining hands with Sasikala, both being Thevars, may dent AIADMK\u2019s social base. AIADMK\u2019s weakening would suit DMK in the short term. But DMK will equally worry about what political forces will occupy opposition spaces vacated by AIADMK. Palaniswami\u2019s reputation as an effective administrator may have helped AIADMK perform credibly in its 2021 defeat. But Jayalalithaa could storm back to office every time she was in the opposition: AIADMK will expect the same from its new supremo. Can EPS, who is also leader of opposition, match up? His detractors, expelled but not silenced, are certain to play up this big doubt.\n\n",

Except, such an ambition in a glacier-dotted region 3,888 metres above sea level is not as clear-cut as at Prayagraj, which is at 90 metres. Friday\u2019s deadly cloudburst was a tragic reminder of nature\u2019s dangers in the mountains, particularly with IMD\u2019s automatic weather stations unable to catch the highly intense and highly localised rainfall in this remote area.\nReports say that the tents that were washed away after the cloudburst had been set up in a dry riverbed that was actually prone to flooding, to try to maximise the number of people who could be accommodated. The obsession with setting footfall records is costing lives. The Nitish Sengupta committee set up after snowstorms and bad weather killed 243 Amarnath pilgrims in 1996 had suggested a ceiling of 3,000 travellers in any of the sectors in a single day. But if the 8 lakh pilgrims that officials had planned for actually turned up this pilgrimage season, it would mean 18,605 a day.\nCollapsing hill stations also repeat this story every summer, with tourism far exceeding the carrying capacity and causing irreparable environmental degradation. Through our current approaches we can end up destroying the ecology, depositing garbage mountains on top of pristine ones. We will then deprive the next generation of the sublime experiences that have been ours. Not only is a well-researched regulation of visitor inflows into India\u2019s ecologically-fragile tourist centres therefore imperative, it should be understood as preservation not prohibition.

        "full_article": "The recent virtual BRICS summit, which brought together the heads of state and government of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, was interesting as much for what did not happen as for what did. The two-day gathering was marked by some constructive discussions, but also platitudes and pablum, and concluded with a grandly titled but thoroughly anodyne \"Beijing Declaration.\"\nFew doubt the huge potential of the BRICS, which comprises the world's two most populous countries (China and India), a former superpower (Russia), and two of the biggest economies in Latin America and Africa. But the grouping's record since the first annual BRIC meeting in 2009 (South Africa joined the bloc the following year) has mostly been a story of lofty rhetoric and chronic underachievement.\nThe Beijing Declaration states that the BRICS High-Level Dialogue is an opportunity to deepen cooperation in the fight against Covid-19, digital transformation, supply chain resilience and stability, and low carbon development. All these goals are being pursued in a variety of multilateral forums.\nMore hypocritically, the declaration condemned terrorism and called for the finalisation and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism within the United Nations framework. This rang rather hollow, since the summit took place just days after China blocked a joint proposal by India and the US to designate the Pakistan-based terrorist Abdul Rehman Makki as an international terrorist under the provisions of the UN Sanctions Committee.\nIndia and the US have long regarded Pakistan, which notoriously sheltered Osama bin Laden, as an enabler of international terrorism. But Pakistan gets away with it because it is shielded by China at the UN.\nThis was not the first time that China stymied proposals for the Sanctions Committee to list known Pakistan-based terrorists. It has repeatedly blocked efforts to designate as international terrorists Masood Azhar, chief of the UN-proscribed terrorist entity Jaish-e-Mohammed, and others associated with the equally murderous Lashkar-e-Taiba. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointedly stated at the BRICS summit that the group's members should understand each other's security concerns and provide mutual support in the designation of terrorists, adding that this sensitive issue should not be \"politicised.\"\nIt was against this background that China, the summit chair, floated a proposal to enlarge the group by accepting new members, and subsequent reports claimed that Argentina and Iran had applied to join. But the matter was not officially discussed at the meeting and featured only tentatively in the closing declaration.\nUnderlying the enlargement issue are two questions that go to the heart of the BRICS grouping. First, is it a largely economic organisation or a geopolitical one? Second, if the BRICS is primarily a geopolitical bloc, will it become the principal vehicle for the emergence of a global axis led by China and Russia \u2013 a goal that China appears to support and that the proposed enlargement, and the putative candidates, seem intended to serve? In that case, what is India doing in it?\nAs to the first question, the BRIC acronym was initially impelled by a vision of economic cooperation. The four (later five) emerging markets' shared and compatible perspectives on issues of global governance reform certainly provided a raison d'\u00eatre.\nBut their common concerns about the direction of global development and the power of the Western-dominated Bretton Woods institutions meant that the group's agenda was political as well. BRICS seemed to be emerging as the premier platform of the Global South, articulating developing countries' dissent from the so-called Washington Consensus \u2013 a tendency underscored by the addition of South Africa, the only African economy in the G20.\nIn recent years, however, the global environment has changed dramatically. A backlash against globalisation and a US-China trade war, as well as heightened suspicions among US policymakers of China's geopolitical intentions, have been compounded by military hostilities between China and India.\nAs a result, BRICS appears to be undergoing an identity crisis. Indian foreign policy mandarins initially saw the group as a useful platform to increase India's international influence, in keeping with its traditional role as a leader of the developing world. But India is plainly uneasy about efforts to turn the bloc into a geopolitical forum supporting Chinese and Russian interests \u2013 and to enlarge it to include other \"like-minded\" states such as Iran. (Brazil has also maintained a studied silence on Argentina's reported membership application.)\nIndia is said to have had a crucial hand in the drafting of the Beijing Declaration's single reference to the bloc's enlargement, buried deep within the 75-paragraph document. Paragraph 73 states: \"We support promoting discussions among BRICS members on [the] BRICS expansion process. We stress the need to clarify the guiding principles, standards, criteria, and procedures for this expansion process through [the] Sherpas' channel on the basis of full consultation and consensus.\"\nSir Humphrey Appleby, the famously circumlocutory British bureaucrat in the Yes Minister television series, could not have put it better, except perhaps for adding \"in the fullness of time.\" The meaning is clear: \"Full consultation\" is a recipe for indefinite delay, and the insistence on \"consensus\" means that at least one state will ensure that enlargement never happens.\nIt appears that China has not taken India fully into its confidence regarding BRICS expansion plans and the pending applications. India can scarcely be expected to welcome an enlargement of BRICS that is intended to make the bloc more China-centric. There are also the inevitable concerns about whether, given China's patronage, Pakistan would be next in line to join.\nIndia has always been the indispensable swing vowel in the BRICS acronym. If the bloc's current strategic direction and possible enlargement push the country toward the exit, the grouping will become not just unpronounceable, but also unviable.\n\u00a0\nShashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2022www.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "The lead headline in this newspaper on July 4 reminded us of the arrival of an austere time, but another story inside was even more depressing, telling us that, according to the Global Emotions Report 2022, Bangladesh is the seventh saddest nation in the world. And we became miserable well before the onset of high inflation and cost of living crisis. How was it possible? Haven't we got dozens of occasions round the year to celebrate \u2013 some religious, some cultural, and many more political? Or are we about to hear that some quarters opposed to the government and its world-class development have been conspiring against us? The Global Emotions Report, however, is not produced by any of the opposition parties, including the BNP, or any human rights groups. It is a report by the global polling giant Gallup, constructed as part of its annual survey on people's emotional well-being.\nIn its quest for assessing the emotional state of people and what contributes to their happiness or unhappiness, Gallup asks hundreds of thousands of people in 122 countries questions about both positive and negative emotions. Think about how you felt yesterday. Did you smile or laugh a lot? Did you learn or do something interesting? Were you angry? Sad? It also asks whether someone was treated with respect, felt well-rested, or suffered from stress. Gallup asks people to imagine a ladder, with the lowest rung representing the worst possible life and the highest rung representing the best possible life. People rate where they stand today and where they expect to stand in three years. Based on how they respond, Gallup classifies them as thriving, struggling, or suffering.\nAccording to this index, we are not thriving, not even struggling, but are suffering. Every resident of Dhaka knows well how much stress one has to cope with just to survive every day. They don't need the Economist Intelligence Unit to tell them that their capital is the seventh least liveable city in the world. Its pollution level, air quality, noise, availability of clean water, traffic jams \u2013 all rank among the worst. Unless someone is a superhuman having supreme patience, it is quite natural that people would forget to smile, and become angry and sad all the time.\nThough the world is suffering from war, inflation, and a once\u2011in\u2011a-lifetime pandemic, Jon Clifton, the global managing partner of Gallup, said the global rise of unhappiness started long before any of those issues made headlines. In fact, unhappiness has been rising for a decade, he said in the report. And the report identifies five significant contributors to the rise of global unhappiness: Poverty, bad communities, hunger, loneliness, and the scarcity of good work. Economists have long been saying that inequalities are rising alarmingly in our growth strategy, which has not created quality jobs as much as it should be. And the Covid pandemic has worsened it further, increasing poverty and hunger. And now, rising inflation and a prolonged war would certainly be bringing in further distress and despair.\nAnother part of the study has produced the World Happiness Report for the United Nations focusing on different variables, such as income, health, and social support. Could that have a different result that can cheer us up? The World Happiness Report, which has used statistical analysis to determine the world's happiest countries, concluded that Finland retained its standing as the happiest country in the world for the fifth consecutive year. To determine the world's happiest country, researchers analysed comprehensive Gallup polling data from 149 countries for the past three years, specifically monitoring performance in six particular categories: Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make your own life choices, generosity of the general population, and perceptions of internal and external corruption levels.\nUnfortunately, these results won't cheer you up either as Bangladesh ranked 94th on the list. We know that our government attaches the highest importance to making our country a high-growth economy, raising per capita GDP, and graduating to a developing country. So, where do we stand after a decade-long pursuit for economic prosperity and well-being of the people? Besides GDP and life expectancy, among other things, Gallup questions included, \"Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?\" and \"Is corruption widespread throughout the government/businesses in this country or not?\" Would one be mistaken in drawing the conclusion that lack of freedom and widespread corruption, both in public and private sectors, are the reasons that keep us stuck in the lower rankings of global indices?\nOther nations faring as badly as ours in the ranking of sadness or unhappiness are mostly known to be entangled in conflicts. One critical element of the study shows that Bangladesh has done equally badly in both the Positive Experience Index and the Negative Experience Index. In the Positive Experience Index, the 10 lowest-scoring countries include our neighbours Nepal and India, along with Egypt, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Georgia. But their scores in the Negative Experience Index are not so poor.\nThe authors of the report claim that higher scores in the Positive Experience Index indicate that positive emotions are more pervasive in a country. These scores strongly relate to people's perceptions of their living standards, personal freedoms and the presence of social networks. On the contrary, in the Negative Experience Index, the higher the score, the more pervasive negative emotions are in a country. People's experiences with health problems and their ability to afford food are predictive of higher negative scores. Reading such analyses would surely make one even sadder.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist and writes from London, UK. His Twitter handle is @ahmedka1\n\n",

        "full_article": "Today I have set out to write one of my most difficult columns. Difficult, because I am writing about a person who is so intimately entwined in my existence that it will be hard to separate myself from her larger-than-life persona. This is a humble tribute to my late aunt, Salma Khan (lovingly known to the family as Situ), who passed away last week.\nBefore I recount my aunt's multiple contributions and achievements, it may be appropriate to touch upon her challenging childhood.\nSitu was merely a toddler when her father prematurely passed away. Her world suddenly shifted from security to uncertainty, the future turning into a question mark. But her mother \u2013 my grandmother \u2013 took up the difficult task of raising and educating her seven children with great fortitude. Situ grew up under the aegis of a matriarch who never cowed under pressure and did not differentiate between her four sons and three daughters. The unconstrained and liberal environment at home proved ideal for a talented woman like Salma to navigate the rapids of life with utter confidence, ability, and a belief in herself.\nSalma Khan's many accomplishments cannot be encapsulated in a single column, but let me highlight the important ones. Although she herself was comfortably placed in the social structure, Salma was a feminist. She invariably stepped out of her comfort zone and walked the extra mile with the less fortunate. Whether it was fighting for equal rights of female workers or rallying against the domestic violence that women are subjected to \u2013 she left her footprint by challenging the many injustices and inequities. In the process, she raised public awareness and helped reshape our social and political consciousness, especially towards women.\nAs a member of the Planning Commission, she was instrumental in mainstreaming gender issues in the macro framework of the country's Five-Year Plans. She was always unafraid to act; I closely observed her in meetings where she took on a horde of men resisting her ideas. Apart from exceptional courage, her greatest quality was that she did her homework and articulated her viewpoints forcefully and persuasively.\nHer attributes were recognised at international forums. She became the founder chairperson of NGO Coalition on Beijing Process (NCBP), a network of 624 NGOs working towards the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. She distinguished herself as the first Asian chairperson of the UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Having worked in the CEDAW Committee for over 12 years, she left her mark in the UN human rights system. As the ambassador to Indonesia, Salma Khan demonstrated to the international community that women in Bangladesh could rise to the highest levels, not only in politics, but also in the government sector.\nIn her book\u00a0The Fifty Percent: Women in Development and Policy in Bangladesh, Salma Khan gave visibility to the invisible by exposing the exclusion of women from development activities. Her research revealed that, despite being in a disadvantaged socioeconomic situation, and contrary to patriarchal beliefs, women contribute substantially to the economy. She thus inspired women to \"act\" for their rights, rather than be passive dissenters.\nMy narrative about Situ would remain incomplete if I did not write about the woman she was. Recently, while a few of us were in the middle of a discussion on how to be a \"real woman,\" a female friend commented, \"I am so confused trying to decide whether to be a Betty Crocker and bake cakes or a Virginia Woolf and work toward women's emancipation.\" Although the remark was made flippantly, I immediately thought of my aunt Salma, for she was the first woman who taught me that there was no need to make these choices. Real emancipation of a woman lies in forging her own path professionally, socially, and in her personal life. Salma Khan was a good wife (to her extremely supportive husband, Habibullah Khan), a loving mother, a dutiful daughter, a loyal friend, a doting grandmother, and also an excellent professional. Her household chemistry was so well-balanced that her mother and mother-in-law lived with her, under the same roof, in perfect harmony. She believed in strong family ties and made special efforts to lend support to her near and dear ones whenever they needed her. I will never forget that when I was going through a difficult transition in my life, she arrived at my doorstep in remote Yerevan in Armenia to give me moral strength. There are countless ways she helped her relatives, friends, and domestic help \u2013 most of which will perhaps remain unknown.\nMy aunt was the first to tell me about Prof Yunus' work in Grameen Bank and how the programme's income-generating activities empowered women. She made me aware about Brac schools and their impact on girls' education long before I joined the World Bank as an education specialist. This knowledge inspired me to approach development work with passion, not just as a profession. And every time I feel the urge to protest against some inequity or injustice, I remember how Situ implanted a seed that helped me understand how important it is to enable the voices of the disempowered to be heard.\nSalma Khan sparked a dynamic change with long-lasting implications in many lives. For my cousins and I, she was an aunt, a second mother, and a friend. But above all, she was the wind beneath our wings \u2013 as I hope she will be for many young women of the new generation.\nWherever you are Situ, you will always make the champak trees bloom. Rest in peace under their fragrant canopy.\nMilia Ali\u00a0is a Rabindra Sangeet exponent and a former employee of the World Bank.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Words are not enough to express how appalled we are by the increasing incidents of violence against women and girls across Bangladesh. According to a new report by Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), at least 476 women have been raped in the country in the first six months of 2022. Among them, 24 were killed after rape, and six died by suicide.\nOur women and girls have suffered many other forms of violence as well during this period of time. Reportedly, a total of 228 women were victims of domestic violence between January and June this year. Of them, 140 were killed and 42 died by suicide. ASK found that dowry was one of the major reasons behind domestic violence, and the number of dowry-related deaths and suicides are extremely concerning. These numbers are truly horrifying, but we shudder to think what the real picture could be as these numbers were collected from newspaper reports only.\nThese revelations point to the fact that all the efforts made by human rights groups, legal aid organisations, and the media to combat violence against women and children in Bangladesh have hardly yielded any results. And how will they, if the state is not willing to take responsibility to ensure the safety of half of its population?\nIn the cases of rape, it is still the survivors who have to suffer from social stigma, while the perpetrators often roam around freely, further intimidating the victims and their families. When it comes to the legal side of it, there are a number of loopholes that discourage survivors from filing rape cases and pursuing justice. The archaic definition of rape in our law is one of the biggest examples of this. Although the controversial \"two-finger test\" was finally prohibited by the High Court in 2018, a more extensive reform is still needed so that the law can do justice to rape survivors.\nTherefore, if we can't change our mindset towards the victims of such a heinous crime, bring the necessary reforms to our existing laws, sensitise the law enforcement officials and the society at large about the issue, and break the existing culture of impunity that the rapists enjoy, things will not change for our women and girls, and we might continue to witness such high number of rape cases in the coming years.\n",

        "full_article": "This year, we celebrate Eid-ul-Azha amid a number of crises. Thousands of people in Sunamganj, Sylhet, and other parts of Bangladesh have only recently lost all their belongings to one of the most devastating floods seen in a hundred years. The world is experiencing one of the scariest inflationary trends in recent times, which has also spilled over to our country. People all across Bangladesh are struggling to afford even the most basic necessities, while it seems that another wave of the Covid pandemic has begun to rear its head. It is in times like this that the deeper message of Eid-ul-Azha becomes even more important.\nLet us all remember that this Eid is really about sacrificing in the divine way. And what can be more divine than to use some of our material wealth to help out our fellow man and woman? There is no shortage of people around us right now who need help. It is our religious and moral obligation to extend a helping hand to them, and to ensure that they too can have somewhat of a joyous Eid.\nIf sacrifice is what this festival is all about, then the people in distress should be the prime beneficiaries of what we do on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha. This Eid, let us resolve to break away from the temptation to show off our worldly riches, and focus on sharing some of our blessings with the less fortunate. In keeping with the true spirit of Eid, we hope that government and non-government organisations will also come forward with various initiatives that can alleviate some of the sufferings of the people who have been hit badly by the floods and ongoing inflation.\nWe would also like to remind everyone how important it is to maintain proper hygiene during Eid-related ceremonies and distributions. The government must ensure that the city corporations and other local administrations diligently carry out their duties, so that garbage and other waste material don't pile up on our roads and other public places. Finally, we hope that Eid travellers have a safe journey home and back, properly following all the health guidelines to prevent another sizeable outbreak of Covid post-Eid.\nWe wish our readers and patrons a happy and safe Eid. Eid Mubarak!\n",
