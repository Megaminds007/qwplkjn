        "full_article": "The Kerala High Court judgment upholding the Government\u2019s revoking the broadcasting permission given to Malayalam news channel MediaOne is plainly wrong. The I&B Ministry did not renew the channel\u2019s permission to uplink and downlink signals after the Union Home Ministry declined security clearance. The company and some employees challenged the action. The court seems to have endorsed the Government\u2019s stand that it was a national security issue and, therefore, there was no need to observe the principles of natural justice. The Government claimed there were sufficient reasons, even though they were not disclosed. It is unfortunate that the court chose to accept the submission of documents in a sealed cover and agree with the authorities that there were intelligence inputs that warranted the denial of security clearance, without the petitioners being shown the contents. The court\u2019s decision goes against emerging jurisprudence that any restriction on fundamental rights must not only be reasonable, as permitted in the Constitution, but also withstand the test of proportionality. In this case, broadcasting involves the inter-connected rights concerning media freedom, freedom to disseminate information and the freedom to consume information. All these fall under the framework of freedom of speech and expression. The court seems to have accepted the restriction without examining its reasonableness in any way. It has negated not only the channel\u2019s right to broadcast but also its viewers\u2019 right to know.It is astounding that the court dismissed the precedent set in a recent case that national security cannot be used as a pretext to avoid any judicial examination of restrictions imposed by the state. Raising the spectre of national security did not give a free pass to the Government, the court had noted in the case involving allegations of the use of Pegasus, a spyware, against citizens. By claiming that it was in a case that involved the \u2018right to privacy\u2019 and not germane to the MediaOne case, the judge seems to have erred. The need for circumspection against the bogey of national security being raised to deny or curtail fundamental rights is a general principle, and not confined to a particular right. Further, it is plainly unacceptable that the much-derided form of \u2018sealed cover\u2019 justice is being used as an aid to adjudication. Even though courts recognise that the scope for judicial review in matters of national security is limited, any claim that a particular action was based on that ground ought to be substantiated by the Government, even if it is reluctant to disclose all details. If this practice of using confidential intelligence claims to revoke the permission given to a channel to operate is encouraged, freedom of the media will be in great peril.",

In sticking with the status quo, the RBI\u2019s policymakers have underscored that they find themselves trapped in a no man\u2019s land. On the one hand, both the global and domestic economy have suffered a loss of momentum in the wake of the Omicron wave and prognosticating prospects for the recovery has become even more risky in the face of the uncertainty shrouding the pandemic. In India, private consumption, which is the mainstay of domestic demand, shows little signs of regaining traction. Add to the mix the persistent increase in international commodity prices, a surge in volatility in international financial markets and global supply bottlenecks, and the risks to the outlook are further heightened. The most telling manifestation of the RBI\u2019s prognosis for growth is its forecast for GDP expansion in 2022-23 \u2014 a markedly lower 7.8% when compared with the 8.0%-8.5% projection made in the Economic Survey. With the contact-intensive components of the services sector and private investment also becalmed, the central bank in fact expects growth in the next fiscal to sharply tail off over the course of the year: slowing from a 17.2% expansion in Q1, to 4.5% in Q4.Nor is there any respite on the price stability front, the RBI\u2019s brave attempts at downplaying the risks notwithstanding. Consumer Price Index-based inflation is seen peaking in the current, fourth fiscal quarter and averaging 5.7% after \u2018moving close\u2019 to the upper tolerance threshold of 6% in January, according to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. And disconcertingly, even as Mr. Das acknowledges that the hardening of global crude oil prices poses a major upside risk to the outlook for price gains, monetary authorities appear to have plumped for backing their own optimistic assumptions. An expected softening in vegetable prices on account of winter arrivals, and the improving prospects for foodgrains production have prompted them to posit that the \u201cimproving inflation outlook\u201d gives them comfort to continue to keep policy \u2018growth supportive\u2019. With the MPC\u2019s forecast for inflation to average 4.5% over 2022-23 predicated on another significant uncertainty, a normal monsoon, the RBI\u2019s rate setting panel has risked forsaking its primary mandate of ensuring price stability at the altar of imparting a monetary impetus to the economy. At a time when inflation is at multi-decadal highs in a number of countries, prompting several major central banks including the Federal Reserve in the U.S. to start normalising policy, there is a real danger of the RBI falling behind the curve.",

        "full_article": "Since the US sanction on Rab and few of its present and former officials, there have been several comments from our ministers on the topic. On February 5, our venerable foreign minister said, \"Some UN body gave us a list of disappeared people. Later, it was found that many of them actually drowned in the Mediterranean. They have prepared the list with the help of a Bangladeshi organisation. They don't have any research on the matter.\" He also said, \"We spoke with the police and asked them to hold talks with the families of the disappeared people in the presence of journalists. In that discussion, the families of the disappeared people will say when, how and where their family members were taken to and whether they returned.\" On US sanctions, he went on to say, \"The real purpose is not human rights. The real purpose is not even disappearances or murders. The real purpose is to try and reap some benefits from these pressures\u2026 Bangladesh has become an eyesore for some due to its good position strategically, and many countries are highlighting the issue of enforced disappearances in their own interests.\"\nHe said the above following a conference on \"Branding Bangladesh.\" What is the brand value he is trying to inculcate\u2014one of glib and unthinking comments on serious issues?\nIn our view, he has made a mockery of the UN's multilateral accountability process on human rights, to which Bangladesh is a signatory, trivialised our relationship with the US at a time when it needs delicate handling, and demonstrated a most insensitive attitude towards the recent tragedy that our citizens suffered while searching for a better life abroad.\nAbout those who met their tragic demise in the watery grave of the Mediterranean Ocean, he said \"it has been found\" that many of them were in the UN-supplied list of the \"disappeared.\" Does he have a list of those names? When was it made, and by whom? Has he verified its authenticity? And why doesn't he make it public? (On February 9, our respected foreign secretary made similar comments to the press about finding the whereabouts of eight or nine people in the UN list, but giving no clue as to the sources of his information. He was vague and sounded like he was conveying what he had heard, rather than the facts he had in hand.)\nOur foreign minister said, \"We have talked to the police and asked them to speak with the families who will say when and how their family members were taken.\" It seems that he never saw newspaper reports of these families who, year after year, come to the Press Club and, with tearful eyes and with young children crying their hearts out, recount how they lost their loved ones.\nIn reference to the UN, our FM said, \"Some UN body gave us a list.\" Well, the UN body happens to be the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID). It was set up in 1980 and works under the UN Human Rights Council, consisting of five independent experts coming from all over the world. The current experts are from Italy, Lithuania, South Korea, Guinea-Bissau and Argentina\u2014the last being the current chair as well.\nAccording to its latest report (2021), there are 76 \"outstanding cases\" of enforced disappearances. The report, in Paragraph 64, states, \"The Working Group reiterates its concern regarding the situation of enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, which it has been raising in similar reports for several years with scarce engagement by the government. In this regard, the Working Group notes that it has not received replies to any outstanding cases during the reporting period, and that only one case has been clarified by the government since the Working Group transmitted the first case in 1996. The Working Group hopes to receive information on the outstanding cases as soon as possible. Allegations of enforced disappearances, notably those carried out by the members of the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), should be promptly investigated and those responsible prosecuted.\" In Paragraph 65, it states, \"The Working Group reiterates its interest in undertaking a visit to Bangladesh, as expressed in several communications transmitted since 2013.\"\nAs is obvious from the WGEID report, they have been in touch with our government since 1996\u2014in other words, for the last 26 years. Since 2013, the group wanted to visit Bangladesh, but no permission was granted. When the foreign minister accuses WGEID of \"no research,\" the answer lies in the fact that we didn't allow them a fact-finding visit since their first request nine years ago. Why? What have we to hide?\nWe could verify that at least on three occasions\u2014September 2013, November 2013, and October 2015\u2014the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh in Geneva acknowledged the receipt of communication from the Working Group and replied saying, \"The Permanent Mission has the honour to assure that the contents of the communication have been duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities in Bangladesh for necessary inquiry and actions.\"\nSo, what \"necessary inquiry and actions\" have we taken since 2013? The report damningly says \"not received replies to any outstanding case\" and \"only one case has been clarified since 1996.\" Only one case in 26 years? Rab's activities have been singled out in the WGEID reports for years, especially since 2013. But when the US put the sanctions on them, we were surprised and woke up. If we had taken WGEID reports seriously then, we feel certain that this sanction and the attending bad image could have been avoided. I think our foreign ministry owes an explanation to the people and especially to the prime minister as to their inexplicable inaction over more than two decades, and especially since 2013.\nThe \"real reason\" for the sanction by the US, the foreign minister said, is neither human rights nor disappearances but \"to put pressure on us.\" In doing so, he is directly pointing fingers at the US and accusing them of duplicity. How diplomatic is that, especially when you are negotiating for its reversal? Putting pressure is the name of the game in relations between superpowers and the rest\u2014who does not know it? But shouldn't our minister handle it diplomatically, through secret negotiations, subtle messaging, third parties, meetings under different guise, visits, etc? How does it help if he says publicly that we have become an \"eyesore\"? Earlier, when the US did not invite Bangladesh to the Democracy Summit, he said it was possibly because the US only invited \"weak\" democracies. Diplomacy, indeed.\nGlib media responses and accusatory comments about countries who have temporary problems with us do not diplomacy make. Matured engagements do. Our pathological aversion to accountability will not take us very far. Our tendency towards overconfidence due to recent economic success may prove to be counterproductive\u2014in some cases, extremely so.\nPlease do not take our international partners for fools. They deserve our most serious engagement\u2014especially as we now aspire to be a developed country.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The one issue dominating British politics for weeks is nothing other than the partying going on at the heart of the government, at 10 Downing Street, the office-cum-residence of the prime minister. This scandalous partying, now dubbed as \"Partygate\" by the British media, raises serious questions about not only the standards in public life, but whether one of the world's oldest democracies can cling on to its global standing. Prime minister Boris Johnson's influence and grip over the nearly 200-years-old party, the Conservatives, has been quite remarkable and unprecedented.\nJohnson's electoral successes, both in the Brexit referendum and in the 2019 general election, almost made him larger than his party. A veteran of British political journalism, Andrew Marr, wrote in The New York Times, that the Conservatives are in an agonised, self-flagellating panic. Should they get rid of Boris Johnson, their populist leader whose deceit and flouting of lockdown rules has infuriated a chunk of the country and embarrassed his party? Or should they stick with a man who, so far, has kept them in power?\nThe Partygate scandal is not about just one party for which Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in attendance, but over a dozen other similar ones that took place at 10 Downing Street, and which are now contributing to the description of the government's \"partying culture.\" Twelve of those parties are being investigated by London's Metropolitan Police. The police investigation, however, has given PM Johnson some time to stave-off mounting pressure for resignation, by requesting the Cabinet office to withhold publication of the report of the other investigation\u2014 carried out by a top civil servant Sue Gray. Gray, who served as the director-general for Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office from 2012 to 2018, is known for having forced out three ministers during her tenure.\u00a0\nDespite heavy redactions, Gray's report had enough damning elements against the prime minister as it criticised \"failures of leadership and judgement\" at the heart of the British government. The report said, \"At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.\" The scandal has engulfed Johnson's government so much that he had to cancel his prescheduled telephone call to President Putin to talk about the Ukraine crisis and attend parliament instead to table the Sue Gray report and respond to its findings.\nOpinion polls show that the Partygate scandal has severely dented the electoral prospects of the Conservatives, giving the Labour party an advantage varying between 10 and 14 points. At least 15 MPs from his own backbench have openly called for Johnson to quit. The actual number of rebelling MPs, however, is speculated to be three times higher. It is hard for many people outside Britain to understand how Johnson is still holding on to his position, despite losing so much support outside and within his party. The main reason is that he holds a majority of more than 80 seats in the Commons, which frustrates any potential move by opposition parties to have a no-confidence vote.\nThe only option left for his removal is a clear, no-confidence vote within his party. But the Conservatives' internal rule stipulates that discussing any proposal to replace the leader requires a written submission to the chairman of the backbench committee (known as 1922 committee) by at least 15 percent of its MPs. This means that about 54 MPs\u00a0 have to officially call for a leadership change. But that does not automatically seal the fate of an incumbent leader of the Tory party. The party rules say that if the current leader is able to retain a majority within the parliamentary party, his/her position is secured for at least another year.\nDespite such rigid rules of the Tory party, many pundits say there are signs that, despite Johnson's long history of beating the odds and pulling through rough waters, this Partygate scandal could end his premiership. According to them, if the police investigation results in him being handed a penalty for breaking lockdown rules or if Sue Gray's final report finds he lied to parliament, then it would be terminal. Few others say, if the upcoming local elections in May show that Johnson is no longer a vote-winner, as the opinion polls have been indicating consistently, then a sufficient number of party MPs would rally round his likely challengers.\nAmidst the Partygate turmoil that prompted a series of high profile resignations and clearing out at Downing Street, and an attempt to revamp his administration, PM Johnson has come under renewed attack from all sides following an unruly mob confronting the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outside parliament on Monday. MPs from all sides angrily accused Boris Johnson of whipping up political poison by falsely accusing Sir Keir of protecting a notorious paedophile, Jimmy Savile. Johnson provoked widespread fury last week when he suggested Sir Keir had protected Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions. This latest incident has now fueled speculation that many more Tory MPs will have pens poised to write to the 1922 committee chief demanding a vote of confidence.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed is an independent journalist who writes from London.

        "full_article": "Eleven zebras, one lioness and a tiger died within a span of weeks recently at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Safari Park in Gazipur. The reasons behind their deaths remain unclear as the authorities keep suggesting various possibilities, from anthrax and other bacterial infections to negligence of concerned officials at the park. In order to identify the causes, a five-member investigation committee was formed on January 26 by the environment ministry, which was supposed to have submitted the investigation report within 10 working days, which ended on February 8, 2022. Reportedly, two more animals\u2014a tiger and a lion\u2014are currently ill at the same park.\nBut the above case is not an outlier. A 12-year-old lioness called Moni died\u2014of a cardiac arrest, allegedly\u2014at the Dhaka National Zoo on January 25, and media reports suggest the incident was kept low-key by the zoo authorities. When asked about why the incident was not made public earlier, the zoo's curator reportedly said, \"We log it in our records, no need to gather the press for it.\"\nIn Rangpur Zoo, its lone tigress, Shaon, died on February 4, after she had been refusing food and water for about two weeks. In one report, the cause of death has been attributed to the cold, while zoo authorities suggested Shaon had died of old age complications.\nThe recent animal deaths are making headlines due to their sheer number in a short span of time, and the mysterious circumstances under which they occurred. However, over the years, animals old and young have died in our zoos, with the authorities failing to provide convincing information about most of the deaths.\nThe recent deaths have raised many questions about the efficiency, sincerity and motivations of the safari park officials, the medical support that is provided to the animals there, the competence of their medical staff, and the overall living conditions of the animals.\nUnfortunately, on Sunday, Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim ruled out negligence of officials as the issue, rather suggesting that the deaths had been caused by bacterial infection. This statement is problematic for two reasons. First, this suggestion by the minister in the middle of an ongoing investigation is highly irresponsible, as his words might influence the outcome of the probe. Secondly, on what basis is he suggesting that the park officials were not negligent? Is it just another thoughtless, generalised comment\u2014so characteristic of our politicians\u2014or does he have concrete evidence to support his comment? Even if the animals have died of bacterial infection, how did they come into contact with the bacteria in the first place? If the sources of the bacteria are their food or living conditions, are they not a marker of the park officials' negligence? And why could they not be treated before they succumbed to their illness?\nMoreover, the attempt of the safari park authorities to keep under wraps the death of the tiger adds to the case against the officials involved. Why did they not come out with the news of the tiger's death earlier? Why did the local MP have to visit the park and enquire about rumours about the tiger's death for the truth to come out?\nIt has been suggested that the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police is going to help with the environment ministry's investigation. Moreover, a three-member investigation committee has also been formed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. Three of the concerned officials have been suspended to aid a free and fair investigation. These are welcome moves and we hope that the investigation committees will do their work properly and submit impactful reports that will help in averting the threat to animals living at the safari park.\nHowever, the authorities should also look into the living conditions of animals in zoos across the country. We do not want more animals meeting the same grim fate as Heera, Moni and Shaon. Going by the dilapidated condition of our zoos, it is apparent that there is ample room for improvement. However, the system seems to have accepted this sorry state as the standard.\nPerhaps a shakeup is now needed for the system to come out of its hibernation state and take meaningful measures to make zoos more habitable for animals. Perhaps we need more officials who are sensitive to the needs of the animals and understand the concept of animal rights. While there is an entire debate over the ethical aspect of keeping animals confined in zoos\u2014perhaps best-saved for another day\u2014right now, we have to focus on the fact that we need to make our zoos safer for their inhabitants.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Today marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and Japan. As the ambassador of Japan to Bangladesh, I am honoured to celebrate this memorable day with the people of Bangladesh.\nOn February 10, 1972, Japan recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign country soon after its independence. In the letter addressed to Mohammed Abdus Samad Azad, then minister of foreign affairs of Bangladesh, Fukuda Takeo, then minister of foreign affairs of Japan, expressed Japan's wish for the prosperity of Bangladesh and its eagerness to promote friendly relations between the two countries. In his reply, Azad expressed his firm determination to rebuild Bangladesh's economy from the Liberation War through cooperation with Japan. Now, both countries have fulfilled their wish. The friendship and cooperation between Bangladesh and Japan have become more robust than ever, and the economic development of Bangladesh has been remarkable.\nThe 50 years of diplomatic relationship between Bangladesh and Japan has always been a \"heart to heart\" relationship. In January 1972, before Japan recognised Bangladesh, Fukuda emphasised the importance of establishing a \"heart to heart\" relationship with other countries. Then, it was Hayakawa Takashi, a Diet member of Japan, who made efforts to put the spirit into practice.\nIn March 1972, Hayakawa visited Bangladesh as goodwill envoy of the Government of Japan. While observing a devastated Bangladesh due to the Liberation War, he felt people's enthusiasm and talked thoroughly with the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman about future nation-building. The Jamuna Bridge, raised by Bangabandhu in the discussion, was printed on Bangladesh's Tk 100 banknote after its construction, which became a symbol of friendship between Japan and Bangladesh. In October 1973, Bangabandhu visited Japan and received an enthusiastic welcome from the Japanese people amidst the wave of the two countries' flags, which have a brotherly resemblance. Seeing Japan's post-war reconstruction, Bangabandhu thought of the recovery and development of Bangladesh. His successful visit paved the way for the subsequent excellent cooperation.\nIn 1973, the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) began coming to Bangladesh. JOCV worked together with the local community for the development of Bangladesh, building trust. In 1974, a high-powered business delegation headed by Nagano Shigeo, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, visited Bangladesh. The mission visited every corner of the new Bangladesh, including Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Sundarbans, Cumilla, Kaptai, Sirajganj and Khulna. They found great potential in the country through face-to-face interactions with the people of Bangladesh. From the very beginning of our relationship, Japan demonstrated its willingness to contribute to the development of Bangladesh in various fields, ranging from grassroots support and human resource development to infrastructure-building.\nA saying goes, \"A friend in need is a friend indeed.\" As Kishida Fumio, prime minister of Japan, emphasises in his message for the 50th anniversary, Japan has always been a true friend of Bangladesh in difficult times. It has not changed at all, even during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Japan became one of the first countries to start providing vaccines to Bangladesh in July last year. Until today, about 4.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and budget support of 75 billion yen have been given to Bangladesh. Japan will continuously cooperate with Bangladesh to overcome this Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe 50th anniversary of the Japan-Bangladesh diplomatic relationship will elevate the cooperative relationship between the two countries to a new height. JICA's large-scale infrastructure projects will promote the Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt (BIG-B) initiative, launched by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and then Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo in 2014. In December this year, Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line 6 will start its commercial operation, and Bangladesh Special Economic Zone in Araihazar will be ready for international investment. After that, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport expansion, Matarbari Deep Sea Port and Bangabandhu Railway Bridge will be in line.\nThe completion of these megaprojects will be a game-changer for Bangladesh. Bangladesh's economic development and prosperity are vital for the stability of the entire Indo-Pacific region, as Bangladesh connects India and Asean. At the celebration ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the independence of Bangladesh and the 100th birth anniversary of Bangabandhu last March, Dhaka played a pivotal role as a centre of regional diplomacy and connectivity under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. That showed that Bangladesh owns high stature in the region against the backdrop of its rapid economic growth and political stability. Bangladesh will undoubtedly play an even more significant role in promoting regional cooperation and addressing the global agenda.\nIn this regard, Bangladesh's current efforts for providing shelters and humanitarian assistance to the displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar are worthy of our appreciation. On January 28 this year, the Government of Japan has decided as the first donor to fund a total of USD 2 million to UNHCR and WFP for the humanitarian and protection needs of the Rohingya people on Bhasan Char. Japan will continue working towards early repatriation together with the Government of Bangladesh and the international community.\nIn 2026, Bangladesh will graduate from the least developed countries (LDC) status and aims to become a developed country in 2041 by achieving \"Vision 2041.\" Japan will continue to stand by Bangladesh in its development journey. Japan will extend practical cooperation to Bangladesh as a partner to realise a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)\" vision of peace, stability, and prosperity in the region. Such cooperation includes quality infrastructure, connectivity and maritime safety.\nIn this milestone year, Japan hopes to improve the business environment. We should build a win-win partnership for expanding trade and investment. Japan will also make the utmost effort to deepen the mutual understanding and exchange of the two peoples. To that end, we look forward to working \"hand in hand\" with the government and the people of Bangladesh. Let's further develop our \"Comprehensive Partnership\" to a more strategic one. Japan will not stop moving forward to further widen the horizon of \"heart to heart\" relationship between our two countries.\n\u00a0\nIto Naoki\u00a0is the ambassador of Japan to Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "We are quite concerned at the increasing incidents of cybercrimes against women and children in Bangladesh. According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), 70 percent of the victims of cybercrimes are women. The rights organisation has found this after analysing data from a recent police survey. In a separate survey, the ministry of posts, telecommunications and information technology has found that 49 percent of schoolchildren are becoming victims of cyberbullying. The real situation can be worse, as many victims or their families do not report these crimes to the police, fearing social stigma or further victimisation.\nCybercrimes have increased particularly during this pandemic which led to a rise in the number of internet users. From January 2020 to August 2021, the number of internet users has increased by 26.21 million in the country, according to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. A large portion of them are teenagers who are using internet mainly for academic purposes, as schools and colleges have resorted to online classes to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\nUnfortunately, most teenagers and young adults have no awareness of the danger internet poses. A survey conducted by the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh last year found that teenage girls are less aware than boys of the risks of cyberbullying, stalking, harassment, sexual abuse and production or consumption of illegal materials. Although police introduced a helpline to provide support to the victims in 2020, few people used that to report crimes. And those who did and sought help, less than half of them got any legal advice and assistance, ASK found.\nAmidst such a grim situation, what needs to be done on a priority basis is raise awareness among young users about the harmful aspects of the internet. ASK has also identified some reasons\u2014such as lack of importance given to children's mental health, domestic violence, absence of sexual and reproductive health and cyber security education\u2014behind the increase in cybercrimes. Addressing these issues is crucial, and parents and educational institutions have a key role to play here.\nOf course, a major part of the responsibility to stop such crimes falls on our police force, especially the cybercrime fighting unit. Since police have a specific unit to work on the issue, they must have the willingness and required manpower and tools to reach out to all the victims who report to them and provide them prompt and necessary support.

        "full_article": "Hard on the heels of the price hikes of diesel and kerosene in last November, and amid continuing rise in edible oil prices, the price of water in the capital is also set to see a sharp rise after Dhaka Wasa proposed a 20 percent hike in tariffs. If the government approves it, it would cause a big dent on the residents' wallet, not to mention the domino effect it may have on the prices of kitchen market commodities, especially with the month of Ramadan approaching. At a time when people are already at their wit's end trying to cope with the pandemic-induced economic pain and adjust their budget to erratic market behaviour, the Wasa proposal comes as a big shock indeed.\nThe proposal for increasing water price by 20 percent is not comprehensible, as technically, Dhaka Wasa can increase the tariff by 5 percent each year as per Section 22 of the Wasa Act, 1996. But in his defence, Dhaka Wasa's managing director said that a 5 percent hike is not \"sufficient\" as it cannot match the production cost even with the government's subsidy of Tk 10 per litre of water. As per the new proposal, the price of each unit (1,000 litres) of water should be Tk 21 for residential use and Tk 55 for commercial use, whereas the current prices are Tk 15.18 and Tk 42 respectively. As well as bringing down subsidies, the other reason cited for the proposed hike is the need to pay back Wasa's foreign loans with interest.\nUnfortunately, while Wasa officials seem keen to enhance water tariff at every opportunity\u2014which they have done twice in the last two years and 15 times in the last 13 years\u2014they have never shown much enthusiasm in fulfilling their pledge of providing clean, safe drinking water to the vast majority of the capital's over two crore residents. Seldom do they feel the need to answer for their failure to do so, while residents continue to suffer the brunt of their lack of competence, vision and accountability. The proposal for a water price hike is especially troubling with all the talk of raising the prices of electricity, gas and fertilisers by March.\nThe combined effect of all these price hikes coming in quick succession would be unimaginable. The pandemic has already caused immeasurable suffering and hardship to the people, pushing a vast number of them beyond the poverty line. Unemployment has reached an alarming level. People are also struggling with the rising healthcare costs. This is no time to compound their suffering. We urge the government to see the bigger picture here and not entertain the misguided Dhaka Wasa proposal. The government should also find alternative ways to fund or manage its subsidies.\n",
