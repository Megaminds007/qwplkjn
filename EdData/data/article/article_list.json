A 22-year-old man, from Thrissur in Kerala, died due to suspected monkeypox symptoms, a day after which Kerala\u2019s Health Minister Veena George said he had tested positive in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The patient was undergoing treatment in a private hospital for severe fatigue and brain fever, six days after his arrival in the State on July 21. His swab samples have been sent to the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) centre in Alappuzha for confirmation. Death from the virus is reportedly rare, though as the experience of COVID-19 shows, it could vary depending on the population at hand. According to the World Health Organization, the case fatality ratio of monkeypox has historically ranged from 0% to 11% in the general population and has been higher among young children. In recent times, the case fatality ratio has been around 3%-6%. While the disease has been around in Africa since the 1970s, it has also been reported in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel. In 2017, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak, with a case fatality ratio of approximately 3%; cases continue to be reported. It is the surge outside Africa, in 78 countries, that has elevated the risk profile of the disease along with the realisation that there are considerable gaps in knowledge on whether the disease poses a greater risk to specific population groups, just as it was eventually determined for COVID-19. In monkeypox deaths in Brazil and Spain, the patients were reported to have had serious associated syndromes such as encephalitis and lymphoma, though it is unclear what role the virus played in their disease outcome.That monkeypox spreads mainly through sexual transmission and close contact \u2014 it is not an airborne disease \u2014 should not be of comfort to health authorities. The death in Thrissur highlights the need for a thorough probe as well as a public disclosure on the case progression. For instance, Kerala\u2019s health authorities say the person was admitted not after being confirmed to be monkeypox-positive but due to a fever and experiencing fatigue. It was only later that the rashes and blisters showed up. Intriguingly, that he had tested positive for monkeypox was disclosed to the health authorities a day before he died. It is to rule out a misdiagnosis of monkeypox (by the UAE) that the NIV has undertaken a re-test. India has announced a task force to monitor the disease spread. The Indian Council of Medical Research has isolated the strain of the virus and invited vaccine makers to develop a vaccine. It has also invited proposals to develop diagnostic kits. While it is fortunate that the disease so far appears to be self-limiting, the Government must not be slack in transparently communicating the potential severity of the disease.",

        "full_article": "The call by Home Minister Amit Shah last week for engineering, law and medicine to be taught in Indian languages is a well-intentioned one. His stand is in sync with one of the focal points of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, i.e., the promotion of Indian languages in higher education. The NEP provides for more higher educational institutions and programmes in higher education to use the mother tongue or local language as a medium of instruction, besides offering programmes bilingually. The rationale behind Mr. Shah\u2019s call is that 95% of students, who receive primary education in their mother tongue, should not be left out in their pursuit of higher studies. In recent years, substantive measures have been taken to make engineering courses available in Indian languages, if the statement by Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in the Lok Sabha in December 2021 is an indication. Effective 2021-22, the AICTE granted approval to 19 engineering colleges in 10 States for having engineering courses in six Indian languages. The Council has also developed an \u201cAICTE Translation Automation AI Tool\u201d that translates English online courses in 11 Indian languages. SWAYAM, an open online courses platform of the Central government, has been offering some popular courses in Indian languages too. The import of this is that the goal of covering all sections as far as higher education is concerned should become a reality. But, at the same time, one should not gloss over the exercise not having yielded results. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, the bid to impart engineering education through the Tamil medium has not created any impact despite the principal political players using language as a political tool. In the field of law \u2014 before the subject is taught in the Indian languages \u2014 the Central government should try to impress upon the judiciary to allow the use of Indian languages in court proceedings.While there is no need for haste in making educational materials available in Indian languages, the approach and methodology should be discussed threadbare by policymakers and educationists, without political pressure or interference. What should be made obvious is that the use of English, wherever desirable, should be retained, with no aversion shown on the ground that it is a \u201cforeign\u201d language. It would not be out of place to highlight issues about standards and the quality of teaching of Indian languages in schools. Be it Gujarati or Hindi or even Tamil, students have been found to fail in their public examinations in language papers. There is also the point of diminished employability outside the region of the language. If the Government is serious in taking forward its stated position of creating higher education access to certain sections, it should dispassionately study the advantages and the disadvantages.",

        "full_article": "GoI\u2019s social media posts said that 6.7 million income tax returns had been filed till 11pm on July 31, an hour before the deadline. To put that number in context, there are 617 million individuals with a PAN, of whom 467 million have also linked it with their Aadhaar. The number of PAN allottees exceeds the size of the workforce. On paper, India\u2019s potential tax base seems unusually large. However, from the practical standpoint of revenue raised, it\u2019s despairingly narrow.\nOn account of pandemic-induced distortions in the last two years, the five years between 2015 and 2020 are the best recent period to get a sense of trends in the tax base. Only 20% of non-corporate assessees in 2015-16 had an income exceeding Rs 5 lakh. Five years later, it had increased to 24%. But the increase in the size of the base that represents the potential for meaningful tax collection was less than 1 percentage point in a year. In 2018-19, about half of the 58.7 million returns filed among all taxpayers showed no income. Therefore, the slice of the potential tax base that yields revenue is tiny.\nCorporate tax assessments give an even clearer picture of the narrowness of the base. GoI\u2019s budget showed a corporate tax base of 9.17 lakh firms in 2019-20. Of this, a mere 0.2% or 1,843 companies contributed 69% of the corporate tax. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the budget\u2019s performance is influenced by less than 2,000 firms. A key reason for the narrow base is the tax exemption window, described by the budget as indirect subsidy to preferred taxpayers. A wide exemption window and high statutory rates have given India the worst of both worlds.\nTo illustrate, firms with a pre-tax profit above Rs 500 crore had 58% share in the total profits open to taxation. These firms had an effective tax rate of 20.19% in 2019-20 when the average statutory rate was 34.58%. Successive governments have moved towards narrowing the window of exemptions, but it\u2019s not been fast enough. India\u2019s direct taxes contribute a little over 50% of the total tax revenue. It needs to be more for an economy with a per capita income of around $3,000. The way forward is greater use of AI and a legal architecture oriented towards widening the tax base.\n\n",

Such a law is urgently needed to clarify ownership, storage and processing of personal data collected by public and private entities. The law will also codify these entities\u2019 responsibilities and liabilities. Key recommendations of the Srikrishna committee were unpalatable to GoI. This was evident from the Personal Data Protection Bill introduced in Parliament in 2019. The Bill gave government sweeping exemptions from privacy norms and endowed it with powers to overrule the proposed Data Protection Authority, reducing it largely to an appendage rather than an independent regulator.\nCivil society worried that these backdoors would undermine privacy. The joint committee of Parliament examining the Bill added another element of complexity by noting the difficulty of distinguishing personal and non-personal data. The dissent notes submitted along with the committee\u2019s report have also dashed hopes of a political consensus. Bipartisanship will buttress the law in case there\u2019s judicial scrutiny following a legal challenge. The reference will be the 2017 SC judgment on privacy.\nThe statutory vacuum is being keenly felt. Take the theft of data from public and private agencies collecting biometric information like fingerprints. This has led to people losing money from bank accounts. In May, a UIDAI advisory warning against sharing Aadhaar numbers with unauthorised entities raised some legitimate worries. There are also threats like the Pegasus malware that infects mobile phones and the opacity of data collection operations of tech companies.

        "full_article": "For a democratic system to function properly, all elections must be free and fair so that the people's choices are reflected in how the country is run. That is the main essence of democracy, and the Election Commission has the single most important role to play in making sure that the polls held under its supervision are all impartial. During the period of an election, regardless of who is in power, the state mechanism should ensure the space the commission needs to function independently. At the same time, the commission should also be able to challenge any questionable action by the incumbent offices. Interestingly, apart from a few exceptions, such as the election commissions that staged the 1991 and 2008 parliamentary elections \u2013 two of the least debated elections in the history of Bangladesh \u2013 this ability or intention or courage (or however you may want to describe it) to challenge the incumbent authority has almost always been missing.\nIn 2013, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia was addressing a rally in the northern divisional headquarters of Rajshahi. I was present there to cover the event. Speaking at the rally, the BNP chief said the then Election Commission (headed by Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmed) lacked an \"upright spine.\"\nWhat she meant by that was that the commission did not have the \"guts\" to challenge the ruling Awami League who, she alleged, was preventing a free and fair national election from happening.\nBut what followed that comment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the rebuttal from the then Election Commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Md Zabed Ali\u00a0\u2013\u00a0created quite a buzz in the country's political arena.\nSpeaking to journalists at his Election Commission office, Zabed Ali said they (the commission) were fine and their spines were straight as they were working to ensure the same scope for all the candidates during the polls.\n\"See, I am 63 years old and I am fine. As per medical reports, my backbone is still straight,\" Zabed told journalists, standing up from his seat.\nAs humorous as this back and forth was, it also created controversy as to how an issue of such import was discussed so light-heartedly. And then we saw what happened in the parliamentary election that followed on January 5, 2014: a total of 153 candidates declared elected without contest.\nThere is another instance where the head of yet another controversial Election Commission was admitted to the hospital with \"spine\" problems in 2006. It later turned out that the then chief election commissioner (CEC), Justice MA Aziz, was literally hiding in the hospital to avoid finding replacements for his two deputies with whom he clearly had a difference of opinion regarding the \"should-haves\" before the parliamentary election scheduled that year. Eventually, the Aziz commission had to quit before carrying out the task they had been assigned.\nWith so many controversies, especially on the presence and alleged \"absence\" of a spine that has now reached mythical proportions, a comment about having an upright backbone by the current CEC, Kazi Habibul Awal, whose team is in charge of arranging and ensuring a free and fair parliamentary election, which is due in about a year and half from now, only dug up old memories about the past election commissions and their fabled spines. When your chief election officer has to say it out loud that his office has its backbone in the right shape, you know that something is not right there. Also, hearing such a comment, one can hardly be blamed for immediately starting to doubt the Election Commission's ability to carry out the primary task it has been assigned: shake off all fears and political intimidations and do what it needs to in order for the most popular and competent candidates to get elected in a fair manner.\nIrrespective of what the CEC might be saying, the reputation of the EC's spine took a nosedive when it failed to rein in a ruling party lawmaker during the Cumilla city polls held in June. In what transpired as a blatant display of disrespect, Awami League lawmaker AKM Bahauddin openly refused to abide by the EC's orders to stay out of the city before and during the polls, and the commission could do nothing to enforce its own rule.\nIncidents like this are what puts the current commission's \"spine\" under serious doubt, because in the ideal scenario, the Election Commission should be able to exercise a certain degree of authority over the law enforcement agencies to take care of anyone who may disrupt an election or stop it from being fair.\nOur Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be remembered forever for his political heroics. But he may also be remembered for having the straightest spine a human being could possibly have \u2013 a spine that displayed uncompromising fearlessness and conviction for his ideals and beliefs, which enabled him to put everything at stake to drive his dreams home. If you want to know what an \"upright spine\" looks like, all you need to do is look into Bangabandhu's life. Once you do that, you will know how far the current Election Commission is from having an \"upright spine.\"\n\u00a0\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Every time there is a furore over an issue that relates to Rabindranath Tagore, I try to imagine: What would the biggest writer of the Bangla language think if he were here to see how he is caught up in debates that have more to do with the animosities between opposing cultural forces than his writing or music? Let's imagine a play in which Tagore has come back to the real world as a spirit, to observe how his writing is being received and studied in the 21st century. A rekindling of interest in his work, accompanied by quality translation and research, is likely to reassure him that his creations are still relevant and perhaps will always be. But how would he react to the situation here in Bangladesh? Would he be outraged at how often he is embroiled in mud-slinging, through which some people advance their own political agendas?\nThe latest occasion with a flurry of incidents was stirred up by Ashraful Alom Saeed. Also known as Hero Alom, he rendered an iconic Tagore song and uploaded it on YouTube, which set off a social media warfare, leading the Detective Branch of police to pick him up for interrogation on July 27 on the grounds that we are still struggling to understand. Not that police really need strong grounds to detain and interrogate singers or actors any more. The memories of how film director Anonno Mamun and actor Shaheen Mridha, Baul singer Rita Dewan, and actor Pori Moni were arrested are still fresh in our minds. They were targeted for reasons we could at least explain, no matter how flimsy those reasons were. But why target Hero Alom?\nAlom's detention was the kind of moral policing that many thought would never occur in Bangladesh. We'd encountered another kind of moral policing during the Ekushey Book Fair in 2019 and 2020, when police teams were deployed to monitor stalls and check if any book was hurting religious sentiments. It was Hefazat-e-Islam \u2013 a Qawmi madrasa-based Islamist organisation whose influence over policies is becoming stronger by the day \u2013 that put pressure on the government to monitor books at the fair. Writers, publishers and activists vehemently opposed the decision to send police teams to the fair, calling such acts of policing a threat to our fundamental right to freedom of expression and thought.\nIf the book fair's moral policing was a threat to freedom of thought, how are we supposed to look at Alom's interrogation, during which he was asked demeaning questions about his skin colour and look? Worse still, he was released after he signed a bond declaring that he wouldn't render songs composed by Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam.\nThe religious impetus for moral policing is alarming, but equally alarming is the cultural impetus behind Alom's interrogation, which was provided by a social media explosion engineered by Tagore brigades. The Facebook ruckus has put Alom at the receiving end of a campaign through which he was, and still is, trolled mercilessly. The trolls have not gone unchallenged though. The counter-currents challenging the trolls include literary and cultural activists, journalists, and even Tagore fans, but they also include those from the anti-Tagore brigades who are known for their communally fuelled attacks on Tagore.\nThis is not the first time a singer has been brutally berated due to their rendition of Tagore songs. Rock singer Maqsood rendered a Tagore song more than two decades back. If my memory is serving me right, I believe by then he'd left the popular band Feedback and formed his own band, Dhaka, with which he embarked on a new journey of blending rock elements with Baul music. His performance, which was accompanied by electric guitars and drums, angered Tagore aficionados so much that the entertainment pages of many Bangla newspapers carried angry responses for weeks. The message was clear: No deviation from the original, in terms of composition, would be tolerated.\nBy the time Sahana Bajpaie released her debut album of Tagore songs in 2007, the scope for using compatible modern instruments broadened and her album was given a warm reception. In 2010, alternative rock band Shironamhin released its fourth album, which consisted entirely of Tagore songs. Shironamhin's renditions deviated from the original on many counts but were not met with the same angry responses that Maqsood's performance had been. Arnob's renditions of several Tagore songs were also warmly received.\nEvidently, between Maqsood and Alom, the cultural climate has gone through a transition, becoming in the process more tolerant and welcoming towards experimentation with Tagore songs. What, then, caused this ruckus over Hero Alom? Well, one obvious reason is that while Maqsood, Sahana, Arnob and Tanzir Tuhin of Shironamhin are fabulous singers, Alom is not. When I say this, I am not judging him by my own standards. Singers from humble socioeconomic backgrounds, or singers popular among people from those backgrounds, can surely sing and in many instances, they do a better job. When they get the right opportunity, they make it big, like Momtaz, who was discovered by Hanif Sanket. There also are many local, folk and Baul singers who attach no importance to national platforms and are happy being where they are. They follow musical conventions, many of which are way richer than the modern or postmodern trends that we urban-educated people find sophisticated and palatable.\nBut Alom surely cannot sing. He is a terrible singer and he himself has no confusion about it. After Alom was released, he expressed his position vis-\u00e0-vis the whole situation in a Facebook post. In my rough translation, the relevant parts of his post appear like this:\n\"If you don't like my songs, don't listen to them. If you don't like my acting, don't watch my videos. But please don't conspire against me\u2026 I come from a poor family living in a small village, but I have confidence in myself. I am a hero to myself and an inspiration to hundreds of thousands of underprivileged people.\n\"I am not educated, I have no quality to speak of, I'm not a singer, I'm not an actor \u2013 are all these my crimes? I try my best and I will keep trying for my audience.\"\nNothing can explain the fundamental principles of freedom of expression better than Alom's emotionally charged Facebook post. By the same token, every Tagore fan has a right to express their opinion on Alom's performance. But if those responses are filled with hatred and if they assume a tone that goads the police on to harass him, then it starts smacking of a form of bigotry that we associate either with jingoism or religious fundamentalism. As a Tagore fan myself, I am certain that this is not what Tagore deserves. Tagore is our biggest writer not because of the size of his oeuvre; rather, he attained this position by virtue of his powerful writing and the sheer range of his thoughts, which do not have any space for bigotry. To put Tagore on an ideal pedestal, seeking to imbue his work with a sanctity that does not warrant any criticism of his work, can never open up new doors for illuminating studies of his work. Such an approach only strengthens the anti-Tagore brigades who seem ever poised to jump in with both feet and start levelling unfounded accusations at Tagore.\nIdealising Tagore also creates a lot of confusion, encouraging wrong interpretations of Tagore's work, feeding the claim that Tagore's writing celebrates the middle-class sensibilities that the ruling clique uses to govern the masses. Nothing can be more prejudiced than this interpretation. If it applies to Tagore, it also applies, more effectively, to the songs written by Nazrul, DL Roy, Atul Prasad, and Rajanikant Sen.\nThere is no denying the power of Nazrul's poems and songs. He has left numerous critics enamoured of his poetry and songs, just like Tagore has. Among Nazrul's critics are not only Serajul Islam Chowdhury and Jatin Sarker \u2013 both of them Marxists \u2013 but also modern scholars like Abdul Mannan Syed and Rafiqul Islam. But why does BNP, one of Bangladesh's main political parties, find an avatar in Nazrul? BNP never issues a press release on Tagore's birth or death anniversary but it almost regularly, if not religiously, organises events to celebrate Nazrul's birth anniversary. Nazrul is also loved by activists of Jamaat-e-Islami, Hefazat and Khelafat Majlis, among other Islamist parties and organisations, just like Tagore is loved and appropriated by many Hindutva activists in West Bengal, India. Are we to believe that BNP \u2013 the party that holds on to Nazrul \u2013 is devoid of people with middle-class sensibilities? Are we to believe that the BNP's ruling clique does not use middle-class ethos to govern the masses? In BNP's case, religion is the only trump card, one might quip. If middle-class sensibilities are replaced by religion, what we get is a bleaker picture, especially since Nazrul's writing is absolutely non-communal in spirit.\nIt is not easy to understand why one writer is appropriated by a political party or a section of a class but when they are, it does not mean a one-to-one correspondence between that party or class and the writer in question.\nGetting back to the initial thread of Tagore's fictional appearance in a play, when faced with the circus around Hero Alom rendering one of his songs, is it possible that Tagore would say: Both the brigades across the literary spectrum should go to hell? Is it possible that he'd look at the whole thing from an entirely fresh angle, that he'd feel happy to see his songs cross the class divide and reach Alom? Well, it all depends on the playwright's vision and understanding of Tagore.\nAs I understand it, Tagore as a writer is so great that he does not require a brigade to protect the worth of his writing. Also, to stand up for Alom's right to render Tagore songs does not stand in contradiction to being a Tagore fan.\nRifat Munim\u00a0is an editor, writer and journalist based in Dhaka.

        "full_article": "In a densely populated city like Dhaka, waste collection, transportation, recycling, and disposal requires an efficient waste management system. Improper waste disposal and poorly managed landfills pollute the ground, water and air, causing many health and environmental problems. The city must, therefore, use modern approaches to ensure the health and safety of its inhabitants by creating a cleaner and greener environment while saving money and other resources.\nCurrently, the waste generated in Dhaka city is collected without segregation, dumped at various locations across the city, and finally transported to landfills in an apparently unstructured manner. The problem is exacerbated due to the lack of awareness, motivation, and poor attitudes of the city's inhabitants to practise proper waste management. But people's motivations and attitudes can be changed by adopting a creative incentive policy, whereby desired behaviours could be reinforced and new behaviours encouraged.\nIn this context, we propose an innovative model of waste management that is low-cost, robust, technology-based, reliable, and sustainable. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology, in fact, can be used creatively to improve Dhaka's current waste management system without introducing major alterations to the core structure. IoT refers to physical objects that are equipped with sensors, processing power, software, and other technologies that can communicate with other devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks. Mobile applications, modified primary vehicles, smart secondary transfer stations, and monitoring centres make up the system. A powerful message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) cloud-based platform, such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS), may be used to coordinate technologies, manage data, and perform the needed computations. In other words, real-time data can be tracked from each piece of hardware linked to the IoT server independently, and their values combined or correlated to draw statistical and logical conclusions and solutions to produce data-driven economic value, as well as making predictions of future waste generation and its efficient handling.\nNot segregating rubbish at any stage is a shortcoming in the traditional garbage collection mechanism. The best way is to segregate waste at the source (i.e. household level). The primary vehicles of household waste collectors can be modified by compartmentalisation of the waste bins (or colour-coded garbage bags) to separate garbage such as biowaste, plastics, and scheduled waste. Scheduled waste means items such as glass collected on Monday, electronic items on Tuesdays, metals on Thursday, etc.\u00a0Each container would possess one load cell sensor connected to the microcontroller in an embedded system. We can demonstrate this system using Nodemcu, a microcontroller which converts the weights of classified waste into QR codes with security codes that change regularly like OTPs (one-time passwords) that can be verified by the QR scanner in the app. We can connect to the system using the internet through its inbuilt Wi-Fi module. The internet can be accessed via a hotspot on the garbage collector's mobile phone. The routes of the primary vehicles can be accessed by the control centre via GPS tracking.\nLack of awareness and motivation seems to be the root cause of Dhaka city's waste management problem. From our perspective, the generated waste products are the raw materials for making new products. For this, we introduce our \"N0 waste!\" app with the following functionality:\n1. Users can scan the QR code generated in the primary collection vehicle.\n2. The application will convert to values by verifying the OTP associated with the QR code with the cloud, which deploys the app and primary vehicle circuit.\n3. Points will be generated in the user domain with respect to the type of waste and also to calculate community (e.g. a predefined zone) ranking. These reward points may be used to make purchases at supermarkets, pay for university fees, and so on by individual households. Community points may be used to prioritise community projects (building or repairing schools, providing priority healthcare, enabling greater security, etc). The money for these rewards would come from selling the separated rubbish to recycling plants or from new products generated from the rubbish by start-ups with high-value addition. For example, the segregated biowastes can be used as the raw materials for bio-methane production. The slurry can be utilised as agricultural compost. This circular process indeed has the potential to increase the country's GDP and job prospects.\nThe overflowing secondary transfer stations (STS) (the large waste bins) is another important issue. Garbage may accumulate in the large bins by the roadside, emitting foul odours and posing a health risk to the city residents. It also looks awful. We propose a Smart STS with an ultrasonic distance sensor on top of the bins to monitor the tank's state and a load cell at the bottom to measure the weight. The STS status will be sent to the controlling and monitoring centre when a trigger point is reached so that trucks can be deployed to clear the bins. Also, the system will facilitate the cross verification of STS weight with the weight the waste collectors claim to have collected to prevent malpractice.\nThe weight and type of waste data may facilitate real-time monitoring of segregated waste and its flow through the system, solving problems of coordination, calculating the economy of collection, comparison of market price of virgin raw materials with that of recycled materials, total revenue generated from the recycling, and prediction of waste quantity in the future by trend analytics. The public and private stakeholders may get this data on their laptops, tablets, PCs, and mobile phones for transparency. The efficacy of the system can be demonstrated using simulated data. Data visualisation can also be availed using business intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI, etc.\nThe innovative solution that we propose, combined with a point-based incentive system, may fuel the economy of Dhaka and reward its residents in a variety of ways. We also believe the system can create new and decent jobs, help establish training centres to facilitate the technical training for hardware technicians, create new recycling start-up companies, and enable the greening of Dhaka city, beautifying it, and curbing the health risks that the present system poses. A team of effort with multidisciplinary perspectives is now imperative to tackle Dhaka's growing waste menace.\n\u00a0\nThis op-ed, the final instalment in a four-part series, resulted from the authors' participation in the 23rd ASEF Summer University (ASEFSU23) interdisciplinary hackathon on \"Livable Cities for a Sustainable Future\" envisioned by Asian and European young professionals and students.\n\nSainul Abid\u00a0is studying for an MSc in cognitive science at the Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences in the University of Allahabad, India, and is a STEM trainer.Dr Syed Saad Andaleeb\u00a0is distinguished professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University and former vice-chancellor of Brac University.\n",

        "full_article": "Mosquitoes are not any modern-day phenomenon. They are to be found even in ancient books on the biblical era, where it is narrated that emperor Nimrod, the builder of the Tower of Babel, suffered at the hands of a mosquito when it entered his brain through his nostrils and buzzed for twenty-four hours, making his life a veritable hell. So, he started to bang his head against stonewalls and died in the process. It will not be an exaggeration to say that humans have been fighting mosquitos since the dawn of history. In cities like Dhaka, that fight is often one-sided with the tiny creatures, in their millions, causing all sorts of troubles for the residents.\nThe two city corporations of Dhaka have tried many methods of mosquito control, often without success, despite claims by top officials that Bangladesh is faring better than many other Asian countries in preventing dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. The methods applied so far include chemicals sprayed on bushes and drains, releasing a small fish variety called guppy in city drains as well as tilapia fish and ducks in ponds and lakes, flying drones for detection of larvae spots, etc. We are told that the Dhaka South City Corporation also released more than 15,000 frogs in various lakes, ponds and other water bodies in the hope that those would eat mosquito larvae and reduce the risk of dengue infection.\nBut the move, which entomologists called \"unthinkable\", proved to be ineffective, as is evident from the fact that city-dwellers in many areas remain hostage to mosquitos, while large numbers of dengue patients continue to be hospitalised. Given the gravity of the situation, the Dhaka North City Corporation recently opened a control room to provide free dengue tests and advice regarding the disease. It also deployed a large number of drones to search for mosquito breeding grounds on building rooftops.\nExperts, however, say that such methods and strategies are usually adopted at short notice, without taking their effectiveness or long-term consequences into consideration. They pointed out that the authorities have a tendency to control both Aedes and Culex mosquitoes by following the same methods, but in reality, the two need different approaches. Therefore, there is no alternative to getting our mosquito control policy right, as well as undertaking sustained efforts including surveillance, prevention\u00a0and follow-up actions. The city corporations must work in collaboration with the experts to adopt the best policy and prevent the onslaught of mosquitos.\n",

        "full_article": "The alarm bell sounded by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) about the rapid degradation of topsoil worldwide is in effect a grim warning of food insecurity for the planet's population. In fact, concerned here is the most productive part of the Earth's crust that produces 95 per cent of the world's foods. The latest FAO report warns that 90 per cent of the topsoil will be at risk by 2050. Another report submitted to the UN in 2019 claims that all the world's topsoil could turn unproductive within the next 60 years if the 'current rate of loss continues'. If these are predictions, the disappearance of farmable lands is equally alarming. Over the past four decades, one-third of the agricultural land has disappeared and half of the most productive soil has vanished over the past 150 years. Clearly, the rate of degradation of soil has been expedited by agricultural, industrial and commercial pollution in the last forty years. This has prompted the UN agency to form the Global Soil Partnership under which programmes and actions are taken to reverse the degradation process. The first task is to make policymakers and farmers aware of the unsustainable agricultural practices and initiate organic methods of cultivation with an emphasis on enriching foods with micronutrients. A project was launched by the FAO Global Soil Partnership with German fund in two sub-Saharan African countries and Bangladesh. The result of this sustainable soil management, nutritional enrichment programme spread over three selected areas in the country--- Baliadangi, Chandina and Chuadanga --- has reportedly been quite encouraging. However, the FAO has initiated yet another programme in order to stem the rapid decline of soil quality by forming a partnership with farmers and local governments. Under this programme use of cover crops, crop rotation and agro-forestry are practised, in which governments are required to provide policy support without being involved directly. The reasons behind topsoil turning acidic and infertile are not unknown. Apart from agricultural, industrial and commercial pollution, climate change has, of late, posed a threat to soil quality. In the south-western region of Bangladesh, the intrusion of saline water has rendered agricultural land unfit for crop production. Also, shrimp cultivation by influential quarters has made the situation even worse. If Sidr and Aila were responsible for prolonged flooding of large areas with saline water, those shrimp cultivators have only channelized further intrusion of such water into agricultural lands of unwilling farmers. However, if this problem is confined to that particular area, the problem of topsoil loss is common to all areas in Banglasdesh. The areas that still come under seasonal monsoon flooding fortunately get reprieve from this negative development and even can more than recoup losses. An overwhelming emphasis on production of rice has been primarily responsible for loss of soil health. There is indeed a need for cover crop and crop rotation which help rejuvenate soil. Particularly where possible, cultivation of pulses and beans can prove highly beneficial because those crops help fix nitrogen to soil. To get the maximum benefit, however, agro-forestry can be a nice way of covering up the soil quality decline. The challenge of retaining soil nutrition is great but can be overcome by judicious plan and follow-up actions.",

        "full_article": "Thanks to the remarkable cut in road accidents prompted by the lengthy corona lockdowns, the absence of bustling roads in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country emerged as a blessing in disguise. The roads in the capital remained off-limits to reckless traffic. The highways didn't have to see repeated fatal accidents like that seen in Dhaka. Given the frequency of accidents involving different types of public and private transports, the grisly nature of the road mishaps and the rising number of casualties, the country's roads earned for themselves a chronic notoriety. With the passing of days, the road accidents in the country continue to take fiercer forms ending, at times, in macabre results. In Bangladesh, people are used to watching extraordinary types of accidents. On occasions, the highway accidents involve three vehicles colliding at a time, instead of the traditional mishaps involving two. Sarcastically speaking, the blood thirst of the Bangladesh roads and highways keeps becoming unquenchable. Moreover, the weirdness of these accidents keeps taking more terrible nature than the previous ones.Just a couple of months ago, the ordinary people couldn't consider head-on collisions involving more than two vehicles. Perhaps to prove Dhaka highways' unique ferocity, they have gone for grislier mishaps --- involving three vehicles at the minimum. It could be more.To imagine morbidly, the prevailing circumstances might be inviting more motorised or home-made makeshift transports to join the deadly mayhems. Before the inauguration of a multi-lane highway, a number of formal promises are made. Those include round-the-clock patrol by highway police, installation of close-circuit cameras at the roads' accident-prone areas, foot over-bridges around crowded places and many other amenities. Virtually few of these facilities have been in place since the highways' opening.In the immediate past, recklessly driven minibuses were identified as the main culprits behind terrible road accidents in Dhaka. In years, hundreds of people would die in avoidable accidents in Dhaka. Thanks to the enactment and enforcement of many fresh traffic rules, the frequency of accidents caused by rash driving dropped significantly for a few months, starting from 2018. During the days after the death of two college students under the wheels of a speeding bus, the angry general students came out on streets of the capital in protest. For a total 11 days, protesting students had tried to bring discipline to the Dhaka traffic.Amazingly, the students' all-out efforts to bring order to the capital's roads proved a success. The on-duty traffic police sergeants extended their cooperation to the students' checking of the running vehicles' papers. The Dhaka commuters and residents hoped the city roads would not revert to their earlier anarchic look. Unfortunately, after remaining in a semblance of discipline and order, lawlessness began creeping into the traffic movement scenario. In barely two years, Dhaka wore its earlier look --- traffic caught in gridlocks and tailbacks and buses in competitions to speed ahead of others to pick passengers. Apparently, the unprecedented students' movement for safe roads had fizzled out with no tangible results. But the protest campaign left a note of caution. It was clear. If there were even the faint signs of the return of the commuters' killings caused by traffic recklessness, Dhaka students would not hesitate to stream into the roads like they did in 2018.Given the unabated rise in the occurrences of deadly road accidents on the country's highways recently, they are also emerging as the causes of a new headache. But since they cut through the outback rural and semi-rural areas, after causing a disastrous accident, the responsible drivers can flee the scenes. The rural eye-witnesses cannot always chase them successfully. To speak forthrightly, the drivers responsible for dreadful accidents on the national and regional highways can somehow manage to flee the scenes of crime. They could be caught with only the prompt arrival of patrol police teams. These incidents are rare. It means the highway route-using transports remain at the whims of the drivers at steering. The vehicles include heavy trucks, covered vans and large passenger buses and coaches. These transports, like those seen inside cities are often found engaged in the competition of overtaking each other.A new scourge has lately emerged in the form of improvised transports. They are seen carrying passengers and merchandise, often competing with passenger coaches! The ending often proves fatal.Prior to these road mishaps, it was the heavy trucks which were held chiefly responsible for the deadly accidents in the capital. At one stage, trucks emerged as the symbols of gory deaths. The defiance of the drivers at one point reached such an extent that the government in the mid-1980s was compelled to ban the plying of trucks during daytime in Dhaka. The rule is still in force amid sporadic violations.Besides scores of rules and restrictions, the cities in the developed countries are literally free of terrible traffic collisions. Still, police patrols are found making rounds in the cities for 24 hours. Disastrous accidents, however, do occur in these countries' freeways or expressways. The nature of these accidents is blood chilling, mostly ending in instant deaths and mutilations. Being a small country, with a handful of under-construction elevated expressway roads, the country may not have to encounter myriad challenges of highway journeys in the future --- unless they are constructed in multiple numbers of levels or layers. But the scourges of sloppily constructed highways, their wrong use, lack of police supervision etc., are feared to invite bad reputations for the country's road communication sector as a whole. The construction of the Padma Bridge is, undoubtedly, a great feat. But it will also have to depend on properly functional highways on its two ends.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Railway accidents in Bangladesh are not purely about collision between trains or derailment of a train and their attendant deaths and injuries. Though it may sound somewhat odd, many of such accidents involve speeding trains ramming buses, trucks, microbuses, you name it.Since road transports like buses and other kinds of automobiles run on different tracks than trains, ideally, they should not cross each other's path to cause any accident. But it happens and in Bangladesh it does so too often. The July 29's accident at the level crossing near the Baratakia railway station under Mirsharaiupazila in Chattogram is one such tragedy that shocked the nation. The11 who died in that accident were mostly school students in their teens. The dead also included coaching teachers of those students including driver of the ill-fated microbus in which they were travelling. As reports go, the victims were returning after visiting the nearby Khoyasara spring when they were run over by a Chattagram-bound train coming from Dhaka. But the circumstances of the accident are yet to be clear. For there is no answer to why the microbus was on the level crossing when the train was so close. Either the guard at the level crossing or the driver of the microbus or both might be at fault. For most of the level crossings, many of them unauthorised, are not well-guarded. Those at the driving seats of the motorised road transports are also often in a rush or have little respect for traffic rule. The guard of the level crossing in question is learnt to have been arrested. But he is an insignificant cog of the wheels of a bureaucracy known for its sloth and inefficiency. According to the Accident Research Institute of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), during the last one decade and a half 5,000 accidents took place at Bangladesh's railway crossings. Which is more than 333 accidents per year.Between 2020 and July 2022 alone some 116 accidents took place between trains and road transports with a death toll of some 219 people. Of course, the victims were all passengers of motorised vehicles. Notably, Bangladesh has about 2, 000 miles of railway line which is crisscrossed by more than 2,500 level crossings. That is about 8 level crossings per every 10 miles of railway line.Railway tracks crossing roads, however, is a common scene wherever train service exists. And accidents at the level crossings are also nothing out of the ordinary. In India, for example, the total length of the country's railway track is over 61620 miles. And there are 19,000 level crossings. In other words, for every 10 miles of its railway lines India has more than 3 level crossings. In that case, Bangladesh has more level crossings (more than 2.5 times) per mile of railway line than in India. And at these railway crossings, India saw some 1788 accidents in 2019. But considering the number of level crossings and the size of India's railway traffic, the number of accidents reported in 2019 cannot be said to be too high. Moreover, accidents at the level crossings, reportedly, saw a 20 per cent increase in the reference year (2019) than before.Against this backdrop, Bangladesh railway needs to be extra cautious in maintaining its level crossing, if only because the railway lines are spread across a small, densely populated country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh Railway reportedly spent Tk.1.16 billion under two projects undertaken in 2015 to improve safety level and other aspects of the level crossings. But then how can one explain the glaring instance of gross negligence of duty at the level crossing in Mirsharai that has left an entire village mourning the deaths of its children?Who is to take responsibility for the avoidable tragedy that took so many innocent lives?\n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, the recent incident in which a nine-month old child was allegedly killed in police firing after announcement of the election results of Bachor union parishad in Ranisankail upazila of Thakurgaon is unprecedented. On last Wednesday, when results of the election were reportedly announced at the VF Junior High School polling centre, supporters of a defeated candidate attacked police. At one point of the clash, police resorted to firing to control the situation. Unfortunately Suraiya Akter Asha, who was in her mother's arms at that time, was shot in the head and died instantly. All deaths are painful. The death of the child is an irreparable loss for her parents. The question, however, is whether it is necessary for our law enforcers to fire bullets in response to stone-pelting? As per the law, several procedures have to be followed before firing bullets. There are specific situations where the police can use bullet. It is important to know whether the police are complying with the rules or not. A proper investigation into the incident of police firing must be carried out. And a separate agency should conduct the probe against the police involved in the firing. If the police are found to have failed in discharging their duties, they should be brought to book. \nAshikujaman Syed,Research Assistant,Bioinformatics Research Lab,Center for Research Innovation and Development (CRID),[email\u00a0protected]",
