The three-member collegium, which makes recommendations for High Court appointments, has reiterated its decision to elevate lawyers Saurabh Kirpal to the Delhi High Court, R. John Sathyan to the Madras High Court and Somasekhar Sundaresan to the Bombay High Court. As it dealt in detail with the objections raised by the Centre in each individual case, the motives behind the government\u2019s ongoing contestation with the judiciary over appointments to constitutional courts stand exposed. Communications between the collegium and the Centre offer a glimpse into the untenable nature of the government\u2019s objections to proposed appointees, making it abundantly clear how badly the current regime wants to control judicial appointments. If the objection based on a candidate\u2019s sexual orientation smacks of a medieval-minded ideological bias, the effort to stall the elevation of a couple of advocates based on their social media activity exposes a mindset that sees appointments to the higher judiciary as a system of spoils meant for political loyalists. As the collegium has pointed out, neither the sexual orientation of Mr. Kirpal nor the airing of political views by the other two advocates will impinge on their suitability or integrity.The government appears to think that potential candidates for judicial appointments should not have political views of their own, or that a tendency to make their views or opinion known will amount to a possible bias in their functioning as judges. Nothing can disprove this more than the fact that there are other names \u2014 to which the government seems to have no objections \u2014 that are closely associated with political parties. Indeed, one can say that the history of judicial appointments is replete with instances of government law officers, who invariably enjoy the confidence of the political leadership at the Centre or the States, and lawyers who represent political leaders being offered positions on both the Supreme Court and High Court Benches. The objection based on sexual orientation is particularly appalling, as it is contrary to the constitutional position against discrimination based on sex or sexual preferences. The viewpoint that the collegium system of appointments is flawed as it is opaque and tends to reduce the zone of consideration is valid. However, the manner in which the current regime is seeking to filter out candidates who, it suspects, may not further its political agenda will surely give the impression that allowing any sort of government interference will pose a threat to judicial independence.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nexecutive (government)\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)",

The Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s stakes are the highest as it seeks to retain power in Tripura and continue to be a key partner of the main ruling entities in the other two States. The BJP is in alliance with Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma\u2019s National People\u2019s Party (NPP) in Meghalaya and Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio\u2019s Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) in Nagaland. The Congress, once the main party in the northeast, is struggling, wiped out in Nagaland, trying to stay afloat in Tripura, and raided by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Meghalaya. Regional parties in the northeast tend to align with the ruling party at the Centre, and the BJP has expanded its footprint in the region considerably in recent years. A BJP victory in 2018 ended more than two decades of Left Front rule in Tripura. However, being in power has not been easy; its first Chief Minister, Biplab Kumar Deb, was replaced with Manik Saha, a dental surgeon, in 2022, an effort to reverse the decline in the party\u2019s popularity. The emergence of the Tipra Motha, a regional party that swept the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council polls in April 2021 has changed the dynamics in 20 Assembly seats in its area. A Left-Congress alliance is also possible.TMC leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been trying to gain a foothold in the northeast, but with limited success. In Meghalaya, 12 Congress MLAs defected to the TMC in 2021, but its stock has been depleting since. The TMC is viewed as a Bengali party in the State, where regional sentiments are strong. The party has some patches of influence in the Garo Hills of the State. In Nagaland, the BJP has announced a pre-poll alliance with its current partner the NDPP; in Meghalaya, the BJP and NPP are not only contesting separately but also calling each other names. Alliances in the State are usually forged after the elections. The NPP is facing accusations of corruption, and is being overly influenced by Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the BJP\u2019s pointsman for the northeast. As usual, indigenous groups in Nagaland have threatened to boycott the polls, pressing various demands. A demand for the creation of Frontier Nagaland being raised by the Konyak Union, an apex tribal body is a new flavour of the season. The BJP is likely to continue with its innovations in dealing with regionalism while the Opposition\u2019s capacity to sustain will be tested in these elections.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMeghalaya\n\n/\n\nNagaland\n\n/\n\nTripura\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress",

Consequently, visa liberalisation under the proposed India-UK FTA is not up for negotiation. But in that case, there\u2019s not much left to negotiate. To begin with, in the ongoing FTA talks, the potential of enhanced trade through an India-UK deal is underwhelming.\nThe two-way trade between India-UK in 2021-22 was $17.5 billion, lower than India\u2019s trade with Germany or with Belgium. As a proportion of India\u2019s overall merchandise trade, it was less than 2%. In such a scenario, the likelihood of freer movement of skilled labour and students between India and the UK could have provided an incentive to quicken the pace of negotiations. But given the UK\u2019s domestic politics, visa liberalisation appears to be dead in the water.\nFTAs require tradeoffs. Some domestic interests have to be set aside in the pursuit of larger gains from lowering barriers to trade. Clearly, the UK government is reluctant to spend political capital on visa liberalisation, even if it makes economic sense. This makes tradeoffs harder to justify for India too. Even the UK\u2019s own assessment doesn\u2019t show eye-catching returns if this FTA is concluded. The UK government\u2019s paper on FTA locates it within a larger strategy of strengthening trade ties in the Indo-Pacific region. Access to India\u2019s huge market appears to be the UK\u2019s primary incentive. An FTA which lowers tariffs for British exporters helps the UK. But with UK tariffs already low, what\u2019s the potential big gain for India when freer movement of people is not on the cards?\nIt\u2019s not as if India hopes to get unique concessions. The UK and Australia already have a regime of unfettered movement for young people, including job seekers. Against this backdrop, GoI should double down on other potential FTAs like the ones with the EU and US. Likely gains from deepening trade ties with them are far greater than anything on offer by the UK.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Alamgir Kabir's death anniversary has been an occasion to celebrate and remember him as a prominent film director and tireless film society activist. But an important part of Alamgir Kabir's continuing influence in contemporary Bangladesh can be traced back to his film criticism and his approaches to teaching film. Kabir's extensive criticism and film education in the 1960s remains a significant foundation for cultural criticism, film movements, and formal film language in Bangladesh today.\nIn the early 1960s Alamgir Kabir spent a number of years in London, where he moved in left wing and revolutionary cultural and political circles. During this time, he became convinced of the power and possibility of the cinema. He saw film as a medium of transformative possibilities, its very formal or artistic language capable of galvanising change. Training in formal film language became, perhaps counterintuitively, a key aspect of Kabir's political aspirations. Kabir brought these convictions back with him when he returned to Dhaka in 1966.\nThe national popular of 1960s East Pakistan to which Kabir returned was deeply informed by leftist and anti-imperial motifs, rhetoric and themes that were inherited from the anti-imperial and revolutionary cultural movements of the 1940s as well as emerging in tandem with wider international artistic networks. Culture had become a site where underground workers and fellow travellers met and where cultural organisations were 'fronts' in the struggle towards social transformation and revolution in East Pakistan. In the course of the 1960s, cinema emerged as one of the art forms through which progressive and left political commitments could be expressed. Today aesthetic traces in the films of the period provides access to the broader alliances and commitments across political and artistic communities that imbued the atmosphere in 1960s East Pakistan.\nSurveying Alamgir Kabir's writings from the mid-1960s reveals his perspective on the cinema as a socially progressive force and the film critic as the vehicle through which it might be amplified. As he writes in the opening pages of his 1969 book The Cinema in Pakistan: \"The cinema is probably the only art form whose political utility can be comparable to that of any political party, may be even more\" (5-6).. It was self-evident to him that \"the aim of every art is \u2026 to act as a catalyst in the process of social evolution\" (125). The film critic had a key role to play in catalysing such social change: \"A concerted press campaign in favour of good films that try to tell sensible stories without forsaking the needs of the society \u2026 and films that make honest efforts to exploit the resources of the cinema as vehicles of art as well as means of propagation of ideas [\u2026] could act as an important conscience-whipper of audiences throughout the country\" (184). Through publishing his critical evaluations of contemporary cinema in widely read newspapers and by initiating film educational initiatives, Kabir encouraged a reading and viewing public to be familiar with cinematic form, style, genre and convention. He believed that such knowledge would transform established ways of seeing and judging and that this would eventually generate political and social transformation. That is, Kabir understood formal or artistic literacy as a political position. To read Kabir's reviews and critical writing in the newspapers is to witness the ways in which he creates a public pedagogy of emancipation around the cinema. It is to witness the conscience-whipper in action.\nKabir's film criticism was focused on connecting the formal aspects of individual films to their political potential. In the year of his return, Alamgir Kabir reviewed Khan Ataur Raham's film Raja Sanyasi (1966) for the weekly Holiday. Kabir writes that \"two elements of his direction impressed me. These are: a precise sense of proportion which is rare in this country and a potent sense of social consciousness. Obviously, he doesn't belong to the school of 'art for art's sake.'\u2026 he didn't miss any opportunity of injecting as many social comments as he found possible.\" This is high praise for Khan Ata's second feature film. The significance that Alamgir Kabir attaches to cinema as an art that is not produced just for its own sake, and that is imbued with social conscience, can also be seen in his review of international cinematic trends, including the nouvelle vague and the Indian neorealists. His evaluations hinge on the question whether the abstractions in films \"can make art really indispensable to the toiling millions,\" as he put it in the Pakistan Observer in 1966. He therefore expresses great appreciation for Chris Marker and Jean Rouch but does not hesitate to critique Satyajit Ray: \"Ray is never found to portray the 'evil' or 'violence' that are the real by-products of any society\" while \"his social commitments are also too feeble, if not reactionary\" (Holiday, 17-06-1966).\nThe realism and social commitment that Kabir finds so important in the films he reviews are directly linked to how he understands cinema's functioning as a medium. For Kabir, cinema is a provocation that demands a response from its viewer. He suggests that the movement of the image produces alongside it a political velocity: its present-ness (happening right now!) has the force to move us, render viewers committed, engage their conscience. And this is what produces its political potency. The 'formally literate filmgoer could translate the film's galvanising movement into an understanding that settled into their consciousness where it would inspire action. A realist film containing social commentary would provoke its audiences in socially progressive ways, 'whipping up' their conscience. But a 'feeble' film would waste its progressive potential.\nFilm education was the second pillar in Kabir's project to realise cinema's political potential embedded in its formal qualities and animated by its physical movement. It was the trained or 'keen' viewer who would be best able to harness these qualities. Kabir was committed to produce such viewers not only through his prolific film criticism but also through his manifold initiatives towards film education. Like criticism, film education was a means of producing accessible links between people and art forms that were premised on inviting people to pay close attention to the formal aspects of the cinema. And the way to invite people into this body of filmic knowledge was through cine-clubs.\nThe first film society in Pakistan was set up in 1963 in the mould of the film societies in India and Britain. By 1969 there were two clubs in Dhaka, one in Chittagong and one in Karachi. Not only did the film societies screen a variety of international films for its paying membership, they were linked to a history of radical and progressive political constituencies and put into practice their understanding of the cinema as socially transformative. By 1968, Alamgir Kabir was the General Secretary of the Pakistan Film Society. In 1969, Alamgir Kabir founded a parallel organisation, the Dacca Cine Club and was on the board of directors of the Dacca Film Institute set up at the same time.\nKabir taught a rigorous curriculum at the Dacca Film Institute. If, in 1970, you wanted become an associate of the Dacca Film Institute, you were required to sit four exams, each taking three hours. The four papers covered cinema history, international cinema, documentary, and, of course, film criticism. The exam papers from that time provide clear insight into the types of knowledge and practice Kabir expected of his students: close textual study, detailed technical knowledge, a good grasp of the political nature of film, extensive historical awareness with regard to cinema in Pakistan, a grasp of film theory and an intimate familiarity with the classic film texts of a recognizably international film canon.\nKabir's efforts in the 1960s were to ground film education in independent Bangladesh in crucial ways. But his socialist vision of a state-run film industry came to naught due to numerous circumstances. Instead, the aspirations for the radical transformation of cinema remained located among film society activists and film educational initiatives, many of which were spearheaded by Kabir. Alongside others such as Mohammad Khusru, Kabir remained a driving force of the movement around cinematic art that emerged after the Liberation War. The movement pushed for the state's support in developing film culture, leading to the establishment of the Bangladesh Film Institute and Archive. Kabir would continue to lead film appreciation courses at various institutes from 1979 into the 1980s and heading the efforts of the Short Film Forum, decisively shaping a new generation of filmmakers, film critics and film enthusiasts. His curricula have become the basis of the many film appreciation courses taught across the country today. Through these curricula, film appreciation, as the practice of evaluating film texts through close reading and formal analysis, has remained the mainstay of film education in Bangladesh and continues to feed into film and media criticism today. It is here that the histories of politically progressive and left-wing cultural politics have sedimented and remain available for contemporary articulation in the film and media culture of Bangladesh.\nPlacing formalist aesthetic at the heart of the left political agenda of one of the key cultural activists of 1960s expands how we understand the place of the fine arts within this decade's political struggles. This is the time when film in East Pakistan is a site of experimentation drawing on the cultural and artistic ferment of the period. The contributions of urban artists and intellectuals to the language movement and political struggle have largely been read as bourgeois and nationalist in nature. Tracing what Sanjukta Sunderason and I have called 'the forms of the left' in the works and writings of these actors can identify additional artistic and intellectual orientations. Despite the ways in which we think of the cinema in the 1960s in East Pakistan as particularly concerned with family melodrama and folk features and as a steady build-up to the nationalist triumph of Nawab Sirajdaulla, Jibon Theke Neya, and Stop Genocide, there is a social and aesthetic history of left political commitments of many of its key actors that can be easily recuperated through a closer engagement with these texts.\nA central legacy of Alamgir Kabir's film work can be found in his efforts at public film education and criticism. His critical writing in newspapers and his teaching on film contributed to the way in which the formal language of cinema came to be understood and practiced as a politically progressive force allied to left-wing positions on art and aesthetics within East Pakistan. This has been inherited by filmmakers and critics in contemporary Bangladesh and its lasting impact can be discerned in films and cultural movements. Tracing the forms of the left in the work of filmmakers and critics such as Kabir provides a starting point to ask what has happened to that progressive cultural politics, in the cinema and elsewhere, after the independence of Bangladesh, and to recuperate its energies alongside the political movements that shape the contemporary moment.\nDr. Lotte Hoek is an anthropologist based at the University of Edinburgh.

        "full_article": "Within a fortnight of celebrating Police Week, two incidents have brought to fore the question of extrajudicial excesses of the force. In one incident, a youth protestor was subjected to police brutality in custody in Chattogram, while in the other, a trader allegedly died due to custodial torture in Gazipur.\nFrom a tender age, Mohammad Mostakim has faced the hard realities of life. After his father passed away years ago, the 22-year-old madrasa student has been the anchor of the family. Mostakim has to look after his 55-year-old mother (a kidney disease patient requiring dialysis three times a week) and a 10-year-old physically challenged sister. He meets challenges with fortitude and as a conscientious citizen who is actively engaged in local efforts to combat the Covid-19 virus.\nIt is no surprise that Mostakim became part of the group of kidney patients and their relatives protesting the price hike of dialysis treatment and reduction in subsidies. On the fifth day of the protest, when protestors blocked the road in front of the Chattogram Medical College and Hospital, the police used force to disperse them. Subsequently, police filed a case in which alleged victims of police assault were charged with \"obstruction of government work and attacking police.\" Mostakim was arrested along with 50 to 60 others. Five days after his arrest, Mostakim was granted bail and the police's application for a five-day remand was denied by the magistrate.\nThe police's heavy-handed approach in dispersing a crowd that was peacefully protesting the price hike of a medical service, and its subsequent slapping of cases against a number of the protesters, has appalled citizens. The situation dipped to a new low as Mostakim was beaten in custody purportedly to get a lesson for \"disrespecting\" the officer-in-charge of the local police station. Photographs of his bruised left leg aptly conveyed the brutality Mostakim had to endure.\nThe treatment of Mostakim and his fellow protesters by the police raises the question of whether the state has effectively abrogated the constitutionally guaranteed citizens' right to protest. The administration also needs to make clear in what ways this group of aggrieved citizens violated the laws of the land, triggering such violent and disproportionate response from the police. Even if the group was impeding the flow of traffic, were there no non-violent and civilised ways of tackling them?\nThe vicious bodily harm inflicted on Mostakim in custody betrays the intensity of contempt that some members of the force hold against citizens who still dare to exercise their rights to express and assemble.\nThe second case of Rabiul Islam of Gazipur shed light not only on alleged custodial torture leading to the death of the victim, it also revealed how members of law enforcement agencies allegedly fabricated stories to cover up their misdeeds.\nOn the evening of January 17, Nupur was informed by the police that her husband Rabiul had died in a road accident following his release from custody. Family sources inform that days earlier, along with three others, Rabiul was picked up by two assistant sub-inspectors of the local police station on charges of gambling. The 45-year-old victim was detained in the police station while the three co-accused were released. When police personnel demanded money for releasing Rabiul, on January 17, Nupur handed over Tk 35,000. After securing the amount, instead of discharging Rabiul from their custody, police demanded an additional sum of Tk 5 lakh. Subsequently, they promised to release the detainee when Nupur complied with their instruction to put her signature on a blank sheet. On the same evening, she was informed by the police that Rabiul had been hit in a road accident and shifted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). When the family arrived at DMCH, they found the body of deceased Rabiul. Refuting the police narrative, his family and people of the locality have asserted that Rabiul was tortured to death.\nRabiul's death, allegedly a result of police torture, triggered spontaneous protest in the area leading to road blockade, vandalising of police boxes, and torching of three police motorcycles. The police's claim that Rabiul's brother Mohidul had filed a case against the truck driver that allegedly hit Rabiul also turned out to be sham. Mohidul denied lodging the case, providing evidence that he was at DMCH to claim his brother's body at the time of the complaint being lodged. There was also a mismatch regarding the signature in the FIR that was filed with the police.\nThe handling of Rabiul's case by the police raises several points of concern. So far, the police could not provide any evidence to back its claim that Rabiul was indeed involved in gambling. Demanding and accepting money for releasing a detainee proves that extortion was the sole purpose of bringing the accused under custody. Securing the signature of a next of kin on a blank sheet also points to the covering up of the offence being planned. The family deserves an explanation as to why Rabiul was not handed over to them.\nThe cooked up police narrative of Rabiul's death also falls flat as the force failed to provide evidence of any such road accident in the area on the evening of January 17. Also, the police's inability to furnish any evidence, including CCTV footage, of Rabiul's release from custody further strengthens the argument that there was institutional complicity to cover up the custodial torture that led to the detainee's death.\nMostakim and Rabiul's experiences are not isolated cases. The media and rights organisations frequently report on cases of custodial torture, some of which lead to death of detainees. In many instances, the families of the deceased contested the police claim that the detainees had committed suicide in custody. Three cases from last year illustrate the pervasiveness of custodial torture.\nOn March 1 of 2022, Laboni Akhtar (23) had a miscarriage after she was brutalised by sub-inspector Ruma Akhter in Kashimpur police station. On July 17, Abdul Salam of Sreepur, Magura was allegedly beaten up and kicked in the chest, which the family believes resulted in his death at Magura Sadar Hospital. On August 21, a video went viral that showed two 13-year-old boys tied to an iron pole in Kulshi, Lalkhanbazar by a three-member police patrol and being subjected to torture.\nCustodial torture continues to afflict the country's law enforcement system despite the framing of the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act 2013, the ratification of the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment, and firm directives from the higher judiciary. At a time when policymakers are deeply concerned about the image of the country, they must acknowledge that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and only in accordance with the law. They ought to ensure that egregious violation of human rights, such as custodial torture, no longer takes place. There is also the need for impartial investigation into all allegations of custodial torture to hold the perpetrators to account. There is an urgent need for an unambiguous political commitment at the highest level of the government to not tolerate torture and ill treatment under any circumstances or against any person. In the past, demands have been made by vested quarters to amend the TCD (Prevention) Act and weaken its efficacy.\nThe government must remain resolute and commit that it has no intention of limiting the applicability of the said Act and ensure that the Act is applicable to all forces. It must also commit that all officials engaged in acts of torture and ill treatment will be prosecuted and punished with penalties commensurate to the crime of torture \u2013 including those with superior or command responsibility \u2013 and that measures will be taken to ensure that confessions obtained from criminal suspects through torture or ill treatment are not accepted as evidence of guilt. There is also the need for the collection of systematic statistical data on the implementation of the TCD (Prevention) Act on the number of complaints, investigations, prosecutions, and trials and convictions.\nDr\u00a0CR Abrar\u00a0is an academic and human rights expert.\n\n",

        "full_article": "For decades, Bangladesh has benefitted from preferential trading arrangements with the European Union (EU) through the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). The GSP provides trade \"sweeteners\" on international trade to developing and low-income economies. For apparel exports, this means that Bangladeshi-made garments can enter the EU market duty and quota-free, offering our manufacturers a significant cost advantage and ensuring that our exports are highly competitive.\nThe GSP has many advantages for developing countries like ours, such as helping expand our exports, accelerating GDP growth, and reducing unemployment. All of these laudable aims dovetail with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for instance relating to decent work, poverty alleviation, and women's emancipation.\nThe EU and the UK together account for about 60 percent of Bangladesh's exports, more than 90 percent of which consist of textile and clothing items. This indicates how valuable the EU's GSP has been for Bangladesh over the years.\nThough Bangladesh's GSP status is set to expire in 2023, a similar scheme is expected to be in place to provide our country with duty-free access to the EU until 2029.\nBut will Bangladesh be able to move into the new regime automatically? There is good reason to pose this question.\nBangladesh needs a Plan B, surely. We cannot rely solely on the competitive advantages conferred by duty-free trade. We must start preparing for 2029 now.\nOne option which many are mentioning is that Bangladesh could make a case for GSP+. This is similar to the current GSP in some ways. For example, it cuts tariffs for vulnerable low and lower-middle income countries. But, to qualify for GSP+, countries must sign and ratify 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance.\nSo, would Bangladesh qualify for the GSP+? There are absolutely no guarantees for this, unfortunately.\nFirstly, even where GSP is concerned, Bangladesh has had a bumpy ride at times. There have been occasions when the European Union has threatened to revoke our GSP status. This is because of accusations that our garment industry is not meeting stipulations laid down by the International Labour Organization (ILO) pertaining to labour and human rights.\nThere are always conditions attached to trade agreements. The EU increasingly lays a huge emphasis on labour rights (and rightly so). But, with Bangladesh always under such global scrutiny, there is a concern that sooner or later, we might risk losing the GSP \u2013 or the GSP+, if it is granted \u2013 due to a few \"rotten apples\" in our ready-made garments industry. As the saying goes, you are only as strong as your weakest link.\nI am not ruling out the possibility of Bangladesh being granted a place in the GSP+. I would rather argue that we need to also prepare for a time when we can stand on our own two feet as far as international trade is concerned. To do this, I believe we now need to make faster moves on bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and also preferential trading agreements (PTAs) with some of our existing trading partners, where we can negotiate mutually gainful benefits and opportunities. It is a new game that our government and businesses must start preparing for.\nFTAs will take us to a new world of \"survival\" where \"trade-offs\" (read: give and take) will determine the game. It is much more than simply reducing and/or eliminating tariffs between trading partners. Such agreements these days are more complex and multi-layered and are often subjected to dominant geopolitics. They help address barriers that might otherwise restrict the flow of goods and services, and encourage inward investments. There is no choice but to improve and strictly enforce domestic rules, policies, and standards in regard to intellectual property, e-commerce, and public procurement.\nAs well as providing trading benefits for Bangladeshi RMG exporters, FTAs could give domestic businesses and consumers improved access to a wider range of competitively priced goods and services, technologies, and innovative practices. FTAs can also help to promote regional economic integration while building shared and mutually beneficial approaches to trade and investment between Bangladesh and its trading partners. Many opine that Bangladesh is still too slow to engage on FTAs and instead depends more on its GSP status to accelerate its garment exports to the EU.\nRecently, Bangladesh's Commerce Minister, Tipu Munshi discussed the settlement of an omnibus trade agreement with India. A joint feasibility study on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has now been carried out after the two countries agreed to explore a bilateral FTA+.\nUnder a CEPA, the two countries can either significantly reduce or completely eliminate customs duties on the majority of goods traded between them. A CEPA would also ease facilitating trade for services and attracting investments.\nIn recent years, Bangladesh's leaders have also considered adopting FTAs with China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Canada, and Malaysia. Bangladesh has also been mentioned as a potential member of the Eurasian Customs Union and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a regional trade agreement among the Asia-Pacific nations.\nIf one is specifically thinking about apparel production, there is a clear opportunity for Bangladesh to negotiate FTAs with raw material producers like cotton-producing African countries. Could reducing or removing import duties on cotton for such countries be agreed upon in return for the duty-free export of Bangladeshi garments? I see little reason not to consider so.\nFTAs bring about a wealth of opportunities for Bangladesh. It all depends on how deftly, strategically, and futuristically Bangladesh can assess its present and possible future scenarios and negotiate accordingly. I see the steady implementation of FTAs as being symbolic of our country no longer being reliant on trading agreements with the huge EU block, and being ready to better negotiate in our own ways with partner countries from around the world.\nTo ensure that FTAs deliver, I believe, our companies in our garment industry will need to develop in tandem and move steadily away from low-value, staple products. We need to re-define and accept newer production functions and realities. Countries with better, more varied product mixes will invariably have a higher place at the negotiating table when it comes to FTAs.\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "A 20-year-old woman has shown us how generosity can go beyond a person's death. By giving instructions to donate her organs after her passing, Sara Islam, who was suffering from a debilitating disease, has saved the lives of two people with kidney failure and may have given back the sight of two other individuals. For Bangladesh, this is the first successful transplant of organs from a brain-dead person, thanks to an amended law that allows collection of organs from clinically dead individuals with the consent of relatives. In Sara's case, it was her mother who helped to fulfil her daughter's noble wishes.\nThe significance of this selfless act cannot be emphasised enough. In Bangladesh, there are more than 20 million people suffering from some type of kidney disease, with about 40,000 estimated to suffer from kidney failure every year. More than 20,000 of them die as they cannot afford the continuous dialysis that they need to stay alive. The plight of those struggling with the high cost of treatment has recently come to the fore after patients and relatives protested a hike in kidney dialysis fees in Chattogram. Against this backdrop, Sara has given hope to many individuals who face death or years of painful dialysis that comes with risks.\nKidney transplants have taken place since 1982, but until 2018, when the organ donation law was amended, it was illegal to take kidneys from a clinically dead person. While living-donor kidney transplants do occur in the country, the law states that it has to be from a relative. The costs of kidney transplants are also very daunting and beyond the financial capacity of most patients. The law was passed after reports of desperate people selling kidneys for money. This means many patients have to wait indefinitely or give up their chance to get a kidney.\nThe two persons who have received Sara's corneas are recovering in hospital, and doctors are hopeful that their eyesight will be restored. With such miraculous consequences, why is organ donation so scarce? While cornea donation has gained certain acceptance, the practice of donating other organs has not caught on. Religion and cultural taboos have made people reluctant about organ donation. But as other countries have shown, thousands can have a second lease on life through this practice. Just as successful campaigning has made blood donation popular among people, the concept of organ donation after death has to be made acceptable and well-received. We commend BSMMU, National Kidney Foundation and Sandhani Eye Hospital for the success in these life-changing transplants, and for making Sara's wishes come true.\nWe express our heartfelt condolences to Sara's family for losing such a remarkable young member. But we also applaud Sara and her mother for their love of humanity. May their example inspire others to donate similarly so that many lives can be saved.\n",

        "full_article": "The need for dedicated children's hospitals (Shishu Haspatals) in the country cannot be overemphasised. The Prime Minister's call for establishing such hospitals in every division of the country underscores this long-felt need. She made the call late last week at a function marking the operation of community vision centres at 45 more upazila health complexes in 15 districts. Given the myriad problems afflicting the child health sector in the country, expansion of specialised childcare facilities, now concentrated in large cities, is long overdue. The greater the reach of such dedicated hospitals is the higher the chance of ensuring healthcare for children at the grassroots level. The country's upazila heath complexes under 64 districts are presently catering to the medical needs of the child patients. However, the standard of treatment and medication involving children is not always up to the mark. Cases of faulty treatments and the resultant complications continue to recur. It compels many parents to opt for district hospitals, and private clinics.The government-supported Bangladesh Shishu Hospital in the capital is serving as a tertiary health facility for treating child patients from across the country. As a hospital, it is well-staffed, well equipped and less expensive. Many of the child specialists of the country serve it as consultants. For the average affluent parents, in the cases of complicated turns of their child patients, they have few options except going to the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital in Dhaka or Maa O Shishu Hospital in Chattogram. Many of the district-based child hospitals have lately earned good name for their higher standard service. Against this backdrop, the division-based dedicated children's hospitals will have to offer specialised child healthcare in order to stop child patients' rush to Dhaka. The number one problem will be to find the required number of specialised paediatric physicians for so many hospitals. In the vast rural area, it's the herbal medical practitioners and faith healers who are still found ruling the roost on the parents of the child patients. Modern treatment of children's ailments still remains elusive to hundreds of patients. The problem lies with bringing proper healthcare to the children and vice versa. It's a daunting task. But when an area is located within the range of a dedicated hospital, long-term results may follow. As a dedicated hospital targets a particular disease or diseases, there is no reason why this move will not prove successful. In terms of humans it aims at a particular segment --- from the elderly to the children. Dedicated hospitals have been seen in Dhaka during the Covid-19 pandemic, when patients were admitted to these facilities to enable them to get cured. The recovery rate was quite satisfactory. The dedicated divisional hospitals for children will bring about a paradigm shift if the plan is well executed. Unlike with the conventional hospitals, required treatment and cares meant for child patients could be availed here under one roof. If run well, dedicated hospitals for children can immensely contribute to improvement of child health and ultimately national health.",

        "full_article": "Bullying in schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions is a systemic problem everywhere. About school bullying, the National Center for Educational Statistics, which is under the United States' education department, in a report in 2016 said that one in five students of that country was bullied. In that report bullying was defined as an aggressive behaviour characterized by 'power imbalance and the intent to cause harm,'. In other words, the potential bully targets the student who in the former's eye is vulnerable. And it is this feeling of powerlessness of the victim student before the bully that leads to the latter's long-lasting psychological, emotional and physical problems. In the USA and other advanced countries, teachers look after the problem of bullying and they have a systematic approach to the issue and the ways to resolve it. And it is an essential part of the teachers' duty in the American schools to recognise the warning signs of bullying in a student-if he/she is a bully in the making or has the vulnerability of being bullied. As a result, the students are continuously under the teachers' watch enabling the latter to counsel the school children. With their intimate knowledge of the psychological pattern of every school student under their care, the teachers are better able to prevent acts of bullying from taking place or can handle it properly if it happens. However, our school teachers in most cases lack the necessary skill to grapple with the problem of bullying among their students. As a result, whenever any incident of bullying happens in our schools, teachers, in the absence of any systematic approach to deal with the problem, take an ad hoc approach to resolve then. A Unicef study conducted in 2019 found that one in every four students in Bangladesh is subjected to bullying by her/his peers. In comparison to American schools as mentioned earlier, the percentage of bullying in Bangladeshi schools is 5.0 percentage points higher. Clearly, the school authorities are not able to handle the issue on their own. Had our school teachers adopted a modern approach as is practised in the advanced countries to know their students closely and the school administrations put the required internal mechanism in place to address it, the higher educational institutions would get a better supply of disciplined students every year. In the institutions of higher learning, on the other hand, the phenomenon of bullying takes a new turn because there the students are no more children but grown-up adults. When adults engage in bullying, it may turn violent and as a result become a law and order issue. Recently, bullying, in the name of ragging, is taking place in the different educational institutions, especially in colleges and universities. In the earlier times, rag day would be observed by students at the end of their academic life in a college or university. On that day, they would have fun by singing and dancing, spraying coloured water onto one another and eat out in groups or do other things to make their last day in that educational institution memorable. Then the rag day activities also included charitable work like collecting used clothes, money, etc for the poor. But of late, bullying has replaced rag-day fun. Some students usually become violent and go on a rampage on the campus. They hold DJ parties, engage in all forms of obscenity, bully other students and do things unbecoming of a university student. The victims of bullying are often roughed up, forced to pay toll or are humiliated in different ways. Such rowdy behaviour has begun to infect otherwise normal students and the savage culture of rag day has witnessed an alarming rise in recent days in different educational institutions across the country. And it is against this backdrop that on April 17, 2022, the High Court ordered the authorities concerned to stop DJ party, illegal and cruel activities and bullying in the name of 'rag day' at all educational institutions.In this connection, the education ministry is learnt to be working on a draft to form a bullying prevention committee at different educational institutions including public and private secondary-level schools, colleges, universities and madrasas. The said anti-bullying committee, soon to be finalised, will consider bullying as a criminal act and punishable by law. Its aim, it is said, will be to create an educational environment on the campus that is free of bullying and where students will feel safe to pursue their educational activities. The education ministry's move is no doubt well-meaning. But better it would be to remove the causes that turn students, who should otherwise seek knowledge, into criminals. Teachers also cannot wash their hands of the responsibility in the matter. The government has the most important role to play by ensuring that students may not become a pawn in the game of power politics. The educational institutions should be a place where the foundation of a nation is built. But if those become a place where criminals have the final word, then it is bad news for a nation. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Aishwarya is her nickname, full name Sara Islam. Hers was a brief life of just 20 years, the major part of which was painful because of a genetic health problem called tuberous sclerosis, yet she never betrayed her physical affliction; rather was the first to come forward whenever someone was in need of an emergency help. Had a stint with the Kishore Alo, was good at painting, particularly in drawing portraits. Her illness could not stop this university student from living a mellifluous and meaningful life. It is quite natural she was a moving light before her family and appeared so to all wherever she happened to be. Yet the richness, prosperity, wealth or treasures that her short and handy name suggests were waiting to unfold in their wonderous splendour until her mortal self bade adieu to this world. In her death, Aishwarya embraced immortality. The girl whose heart melted for others in distress when she had to struggle to overcome her physical pain during her lifetime accomplished her life's mission by donating her kidneys and corneas to four different persons at the time of her clinical death. She has thus made medical history in this country by becoming the first ever donor in cadaveric transplantation as it is called in medical parlance. Organ donation, as against sale, is legal in this country since 1982 but there had been no legal provision for transplantation of organs from any brain-dead person until the law was amended in 2018. Since that time no patient or patient's near and dear ones had ever volunteered to make this unique and ultimate sacrifice. Perhaps involved here is the controversial ethical question of euthanasia. After all, termination of life of a patient suffering from incurable and painful disease or in irreversible coma is not an easy decision. Also in rare cases, patients declared clinically dead have come round after years of mere existence on life-support system in a hospital. When a patient, before going into coma, makes her last wish to save other people's lives, it needs a big and heavenly heart full of courage and a sense of purpose. The richness and nobility of Sara Islam's heart did not falter to make the option clear to her mother Shabnam Sultana who only respected her daughter's last wish by consenting to the cadaveric surgery carried out by BSMMU and Sandhani doctors. The innocent and beautiful soul may have taken a flight to the world beyond to have her rightful place there. She has made her family, society and nation proud as do others of her kind in this mortal world before their spiritual journey to get reunited with spirits like Evangeline in Uncle Tom's Cabin. \"In how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not! It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels, whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the wayward human heart, that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight\". The above long excerpt is from Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe. It is part of the moving passages when Uncle Tom and Evangeline are in conversation about the little girl's spiritual experience in their summer villa on Lake Pontchartrain.The readers' hearts melt as old and experienced Tom senses the inevitable which the girl with a golden heart alludes to when she says, \"I'm going there to the spirits bright\". Indeed, the finest souls that arrive in a family conquer everyone with their sweetest smile, their extraordinary sense of empathy and tenderness for all irrespective of human beings ---low and high, and all creatures in distress. They are delighted to see everyone happy. But then the writer adds, \"When the little soul reveals in words sweeter and wiser than ordinary words of children---hope not to retain that child...\" Sara was one such child who came from heaven only to return there soon enough. No remorse then for this extraordinary soul. In Rabindranath's insightful song, \"Tomaro aseeme monoprano lae jato dure ami dhai/ kothao dukhho, kothao mritu, kothao bichhed nai (How far do I proceed with my mind and soul in the infinity of yours/ there is no sorrow, death and separation)\". Death cannot be averted but surely conquered as fictional Eva and Aishwarya of flesh and blood have done. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
