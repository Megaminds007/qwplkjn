In these elections, according to election commission reports, 43 candidates in union parishads and four in upazila parishads won uncontested\u2014and all of them were affiliated with the ruling party, i.e. Awami League (AL). With these 43, a total of 69 candidates have been elected uncontested in union parishad elections in its first phase. Apart from these, last week's parliamentary by-election in Cumilla-7 constituency also saw the unopposed election of an AL candidate. As time goes on, the number of unopposed winners in local elections have been on the rise. But has anybody thought of the dire consequences or of the ominous signs that this kind of uncontested and voter-less elections might have on the future of the democratic process?\nAccording to available information, elections were supposed to be held in a total of 379 union parishads in April this year in the first phase. But due to Covid-19, it was deferred to June when elections were held in 204 union parishads, with 167 being further postponed for various reasons. Of these, in 160 parishads, polls were held on September 20, and the remaining seven are yet to be held. Polls have been held in nine upazila parishads as well. The results of these polls indicate that 27 percent of the winners in union parishads and 45 percent in upazila parishads have secured their victory unopposed, which raises serious questions regarding their democratic legitimacy.\nHowever, such uncontested elections are not a sudden phenomenon in the country\u2014a lack of confidence in the electoral system has been growing since 2014 in Bangladesh. We have been noticing the result of that in recent elections, which has manifested firstly in people's disinterest or indifference in going to the polling stations, and secondly in not being interested to run for elections. This is how the whole system has been approaching its demise. An objective analysis of all post-2018 elections can shed light on this situation.\nAs I remember, the first City Corporation election in Dhaka after 2018 could attract only 30 percent of voters. After that, the by-election of the Dhaka- 5 constituency attracted only 10.43 percent of voters. This is how the fall started, but now, it has spread all over the country like a fast-spreading virus. One might remember a time when elections held at the union parishad level\u2014the lowest tier of local government\u2014would lead to a kind of festive mood at every corner of the villages. Today, that tradition is all but gone. People, except government party supporters, do not feel like coming forward to even stand for such local elections. Needless to say, it is a kind of silent protest against the current electoral institutions that people are turning away from the polls.\nOne can view this degradation of the electoral system in Bangladesh from two angles. Firstly, starting from 2014, the Election Commission has, willingly or unwillingly, failed utterly to create a \"level playing field\" for all stakeholders and political forces to ensure their participation in the electoral process. Ruling party candidates took advantage of this situation and played their own game with the unholy support of local administration. From my own experience, I can tell that in the 2018 elections, many of the age-old electoral rules were ignored in certain locations, such as the system of casting votes in \"closed and secret rooms\", and many voters felt directly intimidated, especially where election officials and administration did not strictly enforce the rules. Such experiences led many opposition candidates to believe there was no use of participating in elections, and many voters at polling centres also felt disheartened and disengaged, which has been responsible for creating widespread voter apathy in the face of potential disenfranchisement.\nIt is a well-established fact that since 2014, the people of Bangladesh have been losing confidence in the electoral system and in electoral institutions. This is an ominous sign of a looming disaster for the nation. We must now put serious thought into how we can keep democracy alive in the country. By now, it should be clear that this cannot be achieved by killing the electoral system.\n\u00a0\nMoshtaque Ahmed is a former UN official.\n",

        "full_article": "Professor Dr Kazi Shahidullah, chairman, University Grants Commission (UGC), former chairman, department of history, Dhaka University, and former vice chancellor, National University, talks to The Daily Star's Naznin Tithi about how universities can recover from learning loss as they are resuming in-person classes and why our universities should continue with online education alongside classroom education.\n\u00a0\nAs universities (both public and private) prepare to resume in-person classes soon, how do you think the learning loss of the past year and a half can be recovered? Does the UGC have any specific directives to the universities, particularly public universities, to address this issue?\nThere is a lot of recovery work to be done. But I believe our public universities will find a way out of this crisis. After reopening, session jam would, no doubt, be an issue. Session jam is not a new thing here. Public universities have faced session jam issues in the past and have successfully overcome it. So, there is no reason why they can't do it now. Extra effort has to come from all quarters\u2014teachers, students and administrators\u2014to tackle the issue. Being a former teacher of DU, I know how the university went through many crisis periods and also recovered. Ways and means of recovery of learning loss have to be discussed and worked out by the respective universities. In public universities, the university syndicates, the academic councils, the dean's committees as well as the academic committees of the respective departments have to discuss the issue and find out a solution.\nAs far as I remember, the UGC sent guidelines to the universities around two months ago suggesting our ideas of how to recover the learning loss in order to help the universities address the issue. We made proposals such as trimming the course outline focusing on more important parts of the syllabus. Another proposal we made was reducing the holidays after reopening. Teachers may have to sacrifice holidays and would work overtime, if need be, to overcome this crisis. They will have to hold exams on time and publish results on time, for which greater coordination and cooperation of all will be needed. Another suggestion would be to extend the lecture time to one hour from the current 50 minutes. These are just some basic ideas. I am sure our public universities will rise up to the occasion and work out ways and means to tackle the learning loss. It won't be solved in a day; we will need time for that.\nThe digital divide in higher education became a cause for serious concern during this time. What lessons have we learnt from this? How will the universities deal with the issue in future?\nThe digital divide is a reality for us. The rural-urban gap and the rich-poor gap are quite significant here. In March 2020, when the universities were closing down at the government's directive, we from the UGC suggested that we should keep the online classes open. The idea was to keep the students engaged in education. Back then, we had no idea that the pandemic would linger on for so long. Later, we realised that online classes were the only option left for us.\nWe noticed that the private universities were keen to open up but the public universities were not responding as much. We had to conduct surveys to understand the reasons behind this and came to know that many public university students did not have the necessary devices to participate in online classes. After giving much effort, we could collect some funds and for the first time in the history of this country, the UGC gave loans to public university students to buy devices. When the problem of devices was somewhat solved, we learned that many students did not have the money to buy the high-priced internet packages. We then sat with the internet service providers to discuss the issue and got good responses from them. Based on our discussions, they offered exclusive internet packages only for students. But even that did not give us the desired result because students in rural areas were having connectivity problems. Disruption of electricity connection in villages was another obstacle the students had to face. So, there's no denying the fact that the digital divide has been a big issue during this time. The UGC tried to do everything in its power to make online education a success. But it cannot do anything about infrastructure development, the government has to do that. We hope the situation will improve in the future.\nBy now, only a few public universities have shown some progress in getting their students vaccinated or registered for vaccines, while the rest are still lagging behind. What is the current situation in this regard? Will it impact the reopening plan?\nWe have around 3.5 lakh students in our public universities. Among them, 2.5 lakh students have taken the first dose of the vaccine. There are roughly 1.3 lakh students in public universities who are hall residents. Among them, 1.18 lakh have taken at least one shot of the vaccine. I think the situation is quite satisfactory.\nHowever, if we take into account the students of the national university, and the seven colleges under Dhaka University, then the total number of students would stand at around 43 lakh\u2014of them, around 18 lakh have registered for vaccines. And, among these 18 lakh, 5.5 lakh have got the first dose of the vaccine. So, there is still a lot to cover. By the way, this is last Monday's statistics.\nOf course, one of our targets is to take the vaccination to a satisfactory level before in-person classes start. But I don't think it will affect the reopening plan of the universities because each university will reopen after completing their preparations. If the authorities of a particular university feel that they are not ready, they can take time to reopen, but many of the universities will reopen pretty soon. While a university can start in-person classes in, say, five days, another university may need 15 days to start the process, but that should not be an issue. What is most important is, universities will have to reopen maintaining all health and safety guidelines. Vaccinating all the students is the most important part but it is not the only way to tackle the pandemic, according to all experts. Vaccinations will help but students will also have to maintain other health guidelines such as wearing masks, washing hands and keeping a safe distance from each other.\nSince Covid-19 will continue to be a factor in the foreseeable future, experts have stressed the need for accommodating in-person and blended/hybrid learning to be able to respond to any emergency. What is the UGC's plan for any future disruptions in academic activities? What kind of reforms does the higher education sector need based on what we learned in the past 1.5 years?\nBlended/hybrid learning is particularly important for a country like ours where we have to face many kinds of adversities in our higher education sector from time to time. What we have realised during this pandemic is that we should keep continuing with online classes alongside in-person classes. From now on, it will be part and parcel of our education system. Since we have to live with Covid-19, blended learning is what we will need in the coming days.\nOne of the basic problems is, our teachers do not have the expertise in online teaching. This is also a new concept for them. Teachers need to be trained so they can meet the expectations of students. What the UGC is trying to do is train university teachers in online teaching. We are now giving our time, energy and resources in capacity building. About a month ago, we conducted an online training programme for teachers in collaboration with the American Cultural Centre. We also collaborated with the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia (CEMCA) in arranging a workshop where 1,000 of our teachers participated. As I am speaking with you now, a workshop is going on with CEMCA titled \"Online and Blended learning in Higher Education\", which will go on for 20 days. Through these workshops, our teachers will attain the necessary skills to provide the students with quality education online. The UGC is arranging such programmes to give our teachers first-hand knowledge on the technical processes involved with online learning.\nWe have been observing many changes in the higher education sector in the 21st century. New technologies have started to emerge, which is impacting our work environment. So now the challenge before our university administrators is to transform our education curriculum from outdated to updated. At the same time, they have to focus on skill development and infrastructure development, so that they can deliver the talents needed for an innovative and digitised economy. Our country's growth and prosperity will depend critically on the ability of the universities to adjust with the changes in society and the economy. Our university administrators have to remain ever alert and do their best so that they can change and modernise the curriculum according to the needs of the fast-changing global economy. That is how our graduates will remain relevant to the demands of the market.\n",

        "full_article": "As developing countries struggle to cope with the pandemic, they risk being set back further by restrictive fiscal policies. These were imposed by rich countries who no longer practice them, if they ever did. Instead, the global South urgently needs bold policies to ensure adequate relief, recovery and reform.\nBold fiscal responses needed\nGovernments must mobilise and deploy resources sustainably and fairly, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With rich countries' refusal to help more, adequate government financing is crucial.\nTaxation is typically a more sustainable, effective and accountable way of raising government fiscal resources. But the pandemic has imposed extraordinary demands requiring massive urgent spending.\nNational authorities can generate fiscal resources in two main ways, by collecting revenue or borrowing. Government borrowing is generally needed as revenue has been hit by the slowdown.\nMassive fiscal resource mobilisation and appropriate spending are needed to contain the contagion and prevent temporary recessions\u2014e.g., due to lockdowns\u2014from becoming debilitating protracted depressions.\nFiscal policy involves both government resource generation and spending. But developing countries have been far more conservative in spending compared to the rich. The latter have introduced much bolder relief and recovery packages.\nIn the short, medium and long term, both government spending and taxation must be progressive. Much depends on how revenue is raised and spent. Hence, both taxation and expenditure need to be considered.\nTaxes less progressive now\nGovernments must quickly develop progressive ways to finance massive spending needed to protect both lives and livelihoods. Over the last four decades, many governments reduced progressive direct taxation, instead embracing regressive indirect taxes.\nHigher tax rates on the wealthy made direct taxation progressive. The regression was mainly due to lobbying by powerful elites, including foreign investors. The influential Washington-based Bretton Woods international financial institutions led such advocacy.\nIncomes of the wealthy are mainly from assets, rather than wages, salaries or payments for goods or services. But tax rates on the highly paid, as well as property, inheritance and corporate incomes have declined in most countries.\nWealth is often untaxed, or only lightly taxed at lower rates. New rules now allow assets to be moved and hidden abroad. Depending on how one estimates, between USD 8-35 trillion is held offshore, obscuring wealth concentration and inequality.\nTaxation can reduce existing inequalities, but rarely does so despite the widespread presumption that taxes are progressive overall. Worse, most state spending is regressive, little mitigated by highly publicised social spending.\nDifficult to measure, pandemic impacts on various inequalities vary considerably. Nevertheless, the vicious cycle connecting economic disadvantage with vulnerability has worsened disparities.\nEnsure progressive taxation\nTo be equitable, taxation must be progressive. More equitable tax systems should get more revenue from those most able to pay while reducing the burden on the needy. Wealth taxes are the most progressive way to raise revenue while also reducing inequalities.\nDirect taxes on wealth and incomes are potentially progressive. Progressively higher rates and exemptions for the poor can ensure this. Low rates on investment income and assets\u2014such as property, wealth and inheritance\u2014can be increased. Besides reducing inequalities, these can finance progressive spending.\nTaxing windfall and excess profits is not only publicly acceptable, but can also raise considerable funds. Some corporations and individuals have benefitted greatly during the pandemic, e.g., US billionaires have reportedly become over a trillion dollars richer over the last year and a half.\nIn the longer term, progressive taxation means less reliance on indirect taxes\u2014such as sales or consumption taxes, including value-added, or goods and services tax\u2014which burden those with lower incomes much more.\nTax evasion by the wealthy must also be deterred. Companies using tax havens to pay less can be penalised, e.g., by disqualifying them from all government and state-owned enterprise contracts. Tax systems can thus be made more progressive by improving design and with strict, equitable enforcement.\nEquitable recovery?\nEnsuring equitable recovery requires urgent systemic reforms. Although unlikely to yield much more revenue in the near term due to the economic slowdown, introducing such reforms now will be politically much easier.\nTaxation can transfer fiscal resources from the wealthy to the needy. Those living precariously, including those now at risk due to the pandemic and its broad impacts, urgently need help. But financing relief and recovery provides liquidity, averting protracted economic contraction and stagnation.\nSome pandemic relief spending in many countries has been \"captured\" by the politically well-connected, as political elites and their cronies seize the lucrative new opportunities. These compromise not only relief and recovery, but also reform efforts.\nWhen relief and recovery are treated as temporary \"one-off\" measures, they are unlikely to address pre-pandemic problems, including inequities. Governments should instead use the crisis to advance SDG solutions for both the medium and long-term.\nMultilateral cooperation needed\nInternational cooperation can help, but the rich countries' Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has long focused on addressing offshore tax evasion to secure more revenue for themselves.\nA decade ago, it broadened its attention, but continued to insist on its own leadership at the expense of developing countries. It has thus effectively blocked multilateral tax cooperation for decades, ignoring the UN's strong mandate from various Financing for Development and other summits.\nEquitable international tax reforms remain urgent. But these have been undermined by earlier reforms encouraging cross-border flows of funds, enabling illicit financial flows from developing countries.\nAlthough unlikely to yield much revenue for some time, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's global minimum corporate income tax proposal deserves strong qualified support.\nDeveloping countries need to ensure that transnational companies are better taxed, instead of the current G7 proposal for a low rate. Revenue should be distributed according to where both production and consumption take place instead of just where sales occur.\nEffectively checking tax abuses also requires access to financial information and common, equitable and transparent rules, not those imposed by the rich. But such outcomes can only be achieved through UN-led multilateralism with developing country governments participating as equals.\n\u00a0\nJomo Kwame Sundaram, a former economics professor and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, received the Wassily Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought in 2007.\nCopyright: Inter Press Service\n",

        "full_article": "You must have heard of the story of a fox who accidentally lost his tail to a trap, and later decreed that all foxes must lose their tails too. The benefits, he claimed, were many: humans hunt foxes for their beautiful bushy tails; the tails can be cumbersome while escaping; and they can make noises while the foxes prey upon their targets. The cosmetic argument hides the fox's maimed reality. While failing to fit in with his tribe without his tail, he schemed to make others look like him. Now why am I thinking of a childhood story to start my Friday? Well, a piece of Taliban news reminded me of the story of this \"tail-ban.\"\nThe vice-chancellor of Kabul University, Dr Muhammad Osman Baburi, has been terminated and then replaced by Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat, a Bachelor of Arts degree holder. Following the appointment of Ashraf Ghairat on Wednesday, around 70 teachers in the university resigned from their posts. Surely, they felt that the tailless beast would be after their tails. Earlier, the Taliban's Education Minister Sheikh Molvi Noorullah Munir announced that master's degrees and PhDs were no more valuable in Afghanistan. \"Mullahs who have come to power don't have such degrees, and yet are greatest of all,\" the education minister argued.\nIn contrast, across the border in India, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has formulated a policy of not to recruit any university teacher without a PhD. The minimum recruitment criteria include doctoral degrees in relevant disciplines, passing the National Eligibility Test (NET), a month-long faculty induction, and a two-hour-long weekly commitment to students for counselling on extracurricular activities. The prescription of the UGC came in 2018 with a three-year lead time. Last week, the implementation of the proposal was stalled considering the Covid-19 situation. However, the higher education regulatory body is adamant on moving ahead with this initiative as it believes that a qualified teacher is the building block of quality education.\nIn order to attract better teachers, the Indian education ministry has revised its pay scale for teachers who would return from abroad. For candidates who have earned their degrees from any of the world's top 500 universities, the NET is waived. Also, the UGC has set assistant professor as the entry-level position, assuming that the candidates would spend their formative years of lectureship in doing research for their PhDs.\nNow, how important is a PhD for an academic post? True, the mullahs have come to power in Afghanistan without having ornamental degrees to precede their names. They have the twists in their turbans to denote their prowess. Shall we follow such a regressive model that disallows academic pedigree?\nOur quest for quality education will remain incomplete without an established culture of research. Unfortunately, we subscribe to a system that does not promote research and innovation. Students can earn their degree simply by attending some summative (mid-term and final) exams and submitting some assignments. Many disciplines do not even require students to write a terminal thesis, which means many teachers don't know how to supervise a research student. By extension, when some of these students join academia, they don't have the orientation to write a research paper or pursue a higher degree. Many of these faculty members take advantage of the systemic loopholes to get promotions. For instance, even working as a house tutor, distributing bulbs among the residents of a student dormitory, is considered for academic promotion in a public university. In such cases, what signals do we give to our junior faculty members when we appoint teachers without a PhD? We have had vice-chancellors, even UGC chairs, without PhD degrees. We can invite scores of foreign consultants to facelift Bangladeshi higher education, but in order to make real systemic change, we must begin with the basics: quality recruitments at the entry level.\nA good education system demands the presence of a good teacher. And for a good teacher, a PhD degree is one of the most respected and well-recognised credentials. It is a badge of personal satisfaction for educators who know that they have achieved a professional goal through intensive research work in their chosen fields. They are capable of contributing to the knowledge economy. In our system, we have allowed fresh graduates with good academic results to join the university with a master's degree with the expectation that they would pursue a second master's degree (as many universities overseas don't acknowledge many of our master's degrees), leading to a PhD while in service. As a lecturer, I took advantage of such a system of study-leave and managed to secure scholarships for higher degrees. But many of my colleagues preferred not to pursue any further education, or some returned after doing a second master's or MPhil. They published the bare minimum of articles\u2014often co-authored with others\u2014in in-house journals to move up the promotion ladder. Some of them are great teachers, no doubt. Somehow, they rehearse what they have learned from their mentors or are comfortable teaching only in particular courses. But that does not make them great academics or researchers.\nMy octogenarian father-in-law still recalls the great life-changing contribution of his maths teacher at Barisal Zilla School in inspiring him to find a place in BUET in 1963. There are many such inspirational teachers without PhDs. But teaching at a university, where our students are our academic peers who force us to constantly learn and update as professional students, is a different ball game altogether. Having studied in three world-class universities in the US and the UK, I remember how small I felt with my university teacher badge, in a class taught by a lecturer with PhDs, who had their books published by the finest publishers. One should not be in academia without a PhD, I told myself.\nWith the pressure to upscale the national portfolio of higher education, the Bangladesh UGC has undertaken consultant-driven workshops to teach colleagues how to publish, how to prepare outcome-based curricula, how to find industry linkage, and so on. These are things that a PhD student learns alongside doing their research, while teaching a course assigned by their supervisor as a graduate teaching or research assistant.\nThe scope of transferable knowledge is trimmed by the UGC, which is paranoid of allowing private universities to offer PhD degrees. Many of the retired professors with stellar academic potential are now teaching at private universities. But the idea that these private institutions might \"sell\" certificates has restricted the regulatory watchdog from encouraging the habitus where PhD culture could have thrived. In its absence, we have developed this culture of homegrown good students getting first into university teaching, then into political grouping, and finally winning a professorship in the public system. This tale is as spectacular as the winding curves of a Taliban turban emitting an aura of power.\nMy own hybrid experience as an academic administrator in both public and private systems tells me: \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.\" You can have endless workshops, but to make someone produce research work is a different story. However, if teachers enter the system with the basic academic and research orientation, they can inspire their students and get into serious research and innovations. A teacher's research credential should be taken into account in making a research supervisor, not the institutional affiliation. We don't want a bulb-giving professor to supervise research students just because he or she is in the public system. The public and the private systems have the same chancellor as their sire; one group should not be treated as the favourite one, while the other one as the foster child.\nLet's rethink our policy of awarding doctoral degrees, and their value in the system. If needed, we can insist on joint supervision of a doctoral thesis from the public-private, local-international pool of supervisors to ensure transparency and quality of the degrees. Such a system will create a culture where PhD is encouraged and applied. Let's rethink PhD as a research generation scheme that will trickle down to all sectors, including the highest seat of learning. Let's rethink our university recruitment policy\u2014or else, we will keep on chasing our own tail without any significant change.\nShamsad Mortuza is acting vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), and a professor of English at Dhaka University (on leave).\n",

        "full_article": "It is a cause for concern that five students of a government primary school in Thakurgaon town have tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks after schools reopened in the country. Since the students who have contracted the virus are of Grade IV and V, the school authorities have suspended the classes of those grades temporarily. Reportedly, all the five students live in an orphanage run by the government. According to the deputy administrator of the orphanage, on September 17, only one child of the orphanage had fever and cold and the five students of the primary school developed symptoms later. Until now, the orphanage authorities have sent the samples of 25 girls for Covid testing and 13 of them came out positive, including the five students of the primary school. It is, however, reassuring to learn that the 13 girls are being treated in the isolation ward of the local government hospital and are doing well now.\nSo far, we haven't learnt of any other instances of the spread of Covid-19 in our schools besides this one in Thakurgaon. We hope other schools will take note of this case and remain ever alert to avoid the spread of the virus in their institutions.\nIn this case, we hope the orphanage authorities will remain alert since there could be more cases in the coming days. Each and every child of the orphanage with the slightest of symptoms must be kept in isolation and get tested. The school authorities also have a lot of responsibilities here. They need to strictly maintain the health safety guidelines, such as making sure that all the students wear masks and wash their hands at regular intervals. However, we know that keeping a safe distance is really difficult in our primary schools where many students have to sit in close proximity to each other. Even then, the school authorities must try to find a way so that students can maintain at least some distance from each other. Moreover, they need to make the guardians aware of the health guidelines and Covid risks their children might be exposed to. Similarly, guardians should never hide the truth about their children's health conditions and should report to the school and keep their children isolated if they suffer from any Covid-19 symptoms. Only awareness can make a lot of difference in keeping our children safe at school during this pandemic.\n",

        "full_article": "We are disappointed, but not at all surprised, to find that the project to acquire land and relocate utility service lines for expanding the Dhaka-Sylhet-Tamabil highway is likely to be delayed by two and a half years and cost double, according to the latest revision proposal of the project. It is hugely concerning that such delays and cost inefficiencies in government projects are continuing to occur, despite repeated expressions of dissatisfaction at this state of affairs from the Prime Minister herself. In fact, in February this year, she directed the authorities to take legal action against those responsible for flawed project designs that ultimately push up costs.\nSuch delays are not only detrimental for the project at hand, but have knock-on effects on other development projects as well. In this case, delays in clearing the land will put on hold the two major projects taken up by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) to turn the Dhaka-Sylhet and Sylhet-Tamabil highways into dual carriageways with separate lanes for slow-moving vehicles. The physical work for this was meant to begin by June next year, and the process of floating tenders to hire contractors has already begun\u2014but what will the contractors work on, if the land itself is yet to be acquired?\nWhat makes the situation even more complicated is that this is the first project in Bangladesh's transport sector that is being funded by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which laid out the specific condition that the highway expansion cannot begin if the land is not cleared first. Yet, over the past three years, the project to clear the land has only progressed by about 25 percent. The delays have been attributed by RHD sources to the fact that the project proposal was based on a feasibility study and detailed design from 2015, which has undergone changes to make way for wider roads and better road safety. However, this does not in any way explain why these factors were not included in the original design in the first place.\nThe director of the highway expansion project told reporters that the land was supposed to be readied before starting the infrastructure building work, but \"that does not happen in reality\". It is disappointing to hear such acceptance of cost overruns and delays as the norm. We urge the government to investigate why we are continuing to see such lethargy, even in the case of implementing major infrastructure development projects, and take prompt actions to change this disheartening state of affairs.\n",
