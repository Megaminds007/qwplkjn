The initiative is touted as a substantial step by the U.S. as part of its decade-old \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, and an attempt at putting some \u201ceconomic heft\u201d into its Indo-Pacific presence that has been on the decline after its decision to quit the Trans Pacific Free Trade Agreement, the CPTPP, in 2017. Officials say the IPEF framework has four \u201cpillars\u201d: supply-chain resilience; clean energy, decarbonisation and infrastructure; taxation and anti-corruption; and fair and resilient trade. Mr. Biden\u2019s visit to Japan and South Korea, attendance at the Quad summit and helming the IPEF launch is also aimed at reassuring the Eastern hemisphere about the U.S.\u2019s focus. India\u2019s joining is an equally strong statement of commitment to Indo-Pacific goals, and to broadening regional economic cooperation, particularly after it walked out of the 15-nation RCEP. It is significant that all IPEF members, other than India and the U.S., are a part of the RCEP free trade agreement, and yet have chosen to be part of the U.S.-led initiative.Despite the strong signalling from all sides, however, there are many aspects to the IPEF that bear further scrutiny. Monday\u2019s launch only signals the willingness of the 13 countries to begin discussions on the contours. Much will depend, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed, on how inclusive the process is. Second, U.S. officials have made it clear that it is not a free trade agreement; nor will it discuss tariff reductions or increasing market access, raising questions about its utility. Shorn of the rhetoric of Indo-Pacific cooperation, there must be more clarity on its framework. The four pillars also lend themselves to some confusion, drawing into question whether there is enough common ground among the 13 countries that are part of very different economic arrangements, as well as outliers (the U.S. and India), to set standards together, or be open to issues that vary for each country. The U.S.\u2019s statement that the IPEF is essentially focused on \u201cAmerican workers\u201d also raises questions on whether increasingly protectionist global trends will chafe. Each of the IPEF countries has considerable trade interests in China, with most having large trade deficits. So, it remains to be seen how much they will be willing to sign on with the IPEF. Already three ASEAN countries, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, have decided to stay out of the framework\u2019s launch. Above all, given the fact that the U.S.\u2019s previous initiatives (the Blue Dot Network and the Build Back Better Initiative) have made little headway in changing the region\u2019s infrastructural needs, the IPEF faces a credibility challenge. Negotiators will need to move with both caution and clarity before making any big promises on its benefits for the region.",

The World Health Organization\u2019s act of recognising India\u2019s ASHA (accredited social health activists) and the polio workers of Afghanistan is an attempt to right that wrong. It is a rare, and commendable doffing of the hat for workers at the very bottom of the rung, and gives credit where it is due. When WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the names of six Global Health Leader awardees at the opening session of the World Health Assembly, over one million ASHAs and eight volunteer polio workers found themselves being counted amidst people leading from the front. The other awardees are Paul Farmer, co-founder of the NGO Partners in Health, Ahmed Hankir, a British-Lebanese psychiatrist, Ludmila Sofia Oliveira Varela, a youth sports advocate, and Y\u014dhei Sasakawa, WHO\u2019s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. Dr. Tedros who picks the awardees himself, said that the award recognises those who have made an outstanding contribution to protecting and promoting health around the world, at a time when the world is facing an unprecedented convergence of inequity, conflict, food insecurity, climate crisis and a pandemic.The ASHAs were honoured for their \u201ccrucial role in linking the community with the health system, to ensure those living in rural poverty can access primary health care services....\u201d These workers, all women, faced harassment and violence for their work during the pandemic, well documented in the media. While the pandemic rewrote the rules, creating danger where mere routine existed, it must be stressed that in general, their job, which takes them into difficult-to-reach places and hostile communities, confers a measure of privations. Even as they contribute to better health outcomes, this workforce continues to protest across the country, for better remuneration, health benefits and permanent posts. The eight volunteer polio workers of Afghanistan (four of them women) were shot and killed by gunmen in Takhar and Kunduz provinces in February 2022. Their work was crucial in a country where wild polio virus type 1 is still circulating, WHO recorded. Clearly, certain kinds of basic public health work are fraught with perils in several continents across the world. It is the duty of the governmental agencies that employ them to ensure their welfare, safety and security. While cheerleading about the award is rightfully reaching a crescendo, what matters is how the Indian government serves its last mile health workers who are its feet on the ground, once the dust raised by their unexpected recognition has settled down.",

        "full_article": "The notoriety of Dhaka's traffic is now daily news. Civil society members have been venting frustration about this maddening crisis. Transportation engineers\u2014local and international\u2014have been busy offering solutions akin to those in highly developed cities like Melbourne or Singapore. These solutions include, among others, improved public transportation and automated ticketing systems, dedicated lanes for bus rapid transit, smart road signals, and coordinated traffic management. They are all well-meaning suggestions. But they are, alas, pipe dreams, given our tangled urban realities. While technically sound, these solutions are likely to fail, because they ignore complex sociocultural issues and public behavioural patterns that make traffic congestion an insurmountable knot in the first place.\nThe hard reality is that Dhaka's traffic problem will not go away anytime soon. The causes for the city's clotted streets can't be undone overnight. Technical solutions alone are not enough, since the capital city's traffic jam is the result of a complex combination of sociocultural factors, lack of rational land use, and misguided urban governance. Let me explain these three issues briefly before contemplating ways forward.\nFirst, to unpack the sociocultural roots of our capital city's notorious traffic congestion, it would be logical to zoom in on its primary contributor: the private car. Private cars occupy 70-80 percent of Dhaka arteries, while serving only 5-10 percent of daily commuters. This is a glaring example of social injustice and inequity. Neither Copenhagen nor Singapore would ever allow this asymmetric distribution of urban resources. Let's put it in perspective. Assume 150 people from a neighbourhood need to go from Point A to Point B. Compare the road space needed by three public buses that can carry them with the space needed by 75-100 personal cars to transport the same number of people. Imagine the street: three buses with a lot of free road space versus 75-100 cars with very little road space left. This is the reality of Dhaka's roads. And, this is not fair to the 90 percent of the city's daily commuters.\nThis is also simple maths justifying the utility of public transportation. An efficient public transportation system means people won't have to rely on private cars to go around. Yet, we don't embrace the idea of public transportation. There are a host of reasons for this. For the rising middle class, the personal automobile is the ubiquitous expression of social mobility\u2014a moving family fortress that ensures safety on a hazardous road and showcases social status. About 4,000-6,000 newly registered cars and other motorised vehicles pour into the streets of Dhaka every month. Banks offer up to 90 percent of car loans to help clients buy their dream cars. The mushrooming car dealerships across the city are viewed as symbols of a prosperous society. Rapidly growing personal car ownership is the future of the city. And that future is filled with insanely congested streets.\nThe personal car is not the disease. The problem is how we embrace the personal car as a lifestyle. In a democratic society, how would the government discourage a family from buying a personal car when there is no safe, comfortable, and gender-friendly alternative for mobility? Singapore deploys draconian measures to make car ownership an impossibly expensive and bureaucratic process. Policies are in place there to encourage the public to utilise an efficient mass transit. Owning a car in Singapore is, in fact, a burden. In Dhaka, such measures won't work yet, because there are no comfortable alternatives. The Singapore model won't work because we have not yet figured out what kind of city we would like to develop. It is a deeply political and cultural question.\nSecond, Dhaka traffic is a multigenerational crisis, long in the making. Since the 1980s, when the capital city's urbanisation began to accelerate, we have ignored one of the key tools of creating a sustainable urban DNA: land-use planning. We allowed the city to become an untenable urban juggernaut, an infernal urban agglomeration, paying little attention to how the city's land could be developed with a logical sequence of use and zoning. What is land-use planning? A basic example begins with your family. Your children should be able to walk safely to their school in 5-15 minutes. This means each neighbourhood or a ward should have a number of good schools, so that a kid from Dhanmondi will not have to make an exhausting trip to school in Uttara. A good Segunbagicha school for Segunbagicha kids is good land-use planning. A city with a prudent land-use template reduces unnecessary road traffic, because people will not have to crisscross the city to reach their destinations.\nThird, it is inevitable that a lack of coordinated urban governance would result in unregulated clogged streets. Much has been said about the lack of coordination among Dhaka's different urban agencies responsible for providing services. The streets of a megapolis like this city are too heavy a responsibility to be left to too many agencies. Cleaning the traffic mess in the city needs one tsar. That tsar needs to go to sleep thinking about solutions for Dhaka streets and wake up thinking about solutions for Dhaka streets. Period.\nWhat are the ways forward? The hard truth is that if Dhaka's urban status quo continues, it is going to take a generation or two for the city to become sane before it bursts at its seams.\nIf we don't want to wait until Dhaka becomes Mohenjo-daro, the only way out is its decentralisation. Dhaka needs to stop being a monstrous primate city (greater than two times the next largest city in a \u200bcountry or containing over one-third of a nation's population). As the former World Bank economist Ahmad Ahsan studied, the economic costs of the capital city's overgrowth are a staggering 11 percent reduction in GDP, or about USD 32 billion in 2019. Ahsan wrote, \"The urban population of Bangladesh has grown by nearly 10 times after independence, where as much as a third of which has taken place in Dhaka, whose population grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent per annum between 1974 and 2017. Other large cities, though\u2014Chattogram and Khulna with populations of more than one million\u2014have grown at a far lower rate of 1.7 percent per annum.\"\nDhaka must stop being the only dream centre in the country. We need to lessen the city's burden. University education? Go to Dhaka. Heart surgery? Go to Dhaka. Establish a startup? Go to Dhaka. Why can't Sylhet become a national hub of healthcare? What's stopping Chattogram from becoming all things maritime? Why is Rangpur, with a new airport, not an industrial hub? Why can't Barishal be a new centre of high-tech industry, like Bengaluru, in the wake of Padma Bridge? Dhaka doesn't have to be everything. Being everything is killing Dhaka. Why are some ministries not located in other divisions?\nDecentralisation is easier said than done, particularly when there is a pervasive but irrational political fear that being away from Dhaka\u2014the centre of all powers\u2014is to risk being forgotten, ignored, and diminished. Nobody wants to go outside Dhaka. The risk is too high. Time has come to fight this entrenched fear to save this city from the looming disaster. Dhaka must be decentralised. If necessary, the capital should be split between two cities. In an earlier column, I wrote, \"Time has come when the idea of splitting the administrative functions of the capital into two cities should no longer appear absurd. On the contrary, the idea should rapidly sink in \u2026 Indeed, we should begin to incubate this idea in our political and administrative heads.\" I provided many examples of capital relocation across the world.\nDuring Eid holidays, the insanity of Dhaka's streets disappears. That's because people return to their homes in other parts of the country. This \"return\" should be encouraged, facilitated, and incentivised by a policy of decentring Dhaka. Which ministry should we move to Rajshahi first?\n\u00a0\nAdnan Zillur Morshed,\u00a0PhD, is an architect, architectural historian, and urbanist.

        "full_article": "Educators in these columns have been asking for recovery and remedial actions to overcome the pandemic-induced learning losses that threaten a generational learning disaster. The problems regarding quality, equity and inclusion in education that existed before the pandemic have been magnified by its effects. A medium-term recovery and renewal plan for education has become urgent.\nTwelve years ago, in April 2010, when a new Education Policy commissioned by the Awami League-led coalition government was about to be finalised, five of the most respected educators of Bangladesh put out a joint statement, spelling out a nine-point agenda for the renewal of Bangladesh's education system. It was published in the media then.\nThe National Education Policy, 2010, adopted in December of that year, remains largely unimplemented. And the nine-point advice of the eminent educators remain highly relevant today. The five education gurus were: Prof Kabir Chowdhury, who headed the commission that prepared the 2010 policy; Prof Anisuzzaman, national professor; Prof Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, former vice-chancellor of Jahangirnagar University; Prof Jamal Nazrul Islam, director of the Research Centre for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the Chittagong University; and Prof Serajul Islam Chowdhury, professor emeritus of Dhaka University. Among them, only Prof Sirajul Islam Chowdhury is still with us today.\nThe nine points, abridged and paraphrased from Bangla, are as follows:\n1) To keep students and the youth away from ill-politics and to protect the academic environment on campus, the Awami League should sever its links with the Chhatra League. All heads of institutions and local administrations should be directed to strictly control criminal activities and rule-breaching by students; support from all levels of government should be assured for this purpose. This is essential to revive the glorious tradition of student politics.\n2) The major goals of the education policy under preparation enjoy broad consensus. Subject to approval by parliament, steps should be taken to realise the broadly supported goals.\n3) Among the important issues about which there is no debate include: a) A unified core curriculum for all students in primary and secondary education; b) All students should acquire basic competencies, including Bangla and English languages, maths, science, history, social studies, and information technology, and the outcomes should be assessed by applying scientific methods; c) Primary and secondary education management and planning should be meaningfully decentralised with the heads of institutions possessing the skills, capability and status to provide educational leadership.\n4) A permanent education commission answerable to the parliament should be established to guide and oversee adapting and adjusting of the policy and to solve problems\u00a0 in the light of experience and emerging issues.\n5) To fulfil the constitutional obligation regarding education, to define roles of the state and citizens, and to outline the management and financing principles, a national education law should be adopted. The permanent education commission can guide this work.\n6) To mobilise adequate education resources, the budget allocation for education should be doubled from two percent of GDP within five years, and raised to six percent eventually as required by the international standards.\n7) As a means of mobilising adequate education resources, an education surcharge should be introduced on all major taxes, as practised in some countries. In India, education surcharge of two percent, later increased to three percent, is deposited in a permanent basic education fund, which covers the national school lunch programme and other equity-promoting measures.\n8) To invest public funds for education equitably, education budgets should be allocated on the basis of student population in each upazila. To fulfil the right to universal education up to at least Grade 8, coordinated and decentralised comprehensive planning covering state and no-state education services in each upazila should be undertaken.\n9) Three specific actions should be included in the Sixth Five-Year Plan (2010-15): a) School meal in all schools to encourage a full school day; b) A 10-year plan to attract and retain the best talents in school teaching. It should include designing \"education\" as a \"major\" in the regular college degree course, with 100 colleges\u2014at least one in each district\u2014prepared to offer the education major, well-equipped with physical facilities and good teachers, and creating an education service corps for government and government-assisted schools with appropriate social status, remuneration, and career path; c) A nationwide network of lifelong youth/adult community learning centres should be set up to extend widely opportunities for literacy, IT, skill-upgrading for the informal economy, and learning for personal development. This should replace the ongoing conventional and ineffective adult literacy courses.\nThe nine-point agenda and the priorities indicated for the sixth FYP remain almost entirely valid now for the current eighth FYP and beyond\u2014an indication of unimplemented plans and unfulfilled expectations. One amendment in the agenda now would be that the universal education plan for Grade 8 should be replaced by a plan for secondary education up to Grade 12. Anything less is not acceptable for an aspiring higher-middle-income country.\nThe eminent educators urged that short-sighted views and narrow political calculation should be shunned, since such calculations do not serve the country or the regime well. They believed that a good faith effort by the political decision-makers along the line proposed, reflecting an enlightened political calculation, would attract overwhelming public support.\n\u00a0\nDr Manzoor Ahmed\u00a0is professor emeritus at Brac University, chair of Bangladesh ECD Network, vice-chair of Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE), and a member of the international advisory committee of the Yidan Education Prize Foundation.\n",

        "full_article": "This year marks 50 years of a long and strong friendship between Bangladesh and the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The Nordic countries followed the struggle for freedom by the Bangladeshi people and simultaneously recognised the independent and sovereign nation of Bangladesh on February 4, 1972. Since then, our joint journey has taken us far, and as reliable partners and friends, the Nordic countries have stood by Bangladesh's side through challenges and successes.\nFrom the very beginning and during its early decades, Bangladesh was one of the top recipients of development assistance from the Nordic countries. It started with humanitarian aid and then moved into development cooperation, creating long-lasting results and multifaceted impact. Our development partnership has covered a wide range of sectors and has been a key pillar of our relationship. It has contributed to fostering strong and sustained economic development and poverty reduction in Bangladesh.\nOver the last decades, relations between Bangladesh and the Nordic countries have matured and broadened. We want to continue this vibrant partnership by joining forces to tackle the global challenges of today. Topping the list is countering the negative effects of climate change. As one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, Bangladesh has been a pioneer in managing the risks of natural disasters. The Nordic countries are proud to have been supporters in preventive measures, such as flood forecasting, cyclone shelters and disaster management. We commend Bangladesh's journey towards climate resilience and will continue to support adaptation and mitigation efforts, as well as promoting decarbonisation and green transition, by bringing climate-smart solutions to the country.\nThe importance of a sustainable and green transition in sectors such as water, energy, connectivity and digitalisation, smart urban cities, and waste management will continue to be a priority for the Nordics. We are known for our ability to combine economic growth with pursuing the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources. Nordic companies provide well-tested green solutions. The Nordics seek to share lessons learnt and our experience of sustainable economic growth with Bangladesh. Marine resources and Blue Economy are other areas with scope for closer cooperation. We also foresee increased partnerships in fields, such as environment-friendly high-tech extraction of coastal and ocean resources, shipbuilding and recycling, and development of port facilities. In light of Bangladesh's graduation from LDC status, the four countries are becoming well-positioned to expand their close cooperation within these sectors.\nAlready, more than 100 Nordic companies do business in Bangladesh. This is a further signal of a dynamic partnership in transition. The volume of trade and investment between Bangladesh and the Nordic countries has grown steadily over the years, and we are seeing an increased interest in expanding our overall business relations. Some of the Nordic investments and imports have gone beyond business purposes and helped empowering millions of people (e.g. Grameenphone, H&M, and Arla).\nThe Nordics consistently stress the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment, a priority that we share with Bangladesh. We have seen women in the RMG industry, a sector where important Nordic companies are active, contribute greatly to the economic development of the country. Investing in women's economic empowerment is not only the right thing to do, but also smart and profitable. For decades, the Nordic countries have worked with Bangladesh to explore ways of strengthening gender equality, including ensuring women's rights, combating gender-based violence, accessing livelihoods and education, as well as improving health and nutrition. Our efforts have contributed to positive advancements, but more needs to be done. We look forward to continuing our cooperation in addressing social norms, power structures, and the root causes of gender inequality and discrimination.\nRespect for democracy and human rights are cornerstones of the Nordic societies and permeate all areas of our foreign policies. We are convinced that democracy offers the best foundation for a sustainable society. A democratic, inclusive, and equal society based on the rule of law provides opportunities for all to achieve their full potential. Upholding human rights complements and reinforces democracy in building a just and stable society. Also, in this area we will continue to work with the Bangladesh government and civil society.\nThe Nordic countries are three relatively small countries, but among the keenest supporters of multilateralism, global solidarity and international law. We share this ambition with Bangladesh. This is also why the Nordic countries strongly support Bangladesh in its efforts to ensure the basic needs and rights of the Rohingya refugees. In addition to providing humanitarian aid to the refugees, the Nordic countries have extended their diplomatic support for Bangladesh in its efforts to ensure a dignified, safe, and voluntary repatriation of the Rohingyas to Myanmar when conditions allow.\nThe Bangladesh-Nordic partnership reflects our common ambition to reach international goals pertaining to multilateralism and sustainability and jointly achieving the 2030 Agenda. The Nordic countries are thus well-placed to remain valuable partners to Bangladesh, to ensure sustainable development in all three pillars of sustainability: economic, social and environmental.\nReflecting on the past 50 years, we are all excited to continue our joint journey with Bangladesh\u2014for the coming 50 years and beyond.\n\u00a0\nWinnie Estrup Petersen\u00a0is the ambassador of Denmark to Bangladesh.\u00a0Espen Rikter-Svendsen\u00a0is the ambassador of Norway to Bangladesh. \u00a0Alexandra Berg von Linde\u00a0is the ambassador of Sweden to Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs has reportedly expressed \"deep concerns\" over the increasing number of divorces in Bangladesh. Following a meeting where this so-called grave issue afflicting the nation was discussed by our lawmakers, one MP went so far as to blame \"drugs and TikTok\" for the sharp rise in divorces, suggesting that social media sites be banned to save the sanctity of marriage.\nIn a country where lawmakers can condone crossfires in parliament, it is hardly shocking that MPs would make problematic and reductive comments without care. Yet, we can't help but be surprised that a parliamentary committee that is tasked with upholding the rights and dignity of women and girls should find no issue of more urgent socio-political and economic importance to highlight than the rising rate of divorces\u2014that, too, at a time when child marriage rates are at an all-time high, women are being harassed and violated both within and outside home, migrant female workers are returning home abused and empty-handed, and female garment workers are struggling to survive on their meagre wages.\nIf nothing else, the committee's statements on the issue depict an alarmingly narrow understanding of an evolving society, the lived realities of women, and the patriarchal structures that continue to constrain women's true emancipation.\nThe committee is, however, correct in their observation that divorce rates are increasing across the country at a dramatic rate. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) recorded a 34 percent rise in divorce applications in just seven years back in 2018. Since then, the numbers have only shot up, particularly during the pandemic: in 2021, there was almost a 14 percent hike after the Covid outbreak in 2020, with double the number of women serving divorce notices than men. Officials of the city corporations in Dhaka, which register divorces, stated that well-educated, professional and wealthy women were comparatively filing more divorce suits.\nThere's no doubt that many like the parliamentary committee members see these numbers as a premonition of the apocalypse. For them, these divorces\u2014especially the ones initiated by women\u2014denote moral decay and the breakdown of long-held cultural values. But as long as we are citing statistics, here's another one to consider: 51 percent of women aged 15-49 years in Bangladesh have experienced physical or sexual violence by their partners during their lifetimes, according to a report of the World Health Organization (WHO). The question then is not why women are leaving their husbands, but why more women are not leaving their abusers.\nIn a culture that thinks a woman's primary goal in life is marriage, a premature end to it is logically seen as the worst possible outcome\u2014not a lifetime of unhappiness and compromises, not physical and verbal abuse, not even death. That's why we'd rather see a woman rot in a violent marriage, bearing the brunt of a toxic partner's whims and abuses for a lifetime, than have the courage to call it quits and dream of a better life for herself. We'd rather have a woman's nose and eyes gouged out in front of her five-year-old daughter, than her make the \"selfish\" decision to leave him. We'd rather have a woman be publicly policed and humiliated by her husband in front of their son, than stand up to him and demand that she be treated with respect. After all, isn't that what women have done for centuries\u2014sacrifice their lives at the altar of men's egos?\nDespite what the numbers might imply, divorce is still a taboo in Bangladesh. Even for educated women who come from privileged families, the decision to end a marriage is a difficult one, not least because it is a lonely, convoluted and emotionally draining process for everyone involved. The endless barrage of prying and insensitive questions from family, friends and not-so-well-wishers are enough to push even the most grounded of women into depression, anxiety and a host of other mental disorders. The omnipresent fear of \"what will people say\" deters many women from doing what they know deep down they should. I know too many women\u2014all educated and successful in their fields\u2014stuck in unhappy marriages, who are constantly performing the part of the happy and dutiful wife to avoid public scrutiny and criticism.\n\nWe'd rather see a woman rot in a violent marriage, bearing the brunt of a toxic partner's whims and abuses for a lifetime, than have the courage to call it quits and dream of a better life for herself.\nIf society is this harsh against women in abusive marriages, can you imagine its reaction when a woman decides to end her marriage\u2014or when two people in a marriage make a mutual decision\u2014because they are no longer in love or feel they are incompatible with each other? Society insists on reducing a personal decision between two people into a melodramatic public event requiring endless investigation: Was he violent? Was he having an affair? Is he on drugs? Was she a bad wife? Did she have an affair? Is she too focused on her career? It is inconceivable to us that two people can reach a logical conclusion to end their marriage because it's simply not working out. This is not to say that marriage isn't hard work, and that we should simply give up\u2014divorce should be and most often is the last case scenario\u2014but marriage shouldn't be a prison from which there is no escape.\u00a0\nPeople often ask: What about the children? Won't they be broken if they come from broken families? I do not disagree that divorces can have grave psychological impacts on children, but so can seeing their parents constantly fight and squabble with each other, or suffer from clinical depression, or worse, witnessing their mother violently beaten or berated by their father. Why do we never question the psychological impact on children stuck between two parents in an unhappy marriage? More often than not, it is society that insists on \"othering\" and bullying the children who come from divorced families. Instead of normalising unhappy marriages, we ought to normalise happy separations. Instead of making a child from a divorced family feel \"broken,\" we ought to make them understand that there are many computations of happy families. If we really care about children, then we should really shake off our prejudices and create a conducive environment for them to flourish.\nWe should, if not celebrate, at least appreciate the fact that, despite the taboo surrounding divorce, even in urban areas and among privileged classes, more and more women are now brave enough to decide what the best course of action for them and their children is, instead of suffering in silence to appease society. More importantly, more and more women now have the financial independence to carry out these difficult decisions\u2014they no longer have to remain subservient to the whims of their husbands or wishes of their parents because they have nowhere else to go.\nIf the parliamentary committee really wants to bring down the rate of divorces, their focus should be on sensitising men to be better and more sensitive partners and fathers. Instead of forcing young people to rush into marriage, we as a society should enable them to be emotionally and financially capable before they choose their partners. Marriage should be a choice, not a compulsion.\n\u00a0\nSushmita S Preetha\u00a0is a journalist and researcher.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is a disheartening fact that, while the government does provide allowances to certain vulnerable groups within the population, the amount is never enough to sustain them properly. A report by this daily has highlighted how dire the situation is for those who have no secondary sources of income or any support from close ones, and must rely solely on the government allowance for their survival. Shamsul Huda, an elderly man from Rajshahi, resides in a tiny and unstable tin shack, which used to be a tea stall (and his source of income). Being too old to work now, he must rely on his children for food and his medical bills. How much does the government allowance contribute to this? Only Tk 500 per month (paid at three-month intervals), which Huda would use up at once on the two inhalers that he needs.\nBut this is one story of one elderly man who is barely scraping by. And to think that the allowance has remained at Tk 500 since 2017, despite the prices of commodities increasing by so much over the last one year alone. Essentials such as cooking oil, rice, lentils, and some vegetables have been getting out of reach for many families. It is unrealistic to think that Tk 1,500 would be enough to help a person sustain themselves for three months, when even people with a monthly income are now struggling to make ends meet.\nIn the current fiscal year, the government allocated Tk 39,637 crore for cash transfer programmes, which include providing allowance to the elderly, widowed, distressed and destitute women, and financially insolvent people with disabilities, as well as for the pensions of retired government employees and their families.\n\u00a0\u00a0 While something is better than nothing, the government must commit to their safety net programmes by providing enough to each beneficiary to support their survival. We agree with experts that the amount of allocated allowance for vulnerable persons must be at least doubled in the budget for the upcoming 2022-23 fiscal year. Authorities must also bring more people under these cash transfer programmes\u2014namely widows, oppressed women and persons with disabilities. It should also be ensured that not only are beneficiaries from all upazilas covered under these programmes, but that the urban poor\u2014whose number has increased significantly since the pandemic began\u2014are also receiving substantive monetary assistance.\n",

        "full_article": "It is unfortunate that price manipulation of daily essentials by unscrupulous businessmen continue unabated despite there being a government order to curb this illegal practice. According to a report in this daily on May 24, the government issued an order titled \"Essential Commodities Distribution and Distributor Recruitment Order, 2011,\" under the Control of Essential Commodities Act, 1956, to curb price manipulation. But it has remained unimplemented for more than 11 years. That is because none of the stakeholders played their part\u2014while importers and producers did not care to comply with the order, the authorities responsible for enforcing the order or monitor the market also did not do their job.\nSince the government order was never enforced, dishonest businessmen often manipulated the supply of essential items by creating artificial shortages in the market to raise their prices. We have seen this recently in the case of edible oils, wheat, and other essentials. Had the government order issued in 2011 been properly enforced, we could have averted the edible oil crisis\u2014or the authorities could have easily addressed it. Under the law, the government would have a list of distributors and the supply data of importers. With these crucial data in hand, the government could have identified and punished those responsible for creating the crisis without much difficulty.\nThe order states that importers or producers of essentials will designate one or more distributors in every upazila, city corporation and district and send their lists to a national committee. Importers or producers are also supposed to send information on the monthly supply of products to the committee. But this is not happening. And while the committee is supposed to sit every month to assess the stock, supply, sale and prices of essentials and take measures to ensure the availability of the goods in the market, so far, they have rarely met to assess the market situation and have not taken any measures to enforce the order.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Like most of our laws or government orders, this order was also formulated\u2014when the market situation was volatile\u2014with no visible intention from the government's side to implement it. And it is the ordinary people who have had to\u2014and still are having to\u2014pay the price for that. But that should not be the case. We urge the government to enforce the order without further delay and identify and punish those responsible for manipulating the market.\n",
