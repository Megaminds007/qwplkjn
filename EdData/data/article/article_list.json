The wrangling between the Union government and the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has been an endless saga for years, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly sought to lay down the terms of their relationship in the way the territory is governed. In the latest verdict, a Constitution Bench has ruled that the elected government does indeed have control over administrative services. However, it is limited to services related to the extent of its current executive and legislative powers, which extend to all subjects under the State and Concurrent Lists, except for the three excluded ones \u2014 public order, police and land. The Centre\u2019s argument, that in the absence of a Public Services Commission for Delhi and in view of the phrase \u201cinsofar as such matter is applicable to Union Territories\u201d the subject of \u2018services\u2019 will not fall under the Delhi government\u2019s remit, was rejected. The Court\u2019s unanimous verdict rejects the attempt to read the phrase as one that imposes an additional limitation on its legislative and executive powers. The Court has emphasised the sui generis nature of Delhi, so that its Union Territory status is not used to limit the role of the elected government. The five-judge Bench ruling again underlines the principle that a representative regime should not be undermined by an unelected administrator.\rDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been embroiled in a prolonged tussle with the Lieutenant Governor over several issues, will be elated with the Court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe involvement of the Union of India in the administration of NCTD is limited by constitutional provisions, and any further expansion would be contrary to the constitutional scheme of governance\u201d. However, even yet another Constitution Bench verdict underscoring the representative character of the GNCTD may not be enough to end the underlying power struggle in Delhi, as long as the Centre continues with its efforts to clip the powers of the government because of its antagonism towards the Aam Aadmi Party. It is five years since the Court observed that constitutional trust between high functionaries is needed to resolve matters, but there is no sign of the conflict abating. In practical terms, the provisions of the GNCTD (Amendment) Act, 2021, which sought to strengthen the hand of the Lt. Governor in running Delhi, may continue to be a source of conflict. The validity of its provisions is also under challenge before the Supreme Court, an indication that the legal tussle is hardly over.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)",

        "full_article": "In a welcome move, the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have at last joined hands to undertake quality human clinical trials to generate evidence on the benefits of using ayurveda along with modern medicine (evidence-based medicine) in treating certain disease conditions of national importance. With its decades of experience in conducting human clinical trials, it makes eminent sense to rope in the ICMR to design and conduct these trials. To begin with, the collaboration will be restricted to ayurveda. The other systems of AYUSH \u2014 yoga, unani, siddha and homoeopathy \u2014 may be included, and each system will be tested together with modern medicine when the central councils of the respective AYUSH systems are ready to work with the ICMR. An expert committee will soon decide the area/disease conditions to be included for detailed clinical testing using both ayurveda and modern medicine. Initially, clinical trials for each disease may have two arms \u2014 modern medicine as the standard of care as well as a combination of modern medicine and ayurveda. The arm that uses both ayurveda and modern medicine will, if at all, only be able to validate the superiority of combining the two for better outcomes. Scientific validation of superior outcomes of combined therapy using ayurveda and modern medicine will form the basis on which integrated medicine will be offered to patients. Encouraging trial outcomes might probably serve as a starting point to undertake further trials using ayurveda interventions alone to evaluate their effectiveness and understand the mechanism of action; this is currently not within the ambit of the agreement.While the initiative may right away not provide scientific validation of ayurveda interventions in treating disease conditions when used singularly, it is the first major step in evidence-based approach of validating medical interventions. Though trials using ayurveda and other systems of AYUSH have been conducted in the country, they suffer from major limitations, thus making the outcomes meaningless. The ICMR\u2019s expertise is sure to help in overcoming the major obstacle in scientific validation, which all systems of AYUSH currently suffer from. Evidence, as the practitioners of AYUSH refer to, is nothing but anecdotal, which is not an alternative to evidence-based approach. Lack of scientific validation, as a stand-alone intervention or as adjunct to modern medicine, has been the bane of alternative medicine in India. No sincere, large-scale attempts have been made to address this serious shortcoming. The collaboration with the ICMR is, therefore, a step in the right direction.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nayurveda\n\n/\n\nunani\n\n/\n\nsiddha\n\n/\n\nhomoeopathy\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\nmedicine\n\n/\n\nmedical research\n\n/\n\n disease\n\n/\n\nmedical conditions\n\n/\n\nalternative medicine",

One of the apex court\u2019s conclusions was that the assembly\u2019s speaker, BJP\u2019s Rahul Narwekar, erred in recognising the chief whip appointed by the Shinde faction of Shiv Sena in July 2022. Consequently, he has now been asked to identify the correct whip and legislativeparty leader of Shiv Sena. This step is critical to the stability of the ShindeBJP government as the identity of the whip has a bearing on the pending disqualification proceedings of 16 Shinde faction MLAs.\nThe backstory is the first lot of MLAs who rebelled against Sena president Uddhav Thackeray were sent disqualification notices by the party whip. The twists and turns that followed suspended movement on disqualification even as Narwekar was elected speaker. He then recognised the Shinde faction\u2019s whip. This, SC has struck down. Therefore, he\u2019s got to choose a new Sena whip in keeping with provisions of the party constitution as SC has said the political party has primacy over its legislative wing.\n\nFollowing the split in the Sena, the Shinde faction approached the EC to claim the party symbol. It was successful. However, EC\u2019s decision won\u2019t be relevant as SC observed that its decision has prospective effect and is decided according to provisions of the Symbols Order. Disqualification notices here are governed by the Constitution\u2019s tenth schedule and relate to the date of actions triggering a chain of events. While Narwekar has authority to make these calls, his decisions are subject to judicial review.

        "full_article": "Mother's Day comes with mixed baggage. On the one hand, mothers \u2013 who most likely have sacrificed years and years of their lives, career, and passion for raising their children in a sexist and thankless society where fathers were probably not emotionally or logistically available \u2013 get one special day when they can expect to hear words of appreciation from children and the community. On the other hand, a heavily corporatised Mother's Day romanticises the concept of motherhood in a society where motherhood is not always a choice for women. The worth of womanhood is often determined by whether a woman falls within a restrictive, narrow definition of motherhood and can give birth to a certain kind of biological offspring \u2013 most often an able-bodied, male baby. We do not appreciate mothers who are single, who are not in a heteronormative relationship and marriage, who are stepmothers, who are adoptive mothers, who have used egg/sperm/embryo donations, who have used surrogates to give birth to their babies, or who have rented their wombs in exchange of some much-needed financial resources.\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that society will forget about the journey to motherhood that does not experience a happy ending. I am talking about pregnancy loss, also known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, in English. We don't even have a Bangla word for this unique experience. \"Gorbhopaat\" is an umbrella term that is used for both miscarriages and abortions. The word \"gorbhopaat\" has a negative connotation, as if something, which was not supposed to fall, has fallen down (\"paat\" or \"poton\"). Similarly, the prefix \"mis\" in \"miscarriage\" indicates something that has happened inefficiently or wrongly.\nAt least one in four pregnancies ends in a miscarriage. To put things into perspective, 34,15,316 babies were born in Bangladesh in 2022, which means more than eleven lakh women experienced pregnancy loss last year! That is a huge number.\nHow many birth announcements or happy pregnancy photoshoots did you see on social media last year? Do you remember seeing any social media posts grieving the loss of a pregnancy? Where are the stories of the eleven lakh women?\nIt's not like we never grieve our personal losses with our community members. When we lose our parents, family members, friends, or coworkers, we share the news and usually get support from family and friends. We host social and/or religious events commemorating our time with our loved ones. The time we spend on grieving and the support we receive from the community help us process the loss and heal.\nHowever, when women willingly decide to carry on a pregnancy and then lose it, they can rarely share the news and receive similar support. Pregnancy loss often comes with a sense of guilt that might be imposed by self or others. A sexist society would not stop for a second to blame women who have just suffered a tremendous loss. Remarks like, \"you should not have eaten this,\" \"you should not have traveled or gone to work,\" or \"you should have started trying for a baby earlier\", are some of the commonly heard remarks that are thrown at women who have just experienced a traumatic loss. Therefore, many women opt out of sharing their experiences outside their trusted circles. As a result, they don't receive the support they perhaps would have received if they had lost a family member.\nThe judgmental remarks women get after pregnancy loss may leave long-term dents. Women may experience a feeling of shame and lack of self-esteem, as if their bodies failed to do something that they were supposed to do. However, scientifically speaking, most early pregnancy losses happen due to chromosomal anomalies entirely out of the control of human beings. By default, the first mitotic division of human embryos is highly prone to errors.\n\nWe need to normalise talking about pregnancy losses. In popular media, we would often see someone have sex just once, and then they get pregnant, and the next thing you know is that they had a perfectly healthy, happy baby.\nPregnancy loss may create a sense of fear and confusion as women cannot figure out what exactly is wrong with their bodies or whether their bodies will ever be able to carry a healthy baby to the full term. Many women confine themselves within their homes or close circles to avoid facing insensitive remarks or getting triggered. As a result, they may suffer in isolation and experience a lack of meaningful human interactions needed to survive critical times.\nFamily and community members do not always play the most supportive roles. It is very common for married women to hear from elders and other family members, \"when are you going to have a baby?\" \u2013 as if having a baby should be the inevitable next step to getting married and as if the couples are obliged to provide some public explanation about their reproductive choices. Sometimes women remain under direct or indirect pressure from family members to have a baby. A pregnancy loss, therefore, just worsens their situation.\nAbout 20 percent of women experiencing a pregnancy loss suffer from symptomatic depression and/or anxiety. The symptoms may linger for up to three years, impacting their everyday lives, conjugal and communal relationships, future pregnancies, and how they would raise kids in the future. This means more than two lakh women in Bangladesh suffered from chronic depression and/or anxiety due to pregnancy loss in 2022. Very few of them have access to much-needed therapy, medications, and appropriate mental health support.\nThe forgotten character in the scenario of a pregnancy loss is the male partner. Due to our problematic gender socialisation, men often don't learn how to express and process emotions. They don't cry, they don't grieve, and many of them may feel like they must stay stronger for their partners. This takes a heavy toll on their health and well-being. Studies have shown that men also suffer from anxiety, depression, despair, and difficulty in coping following a pregnancy loss.\nWhat can we do to better support people who experience pregnancy loss?\nWe can try to be more sensitive about how we respond. There is no need to blame someone or remind them about what they might have done wrong, especially when they might already be blaming themselves for the pregnancy loss. Saying things like, \"everything happens for a reason\" or, \"it must have happened for the best\" does not really help with guilt. There is no need to remind that miscarriages are very common because that does not help with heartbreak. There is no need to say that their babies are in a better place because no mother would want their babies to die and go to a \"better place.\"\n\nThe forgotten character in the scenario of a pregnancy loss is the male partner. Due to our problematic gender socialisation, men often don't learn how to express and process emotions. They don't cry, they don't grieve, and many of them may feel like they must stay stronger for their partners. This takes a heavy toll on their health and well-being. Studies have shown that men also suffer from anxiety, depression, despair, and difficulty in coping following a pregnancy loss.\nThere is no need to tell women that it was a good thing that the loss happened early in the pregnancy. It might have been just an embryo or a fetus \u2013 a very early stage of human development \u2013 and not a full-grown human baby who is able to survive on their own. Nevertheless, when someone decides to continue a pregnancy, that means they have already invested their time, emotion, and body in a long, demanding project. They have committed to suffering and experiencing extreme pain \u2013 willingly and with love. They have started to dream of a happy future. So, there is no need to disrespect this dream and tell them it was just a fetus with some chromosomal abnormality or disability.\nInstead, we can try to provide a non-judgmental space to people who suffer pregnancy loss. We can check in with them, listen to their feelings, and ask what we can do for them. We can offer words of affirmation and affinity. We can specifically check in with the forgotten male partners and give them space to process their feelings.\nWe can also start to tell our stories. We need to normalise talking about pregnancy losses. In popular media, we would often see someone have sex just once, and then they get pregnant, and the next thing you know is that they had a perfectly healthy, happy baby. Real life can be very different from the media representation. We need diverse representation of difficult pregnancies, pregnancy losses, and fertility struggles for both women and men.\nBangladesh has a fantastic paid maternity leave provision, which is much more progressive than many powerful countries such as the United States. However, currently, we have no legislation addressing people who experience pregnancy loss. Countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Philippines, Mauritius, and India offer varying degrees of paid leave to women and/or their partners if they experience a pregnancy loss. Bangladesh needs to do better.\nMost importantly, we need to stop romanticising motherhood. Motherhood is a choice. It is a beautiful and rewarding experience but can also cause pain, stress, and suffering. Motherhood is not the ultimate destiny of women. Therefore, a pregnancy loss or not being able to be a mother \u2013 albeit an extremely painful experience \u2013 should not define the worth of a woman.\nNafisa Tanjeem is an Associate Professor in the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies of Worcester State University, United States.\n\n",

The \"very severe\" cyclonic storm is approaching Bangladesh with a maximum windspeed of 200 kmph. There are concerns that this may result in widespread devastation in Bangladesh's south-west, among other coastal areas, so we must prepare accordingly.\nThe current trajectory indicates that Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Feni and Noakhali are among the most vulnerable districts. Meteorologists say the cyclone may make landfall in Teknaf, which is home to refugee camps for the Rohingya who could be heavily exposed to the elements. Officials have also predicted floods in vast areas along the coastline. The priority right now is to fast-track the evacuation process and ensure that no one is left behind, especially older people, children and persons with disabilities. There is also a risk of landslides in the hilly areas, so people there should too be taken to safety.\nIt is concerning that nearly 50kms of embankment in Chattogram are reportedly compromised. This means that local communities risk being inundated should storm surges triggered by the cyclone breach those. The question is, why were the embankments not fortified? Why do the authorities wait for a cyclone to hit before rushing to make repairs? As for off-shore islands, it is a relief that tourists have been evacuated from St Martin's Island, but what about the 10,000 or so local residents? Shelters have been readied, we are told, but if the island gets cut off from mainland, will locals have access to sufficient food and other vital essentials?\nThese concerns must be addressed. So far, the government seems convinced that all necessary preparations have been taken. We must brace for the worst, however. Usually, despite warnings, many people do not leave until the last moment and often refuse to leave behind their prized possessions, especially livestock. This is where local authorities must be firm while conducting evacuations. Casualties, both during and in the aftermath of the cyclone, must be avoided at all costs.\n",

        "full_article": "In the book \"Uncertain Tomorrows: Livelihoods, Capital and Risk in Labour Migration from Bangladesh\" (UPL, 2016), Syeda Rozana Rashid attempts to explore the causal links between lack of security in people's lives and livelihoods and overseas labour migration from Bangladesh. When Rozana Rashid was working on understanding the causes of migration of people from two migration-intensive villages in Cumilla, Bangladesh was being promoted as a country riding the tide of development.\nThe ethnographic study found that people are well aware of the risks involved in migration. But they also see opportunities to benefit from it \u2013 there are many more risks to rural life and livelihoods in Bangladesh that make migration seem less risky. Although agricultural land provides a form of security in rural life, agricultural work is no less risky than migration. In addition to the uncertainty of weather and natural disasters, there are various political risks, economic risks and uncertainties like not getting the right price for crops. While investigating the reasons for the migration of the working people, she noted at that time that Bangladesh as a state had not yet developed a political system that could guarantee economic stability and social security.\nAlmost a decade and a half has passed since. During this period, the GDP and per capita income increased significantly. But has the political and economic system been developed in a way that the working youth of this country can dream of a bright future? The growing incidents of desperate migration of Bangladeshi youth taking deadly risks while crossing the sea by boats, in the midst of the rhetoric of expensive infrastructure-based development, says otherwise.\nAccording to the report titled \"Migration from Bangladesh to Italy via Libya\" by the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of Bangladeshi migrants going to Italy by boat using the dangerous route of the Mediterranean Sea through Libya is increasing day by day. In 2022, 15,228 migrants from Bangladesh arrived in Italy via the Central Mediterranean Route (CMR) with a majority transiting through Libya. Migrants from Bangladesh constituted slightly more than 14 percent of all arrivals in Italy \u2013 the third most-represented nationality. This number was 602 in 2019 (5 percent), 4,141 in 2020 (12 percent) and 7,838 in 2021 (12 percent).\nAfter the Mediterranean route, Bangladeshis use the Balkan route the most. More than 6,000 Bangladeshis have gone to Europe through this route in the last few years. There have also been incidents of Bangladeshis being stuck in the forests of Bosnia while entering through this way.\nThe question is, why are increasing number of Bangladeshi youths desperate to migrate by risking their lives across the seas, jungles and deserts. If these young people would get good employment opportunities within the country, if they would get living wages, if their workplaces were safe, would they risk their lives to cross the seas, jungle and desert so desperately? To answer this question, we can look to the direct experience of some aspirant migrants reported in the media.\n\nIf there is no decent job opportunity within the country, young people will always strive to get it even if they need to risk their lives.\nJumon Ahmed of Shariatpur first went to Turkey by air via Dubai, then to Libya and then reached Italy via the dangerous Mediterranean Sea, according to a report by Bonik Barta. Before embarking on this risky journey, Jumon worked for three years in a Chinese restaurant in Mirpur, Dhaka. During this time no appointment letter was given to him. He had no fixed salary, rather was paid according to the whims of the owner. He told Bonik Barta that he could not change his job even if he wanted to just because he is not highly educated. That is why he decided to take this risk.\nArafat Rahman, an aspiring Bangladeshi migrant told InfoMigrants that he went to Serbia hoping to reach Italy after failing to get a job as a computer operator at a court in Bangladesh. He was asked to pay a bribe of 16,000 Euros to get the job that would pay him around 160 Euros per month as a salary. He decided not to take the job as the bribe was too high. He hoped to earn much more in Italy and pay back the loan that he took to go there.\nWhy did young Khokon Ahmed of Sylhet's Biswanath Upazila, who died on his way from Libya to Italy by boat in 2019, take this risk? According to a statement given by Khokon's brother Liton to Deutsche Welle, Khokon's father was a shopkeeper. All five of the brothers were unemployed. Among them, Khokon was a degree class student. Khokon's father agreed to send his son to Italy with the money collected by mortgaging the shop and borrowing Tk 8 lakh in anticipation of good employment opportunities in Italy.\nThere are more such stories. All human beings have the desire to live a decent life. No one wants to be stuck in a low-wage drudgery job forever. If there is no decent job opportunity within the country, young people will always strive to get it even if they need to risk their lives. According to a survey by the IOM on more than 11,000 potential migrants in 64 districts of Bangladesh, the majority of the respondents reported that they chose to migrate to find better job and livelihood opportunities (73 percent). Other common reasons were financial (13 percent) and to enhance their social status (11 percent). Not only that, 91 percent of potential migrants would consider staying in Bangladesh if there were more work opportunities, but 46 percent of them had conditions on that answer. Most of the conditions were related to better quality of work, including better salaries (63 percent) and better opportunities for work (33 percent). It is to be noted that, potential migrants planning to travel to Europe and the Americas or Asia and the Pacific were more likely to have completed a secondary school education or higher \u2013 67 percent of potential migrants to Europe and the Americas and 51 percent of potential migrants to Asia and the Pacific.\nIt seems many of the moderately educated young people who have passed secondary school do not find any such employment in the country by which they can hope to live a decent life. As a result, many of them tried to reach Europe by crossing the sea, desert or the jungle despite knowing the risk. Even the workers who went to the Middle Eastern countries as migrants, after not being able to earn as expected despite their hard work, became desperate to go to Europe in the hope of a better income.\nAs long as quality employment, living wages and a safe working environment cannot be ensured for the youth within the country, the dangerous and desperate journey to Europe will not stop.\nKallol Mustafa is an engineer and writer who focuses on power, energy, environment and development economics.\n",

The \"very severe\" cyclonic storm is approaching Bangladesh with a maximum windspeed of 200 kmph. There are concerns that this may result in widespread devastation in Bangladesh's south-west, among other coastal areas, so we must prepare accordingly.\nThe current trajectory indicates that Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Feni and Noakhali are among the most vulnerable districts. Meteorologists say the cyclone may make landfall in Teknaf, which is home to refugee camps for the Rohingya who could be heavily exposed to the elements. Officials have also predicted floods in vast areas along the coastline. The priority right now is to fast-track the evacuation process and ensure that no one is left behind, especially older people, children and persons with disabilities. There is also a risk of landslides in the hilly areas, so people there should too be taken to safety.\nIt is concerning that nearly 50kms of embankment in Chattogram are reportedly compromised. This means that local communities risk being inundated should storm surges triggered by the cyclone breach those. The question is, why were the embankments not fortified? Why do the authorities wait for a cyclone to hit before rushing to make repairs? As for off-shore islands, it is a relief that tourists have been evacuated from St Martin's Island, but what about the 10,000 or so local residents? Shelters have been readied, we are told, but if the island gets cut off from mainland, will locals have access to sufficient food and other vital essentials?\nThese concerns must be addressed. So far, the government seems convinced that all necessary preparations have been taken. We must brace for the worst, however. Usually, despite warnings, many people do not leave until the last moment and often refuse to leave behind their prized possessions, especially livestock. This is where local authorities must be firm while conducting evacuations. Casualties, both during and in the aftermath of the cyclone, must be avoided at all costs.\n",

It is as if anyone can wake up one day, decide to dirty their hands, and there will be no stopping them. The man in question, Khandakar Mohammad Iqbal (42), worked for 14 years at the Shahjalal Fertiliser Factory in Sylhet. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, he was assistant chief accountant when he was fired for embezzlement in 2018. Later, an investigation by the CID revealed that he had embezzled Tk 38 crore during the five years when he occupied that position.\u00a0\nIqbal allegedly took this money out using fake bills and receipts through companies registered under his wife's name. Their illegally accumulated wealth includes an eye-popping 91 vehicles (microbuses, private cars, vans), several flats and land plots, two department stores, etc. Currently, the couple are in jail pending trial in a number of corruption cases filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission and the CID. The question is, how could one man embezzle so much money from a government institution? If the allegations against Iqbal are true, he had certainly had help from his colleagues and superiors. Surprisingly, no one from BCIC or the fertiliser factory has been implicated yet.\u00a0\nThe story of Mohammad Iqbal shows just how vulnerable the whole public system \u2013 with all the government, semi-government, autonomous, and semi-autonomous offices that are run with public money \u2013 is to corruption, which is often committed using systemic loopholes and political influences. Over the years, we have frequently published reports on corruption in various sectors. Unfortunately, despite the administration's so-called \"zero tolerance\" policy on corruption, it has been harder to tackle in the absence of an effective institutional accountability mechanism. Bangladesh, as a result, is increasingly becoming synonymous with corruption and financial scandals. We urge the higher authorities to undertake drastic reforms in how public offices are run in order to reverse this trend. The future of Bangladesh depends on it.\n",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh automobile market is in a state of transition. When the first hybrids came on to the market, first through reconditioned vehicles which was followed by brand new variants, there was palpable hesitation on the part of consumers about what this new technology would entail. This was understandable because the first shipments that came in had a lot of problems in underperforming battery life and replacement costs for battery cells or entire battery packs were exorbitant. That has changed with government slashing taxation on this category of vehicles and consumers smartening up on how to shop.Similarly, a quiet revolution has begun in the passenger category of Electric Vehicles (EVs). This has been made possible because the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the body responsible for registering vehicles in the country has formulated rules which allow for EVs to be registered in the same manner as conventional vehicles running on combustible engines. The rest of the world started this journey a few years ago, but Bangladesh has finally started the process of making it possible for consumers to buy and register vehicles and that is only the first step. Presently, EVs of premium brands and pricing are seen on Dhaka roads. According to BRTA data, 34 such vehicles have been registered in two years. One may ask why a mere 34 vehicles over 48 months is news. It is news because the government intends to convert 30 per cent of all vehicles to EVs by 2030. Now that is news because this would entail tens of thousands of cars to be switched to battery-driven EVs. While the infrastructure to recharge EVs is still missing in country, that is expected to change as one or more EV plants come into production domestically in the foreseeable future. Reportedly, several companies have or are in the process of setting up plants, primarily in the new special economic zones. Foreign and domestic investments to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars have been earmarked for EV assembling in Bangladesh and what was lacking were BRTA rules and guidelines. The government is understood to have taken the first steps at 'greening' the public transport sector by importing 100 EV buses that are to be operated in the city on a trial basis to see how things pan out.Although it is highly commendable that authorities have come round to this way of thinking, it is also hoped that rules and guidelines be set up for the 2.5 million unauthorized EVs that are plying the country's roads, on highways, in rural Bangladesh. Commonly called 'easy', these are long-base 3-wheeler passenger vehicles are EVs. These are both imported, and increasingly locally assembled and perform a wide variety of essential tasks from moving people from Point A to Point B, and in some cases are used to transport goods in rural Bangladesh. Attempts to ban them have failed primarily due to public pressure because they do serve the purpose of transportation. In the absence of viable options, people will ignore the law to get the job done. That is ground reality.The BRTA should formulate rules on these EVs too because by all counts, they are here to stay. Forming rules and turning these rules into a law would help regulate the quality of manufacture of EVs, which now involves thousands of people who work as technicians and are involved in the assembling of such vehicles. Currently, there is no quality control and since these EVs ply country roads and sometimes venture on to highways, it is time to look at this sector with renewed interest at policylevel.",

        "full_article": "Annual inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Bangladesh again crossed US$3.0-billion mark, after three years, in the last calendar year. The amount stood at $3.48 billion, recording a 20 per cent growth over 2021 when the net inflow of FDI was $2.89 billion. The figure for 2022 also matches the figure for the last fiscal year (FY22) when the net FDI inflow was recorded $3.44 billion. In respect of Bangladesh's graduation requirement, however, the country stays underserved in foreign investment. For international comparison, FDI data based on calendar year is generally used. However, for the internal understanding, the FDI figures are prepared for a fiscal year, as it is done in the case of other macroeconomic indicators. The country's fiscal year spans the July-June period. As the central bank publishes detailed statistics of the country's foreign investment on half-yearly basis, it is not difficult to find out and compare FDI situation in two different time periods.  The boost in FDI in the last year, however, needs to be reviewed with some caution. The half-yearly inflow indicates a bit different picture. In the second half (H2) of the last year, also the first half (H1) of the current fiscal year, net inflow of FDI increased by only 2.30 per cent from the same period of the past year. The growth rates of FDI in the same period of previous years are much higher. For example, net FDI jumped by 16 per cent in H1 of 2020 and increased further by 28 per cent in H1 of 2021.Again, statistics available with Bangladesh Bank showed that there is a general trend to make a big jump in FDI in the last quarter (Q4) of the calendar year which is also the second quarter (Q2) of the fiscal year. It did not happen in the past year. Net FDI dropped 36 per cent in Q4 of 2022 to $0.70 billion from $1.10 billion in Q3 of the same year. Another trend is that FDI through equity capital mostly saw a surge in the above mentioned quarter. As total inflow declined significantly in the period under review, it also fell sharply to $0.25 billion from $0.54 billion in the Q4 of 2021. Equity capital is defined as 'remittances received by the incorporated or unincorporated direct investment enterprises operating in Bangladesh on account of equity participation in those by the non-resident direct investors.' In other words, it is a fresh investment by an existing multinational enterprise (MNE).The annual inflow of FDI in terms of equity capital dropped to $1.02 billion last year from $1.14 billion in 2021. At the same time, FDI from reinvested earnings of the MNEs increased to $2.51 billion last year, recording a robust growth of 60 per cent over $1.56 billion in 2021. It implies that, instead of injecting fresh capital, the MNEs in Bangladesh prefer to reinvest a portion of earnings which also include profits.Now, FDI usually also drops in the first quarter of the calendar year. As the updated data on the Q1 of 2023, which is also the Q3 of FY23, are not available so far, it is not known what actually happened in the period. Provisional estimate, as incorporated into the balance-of- payments (BoP) table, indicated that there was a decline in the net inflow of FDI in the quarter. It showed that net inflow of FDI dropped by around 18 per cent in the first nine months (July-March) of the current fiscal year although gross inflow increased 7.0 per cent at the same time.FDI statistics quoted in the Balance of Payments (BoP) table is preliminary estimate and subject to revision. Moreover, the data of net inflow are under-reported as it has to match the IMF-guided calculation. Usually, the figure of disinvestment is deducted from the gross inflow of FDI to determine the net inflow. Gross FDI in 2022 was $4.82 billion whereas the amount of disinvestment was recorded at $1.34 billion. So, the net FDI was $3.48 billion last year.It is to be noted that gross inflow of FDI is the total inward direct investment made by non-resident investors in the host economy. Disinvestment includes capital repatriation, reverse investments, loans given to parent firms and repayments of intra-company loans to parent firms.BoP table, however, does not show the disinvestment figure explicitly, which is available in the half-yearly report of FDI and external debt. FDI data are incorporated into the report on the basis of regular survey. So, it is difficult to know the actual amount of net FDI from BoP table. Nevertheless, it can be presumed that net inflow of FDI actually declined in the third quarter of the current fiscal year.Meanwhile, the annual data also showed that the highest amount of FDI came from the United Kingdom (UK) last year, followed by the United States (US) and South Korea respectively. Textiles and weaving attracted the highest amount of net FDI worth $706 million last year, followed by $599 million in power sector and $450 million in telecommunication sector.Overall FDI situation in the country shows a positive trend which is necessary in the time of widespread geopolitical tensions. However, the annual inflow of FDI is still below the desired level though there is no official target or projection to this effect. It was the Seventh Five-Year Plan (7FYP) document which set an annual average target at $6 billion worth of FDI. In reality, during FY16-FY20, the annual average FDI was recorded at $2.66 billion. The 8FYP, however, discarded such target-setting or projection of FDI. Nevertheless, it is clear that the country has yet to attract $6.0 billion annually even as gross FDI.As Bangladesh is set to graduate from the Least Developed Country (LDC) category by 2026, more FDI is needed to keep the economy vibrant and raise its share in the global trade.

        "full_article": "Mango is not the national fruit of Bangladesh. Jackfruit has received that status. But mango is, indisputably, the king of fruits in the country. Decades ago, the mention of mangos would bring to the people's mind the highly fibrous 'deshi' (indigenous) varieties produced all over the country. The two popular non-fibrous and immaculately sweet and aromatic mangoes were Fazli and Lengra. Produced in the greater Rajshahi region, they would start arriving in markets across the whole country in May-June, the second of the Bangla month of summer --- Joishtha. The Rajshahi, Chapai Nawabganj and Dinajpur mangoes would flood the market for two to three months besides the 'deshi' ones. In course of time, the 'deshi' mango varieties have petered out. With the approach of Joishtha, the country's fruit markets start wearing a colourful look with the racks of shops displaying arrays of ripe mangoes. This year would not be an exception. But when it comes to prices, the mango market may not appear the same as the last year. As part of the domino impact seeing sharp rises in the price of essentials, that of mangoes may also not remain unaffected, the mango lovers fear. It means the market bearing with the ongoing inflationary pressure in every sector may not be able to sell mangoes at an affordable price. The grim prospect of remaining deprived of tasting the juicy sweet fruit this year makes many feel morose. With the arrival of the early variety of ripe mangoes in the markets, traders and small businesses are found bracing for collecting mangoes from the orchard owners --- and sending them to different city markets including Dhaka.A strange rule that defines the mango retail market is the sellers' tendency to pass off the fruits of an inferior quality under the name of one known for its better quality and taste. According to mango experts, the fruit with different long-known names ought to be collected from known sellers. Nothing could be more disappointing than taking home the wrong variety of mangos believing them to be of better quality. Even many innocent buyers get cheated over the GI-tagged 'Khirsapat' mangos, popularly known as 'Himsagar'. The problem with this variety of mango is there are several types of the fruit that look similar to 'Khirsapat'. People not properly acquainted with the fruit remain vulnerable to being cheated over this sought-after mango. Apart from being tagged with GI (geographical indication) in 2017, facilitating its export prospects, the value of this mango has increased manifold among the general mango-lovers. The fruit markets of the capital remain filled with mangos of dozen types. They include Lengra, Gopalbhog, Mohonbhog, Laxmanbhog, Kohitoor, and, of course, Himsagar. In this wide array of ripe mangos, confusing one with another is a common phenomenon. Another menace that plagues the larger mango sector is the fruits' artificial ripening with chemicals. According to mango experts, treating mangoes with a certain amount of ripening agents is part of a normal procedure. Problems lie with the use of the chemical in excess. In fact, the chemical treatment of a whole mango orchard is a continuing process. It begins with the flowering stage of a mango tree, and continues up to the fruit's growth into the fully shaped green mangoes. The chemicals used in the mango orchards comprise mainly insecticides. In the face of opposition from the mango exporters, the extent of chemical use has been lowered. Thanks to these developments vis-\u00e0-vis chemical treatment of mangos and mango trees, a large section of the orchard owners began adopting the 'fruit-bagging' method. This process sees wrapping of mangoes with paper bags, thus protecting them from insects. Bangladesh has already emerged as a top mango-exporting country. It vies with mango-producing countries like India, Pakistan, and Thailand, China and Vietnam. What the country needs most is full-scale state backing.[email\u00a0protected]",

According to our law, it is an offence if a person throws or keeps rubbish on the street or any place other than that prescribed by the city corporation. However, littering has been going on unabated across the country, especially in our cities, as if nobody knows about the law. The streets of Dhaka city continue to suffer due to littering. In 2016, the two city corporations of Dhaka set up around 6,700 trash bins to curb littering in the capital. But most of those were either damaged or stolen within years. Unplanned installation, lack of maintenance and public awareness are some of the key reasons behind the failure of this initiative. Littering affects the environment and the people responsible for it are fined in many cities across the world. The existing law against littering is not implemented at all in most of the areas in Dhaka city. If we have a look at the cantonment area of the capital, we will find people there obeying the law. From this, we can say that it is all about enforcing the law. Moreover, we need to educate our people and make them aware about the negative effects of littering. Promoting cleanliness requires changing the mindset of every single citizen of Bangladesh. The culture of throwing waste here and there cannot change without strict laws and the rigorous enforcement of those laws. Shahjahan Sirazi,Malibagh, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
