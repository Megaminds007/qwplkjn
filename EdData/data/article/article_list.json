Yet again, vegetables and pulses were key contributors in keeping food inflation as measured by the Consumer Food Price Index little changed at 8.69%, with urban consumers feeling the heat more than their rural counterparts as the pace of year-on-year change in food prices in India\u2019s cities and towns hit a three-month high of 8.83%. Vegetable inflation not only continued to hover above 27% for a sixth straight month, at 27.3%, but month-on-month gains too accelerated by almost 200 basis points to a six-month high of 3.22%. Tomato, onion and potato prices led the charge, with these heavyweights in the vegetables sub-group logging sequential gains of 1.5%, 0.5% and a bruising 15.1% in the case of potato. Nor is the outlook for vegetable inflation particularly reassuring with June\u2019s retail price trends as well as the lag from escalating wholesale costs pointing to more pain ahead for consumers running their household budgets. Data from the Department of Consumer Affairs Price Monitoring Division show the all-India average retail price of tomato, onion and potato, as on June 14, were 21%, 14% and 8% higher, respectively, month-on-month, and a significantly steeper 35%, 58% and 44% costlier, respectively, when compared with their year-earlier prices. At the wholesale level, sequential inflation in tomato, onion and potato was disconcertingly faster at 28%, 18% and 9%, respectively, underlining the challenges policymakers face in containing prices through trade measures.Food inflation also manifested last month with a quickening in price gains in the category\u2019s largest constituent \u2014 cereals and products \u2014 to a five-month high of 8.69%. Retail cereal prices from the price monitoring division\u2019s daily dashboard show rice was 13% costlier than on June 14, 2023, wheat was 5.7% more expensive and inflation in wheat flour (atta) was 4.7%, signalling that here again the prospects of a let-up in price pressures are remote, at least for now. Pulses saw inflation quicken again, after a mild slowing in April to 17.1% with the pace of sequential price rise hitting a six-month high of 1.53%. Official price data for June 14 showed gram dal, tur, urad and moong costlier by 17%, 27%, 13% and 8.5% than a year earlier, respectively. Rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department as on June 14 that show a 12% deficit since June 1 is also a cause for mild concern, an \u2018above normal\u2019 monsoon forecast notwithstanding. With food inflation particularly hitting hardest the poorer sections, policymakers can ill afford to drop their guard. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nfruit and vegetable\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nrains\n\n/\n\nMonsoon\n\n/\n\nsocial issue",

        "full_article": "President Joe Biden\u2019s three-phase ceasefire plan for Gaza got a major boost on Monday with the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) resolution asking Israel and Hamas to accept the proposal. The U.S. says Israel has already agreed to the deal laid out in the resolution, adding that Hamas\u2019s tough position was the main hindrance to a ceasefire. This is the second time since the war began on October 7, 2023 that the UNSC is calling for a Gaza ceasefire. In March, the Council\u2019s call was ignored by Israel. If the U.S. had abstained from voting then, letting the resolution pass, this time, Washington is the force behind the proposal. According to the Biden plan, which the U.S. President says was laid out by Israel, there would be a six-week long ceasefire in the first phase. Israeli troops would pull back from densely populated areas, allow more aid trucks into Gaza, and release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 33 hostages held by Hamas. In the second phase, Hamas is to release the remaining hostages while Israel is expected to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. The third phase would see the enclave\u2019s reconstruction.While the Biden administration, which backs Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, is actively pushing for this plan, there are serious hindrances on both sides. The U.S. has repeatedly said that the proposal has the blessings of Israel, but the Benjamin Netanyahu government has not publicly endorsed the plan. Mr. Netanyahu was politically weakened last week when opposition politician Benny Gantz quit the unity government, leaving Prime Minister Netanyahu more dependent on his far-right allies. And the far-right parties in the ruling coalition have threatened to break the government if he accepted the ceasefire proposal. So the question is whether Mr. Netanyahu could place the country\u2019s interests above his political survival. On the other side, Hamas demands an immediate Israeli withdrawal from Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing with Egypt, total freedom in choosing the Palestinian prisoners to be released and guarantees from China, Russia and T\u00fcrkiye for a final agreement with Israel. As both sides harden their stances, truce remains elusive. Since the war began, at least 37,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel and 2.3 million people displaced. Israel has repeatedly ignored pleas to protect civilian lives, while Hamas has shown little interest in making concessions to clinch a ceasefire deal. Israel wants the hostages to be freed. Hamas wants the war to be over and Israeli troops to be out of Gaza. They should realise that the only way to meet these objectives is to strike a negotiated deal, rather than prolonging the war that has destroyed much of Gaza and turned Israel into an internationally isolated rogue state.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nEgypt\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nTurkey",

        "full_article": "One of the immediate challenges before the new govt is the ongoing NEET fiasco. Inflated marks, allocation of grace marks, an unusually high number of perfect scores, allegations of paper leak, and calls for a retest have created stress for students, parents, and even the govt. This is not an isolated incident and, regrettably, will not be the last. Conducting such a massive exam for over 2.3 million students in 13 languages across 4,500 centres in India and 14 countries abroad is a Herculean task. Similar challenges plague the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) for undergraduate admissions, and the JEE Mains exam, both of which are taken by over a million students. These exams have now become behemoths that need better handling.\nCurrently, gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in India is around 26%. The goal is to increase this to over 50% in the next decade, which implies that the number of candidates appearing for entrance exams will double. This raises two critical questions. First, is it necessary to have such single exams, which are nearly impossible to administer, on such a large scale? Second, if these exams are indeed necessary, can we adopt better practices from countries like the US and China, which have successfully navigated similar challenges by evolving systems that suit their needs?\n\nSat example: US model of multiple test dates can ease pressure on students\nGiven that admissions to govt institutions in India rely heavily on a single test score, these exams bear an immense burden to accurately assess a student\u2019s overall scholastic ability and aptitude. One significant downside of standardising school education through uniform national boards and common entrance exams is the homogenisation of higher education intake, which can stifle creativity and diversity of thought. Additionally, this standardisation inadvertently fuels the coaching industry.\nTherefore, the design of these exams must prioritise flexibility, transparency, diversity, scalability, accessibility of materials, and availability of language options. Here are three possible steps that can create a more equitable and effective exam system\u2026\n1. Learn from the world: US, home to many top-ranking institutions, follows a diversified admissions model. SAT and ACT are the primary standardised tests for college admissions, taken by around 2 million students each year. In contrast, China\u2019s \u2018gaokao\u2019 is one of the largest exams globally in terms of participation, with a record 13.4 million students taking it in 2024. It is a high-stakes, highly standardised exam lasting approximately nine hours over two to three days, depending on the provincial administrative regions. It\u2019s also a very secure process with teachers being secluded and armed guards escorting the vehicles transporting exam papers.\nThe US model is potentially more suitable for India as it offers flexibility with multiple test dates throughout the year. It reduces stress by spreading the risk over an extended period rather than concentrating it in a single event.\nIn India, private players now offer the IT and physical infrastructure to conduct secure online computer-based tests for over 200,000 candidates at a time. Establishing a large question bank with questions of varying difficulty levels, randomly picked by an algorithm for each candidate, along with real-time adaptation and immediate provision of raw scores after the test, could effectively address the challenges of scaling up exams. This approach could combine the flexibility and efficiency of the US model with the rigorous standards necessary for high-stakes exams in India.\n2. Constitutional status for NTA: To address transparency issues, it\u2019s crucial to grant the National Testing Agency (NTA) constitutional status similar to the UPSC. Adopting the UPSC structure, with leading academics managing the exam process, and involving top institutions in the conduct of exams, can enhance credibility. The primary reason for the smooth conduct of JEE Advanced and GATE exams year after year is because of the significant involvement of IIT faculty at every stage of the exam. Whether it\u2019s NEET, JEE Mains or CUET, it\u2019s important to involve a set of our top institutions in the conduct of these exams jointly with NTA.\n3. Holistic admission policies: While inclusive and holistic admission policies work well in some private institutions in India and many leading institutions abroad, there are challenges in implementing such metrics for admission in govt-run institutions. There is a fear of external influences derailing the process. Diversity in admissions can, however, be managed by giving seats to state and central board toppers, Olympiad winners, etc.\nMajor reforms in the admission process are essential to build a resilient, inclusive, and effective pathway for our aspiring students, ensuring that our higher education system nurtures talent and produces the best professionals for the future. Exams like GATE and JEE Advanced conducted by IITs are globally unique for their quality and diversity of question papers. By leveraging IT companies and startups, and following global best practices, India can internationalise these exams, allowing other countries to use them for admissions and certification purposes. This approach could elevate India to its much-desired vishwaguru status.\nProf Rao is vice-chancellor of BITS Pilani group of institutions and former director, IIT Delhi\n\n",

But the Kuwait fire that took 45 Indian lives is a reminder that such networks can also have a dark side.\nTrust and betrayal |\u00a0News that the building in which the deaths took place was a fire hazard waiting to explode \u2013 from cardboard and plastic being used to partition workers into cramped rooms to doors to the rooftop being locked \u2013 was painful enough. A subsequent revelation that an Indian managed the building and also employed most of those who died, somehow felt \u2018worse\u2019. It\u2019s obvious why. Because this now becomes a case where not only was workplace safety not provided in a foreign country, an Indian employer also thought Indians didn\u2019t deserve better. Separately, there is the vexed issue of illegal migration, where trusted stories and agents play an even more fraught role. Indians btw have become the third largest unauthorised immigrant population in US.\nHome and abroad |\u00a0Networks on which Keralites, Gujaratis, Punjabis and others have relied to make legal homes across the world, are an invaluable social and economic resource for India. The Kuwait fire reminds us that even these are not without tales of desertion, betrayal, fraud. Or milder letdowns. Say, students who are happy to have Indian student associations helping them with the commute, housing etc upon landing on foreign campuses, then find these to be oppressively parochial. A public policy that tries to even out all the dingy kinks of human nature will be pointless. Still, GOI should increase its efforts to ensure safe working conditions for migrant Indian workers, whose numbers are bound to keep going up. Experts suggest a national-level migration database will be useful in this direction.\n\n",

The most powerful politician in EU right now, she has been reduced to a blonde stereotype, wink-wink nudge-nudge. Like other women in high offices, Meloni is being seen through a male prism \u2013 hot or not? A few years ago, at talks between Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon, the tabloids compared the bodies of the two politicians, asking: \u2018Never mind Brexit, who won legs-it?\u2019 No matter how influential she is, no matter what she knows or becomes, a woman can always be subjected to such demeaning framing. Her power is almost a red rag, an invitation to take her down.\nOur images of public authority are inevitably male and larger than life. In our power structures, man is the norm and women are seen as aberrations who \u2018broke barriers\u2019 to get there. Because men see women as either sexual objects or nurturers, women who aspire to high office have to actively live down these ideas, or exploit them, by playing the parts to their own benefit. Ignoring these stereotypes is not easy, nor is pretending to be a man. Hillary Clinton was cast as a scary emasculator for being openly ambitious. Angela Merkel, who led Germany for 16 years, was as no-nonsense as it gets, but was boxed into a matronly \u2018mutti\u2019 image anyway. Finland\u2019s former PM Sanna Marin was criticised for her youth. New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and Brazil\u2019s Dilma Rousseff faced their own witch-hunts. In recent years, there has been public pushback against this kind of gendered scrutiny. We have seen many prominent politicians take these templates head-on, and lead in their own ways. But as the Meloni discourse shows, old-fashioned misogyny dies hard.\n\n",

        "full_article": "How did Taylor Swift become Taylor Swift? Or Steve Jobs, or Leonardo da Vinci? How To Become Famous: Lost Einsteins, Forgotten Superstars and How the Beatles Came to Beby Cass Sunstein is an exploration of how some people achieve iconic status. Extraordinary as they are, their fate has as much to do with chance and serendipity. How does that serendipity work, and how can it be engineered?\nFame is often seen as a bubble that pops. But long-term fame is not a matter of caprice or infatuation: something causes Mozart or Jane Austen to endure, rather than their peers Salieri or Mary Brunton.\nSuccess stories often focus on random narratives: the dropout or the highly educated, Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, whose example works? It\u2019s hard to identify the exact qualities that make for success\u2013 especially since those traits may be equally found in those who are unsuccessful. Of course, hard labour and resilience are required.\nRandom encounters matter too. If young Cassius Clay had not had his bike stolen, reported it to a police chief who advised him to learn boxing, would Muhammad Ali, the superlative star, come to be? Meanwhile, why does Bob Dylan define an era, while an equally original, poetic and deep singer like Connie Converse, who went viral on Spotify, was forgotten for decades?\nInfluencers have always been crucial: if prominent people in your group like something, it catches on. And this appeal grows exponentially: the more well-known someone is, the more their reputation snowballs. These are reputational cascades. Quite apart from the merits of a book or show or statesman, we want to talk to others about them. Taylor Swift\u2019s explosive popularity is an example of these network effects. Keats found like-minded acquaintances talking up his work on a small scale, a collective chatter that became the buzz of fame. The Beatles had their manager to thank, for his relentless belief and effort that drove their early success.\nSometimes, reputations are created posthumously, as with the cult of Jane Austen. Her work hit the right spot, family and publishers championed her tirelessly like celebrity endorsers and commercial efforts might do today. Keats wasn\u2019t necessarily better than his peer Leigh Hunt; it\u2019s not just about literary worth, but also extraneous factors and accidental advantages that make lionised writers.\nWhy did Star Wars become such a phenomenon? Nobody saw it coming, certainly not the studio executives. Sure, audience reception was rapturous and reviewers declared it amazing to start with. But again, word of mouth in the sci-fi communities, reputational cascades and network effects played a huge role \u2013 even now, you watch it to be part of the group. It\u2019s the same with the Marvel universe.\nSocial scientists speak of the lost Einsteins and Shakespeares and Teslas, who may be disadvantaged by poverty, gender or race, lacking role models and exposure. But there are other reasons that innovators fail to make it. Maybe the zeitgeist wasn\u2019t on their side, there was no wave for them to catch. They might not have been born into the right families, found the right networks, enemies, champions or inspirations.\nFame is a matter of lucky breaks, the book reminds us \u2013 and that also means there are countless stars and talents existing among us, right now. All they need is attention and opportunity.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a culture where parents are often put on a pedestal, it seems redundant to have designated days to remind ourselves of the people who made us. We are constantly reminded of that regardless. In recent times, Mother's Day has gained momentum here and become more of a mainstream idea.\nHere, even if people know of these days, they are still more of an idea than something one actually celebrates. And in a country where there are so many woes and hardships, one perhaps cannot but cynically look at it. However, there can be a scope for localisation that isn't sponsored by a neoliberal profit-making scheme.\nFather's Day can be a chance to look at fathers to see what's really going on with them. This is also an attempt to articulate how it feels to seek reconciliation when fathers are no longer with us.\nGrowing up, for the longest time, I didn't identify my father as a man. He was just my father, and then there was this world of men\u2014men who, in my opinion as a teen, were mucking up my every plan to be gloriously sixteen, seventeen. While I was frowning trying to figure out why a girl is the worst enemy these men can have, and why my laughter and joy was the bane of their existence, my father ceased to exist. And he remained just that, my father, for a ridiculously long time.\nAnd then, it hit me\u2014my father was a man.\nI don't think parents realise how powerful they are. It truly boggles my mind how people remain so nonchalant and do not see that if there is anything miraculous left, it is that they can just decide to bring another human being into this world. That is a power akin to that of being able to say, \"Let there be light.\" So, no wonder it doesn't register easily that these people you call\u00a0Amma\u00a0and\u00a0Abba\u00a0are people too, that they are human beings whom some other folks once decided to bring into this world, that one's father is just a man, made in this culture with language that wouldn't let him be a full human being.\nI'm sure it is somewhat true for every culture, but living in a country such as ours, the relationship between a father and a daughter is a very strange one. The majority consensus for the daughters of Bangladesh is that beware of men. Newspaper articles, TV screens and cinemas all come as precautionary messages of what can happen to you as a girl. Here, fathers have a very panic-inducing job to do.\nThey are the representative of the clan of men. They have a working knowledge of what array of members their clan consists of. They fear the members they don't know well. While I was growing up, I thought women feared men. I had no idea how much men fear men, too.\nWhile I was diagnosing myself and the society out there, I saw my father. A man who had me when he was at my age. He had seventeen years to talk to me. I'm sure he thought he had time. There's no need to even mention that I thought we had time. Time was still a concept that proposed infiniteness.\nIt is a little harder, though not impossible, to reach reconciliation with fathers who are no longer here. Especially if one loses their father at an early age, one becomes quite a detective. It's like their life is spread in front of you and the last entry on the diary has been made. Now make what you want to make out of it. You cannot interrogate, you cannot interview, and no one is going to talk back. You just have to take versions of events from eyewitnesses and examine the existing entries and reach a point.\nReconciliation is needed because the rapture of life tears us apart and bars us from seeing the stage where there is forgiveness and compassion.\nBecause I couldn't reach my father, quite subconsciously, I developed this habit of looking at as many fathers as I could. It was a hobby, like collecting stamps; I would collect memories of my female friends with their fathers.\nI've seen some wonderful fathers in my lifetime, and I saw some truly horrible ones too. I have no unrealistic romanticisation of fatherhood. In my brain, they are not kept on pedestals. I also understand that being a good father does not equal being a good husband. And I have reached that point where I see fathers as men who were taught to put on a brave face and stride, who tried to be the fathers we deserved, and when they failed, couldn't cry.\nSo, there was this daughter in Washington, Sonora Smart Dodd. At age 27, she had the idea for Father's Day. Her father was a Civil War veteran who raised her and her five siblings alone after their mother died in childbirth. The first Father's Day was celebrated on June 19, 1910, the month of her father's birthday.\nThough I don't buy into this very Americanised way of celebration and all that it entails, I do like this story. I try to imagine Sonora's father as well. He always comes in the image of Jo March's father in\u00a0The Little Women. And I want to give them a hug, from our house to theirs.\nIn the hurry to hide true emotion in humour, I digress. I should crack a joke right about now! I want to say Happy Father's Day to Darth Vader. I want to say the most famous son is Jesus Christ. And while my brain seeks denial of grief in humour, I see my father laughing. I see him talking to my older brother, my brother reading Kahlil Gibran's poem \"On Children\" in a very intentional way\u2014\n\"You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.\"\nI see my father hiding shadows of sadness in his eyes, I see him smile.\nAnd even after knowing how it would make us both cringe, to my beautiful, brilliant father, I say, \"Happy Father's Day, Abbu!\" You tried your best, you can put your armour down now, and be the joyful little boy you always wanted to be.\nSumaya Mashrufa\u00a0is sub-editor at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Two Eids ago, we brought home a bull with ominous signs that we ignored. Growing up a fan of horror movies, both good and bad, I should have caught on to the telltale signs that things were not quite right. As the truck stopped at our gate to unload the majestically live beef burger supply, the forlorn, sinister background orchestra must have been playing. It was drowned out by the culture clash of a Katrina Kaif dance hit blaring from the house opposite.\nA broken headlight, a near-fatal spinal dislocation, and a cat stuck in a tree were some of the devastating aftermaths of that fateful night. And we men of the house came out not any more manly, but definitely a little wiser.\nThe bull was bought from a \"haat\" far, far away. Nothing unusual about that since far, far away often translates to \"a pretty damn good deal.\" There were more signs that should have tipped us off. The deal was quick. The price was right, almost too right. And the delivery was prompt, by a truck instead of the usual walking, so that we, the buyers, received the bull quickly without fuss. Is that convenient or what? So much convenience almost sounds like coincidence. So many signs that were more apparent than any M Night Shyamalan movie.\nThe people who delivered the bull, including our home caretaker Laal Miah (complete with patches of red hair to match), managed to set everything in place. The bull was corralled near the front entrance. Two of the cars parked there, and the bull was safely tied up 10 feet away close to the gate. He had space to strut, moo, and drop copious amounts of green fertiliser. It was all good. It was all quiet.\nThen midnight happened, and nothing happened. The graceful bull, all black and shiny, expectantly docile, stood its ground. It seemed to be fine. Near the early hours of the morning, the mooing commenced. The bumping started bumping. And our dogs went mad barking. We ran to the garage to witness a bull that was more like the Predator from, well, Predator. It was gone. Invisible.\nMy brother-in-law went looking. He is a burly man, almost as wide as he is tall, a ship captain who knows no fear. See, the main garage housed two cars; an SUV and my then prized and rather rare Honda. The bull hid among the two vehicles. The moment we approached, it jumped up, ready to make a run if someone so much as moved. The movie buff in me decided this was it, do or die like a toreador making his show. But more concerning was that I needed to save my car.\nThe bull took his stance and charged away from us. My brother-in-law bravely tried to grab the bull by the horns and drag it back. The bull decided it was having none of this controlling behaviour. One life to live and all that. My brother-in-law was very stylishly flipped over the head and laid down flat and square on the ground. The horror movie was taking a turn for 90's early morning Tom & Jerry hilarity. The man was winded but his spine was intact. It is a big household with six kids, three cats, two dogs, turkeys, chickens, and many grownups. Everyone was shouting and some cheering. Not quite sure if it was for the bull or the people trying not to get killed.\nThe bull decided to jump and squeeze between the spaces around the cars. I grabbed the rope, fashioned a noose and tried to lasso it around the bull's head. Then I realised I know absolutely\u00a0 nothing about lasso and ended up enraging the animal. There was a three-foot-tall flimsy decorative metal grill separating the garage from the rest of the open space in front of the house. The bull tried to jump that and used part of my car as his launch pad. I heard the crack of a broken light, saw the bumper clips snap and dislocate, and the pain was worse than being actually stabbed. Yes, I am a petrolhead. I love my cars. In a split second, the bull succeeded in jumping and landed on the potted plants, murdering some, maiming others emotionally to never flower again. This scared the cats that were watching and one scrambled up a coconut tree. It had done this before and each time remained unable to come back down. And then the bull jumped again back into the garage slamming into the side of my car.\nSo I did what any quick-thinking, panicking adult would do. I opened the gate.\nThere's a saying that if you truly love something, let it free. I loved my car so I set the bull free. And it ran. And everyone ran. Eventually, we managed to grab the runaway bull and tie him to a lamppost one block away. And that is where we left him till the morning came around and enough people showed up to coax him back.\nHorror stories do not come any scarier than a bull gone loose. But like all horror stories, things seem much less scary a few months later. Especially when you recall the memories while chewing on said beef patties.\nEhsanur Raza Ronny is head of content marketing and deputy features editor at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Every year, Eid-ul-Azha brings with it viral pictures or videos of human-cattle interactions that amuse some and bemuse others, but overall help to build anticipation for the more solemn occasion of cattle sacrifice. This year is no different. A video clip currently trending online features a runaway cow that\u2014let's say for now\u2014decided to go shopping. The clip begins with what appears to be an overturned auto-rickshaw in front of a shopping mall in Dhaka. The cow, visibly agitated, with its handlers trying to hold onto its reins, leaves them behind to chase a few onlookers before making a dash for the mall entrance. It gallops up the stairs. Once in, it runs past a row of shops, slips into one in the far corner, and briefly hides there, much to the bewilderment of the crowd.\nI must admit that I, like most people commenting on the video, was amused initially. After all, the short video is full of chaotic potential, with a side dish of humour served with a fitting music. Although sacrificial cows breaking loose on their way from\u00a0haats\u00a0or lunging at perceived attackers is not an uncommon sight, it still prompts an amused reaction every Eid-ul-Azha. Netizens, as always, had some funny ideas about why the runaway cow behaved the way it did in front of a shopping mall. Stuff of another\u00a0Gabhi Brittanto, one quipped.\n\nInterestingly, the\u00a0gabhi\u00a0(cow) in question seemed to calm down a bit toward the end, inside the shop, where it found a caring pair of hands stroking its head. Its earlier behaviour can be attributed to fear or irritation. The way sacrificial cattle are often hauled off to their eventual destinations, hemmed in by people and vehicles of all sorts, each louder than the other, can be overwhelming for the shackled animals. The poor cow probably had a similar experience, and its instinctive response was to try to flee to a safer location, away from the chaos, confusion, and beatings.\nBut there are bigger things at work here. While we share and laugh at these viral videos of \"cute chaos\" caused by cows on our streets, they also bring to light a stark reality: the fast-vanishing space for animals in Bangladesh as people continue to encroach upon their habitats and animals, in turn, increasingly find themselves in human-dominated areas, leading to such bizarre encounters. The cows\u2014often treated most inhumanely\u2014thus serve as a metaphor for all the caged, abused, poached or displaced animals out there. Seen from their perspective, the story of animals invading human spaces (like shopping malls) is equally a story of humans invading natural spaces (like hills and forests). We only see one side of the story because it helps us sleep at night, secure in our own sense of self-worth.\n\nWhile we share and laugh at these viral videos of \"cute chaos\" caused by cows on our streets, they also bring to light a stark reality: the fast-vanishing space for animals in Bangladesh as people continue to encroach upon their habitats and animals, in turn, increasingly find themselves in human-dominated areas, leading to such bizarre encounters. The cows\u2014rounded up for human consumption but often treated most inhumanely\u2014thus serve as a metaphor for all the caged, abused, poached or displaced animals out there. \nBut to call what's happening on the other side a \"human-animal conflict\" would be like, for lack of a better example, calling what's happening in Gaza an \"Israel-Palestine war\"\u2014so one-sided has this so-called conflict been. From Cox's Bazar to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to Sylhet to Gazipur to Mymensingh to the Sundarbans, our invasion of the natural spaces has been relentless and merciless. And the animals have only been reacting to it so far, and reacting rather unconvincingly.\nIt is no wonder, then, that the rate of deforestation in Bangladesh, according to an article by this daily, has been almost double the global average. In Cox's Bazar, for example, forests are rapidly disappearing, replaced by various projects and settlements. Often, these forests or forestlands, which serve as the natural habitats of numerous animals including critically endangered species, are ravaged by government agencies themselves\u2014the very institutions that are supposed to protect them\u2014for development or commercial purposes.\n\nThe saga of CHT districts is equally depressing. Every other month or so, you come across reports of how the region, with its rolling hills and rich forests, is being degraded or stripped bare to make way for various infrastructure and commercial projects without any environmental consideration. This rampant development is literally a death sentence for the natural habitats of wildlife. Also at risk is the integrity of Indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with nature for centuries. Other forest and hilly areas in the country that historically served as natural habitats for animals are more or less going through the same ordeals. When a natural space is degraded like this, it is not just the species or their habitats that are at risk. Its ecological balance, too, is disrupted.\nAnimals are not safe from uncontrolled human expansion in cities and other urban landscapes either, as parks and open spaces are being consumed by concrete structures. The occasional sighting of a monkey, bird or squirrel is a painful reminder of their shrinking habitats. Even the abject negligence with which animals living closer to humans, like street dogs and cats, are treated speaks of the ever-widening gap between the human and animal populations.\nSo, yes, when a cow wanders into a shopping mall where you think it has no business to be, it is not a moot or\u2014as Joey Tribbiani from the\u00a0TV show\u00a0Friends\u00a0would call it\u2014\"moo\" point. It is\u00a0the\u00a0point: a clear, decisive statement on the need to end human cruelties and excesses in relation to our animal neighbours.\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Eid-ul-Adha, the second of the two great festivals of the Muslim Ummah, is primarily a festival of sacrifice. But this festival assumes a unique spiritual significance with the performance of hajj scheduled for the 10th day of the twelfth and final month of Dhu al-Hijja on the Islamic calendar. Hajj performed in Makkah is mandatory for all the devout Muslims who are physically, mentally and financially capable of doing so. Sacrifice of animal is integral to the performance of Hajj. Although the celebration is slated for the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijja, it is carried forward to the following three days. However, the difference of time by a day or two in moon sighting from different locations on the planet, which is the basis of lunar months, actually sets the dates for celebrations of both Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha. This is what actually explains celebration of the two great festivals on different dates. Now, all great festivals are generally marked by mammoth congregations. Hajj is certainly one such congregation. Even the prayer offered to the Almighty Allah brings together thousands and, in some select Eidgahs of Bangladesh, tens of thousands of followers of Islam. If Eid-ul-Fitr is preceded by the practice of a month-long siam or self-abnegation, Eid-ul-Adha transcends this lesson to yet another humanitarian and spiritual cause. The core theme ingrained in these two religious obligations is of course unreserved and total submission to Allah, the benevolent. This sacrificial ritual is incorporated into Islam from the unrivalled example of prophet Ibrahim's willingness to make the supreme sacrifice. At the command of Allah the merciful, Prophet Ibrahim was about to sacrifice his son Ismail as a complete surrender to the supreme being's will. It was, however, the ultimate test not only the prophet but also his son were put to by the Almighty. Both came out of the test in flying colours as they responded unhesitatingly to the call of duty to Allah. In today's mundane world, no one is asked to sacrifice his son. Then where does lie the significance of the sacrifice? It is in the purity of mind that remains steadfast against all distractions and seductions. One has to offer to Allah what one holds dearest to his bosom. This also is a lesson in renunciation for the sake of complete surrender to the creator. Through this, man seeks a union with the omnipotent being. To do so one has to come clean on any mundane consideration like prophet Ibrahim and prove total submission to God's will. Sadly, the spirit is woefully missing now. Most people are more eager for the feast than going by the religious edict. When it comes to sacrifice of animals, some take it as an opportunity for flaunting wealth by way of procuring the prized bull or ox for slaughter. Theirs is no sacrifice and it is not accepted by Allah. Apart from this clear religious message, Eid-ul-Adha's socio-economic implications are also very significant. Through sharing and distributing sacrificial meat with relatives and among the poor, the well-to-do in society can also perform a duty towards society. The money spent on the sacrificial animal also contributes to the economy by way of fostering cattle rearing by poor farmers and developing cattle farms in both rural and peri-urban areas.",

        "full_article": "Across the globe, the alarming surge in public debt has escalated into a pressing issue for international policymakers and analysts. The volume of public debt, commonly known as general governmental domestic and external debt, has nearly doubled over a span of twelve years. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), now known as UN Trade and Development, unveiled its 'A World of Debt' report for 2024 in the first week of this month. The report revealed that public debt had soared to US$ 97 trillion in 2023, marking a growth of 6.10 per cent or $ 5.6 trillion from $91.40 trillion in 2022. In 2010, the figure stood at approximately $50 trillion. The report emphasized that global public debt is on a relentless upward trajectory, propelled by 'cascading crises as well as the sluggish and uneven performance of the global economy.' The UNCTAD report also underscored the stark regional disparities in the growth of public debt, with developing nations witnessing a surge at a rate twice that of developed countries. In the past year alone, public debt in developing countries escalated to $29 trillion, constituting around 30 per cent of the total global debt. This ratio was a mere 16 per cent in 2010. However, there is a significant contrast among developing regions in terms of public debt. More than three-quarters of the debt is owed by countries in Asia and Oceania, compared to 17 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The share of Africa stood at a mere 7 per cent. Though public debt is a critical instrument for development as it enables the various governments to finance necessary spending and provides investment for multiple purposes, it may become burdensome for many nations due to excessive surges. Both internal and external factors may spark the surge. If the governments are unable to manage the spending or go for inefficient spending spree, it may compel the countries to borrow more, creating a burden of public debt. Debt servicing also becomes costlier, putting additional pressure on economies. The anxiety regarding public debt is also reflected in the fiscal policy and sovereign debt conference in Tokyo in the first week of this month. In his opening remarks, Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), mentioned that the global debt is now around 93 per cent of the global GDP and is projected to reach around 100 per cent within five years. He also pointed out that though before the global health crisis, growing levels of public debt were a concern in many countries, public debts jumped significantly when the covid-19 pandemic, a global health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, hit. To fight against the negative consequences of the pandemic, governments across the world provided vast amounts of fiscal support to households and businesses. It required higher borrowing from home and abroad. Now, during a time of high interest rates, high debt means increasing costs of debt servicing that constrain fiscal spaces of many nations. And the situation is compounded by the medium-term growth prospects. UNCTAD report pointed out that the increase in global interest rates since 2022 further strained public budgets in developing nations as high-interest payments are outpacing the growth in essential public spending such as health, education, and climate action. It is estimated that the developing world is now home to 3.3 billion people, and one out of every three developing countries now spends more on interest payments than on human development, which refers to the overall well-being and quality of life of a nation's citizens.Against the backdrop, the situation of Bangladesh deserves some attention, especially since the country is going through a tough time in economic management. Like many other developing countries, public debt is also gradually piling up in Bangladesh, and indication is also there that it may become a severe burden on the already stressed economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the country's debt will likely increase to 42.6 per cent by 2027, rising from 37.9 per cent of GDP in 2023. The rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that the country has to bear the burden of higher interest payments. The finance ministry already projected that interest payments are expected to increase from Tk 777.7 billion in FY22 to Tk 1,545 billion in FY27. As a share of the total budget, the ratio of interest payments was 15.3 per cent in FY22 and is likely to stay at the same level in FY27. Though the static ratio may comfort policymakers in the short term, the big surge in the actual amount will be a matter of concern. The projection shows that interest payment liability will almost double in five years. Moreover, the external interest payments will jump by 470 per cent during the period under review. The recent Medium-term Macroeconomic Policy Statement 2024-25 to 2026-27, released in the first week of this month, has sounded an alarm. It points out that the majority of the external credits Bangladesh has received from its development partners have been on concessional terms. However, this trend is expected to reverse in the near future, highlighting the need for alternative fiscal management strategies. \"Because of the tight monetary policy adopted by the advanced countries since 2022, interest expenditure on foreign loans is gradually increasing,\" said the statement. It also pointed out that interest spending on external credits is expected to remain above 2 per cent of total expenditure in the medium term primarily for two reasons. First, reference rates in advanced countries are expected to be elevated shortly. Second, the country's graduation from the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) will gradually close the window for Bangladesh to get concessional loans from foreign sources. In this new reality, the government document suggested a preference for domestic borrowing but noted that the proportion of external debt would gradually increase. \"Overall, the rising debt levels call for careful fiscal management to ensure sustainability and to maintain a healthy balance between growth and debt servicing obligations,\" it added. This means there is no scope for complacency about public debt in the near future based on the country's first-ever Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) report. The report indicated that the country's public debt remains within safe thresholds, even under extreme scenarios. The government will conduct another DSA after the end of the current fiscal year (FY24). One has to wait for the updated report to know the level of complacency regarding public debt management.

        "full_article": "Eid-ul-Adha, the second-largest religious festival for people of Islamic faith, will be celebrated with due fervour and solemnity on Monday, June 17. Eid-ul-Adha, also known as the festival of sacrifice, is not only a solemn religious occasion, but also it has immense socio-economic impacts. A significant amount of cash changes hands during this period, initiating a flurry of economic activities. Government and private sector employees receive bonuses, remittance inflow substantially increases, and the wealthy donate zakat. All lead to an increase in money flow within the market that creates additional demands for goods and services. People spend money on purchasing sacrificial animals, new clothing, food, spices, travel, entertainment, and some other goods. This surge in consumer spending yields a much-needed boost to the economy during this challenging period. Some economists, however, are apprehensive that it could further raise the inflation rate.Economic activities during Eid-ul-Adha encompass and buoy up a wide range of sectors across the spectrum, including buyers, retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, transportations, labourers, and government revenue collection. The period is indeed a godsend to many. It sees increased demand, leading to higher employment, production, and income, thus driving economic growth and ensuring family income. It is difficult, however, to track the flow of money accurately because the substantial financial transactions that occur during the festival largely go unrecorded. Overall, it's estimated that the size of the Eid-ul-Adha economy is around Tk 700 to 800 billion, with the majority of the monetary transaction revolving around cattle and other livestock sales. According to the Department of Livestock Services, a record number of 13 million animals have been prepared for sacrifice this year. As an added bonus, the stocks of locally reared animals are sufficient to meet the demand for sacrificial animals. This also proves that the country has come out of the rut of animal import dependence. Local cattle farming have witnessed a boom following India's restriction on export of cows in 2015. Subsequently, numerous far-sighted youths as well as prominent industrialists have shifted their focus to animal husbandry, making Eid-ul-Adha the focal point of their business. Under the Ministry of Livestock, initiatives such as veterinary services, consultancy, and medical and food supply support have been extended to rural areas, fostering the expansion of hybrid and high-yielding breeds of cattle and goats in Bangladesh.This development not only significantly bolsters the national economy, but also ensures and fulfills year-round meat requirements in the country. Approximately, 23 million cows, goats, sheep, and buffaloes are slaughtered annually in Bangladesh, with half of them raised specifically for sacrificial purposes. Furthermore, Eid-ul-Adha marks the main season for procuring rawhide for the country's second-biggest export-earning sector, leather. Approximately sixty percent of the annual requirement for raw materials of the leather and leather goods industry is procured during this Eid.While the animal business is central, the occasion also causes to spike demand for miscellaneous other goods and services. Butchers are particularly in big demand and can make substantial profit on Eid day, hopping from one location to the next as speedily as they can. They're accompanied by scores of apprentices who learn their skill on the job and apply it later. Additionally, it is an opportunity for some extra income for Imams and Muezzins. The blacksmith community is also energised during Eid-ul-Adha. Apart from the miscellaneous and substantial benefits Eid-ul-Adha presents to the people, significant revenue is also generated for the government. It collects revenue from leasing animal markets and expatriate workers remit additional money, which adds further momentum to the rural economy and boost the country's foreign reserve. Thus, the feast of sacrifice has an enormous impact on the socio-economic arena. Amidst a plethora of macroeconomic challenges, festivals like Eid-ul-Adha can positively impact the economy and bring joy to all. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Every day, newspapers and TV broadcasts are filled with news of accidents occurring on roads and highways. The pressing question remains: How many more highway fatalities will it take for us to assume responsibility and take action? Though the annual toll of road accidents during the two Eids is alarming, with the death count steadily rising each year, yet little has been to address it.The mounting fatalities from road accidents in our country is paralleled by a significant number of individuals injured or left permanently disabled. These accidents are predominantly caused by the negligence and illegal actions of drivers. Additionally, a competitive mindset among drivers contributes to the frequency of accidents. Speeding and ignorance of road rules help the occurrence of accidents to continue. The scientific maxim, \"The higher the speed, the higher the likelihood of accidents\", explains it all.Many roads and highways in our country have sharp bends that pose challenges to vehicle control, particularly at high speeds. Furthermore, issues such as poor road construction, the use of substandard bitumen, and uneven surfacing contribute to accidents, often resulting in tire-bursts. Dividers and U-turns on roads are also potential sources of accident if drivers are careless.A significant number of vehicles in the country are unregistered, some of which are old and unfit for road use. After accidents occur, it is often revealed that the vehicle was not roadworthy, the driver had no license, or the vehicle was illegal, resulting in loss of life and property.Most victims of road accidents are breadwinners, and a single accident can devastate a family's future, leading to financial loss, injuries, and disabilities. To mitigate road accidents, the government must take effective measures, including stricter enforcement of traffic laws, particularly regarding vehicle speed. Illegal and unfit vehicles must be banned outright, and accident-prone areas should be identified for targeted interventions.There is a pressing need to raise the educational qualifications required for drivers, making at least a secondary school certificate (SSC) mandatory. Driving should be treated as a profession, with drivers wearing distinct uniforms and receiving specialized accident prevention training. Additionally, comprehensive awareness campaigns targeting individuals at all levels of society are crucial to reducing accidents on roads and highways. Only through concerted efforts can we hope to make significant strides in accident prevention.Nowrin Akther, StudentEast West University , Dhaka",
