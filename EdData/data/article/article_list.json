The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conceded the Chief Minister\u2019s post to Mr. Shinde who led a revolt in the Shiv Sena to unseat Uddhav Thackeray. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has settled for the post of Deputy Chief Minister. The political churn in Maharashtra is unlikely to settle with this, however. When the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) formed an unlikely alliance, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), to form the government in 2019, it was seen as a new possibility of politics by some and crass opportunism by many. As it turned out, Mr. Thackeray, son of Sena founder Bal Thackeray, could not manage the turmoil that his daring to experiment triggered within the party. Initially, it had appeared that the provincialism represented by the Sena might act as a counter to the totalising politics of Hindutva. The MVA\u2019s unravelling shows that the BJP\u2019s ideology, backed with instruments of state power, and the capacity to mobilise resources, could railroad regional politics when the situation is favourable. This is one sabotage of a government that has a credible ideological defence \u2014 Mr. Shinde, and his BJP backers have argued that the Sena-BJP alliance had fought together in 2019, with Hindutva as their bonding ideology. That Mr. Shinde unseated Mr. Thackeray to uphold the people\u2019s will and fidelity to the ideology is a strong argument. For all his mild demeanour and inclusive image, Mr. Thackeray could not command sufficient chutzpah to remake the Sena. The assumption that the Sena could be re-engineered into a benign political outfit seems to have been misplaced. And he failed to notice the resentment that was bubbling up right under his nose.The Maharashtra episode proves yet again the BJP\u2019s capacity to play the long game. Soon after the patriarch Thackeray\u2019s passing in 2012, the BJP\u2019s plans to gain an upper hand in its relations with the Sena began to roll out; by 2014 the party was ahead of the Sena. By winning a consecutive election in 2019, in alliance with the Sena, it reinforced its position. All this should have tempered the ambitions of the Thackerays \u2014 which by then included a third-generation scion, Aaditya. When they claimed power by forming the MVA, the BJP harnessed the resentment among Sena MLAs, finally toppling the Thackerays. But the BJP and the Shinde-led Sena faction have been careful not to bruise the sentiments of the Sena cadre that still holds the founder\u2019s family in high esteem. Which faction will win the legal battle to own the party name and symbol and which one will win the hearts of the party workers are two different questions. It is not impossible that the Sena could dissipate and its cadres dissolve into the BJP. The concession of the CM\u2019s post to Mr. Shinde is not an act of political altruism, but cold strategy. Having deflected the potential hurt and anger of the Sainiks for now, the BJP will now wait for the best time for its next move. The next episode of the Maharashtra saga will then play out.",

It ratified three of the four reports, put off one for further deliberations based on concerns flagged by a State, with a commitment to reassemble and resolve the impasse holistically in little over a month. A new ministerial panel is being tasked with figuring out the long-pending constitution of an appellate tribunal for GST disputes, to move ahead. Based on an \u2018interim\u2019 report of a panel to rationalise tax rates, exemptions have been scrapped on several items and rates altered for others to correct inverted duty structures. This may translate into higher prices on many goods and services (and reductions for a few) from July 18, although their impact on inflation is difficult to ascertain. However, a larger restructuring of the GST\u2019s multiple rates\u2019 structure, with an increase in levies to bolster revenues that have fallen short of expectations, partly due to rate cuts earlier effected as electoral tools, has been put off. With inflation expected to remain buoyant, that exercise may have to wait longer.Apart from the fine print of the Council\u2019s decisions, which include tighter norms on the horizon for registering new firms and closing of tax evasion loopholes, there is a more critical takeaway. That the deliberations were constructive and not combative, especially amid the brewing trust deficit between the Centre and States in the past few meetings and the prolonged pause since it last met, bodes well for the necessary next steps to make GST deliver on its original hopes. Not a single member raised the recent Supreme Court order that some States believed had upheld their rights against \u2018arbitrary imposition\u2019 of the Centre\u2019s decisions in the Council. Moreover, over a dozen States brought up an \u2018extra agenda item\u2019 \u2014 their anxieties about the sunset of assured revenue growth from July 1, on which even Ministers from BJP-ruled States spoke up to seek the continuance of GST Compensation for some years. That States are no longer driven by party whips in this critical forum, should enrich the quality of dialogue and outcomes. That the Centre \u2018heard them out\u2019 and left the issue open, unlike the last Council meet when its response was akin to an outright \u2018No\u2019, is most refreshing. Taking a clear call, one way or the other, on continuing this support, will be ideal for the Centre and States to plan their fiscal math better. Just as sustaining and nurturing this fledgling federal compact is critical to make the GST work better for all, sooner rather than later.",

        "full_article": "The US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs Wade judgment shocked the world, putting women at grave risks\nIn the landmark Roe v. Wade (1973) judgment, the US Supreme Court had then declared that the constitution protected a woman's right to liberty to choose to have an abortion. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her pregnancy deserves the highest level of constitutional protection. It struck down several federal and state laws restricting abortion.\nNow, in 2022, the very same historic judgment was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States. This has come across as a shock globally for all activists fighting for a gender equal world. This decision has snatched away the constitutional rights of women and has made the progress on sexual and reproductive rights of women over the decades redundant. Despite strong opposition by women, civil society organisations and human rights activists, the Supreme Court of the United States of America overturned the historic case of Roe v. Wade. The conservative overturning of this case intrinsically reflects an authoritarian control of women's bodies and has put the lives of American women in danger by denying them bodily autonomy and the right to choose. Most importantly, it denounces the women's rights movement and decades of struggle by women in the country.\nSurprisingly, the US Supreme Court has claimed several reasons for overturning Roe v. Wade, and none of them features women and their bodies as the main theme. The judgment states that the court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. The legal reasoning that the court provides may sound rational, but the experience of women in the U.S would differ with the court's reasoning. As Justice Breyer rightly points out in his dissenting opinion: \"Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result is certain: the curtailment of women\u2019s rights and of their status as free and equal citizens.\"\nSome 40 million women of child-bearing age will live in states where abortion will become more difficult to access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports abortion rights. The restriction of abortion means an increase in unsafe abortions, a threat to the lives of women and dire physical and mental health consequences for women. While the Supreme Court is now leaving it to the states to decide how to outlaw or regulate abortion, 22 states already have laws in place that will immediately outlaw abortion, thus leaving women with grave and deadly options when it comes to not conceiving. On the personal autonomy front, this is a disaster waiting to happen.\nThis decision has not only stirred up the liberal groups, the political scenarios, and the feminists, but also has put women, their health, and safety at a huge risk of being left with only abstinence or unsafe abortions. It also puts the lives of infants at risk who will be born through pregnancies unwillingly carried due to inaccessibility to safe abortions.\nIn 1971, two years prior to Roe V. Wade, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act was enacted by Parliament in India, allowing registered medical practitioners to carry out abortions under certain specified circumstances. It also granted immunity to doctors performing abortions in accordance with its provisions from prosecution under Section 312 IPC. When the law was initially passed in 1971, the upper-limit for abortion was 20 weeks. Following the 2021 amendment, it has been extended to 24 weeks in the case of women who meet certain criteria. India\u2019s generous stance on the termination of pregnancy is definitely comforting. India might even be a part of the highest echelons of countries that safeguard the constitutional and legal rights of women of the country. While the women of America had to endure a long struggle in the fight for equal suffrage, India had given equal voting rights since Independence. Not only this, when it comes to women representation in the highest political offices, India fares better than the United States of America. Even as the West retrogresses, India shows the path to a progressive society.\nAs the decision of SCOTUS will regress the United States of America, it is important to highlight that the judiciary is an extremely important pillar of democracy, protecting the constitutionality of laws and the rights of the people. It\u2019s a shame that the institution has failed the women of the country and stripped them of the basic human rights that they have been expected to preserve. In fact, up to 66 per cent of US citizens did not want it to be overturned. So, for whom did the SCOTUS issue its decision? The self-serving extreme conservatives who would disvalue a living individual, the authoritative and patriarchal regime?\nIn a nutshell, Roe v. Wade protected women's right to have an abortion and didn't \"force\" anyone to have an abortion. The USA is on a similar path of suffering that Ireland was on from 1983-2018.\n(The author is Rajya Sabha MP and deputy leader of\u00a0 Shiv Sena)",

        "full_article": "The junta\u2019s reign of terror in Myanmar is facing growing resistance from several insurgent ethnic organisatons and civilian population\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the developments in Myanmar away from the centre stage of global discourse. Hence, the ruling junta\u2019s increasingly savage war on its own people demanding a return to democracy and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained Myanmar leaders no longer receives the attention it earlier did. The junta has killed over 2,000 civilians and detained more than 11,200 political prisoners, according to Myanmar\u2019s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners recently.\nDaw Aung San Suu-Kyi\u2019s persecution continues. The icon of Myanmar\u2019s democracy has been convicted in half a dozen cases, and sentenced to a total of 11 years in prison, following sham trials by kangaroo courts closed to the public. Her lawyers have been barred from addressing the media. She has recently been moved from house arrest to solitary confinement in prison. As in the cases of fabricated verdicts against her, the move has been widely condemned, with Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, criticising it sharply.\nAll this, of course, has had no effect on the junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who presides over the reign of terror unleashed by the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar\u2019s army is officially known. Things will change only after the junta is defenestrated. How long will that take? Opposition to the junta is growing. The National Unity Government (NUG), formed on April 16, 2021, by some leaders of the National League for Democracy \u2014 the party led by Daw Suu Kyi \u2014 activists and representatives of several insurgent ethnic organisatons and minor parties, announced, in May, 2021, the formation of its armed wing, the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). According to a report by Richard C Paddock (The New York Times, June 6, 2022), it claims to have a strength of 60,000. Also, the NUG, according to Paddock, claims that at least 14,890 of Tatmadaw\u2019s soldiers died fighting while its forces lost only 1,000 fighters. The Tatmadaw does not give casualty figures but that it is having a hard time is clear from its burning of villages, use of indiscriminate artillery fire and air attacks against civilian targets.\nThe Tatmadaw\u2019s strength is generally estimated to be between 300,000 and 350,000 troops. In an article in Asia Times (February 24, 2022), however, Bertil Lintner has quoted the Australian Myanmar-watcher and military matters expert, Andrew Selth, as saying that the key element was \u201cnot the number of men and women in uniform, but the number of combat soldiers the junta\u201d could field. \u201cMost estimates,\u201d he added, \u201ccite 100,000-120,000.\u201d Even after counting another 80,000 personnel of the national police, the figure is hardly enough to cope with a hostile population spread out over the entire country and increasingly taking to arms.\nAs for arms, Lintner states, \u201cBeginning in 1989, the then ruling junta, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, spent more than a billion dollars procuring new, more sophisticated military hardware. But most of it would be of little use in counterinsurgency operations in remote mountainous ethnic areas.\u201d Helicopters and aircraft have helped the Tatmadaw but, as seen in Vietnam and, more recently, in Afghanistan, they are not enough to avert defeat.\nAs for combat capability, Lintner states that Myanmar had battle-hardened troops that had fought guerrillas of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Karen National Army (KNA). A generation of Myanmar\u2019s soldiers, however, has had no combat experience following peace deals the Tatmadaw had signed with over 20 armed ethnic insurgent groups in the 1990s. They are, he cites a source as saying, better at parades and showing off their new uniforms and guns than in combat! He further states that lacking in training and experience, they were mowed down by KIA guerrillas in the major battles that had followed a breakdown of the ceasefire in June 2011. The Tatmadaw had to withdraw its infantry and depend on heavy artillery and attacks by helicopter gunships and aircraft.\nThe Tatmadaw suffers from low morale and desertions. The opposition, however, is unlikely to be able to oust it from power in the foreseeable future. They lack numerical strength besides heavy artillery, tanks and aircraft, which is almost impossible for them to procure now. Without these, they will not be able to win large battles in the plains.\u00a0 On its part, the Tatmadaw is losing control over increasingly large areas. Its inability to prevent the assassination \u2014 at the rate of more than one a day \u2014 of village ward administrators appointed by it, clearly indicates this. We thus have a scenario in which the junta and opposition forces are increasingly unable to defeat each other and the entire country is a contested area where economic activity is disrupted and civil war conditions prevail with guerrilla and terrorist action countering State repression. There will be more desertions and discontent within the Tatmadaw as its war against its own people continues. The odds are against it in the long run.\n(The author is Consulting Editor, The Pioneer.

The Constitution\u2019s Tenth Schedule, inserted in 1985 and amended in 2003, hasn\u2019t really killed the market for legislature members. It\u2019s just made the reserve price higher. Some argue the law must be made even tougher. Others say the law kills intra-party debate. Some MPs, in fact, bemoan the inability to have principled dissent from the party line because of the disqualification threat. They cite problematic disqualification criteria like voting against a party whip. What should be done? Keep the law but clear the muddle.\nFirst, the law\u2019s provisions give no time frame for taking decisions and are generally badly drafted. Second, speakers and governors aren\u2019t neutral umpires. Third, courts have also muddied waters with differing interpretations. In Maharashtra, 16 random Sena rebel MLAs received disqualification notices though the Shinde faction had crossed the two-third threshold to evade disqualification. This reveals weaknesses in the anti-defection law. It was a clear attempt to break a \u201clegitimate\u201d rebellion by reducing the rebel contingent\u2019s numbers. Sometimes punishment is quick, as in 2019, when the Karnataka speaker disqualified 17 Congress-JD(S) MLAs despite their resigning house membership. He also overreached by barring them for the assembly\u2019s tenure, which the Constitution doesn\u2019t prescribe. At other times, proceedings have been inexplicably slow, for example, against AIADMK rebels in Tamil Nadu and Congress defectors in Manipur and Madhya Pradesh.\nThen there are confusions created by the likes of the 2016 SC judgment that restored a Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh, though rebels who had crossed over to People\u2019s Party of Arunachal under Kalikho Pul met the two-third threshold. Sometimes verdicts are delayed, defanging the law. Tenth Schedule raised the bar on defections. But Parliament, presiding officers and courts must create a more elegant version of it.\n\n",

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in the 1970s passed without politics and was amended for the better in 2021. But it\u2019s the practice and add-ons to the law that are the problem.\nA UN Population Fund report estimates that around eight women in India die every day because of unsafe abortions, and between 2007-11, 67% of abortions were classified as unsafe. It is among the top three causes of maternal death. Unsafe abortions are far higher among poor and marginalised populations. As for the law, the original MTP Act did not require a board of medical practitioners. They evolved out of judicial interventions \u2013 even though the Supreme Court has noted that it deprives women of reproductive freedom, which is a dimension of the right to personal liberty.\nThis medical board is infeasible in rural areas, given the lack of gynaecologists or radiologists and indeed, most healthcare professionals. A recent study found an 84.2% shortfall of OB-gyns in rural north India, and a 57.2% shortfall in south India. All of this becomes more of a systemic hurdle given the still-present stigma around reproductive issues, deterring women from seeking safe abortions.

        "full_article": "Here's an image that will likely be seared into our memory for long: a teacher being forced to wear a garland of shoes around his neck. Watching the grainy video that surfaced on YouTube, you could almost mistake him for a leader as he emerged from a building, flanked by police, with his pressed hands high in the air, as if to greet waiting crowds\u2026 except it was not. Except the police there were just dummies. Except the crowds outside gathered to witness his ultimate humiliation.\nMoments like this can be strangely evocative. In 2008, when an Iraqi journalist threw a shoe in the direction of a US president, it came to represent the pent-up anger of a nation for an unjust war that the US had imposed on it. Pent-up anger was again at work when vindictive crowds in Narail sought to recreate that moment, and it was no coincidence that their target was a Hindu. Regardless of the contrasting symbolism of shoes, enabling heroism in one instance and villainy in another, moments like this, once you see them, are hard to unsee.\nWhat was Swapan Kumar's crime? He tried to save a student, also a Hindu, who wrote a Facebook post in support of Nupur Sharma, a now-suspended leader of India's BJP who had made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad. This made ideal fodder for their tormentors whose anger at a faraway enemy was, until that point, restricted to helpless outbursts on social media.\nBut if we're being honest, many things had to go wrong for a moment this disturbing to be born. Regardless of the communal undertone, it was actually the result of a complex interplay of several factors including the rise of the Muslim Right and shrinking space for diversity, a general anti-India feeling, crumbling of democratic institutions, and moral decadence in a society where long-cherished values \u2013 like respect for teachers or elders \u2013 are being playfully tossed about. Can we address one without addressing the other?\u00a0\nSwapan Kumar Biswas, who has been in hiding since that day, later admitted that after learning what was about to happen, he felt like committing suicide to save himself from the impending humiliation. \"But I couldn't do it thinking of my three children, my wife and my mother,\" he said. In hindsight, he would consider himself \"lucky\" to have come out of it alive. In India's Rajasthan, not long after, a tailor was beheaded purportedly for a social media post supporting Nupur Sharma. This debate that has caused so much outrage and counter-outrage simply refuses to be over, in yet another example of the deepening polarisations across the subcontinent.\u00a0\nBut should we be happy that the worst was averted in our case, or sad that even such humiliation is somehow not tragic enough? Robbed of their dignity, can teachers do what they have been historically expected to do? While any teacher can be in trouble in a vicious, lawless climate, minority teachers have had a particularly rough go of it lately, especially when the allegation is \"hurting religious sentiments\". Before Swapan Kumar, we had Amodini Paul, Hriday Mondal, Pabitra Kumar Roy, Shyamal Kanti Bhakta, etc. Last week, Utpal Kumar Sarkar was beaten to death by a student apparently incensed by his disciplinary measures. After that, the University Teachers' Network demanded an end to attacks on teachers.\nA fair demand, of course. But moments of grief should not distract us from the wider issues at play here.\nLet's face it. Teachers are being attacked not because they are teachers, nor are minority teachers the only ones subjected to the modern-day Inquisition, as evidenced, this Friday, by the brutalisation of Prof Ratan Siddique and his family. But there seems to be a narrow, ahistorical sense of victimhood, an illusion that things happen in a vacuum, isolated from other, larger developments. Journalists, political activists, rights defenders and social reformers have all felt singled out at different times. The truth is, in an environment where intolerance is encouraged from the highest seats of power, anyone using\u00a0their conscience or not toeing the line is fair game.\nIf there is an innate vulnerability in all this, it is the minority status in a majoritarian tyranny. This is as true in India/Pakistan as in Bangladesh. Islamophobic abuse in one country can result in Hinduphobic abuse in another. There are historical precedents going back decades that show how such reactions have been reciprocated, often with devastating consequences. When majoritarian emotions run high, minorities make easy targets. So in India, they tell Muslims and immigrants to go to Pakistan/Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, they tell Biharis and Hindus to go to Pakistan/India. The cycle keeps repeating itself. It's like we've never really come out of our collective Partition trauma.\nBut it is possible to defend one's faith or guard against assaults on religious sentiments without condoning violence. It is possible to consider Islamophobia immoral without making it illegal. Unfortunately, despite having the garb of a secular polity, our laws, most notably the Digital Security Act, make \"hurting religious sentiments\" a punishable offence. Often, though, those are used to serve majoritarian interests and, as in case of people like the Narail student, as a tool to calm frayed nerves.\nIt's like correcting a wrong with another wrong, only it doesn't work. Forget the right to freedom of speech. By enacting such laws and still letting zealots have their satisfaction before the law is allowed to intervene, we're basically trying to force-stop all ideological debates. We're so invested in the short-term gain of such tactics that we fail to realise that matters of the heart cannot be resolved by force, legal or physical. Our ideological differences will perhaps never go away, but we can learn to sit together and find a way through compromise.\nThe Narail incident shows how this simple wisdom is getting harder to follow with the whole state apparently set on a collision course with reason, civility and justice. Increasingly, police are indistinguishable from the criminals they're supposed to deal with; politicians are openly stoking hatred and divisions to serve vested interests; democratic institutions are run on an exploit-first-serve-later basis; and the judiciary is either ineffective or irrelevant or actively enabling a culture of impunity. A suffocating environment prevails in nearly every sector because of the corrupting influence of politics.\nThere is no one villain, or one victim, in the Swapan Kumar saga. All of good had to fail for all of bad to be successful. We need to fix this state of affairs before we have a chance of fixing how teachers are being treated.\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay is an assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The first couple of days of the Padma Bridge's opening was chaotic, hilarious, tragic and outright ridiculous.\nAs I was rummaging through social media, and listening to the interviews that our colleagues from Munshiganj sent, I saw \u2013 as I guess almost all of us did \u2013 grotesque renditions of absurd actions from typical Bangladeshis.\nDespite all of these being illegal and dangerously unsafe, they broke fences, they stopped and got off everywhere on the bridge and made TikTok videos doing I-don't-know-what-that-is-even poses. Overspeeding killed two; some urinated on the bridge; some performed namaz. Then there was a guy who, after a good beating from the police, said with a broad smile that if he couldn't get onto the Padma Bridge, his heart would've shattered (the original Bangla version \"Koilja faitta moirai jaitam\" is way funnier). And then there was a 30-something woman saying, \"I always saw this bridge on Facebook and TV and everyone in the village was coming here. So, I got into a pickup truck too.\"\nWait.\nI think there's an actual glimmer of awe in the awkward and shy gaze of this woman. This was perhaps an actual experience of a lifetime for her. And, perhaps, inside all of those reckless bikers, rowdy pickup groups, political-bandana troupes, that girl who swam to see the prime minister, and that father-and-son duo with hilarious haircuts, there is a cathartic emotion of experiencing a monumental spectacle.\nAnd, why wouldn't it be such? The Padma Bridge is one of the most magnificent engineering marvels of the modern world \u2013 one of the greatest accomplishments of Bangladesh. And I guess no one in this country could remain unaware of each and every step of this megastructure's construction: from the first false accusations and erecting pillars one by one, to the grand opening of the new vital line of our riverine flatland.\nSo, was it surprising that people swarmed to the Padma Bridge?\nAlongside all breeds of media and corporations jumping on board the hype train, and those songs about Swapner Padma Shetu, the government even issued a toll-free service for 18 bridges on the inauguration day of Padma Bridge so that people could easily come to the ceremony.\nWas it at all surprising, then, that there would be mayhem on that day? That the crowd would disregard civility and break the law?\nBangladesh is now starving for public spaces and communal experiences. There is an alarming deficit of open theatres, playing fields, parks, lakes \u2013 anything recreational where the citizens can visit, create shared memories, spend a solitary evening, and grow a sense of belonging with the community, or even understand the concept of communal good. How can they know that if they do not have the civil decency to take care of public properties, all of us would be affected in the long run?\nIn Dhaka, and in most of the big cities in the country, this generation has lived the entirety of their lives inside rapid and scattered urbanisation, in absurd concrete labyrinths. The indoors are congested, isolating, barely liveable; and the outside is chaotic, filthy, and life-threatening. There's scarcely any place to take an idle breath, enjoy the moment, and have an anxiety-free engagement with the environment. Living here means scavenging, annexing whatever one can find.\nEncounters with the community mostly result in interpersonal power negotiations, or what I'd like to call a \"hedam culture.\" Suppose, you are to cross the road; in that very moment, a car and you enter in a hedam show-off of who has the stronger guts. If you have more hedam, the car will (hopefully) stop to let you cross, and if you don't, well, forget about ever crossing the road (or please take the nearest foot overbridge if there's one around).\nThis phenomenon is present in all aspects of our society \u2013 urban and rural. The laws seem different if you have a big car, are a powerful person or even pretend to know someone in the government. If you have bribes to offer, you are exempted from hassles. If you have political affiliations, you can beat up someone or secure a bed in the hospital. The mass never encountered absolute universality of law, and many distrust the law enforcement.\nSo, in this context, would it be surprising if the people regarded regulations as challenges to conquer, rather than as acts of communal duty?\nThey felt triumphant on the Padma Bridge after they elbowed ahead of the crowd, outran the police, ran across the road between two swishing trucks, completed an overtake, did not wear a helmet, unbolted some nuts, sneaked in without paying toll fees, and so on.\nThen there's those TikTokers and social media addicts. Is it normal whatever in this bizarre world they were doing? Well, to a surprisingly great degree, yes. The world is now finding new realities and new connections in the virtual realm. Under surveillance capitalism, with powerful devices in hand, and wondrous algorithms controlling our thoughts and actions, the youths have become virtual citizens. And every part of the world is trying to make sense of this whirlwind. (And governments, celebrities and companies are jumping on this train, because now here's where the money, data and power is.)\nEspecially in our society, where physical spectacles are non-existent and public spaces are repulsive, youths are leaning more towards the communities in the virtual world that taps into their fantasies for extreme machismo, the ultimate hedam, the hoarded extravagances, the grand spectacles. And they, too, crave for a spectacular place to shoot a video.\nAnd the Padma Bridge is one of the very few physically grand spectacles in this country. Of course, Padma Bridge is a functional structure, not a tourist destination. But how many non-functional megastructures do we have in our country? And functional or not, this bridge is euphoric to stare at, to go across. And through this mere functional structure, millions of lives will be changed. Even Durga and Apu came to see the new rail track in Pather Panchali, or those Dhakaiyas in the photograph from the 70s who went in hundreds and just stood there on a foot overbridge because it was something new.\nI'm not saying everything that people did on the Padma Bridge is acceptable, nor is the way this society is functioning. But did the two days of madness come out of the blue? We all knew. We were waiting for something to laugh at, something to gasp at, something to ridicule. And we felt triumphant saying, \"I told you so!\", \"Typical (uncivilised) Bangladeshis!\"\nWhen we say something like \"typical Bangladeshis,\" we somehow place ourselves in a higher position \u2013 like we are not typical Bangalees, we are civil, we have common sense, we'd never do that. They did that. They are ridiculous. This is the narrative that almost all those who hold credibility in our society put out, or at least cradle inside: journalists, policymakers, online celebrities \u2013 the educated bunch. With this, we are negating the voice and experience of the majority of the population. But have we ever thought that, if the law, the civilised narrative, the streets, the city, the new Padma Bridge alienates them, if beating them is a public spectacle, if ridiculing them is a national event, then they would, too, regard all things \"civil\" as alien, as not-their-headache, or at least an entity to struggle against?\nI confess that I, too, am using this \"us-and-them\" dichotomy. Let's be honest \u2013 the majority of the readers of this article are privileged; we are civil, we know what dichotomy or grotesque means (or at least have the sense to Google it); we don't do these unmindful activities; we keep our air-conditioned offices clean. We don't flock to Padma Bridge in extreme heat and sweat. We go to restaurants where the interiors are nice, maybe to a tourist destination or a foreign country. (Except when some Marvel movie is released or a new branch of Domino's opens. Then it's worth going crazy.)\nBut if we, and I'd like to believe the organisers, had the slightest hunch that this kind of chaos could have happened, that there'd be TikTokers trying to make videos, that people would never completely maintain the law on their own, why is it only them who are persecuted, ridiculed, or held accountable?\nAll of these could have been taken into account; there could have been a drive to effectively create awareness, make people understand the situation and maintain regulations accordingly, and of course facilitate the need for a public spectacle. But were these addressed properly?\nThe Padma Bridge is one of the firsts of many functional megastructures to be opened to the public in the next few years. Maybe next time, instead of laughing at the situation, we can refrain from reducing the people to mere objects of ridicule, and try to understand why this is happening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNaimul Alam Alvi is senior production executive in Star Multimedia.\n",

        "full_article": "People tend to believe in progress. As the decades advance, we become more civilised. We expand important freedoms, like voting rights. We expand safety nets and other benefits so that people don't have to live in horrific poverty. We learn from the mistakes of the past and move steadily towards a better future.\nExcept that time and time again, some events prove otherwise. Consider the recent US Supreme Court case overturning 49 years of a legal precedent. Women who have been raped (including victims of incest), whose birth control method failed, or who just made a mistake, will now be forced (depending on which state they live in and how much money they have) to carry a pregnancy to term and deliver a baby they perhaps cannot afford to raise and/or did not want. Girls will drop out of school and young women out of university, some never to return. Some women will be unable to work to provide for their families. Many will be physically as well as mentally damaged: pregnancy complications disable 50,000 Americans each year. And given that the US ranks 55th in maternal deaths (the highest among wealthy countries and the only one where the rate is rising), many women will die. Women who have miscarriages will be suspected of murder.\nAs for the men who impregnate them? If they care about the woman, they too will suffer. If they are rapists, they get off scot-free.\nThese very same politicians offer cynical responses to the lack of exceptions for the victims of rape. Greg Abbott, governor of Texas, says he will end rape. This despite Texas having the highest number of rapes in the country. Other politicians falsely claim that rape does not cause pregnancy.\nNow, you might be thinking: What about those poor unborn children? Sure, the rights of women have been turned back by decades, but foetuses finally have gained rights. Yet, even the Vatican has pointed out the hypocrisy of being against the issue of abortion, but not elsewhere. The same people who are outlawing abortion think it's fine for teenagers to buy assault weapons, for children to be murdered in schools, for people not to have access to the support they need to have a healthy pregnancy and delivery, or for children to thrive. Really want to save babies? How about addressing the infant mortality rate, where the US ranks 50th in the world, and 33rd out of 36 OECD countries? Want fewer abortions? Improve access to sex education and modern birth control. And why do they care about the unborn more than about a 12-year-old girl who has been raped and now must endure a pregnancy and potentially deadly delivery?\nPro-life is really pro-forced birth. It's misogyny.\nAnd the majority of Americans disagree. Depending on how you ask the question, 61-71 percent support legal abortion.\nSo how did we get here? As I've written before in these pages, we cannot take democracy for granted. The explosion of social media has created an unprecedented danger: vast amounts of misinformation convincing people not to wear masks, not to get vaccinated, that the 2020 election in the US was stolen from the rightful winner, and that an attack on the Capitol was thus justified. That the climate crisis is a hoax. That not pollution, not guns, not the climate crisis, but transgender people are the greatest threat to society.\nRepublican presidents who lost the popular vote appointed unqualified justices to the Supreme Court, who lied under oath and are now acting based on their personal prejudices and the whims of their corporate friends. And the majority of Americans are powerless to do anything about it. Watching the protests and the creative signs (\"You didn't like wearing a mask, imagine being forced to have a baby\") is gratifying, but also depressing in its futility.\nI can only hope that the absurd lengths to which this court is going, the fact that it has lost its credibility, and that the majority of Americans disagree with many of its decisions, means that positive change will happen eventually.\nMeanwhile, this all serves as a useful lesson not to be overly optimistic about the march of progress. Our modern, comfortable lives have created deadly pollution, mass extinctions, and the climate crisis. We cannot solve these problems without acknowledging that the modern is not always better, that sometimes civilisations move in the wrong direction and then collapse, and that the bulwark of democracy and civilisation is active, involved citizens.\n\u00a0\nDebra Efroymson\u00a0is the executive director of the Institute of Wellbeing, Bangladesh, and the author of \"Beyond Apologies: Defining and Achieving an Economics of Wellbeing.\"\n",

        "full_article": "In a popular TV ad, a jet set businessman yells at an airport steward, \"Do you know who I am?\" The steward takes a sip of her tea and announces, \"Ladies and gentlemen, here's someone who doesn't know who he is. Can anyone help?\" The hot-air balloon of authority with which the passenger wanted to garner respect gets deflated by the steward's sharp wit. The crowd laughs; the man soon loses his face and disappears. The message is simple: respect is not a one-way street. If one expects respect to pay dividends, then one must invest in a social relational calculus.\nThe man in suit demanded preferential treatment. In a bygone era, a branded suit, watch or a peg of whiskey would have conjured respect and made him \"special.\" In a bygone era, professional markers like the chalk and duster of a teacher, the wig of a judge, the apron of a doctor or the pen of a journalist would have garnered respect. The respect dynamics is changing in tandem with the ever-evolving society.\nIs it good or bad? Rather, the question is: What is good? Being respectful is good, while the absence of respect for others is bad. A man cannot simply approach someone in a threatening voice to demand service. There are norms and etiquettes. Respect is a means to an end. For instance, teachers earn their respect through years of dedication to their studies and students and after fulfilment of other social concerns related to their profession. Then again, a novice teacher earns respect as an end in itself by joining the legacy of moral underpinnings associated with his profession.\nThe recent spate of attacks on teachers by individual students or certain groups made many of us revisit the very notion of respect for teachers. True to its Latin root, respicere, the word \"respect\" literally wants us \"to look back at.\" While reflecting on the attacks, most think that we have regressed from this idealist state where a teacher was once revered. A teacher beaten to death with a cricket stamp by an aggrieved student in front of his students and colleagues is the nadir of morality. A teacher being forced to wear a garland of shoes allegedly for discipling his students is a sign of decadence. A teacher assaulted before being thrown into jail for discussing evolution in class is a sign of regression.\nMost opinion pieces and vlogs share a view that teaching is a \"respectable\" profession. As an educator, it pampers my ego to see many even quoting Kader Newaz's poem, in which the Emperor of Delhi Alamgir chided his son for not scrubbing the feet of his teacher with his own hand. Some even cited the anecdotal references to show the importance Bangabandhu and his daughter had given to their respective teachers. The sad reality is that, when it comes to career choices, teaching does not top the list. I think explaining the attack on teachers as a sign of moral degradation involves a false premise that paints a rosy picture of teaching and learning. The myth of teaching as a noble profession needs to be dispelled if we are to diagnose the social ills responsible for the attack on teachers.\nBy a strange coincidence, the victims in most of these recent cases belong to the minority sect. This gives rise to further speculations and suspicions. Some focus on the religious identities of the victims to detect a systematic pattern to distrust the moralist position that pits the teachers against their students. The general sentiment of the commentators includes the waning respect towards teachers and elders in general, the lack of \"proper\" and ethical education in our young adults. The list skateboards to touch cultural anthropology on one rim and political economy on the other.\nSince the perpetrators are all young adults, it will perhaps be useful to focus more on the intragroup dynamics. The tendency to explain the problem from our worldview in which we expect our current student pool to behave like \"Emperor Alamgir's son\" will not yield any result, especially if we keep on superimposing our values on theirs. We need to remember that we are dealing with the first generation of students who have not known a world without the internet. They know that Google knows a lot more than their human teachers. They do not need to rely on a teacher or ascribe her or him with a power position like their previous generation.\nA recent survey by Stanford University discerns the major traits of the current generation. This is the generation that believes in instant gratification and expects praise for everything. They are not interested in following the footsteps of their predecessors as they believe that they alone understand the complexity of their own lives and situation. They are not interested in criticism or being disciplined for their wrongs. They believe that nobody is special. As a father of a millennial, I know how we do a disservice to the young ones by comparing the world in which we grew up to remind them of the way they should behave.\nThe attack on teachers is a criminal act, and it should be treated as such. But I do not see why we should make it profession-specific. I do insist on introducing mutual respect as an institutional norm not only in education, but also in other sectors. Respect needs to be cultured as a desired and valued principle. It needs to be promoted as something that entails a relational appreciation from those \"others.\" Instead of pitting teachers against students, we need to work on intragroup dynamics, if we really want to see changes and earn mutual respect.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Liberal Arts Banladesh (ULAB).\n\n",

        "full_article": "While girls' enrolment in schools at the primary and secondary levels has been pretty good in recent years, the picture is quite different in case of college, degree and master's level education. According to latest data by the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (Banbeis), girls' enrolment rate starts falling at the college level, and the curve keeps dropping from there on. While they accounted for 53.57 percent of total enrolment at the 9th and 10th grades, their enrolment at the graduation level was only 43.80 percent. This declining trend is concerning, to say the least, and needs immediate attention from the policymakers and other stakeholders.\nWhile poverty and child marriage are generally considered major obstacles in the way of girls, sexual harassment is another impediment that slows or halts their progression to college and university level education. Moreover, a lack of women-friendly public transports and absence of girls' dormitories in the majority of our higher educational institutions contribute to the situation.\nIn poor households, parents often consider girls as a burden, and when it comes to sending their children to colleges and universities, it is the boys that usually get preference. Thus, while girls outnumber boys at the primary and secondary levels, their numbers dramatically fall after that. The correlation between poverty and early marriage becomes clear when you consider that 51 percent of young women in Bangladesh are married before their 18th birthday, according to Unicef. A majority of these girls cannot continue education after marriage.\nThere is then the issue of safety. Since many girls from rural areas have to travel a long distance to go to schools or colleges, they often face sexual harassment on the way and even inside public transports. Most colleges and universities neither have their own transportation system nor dormitories to support accommodation of girl students, which could save them from a lot of trouble. Thus, there is a growing sense of insecurity among parents, and it doesn't help either that the state of law enforcement is generally poor. The result is devastating not just for the girls, but for the country as well. Lack of work opportunities for female graduates is another deterring factor.\nThese barriers must be addressed if we want to reap the full benefit of education and educated women for our society. We urge the government and all relevant agencies and institutions to take note of the above situation. They must take measures to enable and facilitate girls' education up to the tertiary level.\n",

        "full_article": "It's been two years since the closure of 25 jute mills operated by Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) and the layoff of about 25,000 workers involved with them. This effectively marked the end of our state-run jute sector. How have the workers been faring since then? Although there has been no extensive research of the aftermath of the closure, a report by The Daily Star shows that promises made then are yet to come to fruition, to the detriment of both workers and this once-storied industry.\nThe report, based on a recent visit to at least four mills in Khalishpur, Khulna, highlights how some former workers have been passing their days in hardship, having tried other professions without success. The entire area looks like a \"haunted\" space, and there was no sign of activity with regard to the promised modernisation and reopening of mills under private or public-private arrangements.\nOne former substitute worker, now selling vegetables, detailed his struggles after losing his job of 23 years and being displaced from the workers' colony. He got only Tk 1,10,000 and no other benefits. Workers were promised due wages and benefits within \"the quickest possible time\", along with chances of retraining and reemployment when the mills are reopened. Whatever happened to those promises? So far, according to an official estimate, 14,351 workers out of 14,996 from the seven closed mills in Khulna got a golden handshake of Tk 1,352 crore (out of Tk 1,569 crore), while 13,339 substitute workers out of 14,078 had been given Tk 105 crore (out of Tk 109 crore). Apparently, strange as it may seem, confusion over name spellings halted payment to some workers.\nWhatever the case, we're yet to have a full picture of the dues owed or paid to jute workers, not just in Khulna\u00a0but in all the zones. There are reasons to doubt whether those would be paid in full or soon enough, given the history of exploitation of jute workers in Bangladesh. The predicament of laid-off workers, in simple terms, was caused by years of corruption, mismanagement and lack of vision by those running the sector. Will they ever be held accountable? Moreover, payment of dues was meant to be only part of the solution. What progress, if any, has been made in terms of the plan to reopen the mills after modernisation and reemploy former workers as promised?\nThe government must answer these questions and take better care of the workers. It should come up with an action plan about reopening all closed mills. We already have much of the physical infrastructure needed. If properly equipped with modern machinery and run with a vision, they can be a game-changer for Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "The central bank on Thursday last raised the key policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.50 per cent. Nearly a month back, it had upped the rate for the first time in a decade. It also hiked the LC (letter of credit) margin for some non-essential items from 75 per cent to 100 per cent. The stance of the monetary policy for 2022-23, announced by the BB's outgoing Governor, Fazle Kabir on the same day, is thus clear; it wants to contain the inflationary pressure on the economy and make the exchange rate stable. While doing so, the BB wishes to maintain its pro-growth posture and help generation of employment opportunities. Goals under the given circumstances have been rightly set, but achieving those might prove daunting. Undoubtedly, inflation remains the top worry for people responsible for managing the country's economy. The rate of inflation, according to an official estimate, was 5.99 per cent in May, well over the annual target of 5.33 per cent. Scepticism, however, runs high among private think-tanks and relevant others about the official inflation estimate. They feel the rate is much higher. The uptrend in inflation is due to higher commodity prices in the international market. The surge in demand for goods and services in the post-Covid period coupled with disruption in supply created by the Russia-Ukraine war has given rise to a difficult situation. On the domestic front, the devastating floods in the country's north and northwest regions have only compounded it. The effectiveness of a single tool, such as the policy rate in containing inflation, remains in doubt. The BB in its monetary policy statement has also admitted it. That tool should have been supplemented by a hike in the lending rate which is now capped at 9.0 per cent. The private sector credit growth target set for the current financial year (FY2022-23) does point to a tightening stance of the monetary policy. Given the current state of liquidity in the banking sector, a higher policy rate and the government's plan to borrow Tk.1063 billion from the banking system would make the availability of funds for the private sector tighter. Banks are likely to press for higher deposit rates soon, which would lead to higher lending rates. The monetary policy says while being cautious and anti-expansionary, it would keep the pro-growth stance unchanged. Under a monetary policy that aims to tighten the money supply, maintenance of such a stance would not be easy. Much would, therefore, depend on the international commodity price situation. Unless the war in Europe ends, the disruption in the supply of fuels and food items and the consequent rise in their prices will persist. Implementing the MPS aim of cutting dependence on imported items by encouraging import substitution domestically might also prove difficult. Any large-scale financing to this effect will run counter to the move to contain inflation. In sum, the FY 2022-23 will be a difficult one. Many developed countries are now worried about the onset of stagflation, marked by high inflation and low growth. After the pandemic shock, this kind of development in the world economy might prove deadly even for a country like Bangladesh. The country's current account deficit would balloon further with the exchange rate volatility persisting. That is, however, the worst scenario. Hopefully, the world economy will be able to skip that.",

        "full_article": "The day the national parliament approved the budget for the fiscal year 2022-2023 (FY23), Bangladesh Bank (BB) also announced its annual monetary policy statement (MPS). It is the last MPS unveiled by Fazle Kabir, the outgoing BB governor of the central bank. After completing his two terms of six years, he will retire today. The new governor, Abdur Rouf Talukder, will take charge formally on Monday. Like his predecessor, he is also a former secretary of the finance division. The six years of Fazle Kabir, the 11th governor of Bangladesh Bank, were remarkable for various reasons. Mr Kabir was appointed as the central bank's chief on March 20, 2016, following the resignation of Dr Atiur Rahman, the 10th governor. Atiur stepped down as Bangladesh Bank governor on March 15, 2016, amid intense criticism over his mishandling of the US$101 million cyber-heist from the foreign exchange reserve of the central bank. The hackers, however, finally managed to transfer $81 million from the BB's New York Fed account that the central bank has been maintaining since 1973 to conduct its international transactions in US dollars.Thus, Kabir took charge at a critical time. During the last six years, little progress could be made towards recovering all the stolen money. However, Bangladesh managed to get back around $15 million, while the rest $66 million is yet to be recovered. The central bank filed two separate cases with two US courts in Washington and New York. Although the task of recovering the stolen money does not entirely fall within the remit of Bangladesh Bank, it has no doubt the prime role. So, Mr Kabir in that respect is leaving a rather disappointing legacy for his successor. Initially, Kabir was appointed for four years. Later, to reappoint him, the government in 2020 amended the relevant act by enhancing the age limit of the governor to 67 from 65. Thus he got an extension of two more years, drawing criticism from various quarters. Kabir used to avoid the press and virtually curbed the long practices of his predecessors' regular and direct communication with the print and the electronic media. Only on a few occasions he faced the media and the announcements of the MPS took place during some of those rare occasions. He also changed the announcement of MPS from a half-yearly event to an annual one. His first MPS was announced for the first half (July-December) of FY17. Later he announced five more half-yearly MPS and finally switched to annual MPS in FY20. The move helped him to cut the formal direct communication with the media. Since the introduction of the public announcement of the MPS in January 2006, when Dr Salehuddin Ahmed was the governor, it was a half-yearly disclosure. Kabir, however, discontinued the 14 years' trend, which ultimately raised a question about the transparency and effectiveness of the monetary policy.Theoretically, the ultimate objective of the monetary policy is to control the overall money supply to keep inflation in check and achieve sustainable economic growth. In fact, monetary policies in different countries seek to maintain price stability underpinned by sustained stable output growth in the face of internal and external shocks that are faced from time to time.' Accordingly, Bangladesh Bank is also responsible for 'attaining and maintaining price stability, high levels of production, employment and economic growth.'By using the projected real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and the targeted inflation rate, Bangladesh Bank designs its annual monetary programme with reserve money (RM) and broad money (M2) as operating and intermediate targets, respectively. The ultimate target is inflation. Thus, the success of a monetary policy mainly depends on the country's price situation, which is reflected in the rate of inflation. It is also a critical benchmark to evaluate the performance of the central bank governor. Fazle Kabir's performance in that respect is indeed dismal. During his tenure, only in FY17 and FY19 he succeeded in keeping inflation under check, below the target set in the MPS. In FY18, the annual average inflation rate stood at 5.78 per cent against the target of 5.50 per cent. In FY20, the actual inflation rate reached 5.65 per cent, breaching the target of 5.50 per cent. It was, however, the year of the Covid-19 outbreak, and like the other central banks' governors, he had little room for manoeuvring. Providing the support to keep the economic activities on track was the main challenge of that time. So, Bangladesh Bank increased the money supply, cut the policy rates, and continued the relaxed monetary stance in FY21 to support the economic rebound. The outcome is a surge in GDP growth to 6.94 per cent in the year from 3.45 per cent in FY20. At the same time, in FY21, the annual average inflation rate slightly came down to 5.56 per cent against the target of 5.40 per cent. It appears that in the growth-inflation trade-off, the outgoing governor preferred growth in line with the finance minister's stance.In the just-ended fiscal year or FY22, the last year of Kabir's governorship, inflation surged further and reached 6.0 per cent on average. His effort to cap the rate at 5.30 per cent failed. Though in developing countries like Bangladesh, the central bank is not solely responsible for curbing the relentless inflation, it needs to use its tools prudently and timely. Kabir, however, was widely handicapped. By bowing to the finance ministry's pressure, he agreed to fix deposit and lending rates at 6.0 per cent and 9.0 per cent, respectively. Thus, his space to use the policy rates was squeezed significantly. Moreover, he was not initially keen to hike the policy rates when inflation started to surge more than six months ago. He, however, maneuvered exchange rate policy and applied some restrictive measures to contain imported inflation. As inflationary pressure continued, Bangladesh Bank finally raised the repurchase agreement or repo rate on May 29, after 22 months, acknowledging the gravity of rising inflation. And it raised the rate again in the last week while announcing the MPS for the new fiscal year. By switching to a tight monetary stance without withdrawing the lending and deposit rate cap, the BB governor put his last effort into winning a battle against inflation, and his successor will undoubtedly face a tough challenge.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Few tiny tots and teenagers across the world have ever been found averse to toys. Every child likes to play with toys. Children of Bangladesh are no exception. The common toys of the country date back to the pre-Christ era, and the times even earlier. Those comprised mainly clay dolls, wooden carriages or different kinds of flute. Given the drab look of the traditional Bangladesh toys, even in the late 20th century, the news of the country's new-generation toys attracting overseas children in 2022 appears startling. Automated and semi-automated toys have been widely available at upscale markets since the 1950s. But those used to be imported from the UK. Toys made in some other developed countries have also been available in Bangladesh. However, the locally made battery-run toy cars, tanks, helicopters etc began luring the teenage boys in the later days. Those accompanied laughing and dancing dolls. The fact that the sophisticated versions of toys made in this South Asian country might one day muster the skill and technology to win over the European and American children was once a pipedream. But this disbelief has long been consigned to the past. The days of dull-looking and funnily antiquated toys are over. Who could ever fancy that the Bangladesh-made remote controlled cars, aircraft or robots would in the early 21st century occupy a dominant place in the overseas markets of the developed countries? These countries themselves have long excelled in manufacturing marvellous toys in different phases of the modern times. Their toys continued to enjoy a steady demand among children throughout the world. These countries include Netherlands, Spain, Germany, the UK, Russia, and many other toy-making European nations, Japan, Australia and the US. Of late, Indian toys have sparked demand among the middle-income nations.The entrance of Bangladesh into the international toy market as an exporter with great prospects is no unusual phenomenon. Nor is the potential exporters' impressive performance in the sector. After the start of its export activities, the initial consignments were welcomed with a kind of warmth that catapulted its world position into a comfortable trajectory. As has been forecast in June this year, the country's toy exports are expected to hover around $466.31 million by 2030. But it is hinged on the continuation of the present growth spree. As has been observed by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI), \"Bangladesh might become the world's 28th largest exporter of plastic toys if the current growth rate continues.\"Toy manufacturing and marketing necessitates meeting a lot of basic prerequisites. In fact, almost all the countries make toys to cater to the needs of their child population. These toys are mostly made in an informal sector, comprising makeshift factories in the slum areas. People having little understanding of child psychology, and the imperative of keeping them free of physical harm while at play normally run these mostly unapproved toy industries. Starting from the 20th century and all the way up to the early part of the 21st century, children's safety has been attached special emphasis while making toys. Unlike the plastic-made handy toys for toddlers, manufactured with special care for keeping them free of technical intricacies, the toys meant for older kids are not that simple. In order to make them tempting to the electronics-savvy boys and girls, the manufacturers attach many built-in devices to the toys. The toy importing countries, thus, keep a special watch on the products. They inspect minutely if there are risks of hazards in any of the imported toys. Keeping children out of harm's way while they play with toys is a special concern for them. In its goal of the toy market expansion, Bangladesh ought to lay emphasis on this aspect too.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bus owners and operators in Dhaka city have been charging the passengers fares at their will for a long time. They do not hesitate to ignore the government-set fares and charge more from the passengers. It seems there are no rules regarding fares. When you get on a bus, in most cases, transport workers will remind you that this bus belongs to the sitting service category and you will have to pay for a long distance. Even if you get down from the bus much earlier than the destination is reached, you will still have to pay the full fare. There are some buses which have set the minimum fare of Tk 20, no matter how long you will travel. During rush hours, these so-called sitting service buses turn into regular buses with people standing. Branding their service as sitting-service, gate-lock, non-stop, direct or counter service, most bus operators charge high fare even though those buses stop almost anywhere and take passengers. But when they sense that the passengers are in trouble and there is a shortage of transport, they not only charge more but also do not want to pick up passengers. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) has made it mandatory for the bus operators to hang a fare chart in their vehicles. However, no such thing can ever be seen on any bus on the city-routes. One of the facilities our students are supposed to enjoy is paying half fare. However, problems arise when students try to pay fares using 'half fair pass'. Bus operators, in most cases, charge full fare from the students by making several lame excuses. We urge the authorities concerned to look into these issues and do the needful. We have to travel on buses every day. And we no longer want to face such harassments during travels.
