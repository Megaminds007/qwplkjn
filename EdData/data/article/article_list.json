The alliance got nearly 50% of the vote share; in the Konkan, North Maharashtra and western Maharashtra regions, its vote share crossed the halfway mark. While the Mahayuti increased its vote share across all regions, the Maha Vikas Aghadi \u2014 an alliance of the Congress, the Shiv Sena Uddhav Thackeray faction and Sharad Pawar\u2019s NCP \u2014 saw its support decline across the State. The BJP alone got 132 seats, which is nearly a majority in the 288-strong Assembly, and the tally of the alliance is nearly five times that of the MVA which was limited to 50 seats for all its partners combined. The Maharashtra outcome settles several questions and opens new ones for all the players concerned, and for democracy and pluralism. The Maharashtra victory, close on the heels of that in Haryana, has restored the BJP\u2019s dominance, which appeared shaken by the outcome of the 2024 general election. The party has no immediate challenger as it has managed to mobilise religious, regional, caste and class sentiments in its favour, decimating opponents and rendering its partners irrelevant. Whoever becomes the Chief Minister, the dynamics of the alliance has been decisively transformed in the BJP\u2019s favour.The victory in Maharashtra will reinforce the authority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the BJP, notwithstanding the party\u2019s loss in Jharkhand. The marginal gains made by the Congress in the general election were not indicative of any substantive turn in politics, and the party is at a loss yet again. The Congress\u2019s clamour for a caste census and its line about the Constitution being in danger were effectively countered by the BJP. The BJP\u2019s call for Hindu consolidation had more takers, and it could paint the MVA as a platform of dominant Marathas and for Muslim appeasement. Welfare schemes, particularly cash doles for women, also worked in the Mahayuti\u2019s favour. Uddhav Thackeray has been harshly punished by the electorate for splitting with the BJP and aligning with the Congress and NCP. Sharad Pawar\u2019s political base has been eroded and his party is staring at an uncertain future. Maharashtra\u2019s provincial politics has yielded to the BJP\u2019s overarching Hindutva platform, which also has a strand of Maratha language pride and a regional iconography, for instance, in the invocation of Shivaji and V.D. Savarkar. The BJP needs to show wisdom and statesmanship in this moment of triumph.

        "full_article": "The victory in Jharkhand is an encouraging triumph not just for the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) but also the INDIA bloc parties led by the Congress, which are reeling after a massive loss in the bigger State of Maharashtra. Fashioned by the efforts of the JMM, which remains the premier party of choice for the State\u2019s tribal electorate, the victory was also made possible by the coalition partners, the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the CPI(ML)-Liberation pitching in with good performances. The cumulative adding up of the bases of these respective parties helped the JMM-led alliance earn the confidence of voters beyond seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes, as the coalition defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party in seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and non-reserved ones as well. Clearly, the arrest and subsequent release on bail of Chief Minister Hemant Soren played a role in the consolidation of support for the ruling party as the electorate did not buy into the allegations of corruption and the BJP\u2019s narrative about the government. Mr. Soren belied expectations of the BJP building on its success in the 2024 general election where its alliance won nine of the 14 constituencies in the State. The BJP had also stitched a coalition with the All Jharkhand Students Union Party (AJSUP) \u2014 which eluded it in the 2019 Assembly election \u2014 and managed to rope in former Chief Minister Champai Soren through a defection from his parent JMM. These efforts to negate the JMM\u2019s sway over tribal voters came a cropper as Mr. Champai Soren\u2019s influence was limited to his constituency and the AJSUP won only one of the 10 seats it contested.More importantly, the JMM and the INDIA bloc were successful in negating the shrill campaign led by the BJP on the manufactured issue of \u201cinfiltration of Bangladeshi immigrants\u201d into the Santhal Pargana region of northeast Jharkhand. This was a thinly veiled attempt at mobilising tribals using the agenda of Hindutva, which includes the pernicious \u201cothering\u201d of Muslims, and to drive a wedge between them and religious minorities. Santhal Pargana decisively voted for the JMM and its allies \u2014 52% of the electorate favoured the ruling coalition, the highest among all regions in the State. Mr. Soren and the JMM\u2019s ploy to negate this rhetoric as being divisive and manufactured and, instead, focusing on tribal unity, worked well. The Jharkhand victory also marks a rare triumph for a non-BJP alliance or a party in North India while being an incumbent in power. Yet, the JMM\u2019s challenges in governing one of India\u2019s poorest States in terms of per capita income, despite being a mineral rich one, will remain. The JMM government sought to focus on welfare to retain its support but it must now focus on job creation and utilising its mineral wealth efficiently.

        "full_article": "Collectors were seen choking on their fruit salads\nArt is going bananas. Literally. Your average banana is now an objet d\u2019art. Duct-taped to a wall and sold for over $6mn at Sotheby\u2019s auction, it has the art world in a tizzy. Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s work Comedian renders this humble fruit the showstopper if artworks were to catwalk. When the Italian artist first put this up at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2019, people were shocked. What you once mashed and diced, pulped and fried into chips had suddenly become a status symbol! A promotion that crowns plantains the king of produce \u2013 bananas are the apple of everyone\u2019s eye.\nThe line between crazy and arty is thinner than an over-plucked eyebrow. Marcel Duchamp\u2019s sculpture Fountain showcased a urinal; John Lennon was charmed by Yoko Ono\u2019s Ceiling Painting, which involved a ladder, when they first met at the Indica Gallery in London. The sight of a banana at eye level tends to bring out strong likes and dislikes, not to mention debates about what really constitutes art. Is this a dig at labour exploitation and unfair trade? Is it lowbrow or high emotion? Art collectors were last seen choking on their fruit salads.\nApples and grapes have their place in ancient paintings, denoting as they do temptation and decadence, but bananas are usually seen in the hands of apes. All talk of its nutritional worth and lewd use in limericks may be in the past though. The feet of slapstick comedians who routinely slip on banana peels to get a laugh are frozen mid-air. Banana splits will henceforth be served with diamond cutlery. You can probably order banana bags and banana sofas online. Already available are banana lamps, made with perfect 3D scans, to light up dull evenings. The SpaceX test flight has opted for a sticker featuring a banana holding a smaller banana, keeping in mind the \u2018banana for scale\u2019 meme. Bananas are going places.\nWhether satire, spoof, a political statement or the emperor\u2019s new clothes, Cattelan has definitely kickstarted a kind of anti-art movement, an upside-downing of what\u2019s usually considered high art. Food has long been art, but art as food? So, go out now, buy a banana from the fruit cart guy and tape it to the front door just before guests arrive. Eat it once they leave. Shh\u2026can you hear Ecuador, the largest exporter of bananas, singing? It\u2019s that song from Minions: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-nana.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Maharashtra BJP now has such bench strength that allies will get less accommodation than earlier\nAlliance achieving govt formation is what\u2019s important not who becomes CM \u2013 this is a common statement Mahayuti and MVA netas would give. Until this weekend. With the results in, obviously only Mahayuti seniors continued to be chased by the question, Kaun banega CM? Now they sang a new chorus: Party will decide. Very politic and la di da. But the cold, hard fact is quite different: Numbers will decide. BJP is so far ahead of its allies, so overwhelming is its strike rate, that anything but a BJP CM makes little sense.\u00a0\nIn his last CM stint, Devendra Fadnavis became only the second Maharashtra CM ever to complete a full five-year term. That\u2019s how volatile politics is in this state. But one volatility that should be safely counted out is rotational CMship. Actually that ship may have sunk itself across the board. Congress\u2019s attempt to manage its internal battles via this stratagem floundered in Chhattisgarh. BJP has had poor experiences with allies keeping their word on it in UP and Karnataka.\u00a0\nSure, the Eknath Shinde CM candidacy also has some legs. He has stolen the march from Uddhav as far as the weighty Balasaheb legacy is concerned. His Maratha-ness and Ladki Bahin push are also strong cards. But again, Shinde Sena\u2019s 57 seats (and NCP\u2019s 41) pale in comparison to BJP\u2019s 132. Just 13 more and BJP could have formed a govt on its own. Back in 2019, Uddhav ditched the BJP alliance because it wouldn\u2019t make him, the junior partner, the CM. In 2022, Shinde was the junior partner that BJP did accept as CM. Fadnavis accepted deputy CMship, as also another deputy CMship for Ajit Pawar. But that was the chessboard then. BJP\u2019s dependence on Sena for govt formation is near zero now. \n\n",

        "full_article": "When cash handouts help win polls, incentives for politicians to create jobs are low\u00a0\u00a0\nIncumbent Mahayuti\u2019s giant victory in Maharashtra was a sum of many parts, including driven cadres, expert booth management, hard electioneering and a well-oiled poll machinery. And, not least, its cash handouts. Mahayuti brass are crediting the \u201clandslide victory\u201d to govt\u2019s cash transfer schemes. They\u2019ve called their Ladki Bahin scheme a \u201cgame changer\u201d. In Jharkhand too, Maiya Samman scheme paid big dividends to incumbent JMM govt.\nMoney talks. Cash works. It is expected now that all political parties will attempt to outdo one another by raising the bar on the amount and coverage of such schemes. In fact, this played out within weeks in Jharkhand. In Aug, JMM govt floated a \u20b91k every month dole to women. BJP in Oct promised the same group \u20b92.1k. Soren govt jacked up the handout to \u20b92.5k payable from Dec. Populist state handouts are in reality a matter of concern, as every politician worth his salt knows. Political veterans have red flagged the cost \u2013 Ladki Bahin has a budget of \u20b946k cr for 2.4cr women that\u2019ll only go up as the amount is enhanced to \u20b92.1k a month.\nWhere the money will come from is only one half the challenge. The lasting damage is the impact on the economy. Effectively, rich electoral returns on cash transfers become a disincentive for politicians to create jobs. The jobs crisis, in Maharashtra and all-India, has remained intractable. Jobless growth has remained constant for over 15 years as has the recognition that GDP is only half the picture. The missing half is the workforce, growing by 7mn-8mn per year, and ordinary people, aka the voting people. Over 65% of India\u2019s workforce is under age 35. Underemployment is savage. Colleges churn out unemployable graduates. Instead of increasing, share of total workforce in manufacturing has declined from 12.1% in 2018-19 to 11.4% in 2023-24. Chatter is not on growing jobs, but redefining employment. Worryingly, the best brains at the top are moving overseas. Even the low-skilled are migrating given the wage gap between home and destination country for the same jobs.\u00a0\nPolitical parties have their finger on people\u2019s pulse. Their manifestos respond to income distress. But govts are failing to create opportunities. Over the last several election cycles, this has seen cash handouts hardwired into party manifestos. It\u2019s a winning formula for electoral security. But no income security has consequences for India, stuck in the low-middle-income trap.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "At the heart of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s notion of the triple transformation of human consciousness lies a unique reshaping of the Upanishadic philosophical tradition from a prism of a meaningful life-affirming philosophy. As he maps out the psychic, spiritual and supra mental dimensions of consciousness in the\u2018 Life Divine,\u2019 this idea becomes a counterpoint to the philosophical paradigm that all existence, and thereby consciousness too, is an illusion, maya.\nFor Aurobindo, this life itself is unique, for it gives an opportunity to understand, open up and realign ourselves with the Divine consciousness. The seeker has to work on his nature to become a fit instrument and a material channel for the descent of this consciousness. The concept of descent of the Divine supramental consciousness into our very physical bodies gives a unique evolutionary thrust to Aurobindo\u2019s vision, which he posited would materialise sooner than later, as nature forces us to transcend the merely physical dimension and pattern of life.\n\nThe question of consciousness was central to Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy of life and existence. Consciousness was not just a way of knowing reality but could be looked upon as something that takes the seeker beyond the human mind into a divine or cosmic dimension of reality. Echoing Hegel in mapping out the evolution of human consciousness, Aurobindo sees this phenomenal reality as expressing, but one dimension of that universal consciousness, and all layers of this consciousness synthesise in the Supermind. Aurobindo then takes it a step further and visualises the descent of the universal consciousness into the physical body as the next step in evolution.\nConsciousness is the \u201cForce of Being\u201d, Aurobindo says, not merely awareness. It is possible to \u201cseek the union of our soul of mind with universal mind, our soul of life with universal life, our soul of body with universal physical existence, consciously\u201d.\nChit Shakti, consciousness, presents itself to itself through forms and procedures of nature, and it is this Spirit pervading through matter that Aurobindo urges us to strive to know through experience. To call upon that cosmic consciousness is the true calling of every seeker, which will, in turn, give impetus to the evolutionary impulse.\nThis unique notion of the descent of cosmic consciousness, the overmind, into the manifest world through the transformation of human consciousness is at the heart of his poetic opus, \u2018Savitri\u2019, wherein he reinterprets the ancient Upanishadic story of Savitri and Satyavan, as a story of spiritual freedom from ignorance. Savitri is the instrument for descent of Divine Grace, who overcomes death, suffering and ignorance through her burning, single minded focus on bringing back Satyavan to life. This spiritual quest sets the stage for emergence of a new divinity within us, which transcends mortality.\nAurobindo then contends that the story of Savitri shows the way for the individual soul to ascend to a higher dimension of consciousness, wherein the manifest world would be revealed as a materialisation of this absolute consciousness. To be thus blessed by Divine Grace, our inner guru, like Savitri, would provide anew meaning to the here and now of existence, without which life would merely be like the theatre of the absurd, devoid of purpose and directionless.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The Daily Star (TDS): How did you transition to your new research focus on the garment sector in Bangladesh, given your previous extensive research on the prospects and implications of microloans in the country? What prompted this apparent shift from rural to urban settings in your research field?\nProf Lamia Karim (LK): I am an economic anthropologist specializing in political economy and women's labor. My primary focus lies in the anthropological dynamics surrounding women's participation in the workforce, particularly the recognition of women as visible agents within the labor market. Historically, women have engaged in informal labor within the domestic sphere, contributing to their families and supporting their husbands. For instance, a male vendor selling food in the market often relies on female family members to prepare the food. Consequently, women's labor remains both invisible and uncompensated. Feminist scholars have long advocated for the acknowledgment and inclusion of unpaid work within economic policy.\nMy interest in this field is also shaped by my personal background. I grew up in a family where women were actively engaged in professional roles; my great-aunt (my grandmother's sister) was a published poet in the 1930s, my mother's first cousin was the first female photographer in what was then East Pakistan, and my mother, along with several of her female cousins, held academic positions as professors and principals of women's colleges. Thus, the sight of women pursuing professional careers was integral to my upbringing. However, I also witnessed the labor of women hired to work in our household\u2014specifically, cooks and cleaners\u2014whose work was often regarded as a natural extension of their identity rather than as respectful employment.\nThese life experiences made me particularly interested in examining the effects of both waged and unwaged work on women and how social forces condition us to view women's work. Bangladesh is home to two significant industries that center on women's work: the microfinance sector pioneered by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus and the overseas apparel production industry. Both sectors have emerged as prominent examples of women's work as empowerment, a debatable point, within the framework of neoliberal capitalism. Therefore, I perceive my intellectual trajectory not as a shift but as a natural progression of my scholarly pursuits.\nTDS: How do you interpret the trajectory of the garment sector in Bangladesh, which originated from a global capitalist restructuring that heavily relied on exploiting cheap labor, and incidents of so many accidents eventually evolving into the primary contributor to the nation's economy? Despite witnessing a semblance of women's empowerment, how do you address the prevalent issue of widespread exploitation of women, which has unfortunately remained integral to this sector?\n\nLK: The exploitation of women's labor within the manufacturing industry has a deeply entrenched and troubling history. An examination of industrialization in 19th-century England reveals how poverty forced women, men, and children to the cotton mills of Manchester, where they endured minimal wages and horrific work conditions. A pivotal moment in labor history occurred in the United States in 1911, when the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire claimed the lives of 143 workers, in factory conditions reminiscent of what occurred at the Rana Plaza factory collapse that killed over 1,100 workers.\nBangladesh is no different. A complex web of actors\u2014including global retailers, government entities, factory owners, BGMEA, the families of these workers, and Western consumers\u2014contributes to the systemic exploitation of working-class women, thereby facilitating the extraction of labor to yield profits and affordable goods.\nThe answer to your question is also embedded in cultural attitudes. We are a very class-based hierarchical society. Upper and middle-classes tend to treat people from the lower economic strata as less than them. Many factory owners, managers, supervisors, see the workers as lower than them on the social scale, and they take it for granted that they can treat workers poorly, such as using vile language or to physically hit them. Firing workers under all sorts of fictional pretexts and defrauding them of wages is another way that workers get exploited.\nTo tackle the problem of violence against women at work, the way forward is the unionization of garment workers, a movement that remains significantly underrepresented in the Bangladeshi apparel industry. Legal NGOs and Human Rights Organizations should be watchdogs scrutinizing the factories for compliance to safety standards. The government too has a crucial role to play in supporting workers' rights. If all these actors could come together, viable change is possible.\nTDS: What have your research findings revealed about the daily experiences of women laborers in the apparel manufacturing industry? You mentioned that instead of facilitating sustainable improvements in their lives, the neoliberal economy has perpetuated precarity in their work. Could you elaborate on how this has impacted the lives of these women?\n\nLK: One is the precarity of global supply chains where workers are at the mercy of the global economy. During the pandemic for example, stores closed in the West, factories had to close in Bangladesh, making many workers lose their earnings. This dependence on the global economy is precarity at its worst manifestation because the workers who are the bottom of the supply chain do not control what happens to them. There are no safety nets to support them. Importantly, these workers do not understand how supply chains work, and how a sudden loss in demand in the US or EU will have tremendous effect on their livelihoods.\n\nIn conversation with Lamia Karim, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Oregon, Eugene, and author of Castoffs of Capital: Work and Love Among Garment Workers in Bangladesh (University of Minnesota Press, 2022), which received the Gregory Bateson Book Prize Honorable Mention 2023.\nPrecarity at the factory\u2014low wages, long hours, poor quality of housing, poor diet, abuse at the hand of factory management, is constantly compounding precarity in worker's lives. It is well-known that the wages they receive do not cover their living expenses. The women also support their extended families, by extension, another twenty million people (mothers, father, siblings) indirectly depend on their wages. They send home money for a brother's education, mother's medical expense, building a new roof, and so on. Their private lives are also precarious. Most of these women enter the workforce around the average age of fifteen. They are recent rural-to-urban migrants. They are usually brought to the city by a relative or a procurer. Most of them come to Dhaka with no prior knowledge of what it means to live in the city and how cruel and unforgiving the city can be. Many of the young women fall in love with men they meet in the city, who unbeknownst to them may already have a wife. These relationships are tragic and often involve severe domestic abuse. The men in their lives make constant demands on their wages, and if they do not hand the money over, the women are severely beaten. With no family elders, such as a father or an uncle to intercede for them, these women have to cope with these situations on their own. So, one on the one hand, they have attained certain autonomy, they earn wages, they have physical mobility, go to a movie, sit outdoors with friends and have some fuchka, met someone romantically, all the things that would be denied to them in rural society. On the other hand, they make many difficult decisions on their that often gets them into serious domestic precarity.\nTDS: In your research, you explored the private lives of garment workers, delving into their intimate spheres of love, marriage, and romance. This perspective offers a novel way to understand them beyond the confines of economic analysis. How do you perceive the generational shifts among workers in this sector, from the macroscopic view to the individual human experience?\n\nLK: I wanted to understand the attitudinal differences between older and younger women workers. The older women entered in the 1990s, some even in 1980s, at very low wages. All the older women shared a similar background. They came from landless and impoverished families. They described the before and after of coming to work as \"Before I could not eat, now I can eat, before I could not send my child to school, now I can send my child to school, before I lived in a house with a leaking roof, now I live in a house with a roof that does not leak.\" The women had basic literacy of class three or five in a rural school. They could not read their hiring documents, making it easy for factory managers to fire them by making them sign on a document they could not read. Most of the older women came as married women with children, but their husbands had abandoned them. The women had to raise the children on their own. By the time they entered the factory, they already had many familial responsibilities. These women saw themselves as poor women whose goal was to get their children educated and moved up the economic social ladder. After twenty plus years of working, these older women's bodies and hearts were broken.\nThe younger women were entering with higher levels of education, often between class eight to ten. They could read their hiring documents. The younger were mostly single when they came from the village. They also came from poor families, but they entered factory work at higher wages. They would buy new salwar-kameezes, go to the beauty parlors to get their eyebrows threaded, openly hang out with their boyfriends. They did not have children to take care of. Familicidal responsibilities were less burdensome for them. Some of them told me that they would delay marriage because they wanted to experience life and make some money. These younger women exercised more sexual autonomy. They saw themselves as moving up the social ladder. They always called themselves middle-class and they would call the factory \"office\" and not karkhana. They eschewed the term kormojibi or sromik.\nTo the younger garment factory workers, belonging to the middle class signaled the exit from their poverty-stricken rural backgrounds. Factory employment had moved them up the economic scale. Similarly, taking the label of middle class set them apart from the poorer people they encountered in the city. As garment workers they were not like the women who worked as day laborers, cleaners, maids, cooks, and the like. They worked in brick buildings, operating industrial machines. that endowed them with a sense of pride and achievement when compared to their poorer rural and urban counterparts. They were the new symbol of \"Made in Bangladesh\" that is youthful, shiny, and hopeful. The combination of these factors gave them a sense of a new world of opportunities and their entrance into middle-class status.\nTDS: Could you share insights from your conversations with the 16 interlocutors who are older or have aged out of the workforce about their initial aspirations? Additionally, could you discuss the differences observed in their ultimate realities, particularly regarding the changes in life after reaching a mature state within the garment sector?\n\nLK: The sixteen older women, between the ages of 45-55 approximately, I interviewed had earned a limited form of sovereignty over their lives. They left abusive spouses, stood up to factory management when they faced workplace injustices, and tried to create better lives for their children through education. For these factory women, class mobility was a cherished goal that they saw as worth sacrificing for. Their goal was to help their children reach the new middle class that was unfolding through industrial capitalism in Bangladesh. Yet only two sons of the older female workers had made it to the new middle class, one as an accountant at a factory, and the other as an IT technician, the rest of their children had either entered the garment workforce or they were in other low-paying jobs as vendors, shop-keepers, guards. These older women recognized the limits of upward mobility in a deeply hierarchical society due to their lack of social capital. As one older woman said to me, \"My son has received his bachelor's degree. He wants to work in a government office, but I do not have the contacts to help him. He has ended up working at a store.\" But their voices remained laced with traces of hope\u2014if not for them, then for their children.\nThese older women entered the workforce when wages were very low, so they had little savings by the time they were forced out of factory work. They suffered from poor health. Their eyesight, fingers, arms were affected from long-term factory work. Kidneys were affected from not drinking water at work to avoid taking toilet breaks, something frowned upon by line supervisors. Many of them suffered from lung infections from breathing the air inside factories that is full of debris of clothing. Many workers were provided masks, but workers did not wear them because they felt hot and uncomfortable. It was a zero-sum game for these women.\nTDS: Have you noticed any significant changes in the trade union movement or apparent enhancements in safety measures within this sector following the Rana Plaza incident?\nLK: The trade union movement, still insignificant compared to the scale of the workforce, has become more visible after the Rana Plaza factory collapse. After the accident, the global retailers and EU did not have a fig leaf to cover their complicity in ignoring the safety conditions in the factories they were sourcing from. EU, Canada, Australia, and US to a lesser degree, became vocal about the right to unionize and the safety accords were written and implemented, with their many limitations. Trade union leaders have told me that now they have a voice with factory owners, BGMEA, and the government. This is an ongoing struggle.\nI did not inspect factories since that was not what I was doing. Safety measures vary across factories. There are factory owners who are forward looking and want to improve work conditions; there are others who think of workers as disposable bodies. The answer to your question requires investigative journalism.\nTDS: As automation advances, Bangladesh's impending graduation from the category of least developed countries (LDCs) looms, coinciding with a gradual decline in women's participation in the sector. What are your thoughts on the garments industry as a whole, and what potential changes, both minor and monumental, do you envision that could reshape the prevailing landscape?\nLK: With the garment sector accounting for Bangladesh's largest export, generating $47 billion in 2023 and employing approximately four million workers whose earnings sustain the Bangladeshi economy. To effect meaningful change, it is essential to improve wages, enhance workplace safety, and provide accessible housing, healthcare, childcare, and education for their children. Factory owners resist these improvements, citing pressure from Western buyers who are reluctant to increase costs.\nBangladesh will face increased competition from other LDCs. The Ethiopian government sought to attract Western buyers by guaranteeing wages as low as $22 per month for workers. Conversations with several garment factory owners regarding the potential loss of business to competing countries revealed a prevailing belief in their logistical advantages. However, as evidenced by the presence of garments labeled \"Made in Ethiopia\" in H&M stores, capital will invariably pursue profit at the expense of workers unless robust unionization efforts are undertaken. Such collective action represents a crucial avenue for genuine empowerment and systemic change.\nI would recommend diversification from the garment industry to other sectors, and to invest in the domestic market. Here I am arguing for import substitution, so we are not wholly dependent on the vicissitudes of the global economy. While China has transitioned from low-wage apparel manufacturing to high-value sectors such as semiconductor processing, Bangladesh remains stuck on its garment industry. The nation's economic landscape necessitates a forward-looking approach, emphasizing diversification away from apparel manufacturing and the training of workers for more sustainable employment opportunities. But there is an intangible paradox here between the welfare of workers and the welfare of capital. The logic of capitalism is to chase lowest production costs across the globe, devouring the poor and dispossessed on its journey. To harness unfettered capitalism, one needs a systemic change to the economic structure. I do not see that on the horizon.\nMy goal in writing Castoffs of Capital was to humanize these women, to glimpse their world through their eyes, as they graciously allowed me into their lives. I envisioned a future where a Western consumer, poised to purchase a simple tee-shirt or a pair of jeans, could not only see the garment but also feel the pulse of those who made it. I wanted them to visualize the women, to empathize with their stories, and to reflect on the profound consequences of their consumer choices. In this way, I hoped to weave a deeper understanding of the interlocking human tapestry that sustains our global economy.\nMy heartfelt thanks to Kormojibi Nari who assisted me with the research on older workers.\nThe interview was taken by Priyam Paul of The Daily Star\n",

        "full_article": "It is encouraging to learn that the police may cease using lethal weapons and lead pellets for crowd control. We fully support this drive as there is no justification for the police to use lethal force against ordinary citizens. Such actions, however, were rampant during the tenure of the ousted Awami League regime. During the July uprising, excessive use of lethal weapons by police and other security agencies resulted in approximately 1,500 deaths while leaving nearly 20,000 injured. It is incomprehensible that those entrusted with the duty to protect the public could commit such violence against them.\nIn light of these events, it is imperative that our security agencies, including police, undergo reforms to prevent such atrocities from ever occurring again. Reportedly, the Police Headquarters has already formed a committee to recommend non-lethal methods for controlling crowds and unlawful assemblies. Discussions are also underway about banning the use of long-barrel firearms. In extreme cases of necessity, it is expected that police will rely on small arms, in accordance with practices in developed countries and aligned with UN guidelines, to which Bangladesh is a signatory.\nFollowing the successful July uprising,\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0analysed the injury patterns of 204 individuals who had died as of August 1. Nearly 95 percent of these victims were killed by bullets, including live rounds and shotgun pellets. Of these, 113 were shot in the head, chest, stomach, or abdomen\u2014clearly indicating an intent to kill. Additionally, an analysis by the Lawyers for Energy, Environment and Development (LEED) revealed that lethal weapons such as 7.62mm semi-automatic rifles, submachine guns, BD08 assault rifles, Taurus 9mm revolvers, and Type 54 pistols were used during attacks on protesters.\nAs highlighted in a report by this daily, the militarisation of the police under the previous regime began in 2012-2013. In an October 2014 meeting, a decision was made to procure lethal firearms, including 7.62mm rifles. From that point onward, the regime increasingly pressured the police to use such deadly weapons to suppress dissent. Procurement records available on the Bangladesh Police website show that 7.62 sniper rifles and 7.62mm bullets have been in use for years, with their acquisition often coinciding with the farcical elections held under the regime, the latest being the January 2024 general elections.\nFormer Home Affairs Adviser M Sakhawat Hossain has rightly questioned the rationale for giving such \"military-grade\" weapons to the police. The answer is clear\u2014they were introduced to enable the fascist regime to maintain power by silencing dissent and oppressing citizens. Therefore, comprehensive reforms in our security agencies, particularly the police, are critical. These reforms must also include establishing thorough, independent mechanisms to investigate errant police officers and hold them accountable.\n",

        "full_article": "The political upheaval of August 2024, which saw the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government and the installation of an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has placed Bangladesh at a pivotal juncture in its democratic trajectory. Yet, despite this leadership shift, the divisive practice of \"tagging\"\u2014labelling individuals or groups with politically charged identities\u2014remains deeply entrenched in the nation's political culture. For the past 16 years, tagging has been used as a tool to stifle opposition, discredit social movements, and curtail public critique. This culture, prevalent under the Awami League and recently adopted by other movements, has systematically undermined Bangladesh's democratic discourse and the principles of social cohesion.\nFor over a decade and a half, the AL government employed tagging as a political instrument, branding dissenting voices as opponents, traitors, or allies of rival factions. Journalists, activists, and civil society figures who critiqued government policies were often labelled with affiliations to parties like the BNP or Jamaat-e-Islami, framing their criticisms as subversive rather than substantive. By labelling dissent as \"anti-state,\" tagging became a strategic means of sidelining opposition and discouraging public discourse. This tactic generated an environment of caution, leading individuals and organisations to practice self-censorship to avoid the stigma associated with perceived political allegiances.\nTagging also emerged as a powerful tool against youth-led quota movements, particularly those organised by students advocating for government accountability, transparency, and justice. As these protests gained traction, participants were frequently tagged as \"rebellious\" or \"anti-national,\" aiming to diminish the validity of their grievances and discourage broader civic engagement. Instead of being seen as passionate advocates for democratic reform, these young activists were framed as agitators or foreign-influenced disruptors of national stability. This branding not only stymied the growth of these movements but also pressured individuals within them to disengage, eroding the collective critical voice of the next generation.\nWith the establishment of the Yunus-led interim government, hopes for a fresh start in governance were high; yet the culture of tagging remains pervasive. Now, critics of government policy risk being labelled as \"pro-Awami League\" or \"establishment supporters.\" This redirection of tagging creates a deflection mechanism, where critiques are dismissed not based on the content or merit of their arguments but on presumed political loyalty. This continuation of tagging shifts focus away from constructive dialogue, undermining the government's potential to engage meaningfully with the public.\nTagging has had a particularly harmful impact on some members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, where minority Hindus who speak out are often labelled as \"Awami supporters\" or \"Indian sympathisers.\" This labelling detracts from the real issues faced by some members of the Hindu community, such as communal violence and threats. By attributing Hindu dissent to foreign influence, tagging discredits their concerns, discourages them from voicing grievances, and isolates them further from mainstream society.\nIndigenous communities in Bangladesh, particularly those residing in ecologically sensitive areas, have long been at the forefront of environmental activism. They consistently raise concerns about development projects that threaten their ancestral lands, livelihoods, and cultural heritage. However, their voices are often silenced through derogatory labels like \"extremists\" or \"foreign agents.\" These tactics discredit their legitimate concerns, portray them as threats to national security, and justify forceful displacement. Such labelling not only undermines their rights but also perpetuates a culture of fear and intimidation, hindering their ability to participate meaningfully in decision-making processes that affect their lives.\nSecular intellectuals and writers in Bangladesh who challenge religious fundamentalism or social conservatism often become targets of harassment and intimidation. By openly criticising these forces, they risk being labelled as \"atheists\" or \"blasphemers,\" inciting hatred, violence, and social ostracism. Such tactics are employed to silence dissenting voices and maintain a climate of fear, hindering the free exchange of ideas and stifling critical thinking.\nWomen who challenge patriarchal norms or advocate for gender equality face intense online harassment and offline threats. They are often labelled as \"immoral,\" \"promiscuous,\" or \"Westernised\" to discredit their activism and discourage others from following their lead. This tactic reinforces traditional gender roles and silences those who seek to challenge the status quo, undermining the credibility of women's rights activists and perpetuating a culture of discrimination.\nThe rise of social media has intensified the use of tagging, as government supporters frequently employ online platforms to amplify labels against critics. With social media's reach and speed, tagging as a tactic has been turbocharged, allowing supporters to rapidly disseminate negative labels and misinformation about dissenting individuals or groups. Government-aligned online groups and influencers label critics as \"foreign agents,\" \"anti-national,\" or \"pro-opposition,\" driving waves of online harassment that silence critics through overwhelming abuse and trolling. This decentralised yet coordinated use of tagging on social media normalises exclusionary and divisive rhetoric, hindering open dialogue on key issues.\nThe pervasiveness of tagging has fractured Bangladesh's public discourse, shifting the focus from policy critique to the identity of the critics themselves. This divisive practice discourages public engagement with ideas on their merits, reducing complex social issues to simplistic dichotomies. As tagging spreads, it promotes suspicion within society, fuels polarisation, and dampens the critical debates necessary for democratic development. By directing attention to presumed allegiances rather than substantive concerns, tagging undermines efforts for social cohesion and mutual understanding, impairing the foundations of Bangladesh's democratic aspirations.\nFor Bangladesh to evolve as a democratic society, overcoming the entrenched culture of tagging is crucial. To foster a public sphere that values critique and encourages constructive discourse, the government and civil society must move away from labelling individuals and groups based on perceived affiliations. A democratic society's resilience relies on its ability to engage with diverse perspectives without reducing them to simple tags. By creating space for genuine debate and dismantling the tagging culture, Bangladesh can build a more cohesive, inclusive, and dynamic society where critical voices, regardless of their affiliations, are respected for their contributions to national growth.\nDebbrata Kumar Adhikary is a development practitioner.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
