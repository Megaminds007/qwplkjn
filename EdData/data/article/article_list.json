Laying down a set of dos and don\u2019ts for judicial decision-making and writing, the Handbook on Combating Gender Stereotypes helps judges identify language that promotes archaic and \u201cincorrect ideas\u201d, about women in particular, and offers alternative words and phrases. Instead of \u201caffair\u201d, it will be de rigueur to say a \u201crelationship outside of marriage\u201d; similarly, for \u201cadulteress\u201d, the preferred usage is a \u201cwoman who has engaged in sexual relations outside of marriage\u201d. A host of derogatory and seemingly mild adjectives have been dropped too while referring to women. For instance, it is no longer \u201cchaste\u201d woman, \u201cdutiful\u201d wife, \u201chousewife\u201d; a plain \u201cwoman\u201d, \u201cwife\u201d and \u201chomemaker\u201d will do. Men have not been forgotten either, with the Court striking down words such as \u201ceffeminate\u201d (when used pejoratively), and \u201cfaggot\u201d, with the directive, \u201caccurately describe the individual\u2019s sexual orientation (e.g. homosexual or bisexual)\u201d. Pointing out that stereotypes \u2014 \u201ca set idea that people have about what someone or something is like, especially an idea that is wrong\u201d \u2014 leads to exclusion and discrimination, it identifies common presumptions about the way sexual harassment, assault, rape and other violent crimes are viewed, skewed against women.One of the stereotypes the Court shatters is women who do not wear traditional clothes and smoke or drink are asking for trouble, and drives home the important point of consent. It also firmly asserts that women who are sexually assaulted may not be able to immediately report the traumatic incident. Courts should take social realities and other challenges facing women seriously, it says. It is wrong, the Court adds, to assume women are \u201coverly emotional, illogical, and cannot take decisions\u201d. It is also a stereotypical presumption that all women want to have children, says the handbook, and points out, \u201cdeciding to become a parent is an individual choice\u201d. These possibilities, to be able to choose what to do in life, are still frustratingly out of reach for most of India\u2019s women. In a largely patriarchal society, girls are often forced to pick marriage as a way out to avoid social stigma, and not education and a career. Even if things are changing, the pace is slow. To achieve gender equality, fundamental changes need to be made to shun all stereotypes. That women are more nurturing and better suited to care for others, and should do all household chores are simply wrong notions. The handbook may be a guide for judges and lawyers, but it could also be a catalyst for change right down to the societal level.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ncrime\n\n/\n\ncrime, law and justice\n\n/\n\nsociety\n\n/\n\nhuman rights",

Announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech, the scheme, with an outlay of \u20b913,000 crore, provides loans of up to a total of \u20b93 lakh (in two tranches) at a concessional interest rate of 5%. It covers individuals from 18 trades such as cobblers, toy makers, laundrymen, barbers, masons and coir weavers. The government expects about five lakh families to be covered in the first year and 30 lakh families to benefit from the scheme over five years. But the scheme can help craftspeople and artisans only to the extent of freeing them from the difficulties they now face in accessing affordable credit from the formal banking system. However, the support extended to these struggling artisanal communities could come with its own risks in the way of unintended consequences. The challenges they face are far deeper than just the availability of cheap credit. By far the biggest of these that traditional art and craft professionals face is either the lack of patronage for their goods and services in the wider marketplace, or in the case of other trades, a skewed undervaluation of their economic output.Crucially, the lack of access to formal credit may simply be a symptom rather than the cause of the underlying problem these communities face. No government scheme can help these communities in the long run unless it helps them overcome the fundamental problem of a lack of economic viability for their output. More seriously, if the scheme fails to open up new markets and simply extends loans to these communities in the name of promoting their welfare, it runs the risk of leaving not only the intended beneficiaries but also their families deeper in debt. Also, by laying stress on the intergenerational nature of knowledge dissemination in these communities, the scheme could end up leaving the next generation willy-nilly stuck for perpetuity in these traditional low-paying trades, many of which are practised in a caste straitjacket. The Vishwakarma scheme includes skilling programmes that offer a nominal stipend as well as financial help to purchase modern tools. Ultimately, the success of this well-intentioned scheme will hinge on its implementation, an area where the government would do well to rope in professionals with the know-how and entrepreneurial flair to help the craftspeople and artisans upgrade their offerings to cater to new markets and tap fresh opportunities. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nbanking\n\n/\n\nIndependence Day",

        "full_article": "As we salute the tricolour on another Independence Day, some of our freedoms are at stake, some others are being misused. We all have our wish lists of freedoms we are yet to get. If I have to choose one, it\u2019s the freedom from casteism and, as an extension of it, communalism. This is not to say caste and religion should be abolished. Omnipresent in our lives they are, the rituals and ways of life that come with one\u2019s religion and caste may be observed \u2013 even celebrated \u2013 by those who want to do so, but they should be neither a right to discriminate nor a bane to be discriminated against.\nBesides well laid-out Articles in our Constitution, we have such laws against discrimination as the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Yet legislation hasn\u2019t been able to prevent caste crimes. The hope of a generational change that begins with the upbringing of children faces the threat of being snuffed out as casteism goes to school.\nThis was on violent display last Wednesday in Nanguneri in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu when a gang of teenagers barged into the house of a 17-year-old boy belonging to a scheduled caste and hacked him and his younger sister. Investigation shows that the attackers belonged to the thevar caste. Harassed by the gang because of his caste, the boy had complained to his parents and stopped going to school. The school authorities pulled up the boy\u2019s tormentors who decided to take revenge. While caste clashes are regular in some of the northern states, Tamil Nadu that takes pride in its history of the self-respect movement, continues to suffer festering manifestations of casteism at every level (In neighbouring Kerala, caste discrimination has given way to religious intolerance and communal polarisation).\nIn Tamil Nadu, anniversary celebrations of some leaders become occasions to cross swords over caste. Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar deserves to be celebrated by thevars \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 for his fight against the Criminal Tribes Act of 1920 that designated entire communities as habitual criminals. But do we celebrate him also for his role as a freedom fighter rubbing shoulders with Subhash Chandra Bose? Similarly, Immanuel Sekaran is less celebrated as a freedom fighter than as a dalit leader. For pallars, Sekaran is rightfully a martyr, someone who was murdered at the age of 33 for fighting for their rights. But do we teach our children that he was imprisoned by the British for participating in the Quit India movement at the age of 18?\nIt\u2019s a historical fact that Muthuramalinga Thevar and Immanuel Sekaran didn\u2019t see eye to eye (Sekaran once refused to stand up at a peace meeting when Thevar walked in, the two had an argument and the latter walked out), but the two leaders fought on a common ground for Independence. Some of the battles of the past had a political context. While we shouldn\u2019t forget the bloody part of our history, the past should not dictate the present.\nThe Tamil Nadu government has assigned Justice Chandru to recommend measures to prevent casteism on campuses. Hope the legal luminary with a history of fighting cases of caste discrimination will come up with not just proposals for law enforcement, but with a road map to bring up a new generation whose worldview is shaped and guided by self-respect and mutual respect which, incidentally, form the bedrock of all religions.\n\n",

The million-dollar question is therefore: Is this surge in food inflation transient, or can it create sustained pressure?\nInflation in vegetables, the key driver of food inflation, flared up to 37% in July compared with 0.9% in June. RBI typically does not fret too much about this because vegetables have a short crop cycle and prices spike and correct quickly. Take the case of tomatoes.

        "full_article": "Retail inflation in July once again breached RBI\u2019s upper limit of tolerance of 6%. CPI was 7.4% in July, driven mainly by food inflation. If the surge in inflation last year was led by energy products, food price inflation not only followed but has continued to remain elevated. A look at the wholesale price trend illustrates the nature of policymakers\u2019 challenge. Since April, wholesale markets have recorded deflation. WPI was -1.36% in July. During the same period, wholesale food prices moved in the opposite direction, steadily increasing before a surge in July led to food inflation of 14.25%. Typically, trends in the wholesale market get captured in the retail prices after a lag. Therefore, the trends indicate that the outlook for retail inflation, if food is taken out of the equation, is benign.\n\nFood, however, remains a significant part of an average family\u2019s consumption basket, and it contributes about 46% of CPI. Therefore, RBI\u2019s challenge is to judge if the pressure from food inflation is getting generalised. If RBI concludes there\u2019s generalisation of price pressure originating in food or fuel, it pushes up interest rates to head off second round impacts. This is what it did in May 2022.\nBetween May 2022 and February 2023, RBI\u2019s monetary policy committee increased the policy rate, or repo, by 2.5 percentage points to 6.5%. It was a steep increase in a short period. As RBI\u2019s actions take time to work their way through commercial markets, the full impact of the increases in repo rate hasn\u2019t yet shown up. Both the weighted average term deposit and lending rates have increased by a smaller proportion. Therefore, at this stage RBI, while keeping a close eye on the rise in CPI, should not use interest rates as a policy tool to combat inflation.\nInterest rates are effective if inflation has been driven by excess demand. In that case, an increase in rates cools demand without affecting production. The drivers of inflation since 2022 have been supply disruptions. The solution to these disruptions lies not with the monetary authority but with GOI. The tightening of rice exports and offloading its stock of cereals are recent GOI measures to deal with the situation. RBI has since February sensibly paused repo rate increases. It should persist with this policy.\n\n",

They were eventually rescued and brought down to a safe place after four hours.\nAnd then, the other day, I saw some people climbing down a rope to escape from a fire in their building.\nIn high-rise buildings, there should be fire-proof steel staircases for people to safely evacuate.

        "full_article": "Last year, Penguin Random House published\u00a0When McKinsey Comes to Town \u2013 The Hidden Influence of The World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm\u00a0by investigative journalists Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe. The book exposes the shady business practice of McKinsey \u2013 the world's original and most prestigious management consultancy \u2013 and the long-term harm it has caused society.\nGoing to a management consultant is like visiting a doctor. Governments and corporations hiring a consultant for advice on business-critical matters pour out all available information, believing they will get professional and impartial advice in return. And, of course, the whole thing is confidential, and no information is to be shared with anyone, unless it is necessary to devise good business advice. Or so the Australian federal government thought back in 2015.\nCanberra hired PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) \u2013 one of the four largest global accounting and strategy networks along with KPMG, Ernst & Young, and Deloitte \u2013 to draft laws for making big global companies like Google, Facebook and Apple pay their fair share of taxes in Australia. That resulted in the legislation known as the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), the legal tool under the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), aiming to stop major companies, particularly tech giants, from shifting their profits away from higher-taxing countries to others with lower tax rates.\nBut there was a problem.\nDespite signing multiple non-disclosure agreements, PwC's international tax expert Peter-John Collins, the principal consultant, compromised confidentiality. That gave the firm an advantage because it could also devise ways for companies to get around paying the new tax. As the book exposes, it used this advantage to secure new jobs and make more money, a practice McKinsey has long followed.\n\nOne essential element of the McKinsey culture is corporate greenwashing, whereby a company makes a false claim about something it is doing for a good cause, such as environmental preservation. Besides, on McKinsey's advice, many corporations have reduced or eliminated the middle managers and given a hefty pay rise to the top ones \u2013 the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, all the roles that start with the title \"chief\" (the C-suite). In the 1970s, American CEOs made 20 times more than the typical workers. It has now risen to 278 times. This skewed compensation model has squeezed the middle class out of the scene, forcing them to join an army of outsourced staff or subcontractors without the usual company benefits.\nFounded in 1926 by James O McKinsey, the firm quickly formed a culture of euphemism, coining new feel-good words to sweeten the ruthless business practices it adopted, starting by selling itself as a \"values-driven organisation.\" The \"firm\" became a \"practice\" that \"engaged\" with clients, not \"worked\" for them. The effect of such euphemism became so deeply ingrained that even when an ill-advised \"optimising\" and \"rightsizing\" (actually severe cost-cutting by reducing maintenance staff and operation) in Disney theme parks caused several deaths, it quickly shrugged off all responsibilities by saying that none of its staffers were involved in maintaining the facilities that had caused the deaths. One can easily guess there was a disclaimer with every McKinsey recommendation to the effect that it wouldn't be responsible for the outcome of the actions based on it. Such cost-cutting and brutal redundancy programmes became the norm of the day simply because they increased company profits.\nThe practice (or is it malpractice!) continued unabated. Remember the energy giant Enron that collapsed in 2001 after a massive accounting fraud? McKinsey promoted Enron as the new corporate innovation model, implementing the off-balance-sheet accounting practice. However, after Enron's implosion, McKinsey absolved itself from any responsibility, saying it was not an adviser on financial and reporting matters. There is more. Just before the company's bankruptcy, on McKinsey's advice, Enron's top five executives took nearly $300 million in wages in one year alone.\nThe saga goes on. The opioid crisis, in which Purdue Pharma kept selling the drug despite knowing the risks and caused more than 564,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020, Saudi Arabia's harassment of dissidents, including Jamal Khashoggi's execution in 2018, and President Donald Trump's ruthless immigration detention policy from 2017 onwards, all have a common thread \u2013 McKinsey. However, the most significant harm it has done is perhaps introducing a culture of impunity in the corporate world by giving a way to evade responsibility should things go wrong: disclaimers, employee declarations, and a masquerade of elite company culture. We may call it the McKinsey culture.\nOne essential element of the McKinsey culture is corporate greenwashing, whereby a company makes a false claim about something it is doing for a good cause, such as environmental preservation. Besides, on McKinsey's advice, many corporations have reduced or eliminated the middle managers and given a hefty pay rise to the top ones \u2013 the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, all the roles that start with the title \"chief\" (the C-suite). In the 1970s, American CEOs made 20 times more than the typical workers. It has now risen to 278 times. This skewed compensation model has squeezed the middle class out of the scene, forcing them to join an army of outsourced staff or subcontractors without the usual company benefits.\nSuch ruthless cost-cutting made possible the obscene pay rise for the C-suite, with a large amount of disposable cash to spend on unnecessary and luxury items \u2013 such as big cars and houses, fast fashion, and expensive family holidays, besides huge investments in stocks and properties \u2013 that consume more energy and resources, causing irreparable environmental damage and social inequality.\nAs is the current norm, every corporation has a code of practice that includes pro-environment, anti-corruption, pro-workplace safety, and pro-gender balance policies, to name a few, which its employees must sign off on. But often, it doesn't work because corporations exist to make money. Their budget targets assume growth by default, for which the ends justify the means. The McKinsey culture has infiltrated every sphere of corporate governance, adversely impacting millions worldwide.\nIs there a way out?\nDr Sayeed Ahmed\u00a0is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.\n\n",

Their alleged collusion with powerful encroachers in many cases has been equally troubling. We hope that, given the importance of Arial Beel for the country, those in charge will take the task at hand seriously this time.\n",

        "full_article": "We are concerned to learn that the Dhaka North City Corporation's move in February to demarcate separate lanes for rickshaws has done nothing to improve traffic congestion on the busy Mayor Annisul Huq Road in the capital. Trucks continue to be parked unlawfully on the road, damaging the dividers that the DNCC had installed, according to a report by the daily. This is just another example of the authorities' inability to ensure compliance from transport associations, the results of which have been narrower roads, unused rickshaw lanes, and a worse gridlock condition for office-goers, students and ambulances carrying critical patients, among other problems. This is totally unacceptable.\n\nThe Mayor Annisul Huq Road is a crucial one for city dwellers as it connects Tejgaon, Farmgate and Karwan Bazar with Mohakhali and Banani-Gulshan-Niketon. Furthermore, it stands as an embodiment of the late mayor's fight to reduce traffic congestion by staving off encroachment attempts and opposition from truck associations. But its current state is reversing his efforts to alleviate traffic woes, subjecting thousands of commuters to misery every day. Students and office-goers are reportedly often late to school and work, rickshaw pullers are earning less due to traffic jams, and people with medical emergencies are risking their lives. Trucks occupying a vital part of the space illegally is causing all sorts of troubles, and worryingly still, the DNCC is doing nothing about it.\n\nThe fact is, we cannot expect a respite from this reality until the government starts enforcing traffic rules and stops giving in to pressure from transport associations. We have seen the latter frequently exert pressure to shape policies, such as when they did after the Road Transport and Highways Division (RTHD) in May issued a directive limiting the economic life of vehicles (20 years for buses, and 25 years for trucks and lorries). It took just a little over two months for the RTHD to backtrack on that directive, meaning that unfit vehicles can now operate\u00a0legally. It goes without saying that this will only further endanger our safety on roads. It is because of such undue concessions, legal or on the ground, that this sector continues to be in such a pitiful state.\n\nAgainst this background, experts believe that the priority is to establish order in this chaotic sector rather than taking unplanned, half-hearted measures such as building a separate rickshaw lane on the Mayor Annisul Huq Road. The authorities must first ensure compliance from transport associations and prevent illegal parking. They can also build alternative parking spaces for trucks.\n",

        "full_article": "The reported surge in import of scrapped ships, though good news, is fraught with challenges that are yet to be addressed in curbing environmental degradation, on the one hand, and risks associated with the hazardous scrapping job, on the other. A FE report says, import of scrapped ships has risen more than 40 per cent in the Jan-June period compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. The report further adds that the number of ships imported for dismantling was 122 in 2022, 254 in 2021, and 144 in 2020. Clearly, it is the growing demand for scrapped vessels that underlies the steady rise in the numbers.There is no denying the fact that ship-breaking contributes considerably to the country's economy, estimated to be worth around US $2.50 billion. While it offers employment to around 300,000 workers, it has the proven capacity of supporting a vast array of heavy and light engineering industries. Iron rods and billets recycled from ship scraps, believed to be of high quality, meet a major portion of domestic requirements in the construction sector. Scrapped ships also account for 80 per cent of the demand of raw materials in the rerolling mills. Experts have opined that Bangladesh is a unique place for ship-breaking and ship-recycling as nearly all the products available from dismantled ships are used locally. As the advanced countries have given up on ship-breaking because of high cost of labour and accompanied compliance issues, ship-breaking has all the prospects for thriving in Bangladesh, provided that sufficient attention is paid to it for conforming to required international norms and protocols. In spite of the importance of the sector as well as its contribution to the economy, ship-breaking in the country is yet to assume the position of an industry per se, largely because of the reckless environmental pollution and accidents and deaths that it has not been able to avoid, as of now. There were repeated moves from various quarters including international bodies and rights groups to raise the standard of work culture in the ship-breaking yards. Also there are allegations of ship-breaking companies importing highly toxic foreign vessels despite ban. The media and the NGOs have been blaming state regulators -- including the department of environment and the ministries of shipping and labour -- for failing to protect coastal ecosystems and to monitor these companies' compliance to safety regulations.There are reportedly more than a hundred scrapping yards in the country of which 20-30 are in operation. The increase in the number of ships entering the coastline for scrapping is likely to expand their operation. But with the accompanied perils as mentioned, the sector is set to face actions from various international platforms in the form of stringent sanctions, unless urgent remediation measures are in place. However, it has been reported that of late, some moves have been taken for workers' safety, hazardous waste disposal, and oil pollution management, among others. Still, observers feel that there has to be an integrated plan of action to address all areas in a cohesive manner. Once such a plan is taken and executed, the benefits coming from ship scrapping can be rewarding in the true sense of the term.",

        "full_article": "A waterlogged port city makes screaming news headlines but no less, if not more, affected and ravaged Bandarban and the outlying hilly areas have failed to draw media and government attention they ought to have. This is perhaps because people of the plain land are not habituated to constructing a flood-affected picture of the towns and localities on the hills hundreds or even thousands of feet higher than the sea level. Hills and floods are anachronistic. So they can at best visualise the havoc wreaked by landslides if there are incessant and excessive rains. And too much of rains it was. Sea-front Chattogram City and southern areas of Chattogram district have every reason to get flooded, only more so this year because of the sea's refusal to take in the excessive flows of rain-induced river waters under the influence of El Nino. But the hills remain off limit to flooding by sea-river collaboration. Accusing fingers have rightly been pointed at the high dam constructed to protect the newly laid Chattogram-Cox's Bazar rail tracks. A segment of distorted rail tracks caused by the onrushing waters of flood in the area corroborates the view. If huge volumes of rain waters surge down the hill slopes and find no passage, they are sure to cause floods where such a phenomenon is unthinkable. True, Nature has been behaving capriciously of late as if to warn the human race that it is no longer going to tolerate undue interference in its ecosystem. It is apparently because of this, the rich and developed countries which thought they would be safe in their ivory towers are experiencing natural ---better say manmade ---disasters at increasing frequencies. Heat waves, forest or wildfires, typhoons, floods, earth quake, eruption of volcanoes and cyclones are making their visitations one after another giving the impression that the planet is in turmoil. The death toll of the latest wildfire in Hawaii has nearly hit the 100 mark and is thought to be double the number. Right now floods, forest fires and eruption of mount Etna volcano have not only been causing immense suffering to residents in their respective areas but some are also claiming lives beyond calculations. As a natural disaster-prone country, Bangladesh is feared to have a major share of such weird natural phenomena on top of its usual natural calamities. Fortunately, so far Bangladesh has largely been free of such out-of-the-blue phenomena. The floods in the hills perhaps largely qualify for a strange and off-beat phenomenon. Rising flood water inundated first floor of homes, making it one-off natural tragedy residents of Bandarban have ever experienced. Ruma and Thanchi, two attractive tourist spots, opened for visitors after a long gap have been cut off from the district town. A cursory glance at the floods in Bandarban and other parts of the Chattogram Hill Tracts may give the idea of one of the numerous quirky events experienced by the peoples in many parts of the world. But delving into it may present some uneasy developments credited to a section of rapacious elements there. Mindless destruction of hills and hillocks, denudation of hill covers and forests, extraction of stones from quarries, streams and rivers together with execution of development projects in total disrespect for geomorphological diversity and the particular ecosystem of sensitive places have gone on to invite Nature's backlashes.The presence of unwelcome Rohingya refugees in the region has only exacerbated the environment to the extent where even elephants find their corridors to and from one patch of forest to another subjected to interference. Increasing man-animal (elephants) confrontations have been taken, thanks to Rohingya camps, to their limits by blocking those corridors much the same way the gates of floodwaters have been sealed off. Apparently, the decline in habitats of flora and fauna does not immediately show the changes in environment and ecology but gradually the losses in terms of threat to and extinction of both wildlife and vegetation become evident. Mass destruction of plant species can turn a region arid leading to sparse or a lack of rains. These are a complex set of actions and reactions involving human beings and natural phenomena.It would be foolish to think that levelling of hills and hillocks can turn a hilly region into plain lands. Even when the need is overriding for bringing hill slopes under cultivation of crops, the special characteristics of undulating contours must be respected. The same is true for construction of roads, railways and other infrastructure as part of the socio-economic development process. At no point, should the natural system of vegetation, retention and disposal of rain waters be interfered with extensively. So destruction of hills and hillocks should be stopped, human settlements in cleared forest lands prohibited, stone quarries sealed off.Yet this will not be enough now that extensive damage has been wrought. Massive forestation on denuded hills and removal of obstructions to rushing waters in time of torrential rains may not only minimise damage and destruction but also decrease the possibility of such catastrophic visitations.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The people in Bangladesh are familiar with the widespread adulteration of essential items like food and medicine. Spurious toiletries are also found abundantly in the market. For years, people have been consuming adulterated items and falling victim to many life-threatening diseases. The authorities concerned do launch anti-adulteration drives sporadically that usually leave no visible impact on the situation on the ground. It is not just humans. Even insects inhabiting this land are being subjected to adulterated chemicals. A case in point is the chemicals used to kill the mosquito larvae in Dhaka city. In most cases, larvae survive the chemicals sprayed on them, become full-size vectors and bite humans and other animals merrily. It is beyond proof that the quality of mosquito-killing chemicals is compromised well before their application. Had the chemicals been effective, the mosquitoes would not have made the lives of the people so miserable. There have been citizens' complaints about mosquito menace galore, but the city corporations have preferred to be indifferent. The top notches, at times, demonstrate their 'seriousness' in the task of eliminating mosquitoes. But, in reality, these are the moves aimed at playing to the gallery. This year, dengue, a viral disease, is playing havoc across the country. Both the number of dengue cases and deaths have surpassed records. The numbers are feared to go up further during the next two and a half months. The severity of the disease has prompted the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) to do something different this time. It decided to use one particular type of bacteria --- Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) --- to kill mosquitoes within its command area. The BTI is safe as it does not cause any harm to organisms except killing mosquito larvae, fungus gnats and black flies. Accordingly, the corporation gave a work order to a local firm named Marshal Agrovet Chemical Industries Ltd to supply BTI. Marshal Agrovet imported the bacteria and supplied samples of the same to DNCC. Things were on track until then. But things turned sour when the DNCC people arranged a few demonstrations of the BTI use and newspapers carried details about the BTI and its import. The DNCC made available information that the bacteria were being imported from a Singaporean company named Best Chemical. But the Best Chemical in a Facebook post protested the news and claimed that they did not supply the BTI in question to Agrovet. Media investigation has revealed that Marshal Agrovet has imported BTI from China, not Singapore. The firm reportedly is claiming that BTI in question has its origin in Singapore and the Chinese firm is a third-party supplier. Marshal Agrovet is also claiming that the name of the Chinese supplier was mentioned in the documents it had submitted in response to the DNCC tender.Meanwhile, Best Chemical, as reported in a section of the press, is planning to sue Marshal Agrovet. The DNCC tender notice made it conditional that the bid winner will have to import BTI from the USA, any EU country, Singapore, India and Malaysia. Thus, the BTI controversy has put the DNCC in an embarrassing situation. Its top notches are blaming Marshal Agrovet to shirk their responsibility in the BTI episode. If Agrovet's tender documents mentioned the name of the Chinese supplier, there will be a long battle over the BTI issue, it seems. Amidst all the controversy, suspicion has surfaced about the efficacy of the sample BTI that has been made available to the DNCC. The corporation in the presence of independent entomologists should examine the efficacy of the BTI imported by the Marshal Agrovet and make an elaborate public statement on the issue. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Dengue, the fast spreading mosquito-borne disease, has been ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top 10 global public health threats. It has spread to 129 countries, with 400 million annual infections and 40,000 deaths. In Bangladesh, the growing dengue infection has already overwhelmed the hospitals in Dhaka city. Patients are seen receiving treatment on the floors and verandas of government-run hospitals. Medicine crisis, including saline and fluid, affected the patients most, which have already forced the authorities concerned to allow imports of some medicines. With the number of hospital admission averaging in the range of 2,000-3,000 and the number of deaths caused by dengue remain more than 10 every day in recent times. According to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) reports, the peak season of dengue is usually from August to October every year. Dhaka sees the highest number of deaths and infections every year. The DGHS identifies a total of 11 dengue hotspots in the capital. Six of those areas are under the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and the rest under the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). The DSCC areas are Jatrabari, Mugda, Kodomtoli, Jurain, Dhanmondi, and Basabo while the five DNCC areas are Uttara, Mohammadpur, Mirpur, Tejgaon, and Badda. If effective steps are taken to kill mosquitoes of these hotspots, there will definitely be lower infection rates. Studies have revealed that symptoms of dengue infection is changing, with an increasing trend of gastrointestinal symptoms (such as vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea), while symptoms of bleeding and joint pain are decreasing. Worryingly, Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) has increased by up to 10 times in recent outbreaks. It looks like dengue is tending to become a more severe illness in Bangladesh, with young adults and children being affected more. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes but there is no specific treatment for dengue. The WHO has recently termed Bangladesh's dengue situation endemic and suggested swift measures, including entomological surveillance. The agency says that Integrated Vector Management should be strengthened to remove the potential breeding sites, reduce the vector population and minimise individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults. \nShafiul Kayes,[email\u00a0protected]",
