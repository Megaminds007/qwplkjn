        "full_article": "As irate protesters gathered near the house of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in a desperate bid to highlight their suffering, the worsening economic crisis in Sri Lanka has possibly reached its crescendo. The Rajapaksas, who have dominated the political and electoral scene, face an unprecedented decline in their popularity, as the people struggle for want of adequate money, fuel and food. The roots of the crisis may not lie wholly in the policies of Mr. Gotabaya, who was swept to power in 2019 as President on a platform of strong leadership and decisive action, while his party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, won a landslide in parliamentary elections a year later. The Rajapaksas did inherit some economic problems, while the pandemic cast a greater burden. However, the current administration is indeed responsible for some ill-advised populist measures such as a huge raise in the threshold for income taxes and VAT registration, leading to revenue loss. And there was a questionable order to move to fertilizer-free farming overnight, which led to loss of yield and drew sharp criticism. The chemical fertilizer ban has been rolled back, but its impact on food security remains. Yet, more than anything, what appears to infuriate the people is the perception of governmental apathy towards their plight, of denial of the existence of a crisis and the absence of a road map for economic recovery. It may be simplistic to summarise the causative factors behind the crisis as excessive borrowings at high interest rates and a putative \u2018Chinese debt trap\u2019. However, there is behind it a tale of economic mismanagement, profligate use of public resources, and possible mishandling of monetary policy. Sri Lanka, an island nation heavily dependent on imports, gains its foreign exchange through tourism, the export of garments and tea, besides external remittances. If the Easter Sunday blasts of 2019 set back its tourism sector, the novel coronavirus pandemic almost finished it off. The heavy-handed lockdown, overseen by a military-led task force, had severe economic consequences too, as livelihoods were lost, while earnings suffered. The country needs measures to shore up its foreign exchange reserves and the balance of payment position. India has extended assistance amounting to $2.40 billion, and China is also looking at further loans. The country\u2019s past resistance to borrowing from the IMF may not last, and it may have to accept significant conditionalities for a bailout package. However, advocating that the people tighten their belts and suffer a little more may not work. The President should acknowledge both the depth of the crisis and the rising public disenchantment. What his country needs is empathetic leadership and decisive measures to halt the downward spiral.",

        "full_article": "The Supreme Court has rightly quashed the Tamil Nadu Special Reservation Act of 2021, or the Vanniyar quota law, on the ground that it was not based on updated quantifiable data. The Act had envisaged the distribution of the 20% quota for Most Backward Classes (MBC) and De-notified Communities (DNCs) in education and public employment by assigning 10.5% to Vanniyars or the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community, 7% for 25 MBCs and 68 DNCs, and 2.5% for the remaining 22 MBCs. Even though a superficial look at the law would give an impression that not just the Vanniyars but also 115 other communities have been covered, the aspect of internal reservation for one community \u2014 Vanniyars \u2014 had created the impression of special treatment. Such treatment per se is not bad in law, as caste, the Court said, can be the starting point for the identification of backward classes or providing internal reservation, though it cannot be the sole basis. Also, there must be pertinent, contemporaneous data. The Court also pointed out that no analysis had been made of the relative backwardness and representation of other communities in the MBCs and DNCs. The Court\u2019s decision has provided relief to many by holding that the State is competent to design sub-classification among backward classes; prescribe the quantum of reservation based on such sub-classification, and formulate an ancillary law, even with the assent of the Governor, to one included in the Ninth Schedule. Regardless of further moves by the DMK government that had defended the law in the Supreme Court, this episode has important lessons. No community should be allowed internal or exclusive reservation without making a case for it on the basis of quantifiable data. A caste-based census can help in determining the representation of various communities in public employment and in education. After all, it is adequate representation that holds the key for the special treatment of reservation. But whether caste, narrowly defined, and not the socio-economic indicators of the applicants, should be the basis for reservation is another issue. Tamil Nadu\u2019s parties must take a relook at their position against the implementation of creamy layer rule in reservation, as otherwise there will always be demand for internal reservation from communities that feel left out. If the parties believe genuinely in the principle of equity in reservation, they should not have any problem in agreeing to the concept of creamy layer. Also, the demand for reservation for the economically weaker sections among the caste groups not covered by reservation will carry on if those seen as economically advanced continue to obtain a larger share of the reservation pie. Other than for the SCs and STs, the creamy layer must be excluded in providing for reservation for castes that qualify as backward classes.",

        "full_article": "Two dangerous policy drafts regulating our online presence have been prepared right in front of our noses, and except for a few usual suspects crying wolf, there has been little public outrage over it. And I don't blame you for not knowing or caring about them. It's easy enough to get lost in the technical jargon of experts (Intermediaries? Traceability? Peer-to-peer encrypted messaging?), or the righteous indignation of human rights activists (Violation of constitutional guarantees? Incompatibility with Article 19 of the ICCPR? Principles of proportionality?).\nMaybe you've got 99 problems and worrying about some distant law\u2014that is likely going to affect some activist types anyway\u2014ain't one of them.\nBut what if I told you that, if implemented, these laws won't just curtail whatever little freedom of expression the press still has, but could well get in the way of those endless Netflix shows? What if your most private photos could be easily and legally accessed on the flimsiest of pretexts, like you \"liking\" a Facebook post on government corruption?\nThe draft Data Protection Act (DPA), prepared in November last year and finalised last week, is supposed to do as its name suggests: protect your data. The problem is that, in reality, it allows a whole host of actors to access your data, without so much as your permission or even your explicit knowledge. These actors include law enforcement and security agencies, the director general of the Digital Security Agency\u2014in charge of investigating violations, levying fines and ensuring compliance\u2014as well as all employees of the Data Protection Office. The law also has a provision that gives further power to the government to exempt data controllers, meaning those responsible for collecting or processing (or supervising the processing) of personal data such as your IT person, from following the law.\nAdditionally, although it gives us the right to know what kind of personal data is being collected, it does not apply to instances in which \"processing is necessary for functions of the government\". What does \"functions of the government\" entail though, you ask? The draft does not specify that, which means that it could quite literally mean anything the government wants it to mean. Similarly, the draft says that government agencies can \"intercept, record or collect information\" of any person on \"national security\" or \"public order\" grounds, but it does not define or limit what these terms entail, which leave them open to (mis)interpretation.\nNow, at this point, you may be thinking: well, this certainly sounds terrible, but I am a law-abiding citizen. I don't even go to Shahbagh for phuchka, much less protests. What possible justification would the government have for snooping through my Facebook chats? Unfortunately, the scope of the exemption is so broad that law enforcement or security agencies can legally access your data on the feeblest of grounds, for instance, for writing a status criticising a former minister, posting a satirical cartoon, or simply commenting on someone else's status.\nIt may sound as if I am exaggerating, but these are real-life examples of ordinary people, like students and professionals who have no link to the media or politics, who were picked up on these very grounds under the Digital Security Act (DSA).\nYou see, these laws seem distant only until they happen to you.\nThe second piece of legislation\u2014\"Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms\"\u2014is even scarier. It proposes an aggressive and authoritarian content governance framework that applies to a host of applications/actors including social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest; tech companies like Google, Microsoft; OTT platforms like Hoichoi, Netflix, Chorki, Spotify; Facebook live shows; IPTVs and social media handles of media organisations.\n\u00a0Experts have pointed out the absurdity of lumping together services that are miles apart functionally, technically and operationally, and hence require different regulatory models. By forcing them under a one-size-fits-all model that actually fits none, the government is essentially undemocratising the internet, penalising in one broad stroke both content producers and end users.\nBesides, all of these platforms will be required to get registration\u2014yes, including appis selling sarees through Facebook live from their homes. For smaller e-commerce platforms and independent content producers, the bureaucratic loopholes of obtaining registration may well act as a deterrence to their entry into the digital space while, for an established news platform like The Daily Star, registration\u2014and the looming threat of its cancellation\u2014will be a noose that can tighten with the smallest of digressions.\nThe draft criminalises the same set of vague provisions as the DSA. It says that the above-mentioned service providers cannot host any information that, among other things, \"threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign States\"; \"breaches the secrecy of the government; creates unrest or disorder or deteriorates law and order\" situation; \"is offensive, false or threatening and insulting or humiliating to a person\" or \"decency, morality, social acceptance, social values, against national culture\".\nBut what exactly do these terms even mean? Would any R-rated Netflix show pass the test of \"decency\" or \"national culture\"? Who decides that? And frankly, what would the internet even look like without content that is \"humiliating\" or \"insulting\" to someone or the other?\nUnfortunately, we have already witnessed how broadly and arbitrarily these definitions have been used by the government to arrest, harass and humiliate a broad range of actors\u2014ordinary people included\u2014for exercising their constitutional right to freedom of expression. Now, you may ask: if the DSA already allows the government to criminalise free speech, what does it matter that a new regulation is at play? It matters because now the government is making it mandatory for all social media platforms to do the policing on their behalf.\nAs per the new draft, platforms like Facebook can be fined up to Tk 3 billion and its representative imprisoned for up to 5 years for violations. With close to 45 million users in the country, how exactly is Facebook supposed to do this monitoring, with much of what is posted lost in translation? How can automated systems with filters understand context, dialects and nuance?\nMoreover, the draft regulation says that the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) can direct service providers to remove or block content\u2014that too, within 72 hours of the direction\u2014which will rob any and all these platforms of their independence and character. The tech giants are unlikely to take these punches lying down. We have already seen Facebook, Google and Twitter warning Hong Kong that they would stop operating there if officials of that country move forward with data protection law amendments (which is not nearly as bad as ours) that could hold companies liable for users' actions.\nThe BTRC regulation further requires all social media intermediaries to have a resident complaint officer, a compliance officer to ensure due diligence, and an agent to liaison with law enforcement agencies and the BTRC\u2014all of whom are to be residents of Bangladesh\u2014essentially so that there is someone here they can hold liable or arrest in case of a violation. But why would a company like Netflix, for instance, go out of their way to take on this inconvenience when the easier and less expensive solution would be to pack up their bags and leave? And it isn't just Netflix of course. A host of regional and global businesses may no longer find it in their best interests to operate within Bangladesh.\nIt gets worse. The BTRC regulation as well as the DPA also make it mandatory for intermediaries such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, etc. to enable traceability and identification of the first originator of any information. Simply put, this means these companies, whose very existence is premised upon the assurance of privacy, would be required to break end-to-end encryption. Yes, you read that right: these regulations will legalise the surveillance of your private messages that you do not want to share with the universe.\nThese are only some of the more obviously scary provisions of the drafts. They are dense and technical, but it is absolutely crucial that we unpack them to fully understand how they would impact us on an everyday basis, in a very real way, if and when they are approved. Unless we want to live the rest of our lives constantly looking over our shoulders, deprived of the real benefits of the internet, we, the ordinary citizens, must strongly raise our voices against them while we still can.\n\u00a0\nSushmita S Preetha is a journalist and researcher.\n",

        "full_article": "I begin with an apology to my readers for my long absence. Covid played havoc with our lifestyle and livelihoods. Even then, we could make choices still within limited parameters. My choice was to remain passive and wallow in my bad fortune\u2014being traumatised by cancer during an epic pandemic. To compound matters, I had lost the one thing I valued the most: my passion for music!\nInterestingly, it took just one innocuous walk on a beautiful spring afternoon to break the recurring cycle of depression and despair. Dusk was descending\u2026 there was something ethereal about the first blooms of spring against the setting sun, the chirping of birds flying home, the soft breeze rustling through the leaves and caressing my hair. The entire ambience and experience stirred my inner core, which was struggling to overcome all that was dark and distressful in the recent past.\nIn addition to the misfortune of my illness, I was weighed down by the grief of losing dear ones to Covid. My deepest regret was that I could not hold their hands as they said goodbye to the world. The remorse had left a gaping wound inside me. But, standing alone in the tree-lined path, I had a \"reawakening\". I needed to move away from what destructs, distorts and disorients to what heals, rejuvenates and empowers. I realised that this might be the right moment since nature has given us a respite from the scourge of Covid. No one knows if this is an interval or a finale, but why not seize the opportunity to reflect on how to restructure the contours of our lives?\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that this is also the time when Christians are observing Lent. And for Muslims, the month of Ramadan has just started. During Lent, Christians acknowledge misery, sorrow, and remorse and enter into a lamenting mode, seeking healing from the Divine. For many, lamenting is not just mourning, but also accepting that struggle is a part of the general drama of happiness and pain.\nRamadan, on the other hand, is not about finding a new path via remorse and lament, but trying to attain higher spirituality and resolving inner conflicts through reflection and action. Self-restraint through fasting provides a rare glimpse into the miseries of the less fortunate, making us aware of the injustices and unfairness of life. Prayers and meditation, on the other hand, help us understand that so many things are beyond our control, and that inner peace lies in some kind of surrender to a greater force.\nIn both practices\u2014Lent and Ramadan\u2014people strive to find catharsis through introspection, restraint and sacrifice. However, each one of us will need to find our own path whether it is Lent, Ramadan, Puja or simply meditating in the solitude of our homes. We will need to go through our own healing process and rid ourselves of our past baggage. It will be easy to clean wardrobes and cupboards by removing all that is inconsequential, but cleansing our emotional cobwebs will be much harder! As we restart our journey of life, let us concentrate on resetting our priorities and discarding all that is inessential, especially the monster within, called ego.\nEven so, questions will persist\u2026 Why were some chosen to survive while so many others succumbed to the pandemic? On a broader plane, what is this miracle called life? Is it the spirit's desire to break free from the Source and explore, as the Sufis say? Or each one of us is sent on this earthly adventure by the Divine Will to test our love for Him through endurance and compassion!\nWhether we find definitive answers or not, for now let us be thankful that we are alive and celebrate each new day as a gift. Through its cataclysmic upheaval, Covid has taught us a valuable lesson: that despite its sham, broken dreams, suffering and disenchantment, it is still a beautiful life!\n\u00a0\nMilia Ali\u00a0is a Rabindra Sangeet exponent and a former employee of the World Bank.\n",

        "full_article": "The \"Oscar Slap\" has created a virtual cottage industry that profits from processing a particular on-stage action that took place during the 94th Academy Awards-giving gala on March 27. The internet is divided in its reactions to the incident, which is being interpreted as either male chivalry or masculine toxicity. But is it a coincidence that Will,\u00a0 who lobbied hard to smith an Oscar following his first nomination for the award some twenty years back, self-sabotaged his moment of fame by \"smacking the s***\" out of a fellow comedian (who stood like a rock) to protect the hurt feelings of his wife from a rather docile (albeit, insensitive) joke, and jeopardised his glory of being finally trophied for playing the lead role in a film on (surprise, surprise) protecting the family involving the tennis sensation Williams sisters to prove how the Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air has come a long way to become the patriarch King Richard who knows (as a dialogue in the film posits), \"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail\"? Curse me for the long sentence, but I wanted to create a spectacle to disrupt the spectacle that has been offered to us. We are dealing with spectacular Hollywood, at its best! And I want you to think beyond that provided image.\nOtherwise, how do you explain the stage intrusion of a member of the audience during a high-profile award ceremony? How do you explain the presence of the perpetrator after the violence is committed? Why wasn't he immediately escorted out of the venue? How do you explain the narration of the action by the anchor (\"Will Smith just smacked the s*** out of me\") and the consequent business-as-usual attitude after being hit by a man who is trained like a Mohammad-Ali-like boxer? How do you explain the standing ovation offered to the violator within 15 minutes after the violence took place? What is the link between the core message of the speech of\u00a0 \"protect your family\" and the interlude that preceded it?\nWhoever has stage-managed this deserves an Oscar. After all, the image of the Oscar Slap has momentarily drifted our attention from the bombing of Ukraine, the dropping of a financial nuclear bomb on the petrodollar scheme, the dark side of the mega projects in Sri Lanka that have brought the country to a halt, the no-confidence vote on Imran Khan's premiership who reportedly irked the secret society for being on the wrong side of history, the death of a young girl shot by a stray bullet of a professional killer and whose father refused to seek justice from the authority concerned, or the long lines of diarrhoea patients at ICDDR,B. Oh, did I miss out on price hikes and traffic jams (maybe I will mention them during my Jummah prayers)? The list goes on as we remain awestruck by the glitzy slap of a man protecting the honour of his wife, who has lost her hair due to a medical condition. The image affects our social relations. We try to make sense of our world by taking a bite of knowledge, the forbidden fruit that has been dished out to us with the fallacy of control over our own thoughts and actions. Even though the secret insignia is hidden out in the open as a logo on my phone, I allow its AI to regulate my behaviour.\nThe Will-power has pulled me away from the city I wanted to write about. The Will Smith action has made me reflect on the power of the image. I am looking at an image of one of our city's mayors. He is standing on a boat flowing along a freshly excavated canal in Mohammadpur that opens up to a river mouth of Buriganga. Mayor Atiqul Islam deserves our thanks for the angioplasty with which he removed the blocks and ensured flow in long-lost drains and canals, needed to keep the city alive. The media entourage with which he customarily travels quotes him to shed light on another block plaguing the flow of the city's traffic.\nI thank him for his honesty and courage in identifying two government structures responsible for blocking the incoming flow of vehicles to the city from the airport area. The bottleneck from the Mohakhali flyover has a domino effect on one of the two main roads running through the city. The Minister responsible for the two buildings has been musing over finding an underground solution to the traffic problem. Of course, millions of taka need to be spent on the feasibility studies before anything concrete can be said on this topic. Maybe such studies can also explore how certain portions of Dhaka can be demilitarised to create more civil thoroughfares. Those in service may not feel the urgency now\u2014but once they retire, they too will realise how their game of golf is blocking the two main roads of Dhaka city from meeting just like the two tall buildings near the flyover are.\nThe image of a mayor standing on a boat in freshly furrowed water makes me think of the illegal buildings and constructions he had to demolish to unblock the canal. Can we think of similar unblocking for our roads? Sometimes you need to self-sabotage to draw attention to something that you aspire to. Sometimes you need to resort to or orchestrate violence to garner support for your cause. Will Smith, if you ask me, used theatricality to pitch his film on \"protecting one's family.\" Our mayor's boat trip, for me, has the potential to pitch the idea of \"unblocking.\"\nWe have seen the image-saturated mass media and the message that it wants us to consume. Whether the message will be manifested or not is another debate altogether.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "A beautiful baid may soon turn into a little artificial lake in Modhupur forest area. Baid is low land to grow rice and other crops in, between chala (high) land with sal stands. Baid and chala with reddish soil are special features of Modhupur Garh. In large parts of Modhupur forest, sal and hundreds of other native species have been replaced by the plantation of exotic acacia, pineapple, banana and spices. And thus, the beauty of baid and chala with sal stands has disappeared in most parts of Modhupur sal forest.\nIn one such baid, running west to east from Dokhola Range office, the Forest department is building a two-story guesthouse. It wants to dig a small lake (200 feet by 800 feet) on nearly four acres of this land to be used by the guests for recreational purposes. The wild animals will also come to quench their thirst at the lake, claims a top forest official.\nA few Garo families owning this baid (on the basis of customary rights) are unwilling to give up the land that they have been using for generations. The Garos, indeed, have been living in this area since\u00a0 before the creation of the Forest Department and they used to get patta (yearly lease) and pattan (long-term lease) from the Zamindars for it. The de facto owners of the baid claim they paid taxes for this land in the past. However, since the land was gazetted as forest land and the area declared part of the Modhupur National Park, they could not pay land taxes anymore. The Garos and other locals, around 90 percent without title deeds for the land they live on and use, are thus entangled in conflict with the Forest Department, who now claim jurisdiction over all gazetted land.\nIn September last year, I met some of the owners of the baid and they all stood strongly against the plan to dig a small artificial lake on the agricultural land they use. \"The government's plan to dig a lake here does not indicate any good intentions,\" said Dipen Nokrek (65) who claims owning 2.4 acres of land in the baid. Belly Nokrek (27), another Garo who claims owning 71 decimals of land said with confidence, \"I do not want a lake here. If the government wants to dig a lake here without our consent, we will stage protests.\"\nFor months, a tug-of-war has been going on between the Garos and the Forest Department. The Garos are divided on the lake issue. Some are for it, but most are against it or are sceptical.\nThe FD, politicians and administrations are trying to convince the Garos to give up a bit of this baid for the lake. \"They have promised some compensation for the land,\" says Eugin Nokrek, president of Joyenshahi Adivasi Unnayan Parisad, the premier Garo social organisation in Modhupur. \"But we have not yet decided. If proper compensation is given and our other demands are met, we may give consent.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In a meeting on March 19, attended by politicians and higher-ups in the local administrations and the forest department, the DC has offered a compensation of Taka five lacs, which is too small an amount,\" reports Nokrek, who attended the meeting. \"We will discuss among ourselves and get back to them.\"\nWhy a tiny, artificial lake?\nModhupur is thoroughly despoiled. The sylvan aroma is gone. In most parts, there are orchards of banana, pineapple, papaya, spices and lemon. Deforestation is not a new phenomenon. But what we have seen since the mid-1980s, with the advent of rubber plantation and then plantation of exotic species under the guise of social forestry, is rapid destruction of traditional sal forest patches in Modhupur and elsewhere. The so-called social forestry has also caused massive loss of natural forest patches in the south-eastern districts of the country.\nIt is under the forestry projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that so-called co-management of forests was introduced in Modhupur from the 1990s. While the ADB-funded forestry projects have been proven to have caused\u00a0 colossal damage resulting in it suspending all its operations in the forestry sector since 2005, social forestry practices continue. Currently, the Forest Department is implementing a World Bank-funded project worth USD 175 million called Sustainable Forests & Livelihoods (SUFAL). The World Bank-funded project is controversial in that it promotes collaborative forest management, a model close to co-management that has not brought the desired good to our forests. However, the forestry projects with concessional loans from the international financial institutions bring huge financial benefits to the project-mongers.\nThe\u00a0 guest house at Dokhola and the lake\u2014or the pond, to be more accurate\u2014are reported to be part of a purely government-funded project, titled, \"Modhupur eco-tourism development and sustainable management with help of local people and tribals.\" The FD officials confirmed that the guest house and lake are part of an arboretum plantation on three hectares of land in the Sadar Beat of National Park Sadar Range.\nWhile around half of Modhupur sal forest has been consumed by pineapple, banana and spices orchards, setting up a tiny kind of botanical garden brings no hope for the protection of trees. The people of Modhupur have witnessed how the so-called social forestry projects have caused ecocide. Social forestry eventually led to pineapple, banana, papaya, spice plantations and\u00a0 has not even spared the Charaljani Forest Research Centre. Not long ago, the 400-acre research centre had very good coverage of local and foreign species of trees. The research centre, established in 1967, has now been reduced to hardly 20 acres and it is difficult to determine if it is a forest research centre at all anymore.\u00a0\nThe state of a medicinal garden (established in 2003) neighbouring Charaljani Forest Research Centre does not demonstrate meaningful practice, either. The plantation under SUFAL has also surprised the local people when the understory vegetation of the sal forest patches had been cleared and saplings of some local fruits and other species were planted. Common people are fed-up of all these while the traders and politically influential people have been making huge profits out of fruit and spice plantations on forest land.\nThey see the concept of an arboretum with a guest house and a tiny lake as a joke. Many question why a beautiful baid with a natural environment has to become a lake. Can't those staying in the guest house be satisfied with the existing natural environment around? If they want to see water, they can go to Gorgora lake near Lohoria Beat, which was dug in the 1980s. It is now abandoned and some infrastructure built around it has also eroded. Guests can also take a motorbike ride from Dokhola to Rasulpur and see the remaining sal forest patches. They can also trek through rubber plantations to see the \"green desert\"!\nThe Dokhola Forest Range Office premises looked so much better with a few tin-shed cottages. Part of our constitution was written here in 1972. Our Father of the Nation spent a few days at the Dokhola Rest House in January 1971 as well. This is a glorious piece of history that everyone should know. But nowadays, a huge security gate has been constructed at the entrance of the premises. The beautiful landscape looks clumsy now. The air does not flow normally. A two-storey guest house with a couple of rooms and an artificial lake will further congest the environment and restrict general people's entrance to the area. A mud road that the Garos take through Dokhola Range office to Dokhola Bazar will probably be blocked. The people of Chunia, a pure Garo village, will be adversely affected.\nThe Garos of Modhupur in general are strong supporters of Bangladesh Awami League. They revere the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, from their hearts. Their participation in the War of Liberation in 1971 was noteworthy. Yet, they are being made to surrender around four acres of baid land when they have leased a large percentage of their chala land for commercial plantation of banana, pineapple, papaya and spices.\nThe Garos may surrender the land for the lake in the end, in exchange for some compensation, but it will not be done voluntarily. The Garos have many demands, foremost of them is recognition of their customary land rights, which the state denies. We can only hope the government will do justice to Modhupur and the peace-loving Garos in consideration of bitter experiences with forestry projects and the colossal damage, including ecocide, that these have caused.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPhilip Gain is a researcher and director at the Society for Environment and Human Development (SEHD).

        "full_article": "What is happening surrounding the declaration of results of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) election has crossed the bounds of the election laws and bylaws of this important association of about 8,000 lawyers. The election was held on March 15-16 to fill 14 executive posts, including those of the president and secretary. But to the utter surprise of all, the election results haven't been made public even after over two weeks.\nThis is not just unprecedented but also quite unfortunate. The impasse apparently began when some Awami League-backed lawyers objected to vote counting on March 17 and allegedly exerted pressure on the election subcommittee head to tender his resignation. There have been allegations of misbehaviour with him by the pro-AL lawyers, who, however, refuted the allegations and instead accused BNP lawyers of the same. The pro-AL lawyers have been demanding fresh counting of votes cast for the post of SCBA secretary over claims of irregularities.\nWe are quite perturbed by the emerging situation at the SCBA and the unhelpful blame game by the AL and BNP camps of lawyers in a bid to keep their stranglehold on the association. It is, however, good to hear that the incumbent SCBA executive committee has decided to invite all former presidents and secretaries to a meeting to resolve the standoff in the next seven days or so. We believe the idea of consultation with the past presidents and secretaries is a judicious move to reach an amicable settlement. Also, a neutral probe by a competent body can bring out in the open why a senior member of the committee, who has a history of conducting free, fair and peaceful elections for the SCBA, had to resign at such a crucial time.\nPeople in general look up to the law practitioners as embodiments of righteousness, justice and honesty whom they can trust with their legal issues at times of crisis. As such, people generally expect law practitioners to be well-disciplined and show utmost restraint and neutrality when it comes to taking part in an election of their own. What has happened at the SCBA is thus unfortunate and disgraceful, to say the least. We hope the wise heads will help to overcome the hurdle and reinstate the good name of the SCBA.\n",

        "full_article": "It is really embarrassing, for those who care, how time and cost overruns have become a near-routine affair in government projects undertaken in Bangladesh. The most recent example of this can be seen in the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) projects. While the RHD has claimed that 44 of its ongoing projects will reach completion by this fiscal year, documents have revealed that only three of them would actually end within their original deadlines. The majority of the other 41 projects missed their initial deadlines more than two years ago, with some delayed by three to four years.\nAmong the various government departments and ministries, the RHD has become notorious for regularly failing to complete projects on time and within the initial cost estimate. An evaluation report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division on 49 projects, completed in FY 2016-17, shows that 41 of them saw both time extensions and cost escalations. This just goes to show the persistent weaknesses of the RHD in implementing such work. Unfortunately, the higher authorities seem unconcerned by how much public resources get wasted as a result, or how long the people are denied benefits that they would have gotten had those projects been finished successfully.\nDespite the media harping on this issue ad nauseam, nothing seems to change. The prime minister, frustrated by this situation, had clearly directed public officials in 2020 to bring an end to this practice. Last year, having seen no improvement, she directed the authorities to take legal action against those responsible for flawed project designs that ultimately push up costs. Yet, almost no one has been held responsible for these delays. As a result, lack of proper feasibility studies and cost estimations, long postponements in tender process, and the tendency to divide project work in \"small packages\" (to benefit influential but non-professional contractors) still continue to stall project completion.\nDoes the PM's word not mean anything to the authorities? Does the endless suffering of people, or the constant wastage of their money, mean nothing? Are we to take this trend as a fait accompli? The RHD itself had proven, with a project undertaken in 2013, that completing a project on time while saving cost is possible. Then, why can't the RHD and other ministries repeat that?\nWe are once again forced to call upon the government high-ups and repeat to them how important it is to hold those responsible for these delays and consequent cost overruns to account. Unless these people and firms are given exemplary punishment, we fear that this unsavoury story will continue repeating itself again and again, causing immeasurable harm to our country's development potential.\n",
