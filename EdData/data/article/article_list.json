The BJP, which had won only 13 of the 40 Assembly seats, cobbled up a coalition with the two main regional parties, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Goa Forward Party (GFP), and two Independents to form the government under Manohar Parrikar, outsmarting the Congress that had emerged as the single largest party with 17 seats. As the State saunters to the next Assembly election, the Congress is left with only two MLAs. Most of the others have crossed over to the BJP, which discarded its original partners, the MGP and the GFP, along the way. This time, the MGP has tied up with the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC), and the Vijai Sardesai-led GFP is in alliance with the Congress. The MGP at present has one and the GFP two MLAs in the Assembly. The 2022 Assembly election has been spiced up with the entry of the TMC, and vigorous campaigning by Arvind Kejrwal\u2019s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is looking to improve its dismal performance in the 2017 Goa Assembly election when the party failed to win even a single seat. An alliance of the NCP and Shiv Sena is also in the fray. Despite being the largest party numerically, the BJP led by Pramod Sawant is being buffeted by the winds of anti-incumbency: a number of the Government\u2019s ministers have been tainted by scams, while the State faces the challenges of unemployment and the economic slump resulting from the pandemic. The BJP\u2019s apparent strategy to consolidate the Hindus comprising more than 60% of the total populace has resulted in the exit of three Catholic MLAs, including Cabinet Minister Michael Lobo. This may signify a reversal of the Parrikar approach of reaching out to the Catholics. It may not be a coincidence that the BJP is also sidelining his loyalists, even angering the Saraswat community that he belonged to. The BJP is facing resentment among old-timers who were neglected in favour of defectors from other parties. The AAP strategy involves bountiful welfare promises and community appeals. Its CM candidate is a member from the Bhandari community \u2014 the largest electoral bloc in Goa, comprising more than 30% of the population. The Congress is playing it low-key, hoping to ride on anti-incumbency, and counting on its deep connect with voters to ride back to power. Like the BJP, it has been projecting the TMC and AAP as outside parties with no roots in the State. Goa politics has been in a churn during the last five years. The Assembly election is a chance for renewal and fresh beginnings.",

        "full_article": "Almost 11 months after the United States\u2019 leading telecommunications companies won bids for $81 billion worth of C-band radio spectrum to roll out 5G services, the much-awaited introduction hit a major snag this week after the country\u2019s leading airlines warned of massive flight disruptions if the wireless technology was put into operation, especially around the nation\u2019s airports. In a compromise on the eve of the planned roll-out on January 19, AT&T and Verizon agreed to delay introduction of the new wireless service near key airports. The two major telcos\u2019 commitments notwithstanding, several domestic and international airlines flying to the U.S. have announced major rescheduling as well as the possibility of cancellation of flights to several destinations citing warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aircraft makers that accurate functioning of radar altimeters in some aircraft may be affected by the 5G radio frequencies. The altimeters provide information on an aircraft\u2019s altitude and are a crucial part of flight operations for pilots, particularly while seeking to make low-visibility landings in inclement weather. At the heart of the impasse lies the fact that both the 5G services and some flight equipment operate on the same C-band radio spectrum, with only the frequencies varying. The FAA has said it is working with altimeter manufacturers to evaluate data from the wireless companies to determine how robust each model is, and, if required, have the devices retrofitted or replaced.The fact that the world\u2019s largest economy is now faced with the risk of large-scale domestic and international air travel disruptions as a result of the relatively belated roll-out of 5G telecom services points to the peculiar problems of the U.S. market, including the particular frequencies allotted there for 5G. South Korea, China and Japan and several European nations have already successfully rolled out 5G services and the U.S. telcos have cited the lack of problems in these jurisdictions as evidence that the FAA and airlines need to do more to find solutions to the deployment of the wireless technology near airports. The FAA on its website has pointed to the specifics of the proposed 5G roll-out in the U.S. with a comparison to the situation in France and asserted that some key differences pose challenges. For one, the aviation regulator contends planned buffer zones for U.S. airports only protect the last 20 seconds of flight, while in France the last 96 seconds of flight are protected from any interruption from 5G signals. Also, 5G power levels are lower in France, with even the planned temporary nationwide lower power levels in the U.S. still expected to be 2.5 times more powerful. U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration will have their task cut out in pushing to hammer out a long-term solution to this impasse so as to minimise any further disruption to the already pandemic-hit global travel and trade sectors.",

        "full_article": "In a first-of-its-kind study, the Economic Relations Division (ERD) under the finance ministry found that around 1.6 million young people lost their jobs and about 20 million youths faced income loss due to the pandemic. No doubt the pandemic has been extremely difficult for young people\u2014as well as people of other age groups\u2014around the world. But the study acknowledged that it has been particularly brutal for Bangladesh's youth labour force.\nPart of that obviously has to do with the lockdowns that the government had imposed to contain Covid-19 transmission, and the resulting economic losses. Another part has to do with the unequal recovery that we have experienced. For example, cottage, micro, small and medium enterprises (CMSMEs), which account for 98 percent of all firms and half of all jobs, have been able to access only around Tk 15,000 crore of the Tk-40,000-crore stimulus packages allocated by the government. Meanwhile, large firms have gained access to the majority of the funds that the government set aside for them.\nThis disparity in disbursement of funds under the stimulus programme is the main obstacle to a comprehensive economic recovery and sustainable job creation, according to former Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed.\nIn order to overcome the prevailing crisis, government dole-outs or enhanced safety net programmes cannot continue forever; hence, it is the creation of more jobs that matters the most. However, the pandemic alone is not the only factor that is of concern in regards to the creation of more jobs, particularly for young people.\nEven before the pandemic began, Bangladesh was struggling to create jobs and exciting new opportunities for its younger population. According to the Labour Force Survey, 2016-17, youth unemployment in the country (12.3 percent) far surpassed overall unemployment (4.2 percent)\u2014even though the latter (as per the official data) was shockingly as low as in countries such as Switzerland and the US, which some economists deemed very unrealistic. Moreover, during that time, the rate of job creation had already slowed down at a worrying rate: between 2013 and 2016-17, while the average annual GDP growth was 6.6 percent, the average annual growth of jobs was only 0.9 percent.\nLack of long-term and innovative planning are partly to blame for this. But so are bad governance and widespread corruption. The fact that Bangladesh has continually done poorly in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking shows how the business environment has been hampered by these and other factors.\nCorruption and poor governance are always serious drawbacks for business. Corrupt groups and individuals who curry favours from the government not only get \"special\" benefits that allow them to dominate the business landscape without having to operate more efficiently, but they also create barriers to entry for more skilled competition, which leads to the creation of monopolies and less jobs. The social cost that arises as a result of such corruption far outweighs what is easily detectable on the surface.\nBesides the increased unemployment and income loss, about two million college students and one million university students are also facing serious uncertainties about their future. And as more young people sit idle at home, they are also developing various health problems such as sleep disorders, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, which will have long-term health and economic implications for them and for society as a whole.\nWhereas one would expect the youth to be more productive and the biggest source of innovation, the pandemic, along with the lack of space that we have traditionally reserved for them, is stifling their creativity from freely flowing and changing society for the better. Not only are our young people suffering as a consequence, but so is everyone else.\nThe most unfortunate part is that our young people actually want to get involved and help. According to a survey done by the ERD, the topmost priority of our adolescents is to help other people, while a significant area of their dreams and aspirations are related to the prosperity of society and the country.\nAnd the same survey acknowledges that there is no other alternative but to create an environment in Bangladesh where the next generation can raise their voice, make themselves heard and exercise their agency.\nIn regards to the pandemic, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has warned that unless action is taken to tackle the way it has affected young people's employment opportunities, many of them could continue to struggle for decades. But the problem we have is much bigger\u2014it is one of giving young people the opportunity to truly and freely get involved, and feel a sense of ownership of this country, which they are being denied by the power-obsessed who simply cannot tolerate seeing others gain any kind of opportunities or freedom.\nAnd that, most definitely, will hold back the progress of Bangladesh for decades, which is why we need to see a change fast.\n\u00a0\nEresh Omar Jamal is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "The piece \"No 'crossfire' deaths since US sanctions\" published in this newspaper on January 11 will definitely engage all thinking minds, especially those entrusted with the maintenance of law and public order. It would appear from the report that human rights bodies are of the opinion that the so-called \"crossfires\" incidents happen due to establishment policy and strategy and that the same stop or decrease sharply after public outcry or condemnation of such mode of operation of the law enforcement agency. A serving official has said that a \"crossfire\" takes place when the situation so warrants and the increase or decrease of such engagement is dependent upon objective conditions, meaning that law enforcers resort to \"crossfire\" only in self-defence.\nIn view of the above diametrically opposite views on \"crossfires\", it is necessary in public interest to take a serious look into matters and understand the different ramifications.\nMany consider \"crossfires\" to be extrajudicial murders that have been authoritatively encouraged. There is good reason to agree with such a view as so-called crossfires continued unabated during the democratic dispensation of 2001-2006. During the caretaker interval, there were comparatively fewer \"crossfires\". However, the return of democracy since early 2009 has not been able to put an effective stop to the suspected extrajudicial killings.\nUnder the circumstances, should citizens believe that lawless enforcement officials are in great demand when lawlessness and disorder prevail? Alternatively, is belief in the rule of law unnecessary? Don't we need to put sustained efforts into achieving substantial results in the long run? Why are we obsessed with \"spectacular results\" that are in fact illusory?\nEulogising or praising \"crossfire\" actions has created a worrying environment wherein result-oriented investigating officers are increasingly getting inclined to resort to short-cut methods to please political heavyweights. The worst aspect of this is the possibility that an alleged criminal or ordinary suspect may easily get caught up in a \"crossfire\" while ulterior motives are served.\nSince most \"crossfire\" deaths are not seriously investigated to find proof of one's suspected culpability, the culprits in the enforcement and investigative apparatus achieve a macabre win-win situation. Elements of accountability and fear recede into the background and investigation becomes a pathetically low priority.\nProfessionally speaking, this is an instance of heightened jeopardy because, in Bangladesh, the crime-fighting machinery already stands accused of not cultivating a scientific modus operandi and quite often relapsing into untenable third-degree methods.\nThe question is: Do we want sustained labourious action under the law to strengthen our democratic foundation or do we need rash, desperate action without the cover of law?\nThe ultimate punishment for alleged \"crossfires\", the credibility of which many are not convinced of, appears as a summary response from desperate executives of law enforcement. The legality of actions leading to such an extreme apart, any responsible citizen might like to know if in our often overzealous anti-crime operations, we are just treating symptoms without venturing to study and assess the objective conditions promoting criminality.\nWe do not need sociologists and criminologists to tell us that present-day crime is a complex social phenomenon caused by a multiplicity of factors, and determining culpability is an extremely mind-exacting task.\nOften, the fun-seeking delinquent of yesteryears turns into the uncontrollable don of the day due to the patronage of powerful quarters and the unexplained inaction of law enforcement. Therefore, when \"crossfires\" cause deaths, some myopic elements may be satisfied, but a civilised society\u2014which wishes to live by the cannons of law\u2014cannot but be concerned.\nWhat we need is adequate provision for witness protection and victim support in the criminal justice administration, alongside hefty government funds. Any further delay in achieving this will only swell the ranks of summary justice seekers and admirers of vigilante action. The decapitating adversity of the victims of crime demands mainstream support from the system.\nThe rule of law and criminal jurisprudence may appear to be unequivocally in favour of offenders, criminals, and the law-breakers\u2014but that does not automatically allow for resorting to illegal measures. A civilised government must strive to demonstrate that law enforcement effectiveness and civil liberties can co-exist in a society governed by the rule of law.\n\u00a0\nMuhammad Nurul Huda\u00a0is a former IGP of Bangladesh Police.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "In two weeks' time, China will celebrate the advent of spring in the lunar new year, the Year of the Tiger. In Chinese culture, the tiger symbolises bravery and strength, as the Chinese people often refer to spirited dragon and dynamic tiger, or soaring dragon and leaping tiger. To meet the severe challenges facing humanity, we must \"add wings to the tiger\" and act with the courage and strength of the tiger to overcome all obstacles on our way forward. We must do everything necessary to clear the shadow of the pandemic and boost economic and social recovery and development, so that the sunshine of hope may light up the future of humanity.\nThe world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. These changes, not limited to a particular moment, event, country or region, represent the profound and sweeping changes of our times. As changes of the times combine with the once-in-a-century pandemic, the world finds itself in a new period of turbulence and transformation. How to beat the pandemic and how to build the post-Covid world? These are major issues of common concern to people around the world. They are also major, urgent questions we must give answers to.\nAs a Chinese saying goes, \"The momentum of the world either flourishes or declines; the state of the world either progresses or regresses.\" The world is always developing through the movement of contradictions; without contradiction, nothing would exist. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times.\nNotwithstanding all vicissitudes, humanity will move on. We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amid crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges.\nFirst, we need to embrace cooperation and jointly defeat the pandemic. Confronted by the once-in-a-century pandemic, which will affect the future of humanity, the international community has fought a tenacious battle. Facts have shown once again that amid the raging torrents of a global crisis, countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which our shared destiny hinges. Small boats may not survive a storm, but a giant ship is strong enough to brave a storm. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the international community, major progress has been made in the global fight against the pandemic. That said, the pandemic is proving to be a protracted one, resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before. It poses a serious threat to people's safety and health, and exerts a profound impact on the global economy.\nStrong confidence and cooperation represent the only right way to defeat the pandemic. Holding each other back or shifting blame would only cause needless delay in response and distract us from the overall objective. Countries need to strengthen international cooperation against Covid-19, carry out active cooperation on research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defence against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all. Of particular importance is to fully leverage vaccines as a powerful weapon, ensure their equitable distribution, quicken vaccination, and close the global immunisation gap, so as to truly safeguard people's lives, health and livelihoods.\nChina is a country that delivers on its promises. China has already sent over two billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organisations. Still, China will provide another one billion doses to African countries, including 600 million doses as donation, and will also donate 150 million doses to the Asean countries.\nSecond, we need to resolve various risks and promote steady recovery of the world economy. The world economy is emerging from the depths, yet it still faces many constraints. The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted. Commodity prices continue to rise. Energy supply remains tight. These risks compound one another and heighten the uncertainty about economic recovery. The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slam on the brakes or take a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt of it. In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 response, we need to explore new drivers of economic growth, new modes of social life, and new pathways for people-to-people exchange, in a bid to facilitate cross-border trade, keep industrial and supply chains secure and smooth, and promote steady and solid progress in global economic recovery.\nEconomic globalisation is the trend of the times. Though countercurrents are sure to exist in a river, no one can stop it from flowing to the sea. Driving forces bolster the river's momentum, and resistance may yet enhance its flow. Despite the countercurrents and dangerous shoals along the way, economic globalisation has never and will not veer off course. Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy. We should guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice, and uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its centre. We should make generally acceptable and effective rules for artificial intelligence and digital economy on the basis of full consultation, and create an open, just and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological innovation. This is the way to make economic globalisation more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy.\nA common understanding among us is that to turn the world economy from crisis to recovery, it is imperative to strengthen macro-policy coordination. Major economies should see the world as one community, think in a more systematic way, increase policy transparency and information sharing, and coordinate the objectives, intensity and pace of fiscal and monetary policies, so as to prevent the world economy from plummeting again. Major developed countries should adopt responsible economic policies, manage policy spillovers, and avoid severe impacts on developing countries. International economic and financial institutions should play their constructive role to pool global consensus, enhance policy synergy, and prevent systemic risks.\nThird, we need to bridge the development divide and revitalise global development. The process of global development is suffering from severe disruption, entailing more outstanding problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault lines, and a technological divide. The Human Development Index has declined for the first time in 30 years. The world's poor population has increased by more than 100 million. Nearly 800 million people live in hunger. Difficulties are mounting in food security, education, employment, medicine, health and other areas important to people's livelihoods. Some developing countries have fallen back into poverty and instability due to the pandemic. Many in developed countries are also living through a hard time.\nNo matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centred philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and centre in global macro-policies, realise the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide. We need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, promote international cooperation on climate change in the context of development, and implement the outcomes of COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Developed economies should take the lead in honouring their emission reduction responsibilities, deliver on their commitment of financial and technological support, and create the necessary conditions for developing countries to address climate change and achieve sustainable development.\nLast year, I put forward a Global Development Initiative at the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the pressing challenges faced by developing countries. The initiative is a public good open to the whole world, which aims to form synergy with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and boost common development across the world. China stands ready to work with all partners to jointly translate the initiative into concrete actions and make sure that no country is left behind in this process.\nFourth, we need to discard the Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes. Our world today is far from being tranquil; rhetorics that stoke hatred and prejudice abound. Acts of containment, suppression or confrontation arising thereof do all harm, not the least good, to world peace and security. History has proven time and again that confrontation does not solve problems\u2014it only invites catastrophic consequences. Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one; they ultimately hurt the interests of others as well as one's own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history. Naturally, countries have divergences and disagreements between them. Yet, a zero-sum approach that enlarges one's own gain at the expense of others will not help. Acts of single-mindedly building \"exclusive yards with high walls\" or \"parallel systems,\" of enthusiastically putting together exclusive small circles or blocs that polarise the world, of overstretching the concept of national security to hold back economic and technological advances of other countries, and of fanning ideological antagonism and politicising or weaponising economic, scientific and technological issues, will gravely undercut international efforts to tackle common challenges.\nThe right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation. Different countries and civilisations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences.\nWe should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics.\nLast year, the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding. Through a century of tenacious struggle, the CPC has rallied and led the Chinese people in accomplishing remarkable achievements in the advancement of the nation and betterment of people's lives. We have realised a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and won the battle against poverty, both according to plan, and found a historic solution to ending absolute poverty. Now, China is marching on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects.\nChina will stay committed to pursuing high-quality development. The Chinese economy enjoys a good momentum overall. Last year, our GDP grew by around eight percent, achieving the dual target of fairly high growth and relatively low inflation. Shifts in the domestic and international economic environment have brought tremendous pressure, but the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, characterised by strong resilience, enormous potential and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. We have every confidence in the future of China's economy.\n\"The wealth of a country is measured by the abundance of its people.\" Thanks to considerable economic growth, the Chinese people are living much better lives. Nonetheless, we are soberly aware that to meet people's aspiration for an even better life, we still have much hard work to do in the long run. China has made it clear that we strive for more visible and substantive progress in the well-rounded development of individuals, and the common prosperity of the entire population. We are working hard on all fronts to deliver this goal. The common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism. To use an analogy, we will first make the pie bigger, and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements. As a rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will get a fair share from development, and development gains will benefit all our people in a more substantial and equitable way.\nChina will stay committed to reform and opening up. For China, reform and opening up is always a work in process. Whatever change in the international landscape, China will always hold high the banner of reform and opening up. China will continue to let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, and see to it that the government plays its role better. We will be steadfast in consolidating and developing the public sector, just as we are steadfast in encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector. We will build a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system, where all businesses enjoy equal status before the law and have equal opportunities in the marketplace. All types of capital are welcome to operate in China in compliance with laws and regulations, and play a positive role for the development of the country. China will continue to expand high-standard opening up, steadily advance institutional opening up that covers rules, management and standards, deliver national treatment for foreign businesses, and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. With the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) on January 1 this year, China will faithfully fulfil its obligations and deepen economic and trade ties with other RCEP parties. China will also continue to work for the joining of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), with a view to further integrating into the regional and global economy and achieving mutual benefit and win-win results.\nChina will stay committed to promoting ecological conservation. As I have said many times, we should never grow the economy at the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation, which is like draining a pond to get fish; nor should we sacrifice growth to protect the environment, which is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Guided by our philosophy that clean waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver, China has carried out holistic conservation and systematic governance of its mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands, and deserts. We do everything we can to conserve the ecological system, intensify pollution prevention and control, and improve the living and working environment for our people. China is now putting in place the world's largest national park system. Last year, we successfully hosted COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity, contributing China's share to a clean and beautiful world.\nAchieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality are the intrinsic requirements of China's own high-quality development, and a solemn pledge to the international community. China will honour its word and keep working towards its goal. We have unveiled an Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking before 2030, to be followed by implementation plans for specific sectors such as energy, industry and construction. China now has the world's biggest carbon market and biggest clean power generation system: the installed capacity of renewable energy has exceeded one billion kilowatts, and the construction of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts is well under way. Carbon peak and carbon neutrality cannot be realised overnight. Through solid and steady steps, China will pursue an orderly phase-down of traditional energy in the course of finding reliable substitution in new energy. This approach, which combines phasing out the old and bringing in the new, will ensure steady economic and social development. China will also actively engage in international cooperation on climate and jointly work for a complete transition to a greener economy and society.\nDavos is known as a heaven for winter sports. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will open soon. We are confident that China will present a streamlined, safe and splendid Games to the world. The official motto for Beijing 2022 is \"Together for a Shared Future.\" Indeed, let us join hands with full confidence, and work together for a shared future.\n\u00a0\nXi Jinping is the president of the People's Republic of China.

        "full_article": "It is a matter of common sense that a university is supposed to create space and opportunities to generate knowledge, open up scopes for creative ideas and thinking, invite questions against the existing knowledge and system, and raise voices against injustice, discrimination and oppression. From this perspective, students and teachers walk the same path, where teachers have a greater responsibility to ensure a proper environment and create the space for students to become active thinkers. Teachers should be friends, philosophers and guides to their young students, and also be open to questions and differences of opinions.\nUnfortunately, we are witnessing a completely different scenario in Bangladesh now, where critical thinking and voices raised against injustice and corruption are suppressed even at public universities. The recent incident of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) is a reflection of that.\nThis is how it started: female students of SUST were peacefully demanding solutions to some long-standing problems regarding daily meals and the environment of the halls. But the situation snowballed quickly as the residential hall authorities and university administration responded first with misbehaviour, then with threat, and then by unleashing ruling party activists and later police on the students.\nA university administration is supposed to look after the well-being of its students. But in our universities, as far as the administration is concerned, they look at students through the lens of power. The vast majority of students are of little importance to the administration. But then there is a small section of students affiliated with the student wing of the ruling party, who terrorise the campus, forcibly occupy the residential halls or control the distribution of seats in the halls, and so on. This group is seen to be in close terms with the administration. The latter uses the former in various ways to protect their own interests, and as such, succumbs to all their demands.\nUniversity authorities are supposed to maintain close relations with all their students, and be responsive to all their problems. But it is unfortunate that when university students in Bangladesh voice legitimate issues or concerns that affect them, teachers and the university administrations either ignore them or react with annoyance or anger to their plight. On the other hand, when it comes to the terror tactics employed by the ruling party activists, the administration is conspicuously silent. Rather, they hand over the control of the halls to the student wing of the ruling party and allow them to extort money from various construction projects and surrounding areas. This discrimination is rampant in all university campuses across this country. We saw this tragic situation take a horrible turn when we saw police suppression of student protests with the permission of or at the behest of the administration.\nIt is inconceivable that teachers can endorse violent attacks on their own students. It is possible that students might have problems with some of their teachers. But the role of a teacher is to listen to the students' grievances and engage with them in a constructive manner. Instead of doing that, they allowed students to be attacked\u2014not just by the police, but also by the student activists of the ruling party.\nIf we are to believe that the SUST administration was not involved in the attack on the students, they should take action against the perpetrators. However, no action has yet been taken against the attackers. This proves that the attacks were directly or indirectly provoked by the administration. It can't be an acceptable norm for a university administration to unleash ruling party activists on students one day or police the next day.\nWe have seen university VCs in our country\u2014the kind that we want to lead the highest institutions of education\u2014who resigned from their post after state forces stormed into campus and attacked students. That's what the role of the VC should be. A VC is a teacher\u2014they are not a member of the police or military. A VC is someone who should give the utmost importance to the students, who should talk to the students, who ensures that there is no terrorist or police attacks on the students. However, the main problem in our country is that the government wants the type of intuitional heads who will be loyal to them and implement all of their plans without question. Nowadays, the prerequisite for a VC is being able to surrender all of their self-esteem and being ready to work closely with corrupt, irresponsible and anti-people groups. Big construction projects have become the main area of interest for university administrations, ruling party bosses and their student leaders. The priorities of education and student interests are not on their agenda.\nNo university administration has taken any measures against criminals and the corrupt, or against violence committed by ruling party leaders. What they do is use the cadres for their own benefit, and if they face a difficult situation, they close down the university. Closing down the university is not the answer. Those who find solutions in doing so are not qualified to run university operations.\nThis problem exists all over Bangladesh. VCs and administrations are flexible towards the powers that be and rigid towards the student bodies. When students protest against injustice and corruption, they respond with anger and violence, with the help of political cadres and state forces. That cannot be the environment of a university where learning and free thinking is valued.\nUniversities should be run by putting knowledge-sharing and the interests of general students at the forefront. Therefore, teachers should be teachers first and last. The SUST authorities should reopen the university soon after meeting all the demands voiced by the students, and ensure an environment appropriate for higher learning.\n\u00a0\nAnu Muhammad is a professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University.\n",

As a parent, you have to teach a child to stand and walk and talk, to make decisions for themselves. As a parent, you then have to teach yourself to stand by as they make mistakes and hopefully learn from those, while you know for a fact that if only they listened to you, if only they did things exactly the way you told them to do, the children would be so much better off. Or so it may seem.\nThe thing with strict, overbearing parenting is that it makes complete sense from the parents' point of view. But weird as it may be to have to say this out loud, children are people. They have their own points of view, and the sad thing is that way too many parents don't want to respect this fact. \u00a0\nParenting is a ridiculously important aspect of the human experience, it's a skill that is not looked at closely enough when people talk about families and the future. They really should.\n\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "It is quite alarming that open electrical lines going right through the Lawachhara forest are turning into a death trap for different species of wildlife there. As a protected forest, it is supposed to be a safe place for animals, and having such uncovered lines is clearly a danger to them. This makes us wonder why this hasn't crossed the minds of the forest authorities, or if it has, why they haven't done anything about it.\nAccording to a report by this daily on January 19, 2022, the power line that runs through the forest in Moulvibazar's Kamalganj upazila packs 33 kilovolts, posing a constant threat to the overall biodiversity of wildlife there. When animals roam at night in search of food, they risk getting electrocuted as the power line is not insulated with non-conductive materials. According to forest officials, almost every month, there is news of at least one or two endangered wild animals getting entangled in live wires, resulting in deaths or serious injuries. The actual number could be much higher.\nExperts believe that if the animals keep dying at this rate, many of them might go extinct someday. They stressed the need to replace the existing power line with one covered with rubber or other non-conductive coating. But despite requests made to the forest department and the rural electricity office to install suitable covers, nothing of this sort has been done yet. According to the Forest Act, installation of electric poles, laying of lines and providing power connection in a forest without permission of the forest department are prohibited.\nWe must understand that the Lawachhara forest is a national treasure that needs to be protected. Seeing many inspiring examples of wildlife conservation in other countries, it is heart-breaking to see animals dying in our country because of neglect and mismanagement. We urge the relevant authorities to replace the uncovered wires in the forest for the sake of its wildlife.\n",
