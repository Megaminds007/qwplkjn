But by quickly blaming the Punjab government and the State police, the Central functionaries triggered a blame game that has forestalled the possibility of a fair and credible inquiry into the incident. Two parallel inquiries have been announced, one by the Centre and another by the State, both of which are on hold until Monday when the Supreme Court of India will hear a plea on the issue. Discussions on national security are always surcharged in India but at least this one involving the personal security of the Prime Minister should have been more tempered. Union Ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party functionaries turned this into yet another loyalty test, and resorted to hyperbole. India takes the security of its Prime Minister very seriously. After all, a sitting Prime Minister, a former Prime Minister, and the leader revered as the father of the nation are among the list of the country\u2019s assassinated leaders. The Special Protection Group (SPG), with an outlay of around \u20b9600 crore in 2020 and around 3,000 personnel has just one job \u2014 protect one person, the Prime Minister. The critical question that is to be probed is who made the decision that the Prime Minister could, and should, travel by road for more than 100 km, from Bathinda to Ferozepur and what inputs went into making that decision. Assuming that someone concluded that it was advisable for the Prime Minister to be on the road for nearly two hours, the process that preceded it must be probed. It was also decided that the Prime Minister should not be using a helicopter as was originally planned. The route was identified in advance as a contingency plan, but the decision to use it was made at the last moment \u2014 a version that both the State and Central governments agree on. Various scenarios involving miscommunication, misinformation and misjudgment are possible. Protesters who blocked the route were reportedly unaware of the Prime Minister\u2019s travel. As the Union Home Minister said, accountability must be fixed, and loopholes must be plugged. Considering the mutual distrust the State and the Centre have now public, a Supreme Court-monitored probe could be a good way to get to the bottom of the matter in a credible manner. This episode must also lead to a more efficient protocol for the Prime Minister\u2019s travel, and a repurposing of the SPG, if required. Meanwhile, loose talk, diatribe and electioneering on the issue must be shunned at all cost.",

        "full_article": "The protests that broke out in Kazakhstan on January 2 over a fuel price hike have snowballed into the biggest political crisis the oil-rich Central Asian country\u2019s leadership has faced in over three decades. Kazakhstan, which broke away from the Soviet Union to become an independent republic in 1991, has been tightly ruled by \u201cstrong men\u201d ever since. Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country\u2019s powerful leader, stepped down as President in 2019, but retained an outsize influence over the government of his cherry-picked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The capital city was named after Mr. Nazarbayev as Nur-Sultan and his statues erected across the country. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Nazarbayev, who embodies the old regime, was the centre of public anger. The protesters, chanting slogans, such as \u201cold man out\u201d, burned his statues. Shaken by the mass gatherings and violence, Mr. Tokayev took a series of swift measures to quell the unrest. He reversed the fuel price hike, sacked his Cabinet and replaced Mr. Nazarbayev as the Security Council\u2019s chair with himself. He has also requested the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization for help. A willing Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, quickly despatched troops.Not many had foreseen a crisis of this proportion coming. But Kazakhstan has witnessed growing labour and ethnic unrest in recent years. Despite its oil wealth, low salaries and poor working conditions have always been issues. Many hoped that Mr. Tokayev would bring in change. But they saw Mr. Nazarbayev continuing to pull the strings. The pandemic-induced economic slowdown and soaring inflation made matters worse. Public resentment was building up against the ruling elite over the years, and the fuel price hike did just light the fuse, triggering protests first in Zhanaozen, a city in the western Mangystau Region that had seen unrest in the recent past. It spread to other parts of the country quickly, especially to Almaty, the largest city where the mob stormed the Mayor\u2019s office. The protesters, emboldened by the concessions the regime has made, now demand political reforms. For Mr. Tokayev, this is the biggest crisis of his presidency, but also an opportunity. It is a crisis because in a country where the public was taught to adulate their rulers, the violent clashes raise both political and security challenges to the ruling elite. On the other side, it is an opportunity for the President to come out of the shadows of the old regime. The outcome of the current crisis would largely depend on the choices he would make. Dealing with the protests only through force, including with help from Russia \u2014 the Belarus model \u2014 would not resolve the underlying issues. The other option, the most sensible one, is to reach out to the angry public, hold consultations and build consensus to enter a new social contract with the people of Kazakhstan.",

        "full_article": "It was in the foothills of the Himalayas that he was born. In a bullock cart amid a snowstorm. It was in the cold chill of January, in the severest winter in Bangladesh's memory, that he died. Alone and uncared for, the frail old man shrunken with age, but with a heart as wide as the ocean, and a mind as young as the children that he loved, Golam Kasem, nicknamed Daddy, died at the tender age of 103. The single-storey yellow building at 73 Indira Road, with its unkempt garden, was home not only to Bangladesh's oldest photographer, but also the first Bengali Muslim short story writer.\nBorn on November 5, 1894, Daddy lost his mother shortly after birth. Raised by his aunt, the young man took up photography the way many young men take up many things\u2014to impress a young girl. She had promised to cook for him if he could develop a film that others had failed to. Kasem embarked with the same trait for disciplined research that he maintained till his death. He went around the studios of Medinipur to find out the method that would win him his meal. He never talked of what the meal was like, but did describe how he used a hardener to prevent the emulsion from peeling off. Saving his bus fare to school to buy a brownie camera, he began taking photographs of the things he loved most: animals, flowers and children. And most importantly, he preserved those negatives. In his archives, amid old paper sachets marked in his neat handwriting are glass plates dating back to 1915: the harbour in Calcutta, early steam engines, the Gurkha regiment in shorts, and many hardener portraits. Period pieces lit in that soft natural light that early studios used.\nGrainless negatives of people, generally in studied poses. His spontaneous pictures were those of animals and children, and among them are some gems. \"Her first dance\" is a delicate photograph of a child amid a twirl, centre stage with her family as an audience. Strong portraits of his friend, a teacher, and the calm portrait of his grandmother belie the fact that he was an amateur who took photographs for fun. He sold his first photograph at the age of 98, for Drik's 1991 calendar.\nThe founder of the Camera Recreation Club, Daddy arranged regular meetings at his house in Indira Road where the club was housed. Regular visitors included poet Sufia Kamal, painter Quamrul Hassan, and photographer Manzoor Alam Beg. His letters were hand-written, each one numbered, and the envelopes were often made of recycled newspapers or book wrappings. Competitions at the Camera Recreation Club were unusual events. Photographers who would abstain from many local competitions would submit those small 4\u2033x5\u2033 prints. And they were proud of the simple prizes they sometimes won. The prize giving was always accompanied by a cultural programme. And Daddy would always sing.\nThe room next to his bedroom was his darkroom. A red plastic bowl stuck under a light bulb\u2014his safe light. He mixed his own chemicals from old tins of chemicals. Often, I would get an SOS\u2014in the same neat handwriting, asking for potassium ferricyanide or some other chemical that he needed for his latest experiment. Photography was his passion. Once during a meeting at the Bangladesh Photographic Society (BPS), where he had been presented a new camera, Daddy spoke of how the camera he had been given would be much more than a machine to him. He talked of how he kept his camera next to his pillow when he went to sleep. How, when he was sad, he would speak to it, and that it would talk back and comfort him. Unimpressed by the modern motor-driven models, his preference was a simple manual SLR, \"preferably not too heavy,\" he would add with a mischievous smile.\nThat is not to say he was shy of technology. I remember him holding up his thick glasses to read his first email from his grandson in Canada. He asked me to come back the next day, and as I parked my bicycle by his rose garden, he was ready with his answer, again written in his neat handwriting. He was fascinated by email and used it regularly, and curious about how the message would get through the ether.\nDaddy was fiercely independent. He cooked his own meals, fed his dog and cats, and did his own shopping. Until recently, he would even go on his own to a house down the road and guide himself up the stairs to meet a lady friend whom he occasionally visited. Rarely would he talk of himself, and it was only in passing conversation with the late Nasiruddin that I discovered that Daddy was the first Bengali Muslim short story writer. He used to write regularly for \"Saogat,\" and continued to write, both technical articles on photography for the BPS newsletter, and short stories for general publication. His last manuscript, a simple manual on photography, sadly lies in my hands, unpublished. He had dearly wanted it printed before he died. The proofing was complete, the photographs selected, but \"matters of consequence\" allowed other projects to take precedence. His last note, urging me on with the publication, will forever haunt me.\nAlways articulate, on his 100th birthday, at the opening of a joint photographic exhibition by him and the other photographic guru Manzoor Alam Beg at Drik Gallery, he talked eloquently of how photography was the way for people of the world to make friends, to break barriers, to discover one another. Later as the chief guest at the opening of the 1996 World Press Photo Awards, he talked of his own struggle to overcome the limitations of an ageing body. \"My body says no, but my mind says you must, and in the end, it is the mind that wins.\" On January 9, 1998, the body finally said no and the mind took wings.\n\u00a0\nShahidul Alam\u00a0is a photographer and an activist, and founder of Drik and Pathshala South Asian Media Institute.\n\n",

        "full_article": "On December 29, 2021, India's Chief Justice NV Ramana sent out a message to the Indian media that could not have been timelier. In fact, it served as a wake-up call.\nWhile delivering his keynote speech at a journalism award ceremony in New Delhi, Ramana, who reminded us that his professional journey began as a journalist, said mixing news with views was a dangerous cocktail, and \"nothing can be more lethal to democracy than the deadly combination of confrontational polity and competitive journalism.\"\nHe also raised a few other important points related to journalism as a profession in India. The most important of his messages was his caution to journalists against ideological biases seeping into news stories, and that factual reports must keep aside interpretations and opinions. \"Allowing yourself to be co-opted by an ideology or the state is a recipe for disaster,\" the chief justice said, adding that truthful reportage was essential for a robust democracy. What he appears to be driving at is the pitfalls of highly-opinionated news dissemination, a trend that has been in India for decades but really caught on in the last decade or so. Separation of news from views, therefore, acquires more urgency today than ever before.\nIn this context, he pointed to a rising tendency in Indian media\u2014that of \"cherry-picking of facts\" to give news stories a \"certain colour.\" In fact, cherry-picking or selective presentation of facts has become a favourite tool of a section of the media trying to curry favour with the government. A classic example of this comes either in the form of a total blackout of a news story going against a ruling party, or its relegation to a less noticeable space of newspapers. It has been argued by some that it is the media's prerogative to decide which facts to include and which to leave out while presenting a story. But fair journalism cannot take shelter behind such specious arguments. For a section of the Indian media, objectivity, it seems, is no longer an option\u2014but subjectivity is.\nAnother key issue raised by the Chief Justice Ramana relates to TV discussions and interpretations of the judiciary's rulings, especially on social media, amounting to slandering the judiciary. The press must show some belief in the judiciary, and the media has the duty to defend and protect the judiciary from motivated attacks by evil forces, he said. One cannot agree more.\nIs unbiased journalism a myth? Is some bias, however subtle and nuanced, inescapable\u2014especially when the media sees itself as an important agent of reforming the ills of society and holding a mirror to different pillars of a democracy? We want myriad flowers to bloom in a democracy. But do we also want the media to let those flowers bloom by giving space to views of all shades and hues, barring the rabid elements?\nJustice Ramana's speech comes at a time when the Indian society is highly polarised along political lines. Unfortunately, a segment of the media has been sucked into taking sides, mainly due to reasons of economic survival. That is why one finds many newspapers becoming virtual outposts of ruling parties, irrespective of ideology both in states and at the centre.\nA newspaper has every right to follow its own political line and comment on the activities of all stakeholders in a democracy, including the judiciary, but it should introspect if in the process it is resorting to downright slander. The views of the media should be reflected in its editorials and commentaries with a coating of fairness, and not in its news reporting.\nReflecting on the state of Indian media today, the chairperson of the Hindu Publishing Group, Malini Parthasarathy, acknowledged in a recent interview to the \"Tricity Scoop\" portal \"the tendency of journalists to take sides, to take ideological positions.\" Of course, she also talked about pressure from governments on journalists. Those words come from someone who has risen from a city reporter to the top post of The Hindu newspaper.\nIt is often said that most journalists are not given to self-introspection. The problem arises when journalists or media houses start visualising their roles as agents of social change and mobilisers of public opinion for the better. That is where the dividing line between activism and journalism often gets blurred. Activism is not news reporting, and news reporting is not activism.\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya\u00a0is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India\n",

        "full_article": "The question in the title of this column was triggered by a press comment following our president's dialogue with National Awami Party (NAP) leaders, published on December 27, 2021. Ivy Ahmed, its executive president, quoted the president as saying, \"You are aware of my powers. I will try to materialise your demand with(in) all these limitations.\"\nSo what are our president's powers? Is he as powerless as the constitution makes him out to be? Like others, our constitution is a composite of ideals and principles and a legal framework to realise them. The spirit of democracy, freedoms, rights, economic prosperity, equality, tolerance, diversity, etc are all as much a part of the constitution as its specific articles, clauses and sub-clauses are. Seeing one delinked from the other will lead to missing the bigger picture.\nOur constitution says, \"In the exercise of all his functions, save only that of appointing the Prime Minister pursuant to Clause (3) of Article 56 and the Chief Justice pursuant to Clause (1) of Article 95, the President shall act in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.\" So, it is very clear that our president has no power save the above mentioned two.\nBut there is a bigger picture. Outside the legal powers, there is another power that the president enjoys, and in which he has no rival: moral authority. There is no other office that rivals that of the president in this regard. In fact, his office is designed to exert more moral authority than the legal ones. His most coveted status in the hierarchy of leaders, most luxurious accommodation, the best of everything that the country can afford and hundreds of staffs and perks unmatched within the country, and most significantly, his immunity from prosecution for any action or omission\u2014placing him, for all practical purposes, above law\u2014are all designed so that he is beyond all controversies and suspicion, thus protecting his pristine status. The \"moral authority\" of this office makes it the final source of justice, fair play and national stability\u2014an office to which rival political parties and contending sections of society can turn to for guidance and solution: the ultimate crisis solver.\nThat is why, even though a president is appointed by the government of the day, the office of this highest constitutional post is allowed to remain above all political play and not be seen to be used by the government for its partisan end. This, in fact, imposes an ethical responsibility on the executive branch to exert restraint, foresight and circumspection in how it relates to the office of the president.\nOur government has mostly followed this principle. But when it comes to anything to do with elections, every caution, norm and good practice are thrown to the wind.\nEven though it was done before, was it wise of the president to entangle himself in a process leading to the formation of the next Election Commission, which may be a constitutional body but has now become among the most controversial of institutions? As he was himself a part of the last \"search committee\" formation and had seen first-hand how the process worked, shouldn't he have maintained a distance, rather than getting involved again? Seen against the background of how subservient some of our past chief election commissioners (CECs) proved to be\u2014especially the last two\u2014shouldn't the president have known better?\nAfter the fall of Gen Ershad's autocratic regime in December 1990, a total of eight Election Commissions with their eight respective CECs have been appointed. Of them, three\u2014Justice Abdur Rouf, Mohammed Abu Hena, and ATM Shamsul Huda\u2014were appointed by the caretaker governments. Justice AKM Sadeq, MA Sayed, and Justice MA Aziz were appointed by the BNP. Two of them were forced to resign and only one, MA Sayed, could complete his term\u2014though amid controversy. Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad and KM Nurul Huda were appointed by the Awami League and served as the last two CECs. Their tenures faced lots of controversies not only for how they conducted the last two general elections, but also for how, in general, they ran the commission, how sensitive they were to the legitimate criticism made, how they handled the various election-related complaints lodged with them, and the arbitrary manner in which they conducted the business of the Election Commission itself. The most infamous incident occurred under Kazi Rakibuddin, when a total of 153 MPs out of a House of 300 were elected unopposed in the January 2014 election, resulting in the majority of House members getting \"elected\" without a single vote cast. Surely, a world record. In the case of the last Election Commission, in addition to all the previous complaints, there were also questions of financial impropriety, not to speak of allegations and suspicions of large-scale vote-casting the night before in the last general election held in December 2018.\nJust as in imparting justice, and also in conducting national elections, the process has to not only be correct, but also seen to be correct. An ideal many of our CECs, especially the last two, seem to have been oblivious to.\nIt is our view that by conducting the dialogue itself, and especially because he has no power to ensure its ultimate outcome, the president has allowed himself to be dragged into a process which is structurally political and inevitably controversial. This is proven by the fact that several political parties have already refused to partake in the dialogue, saying that they have no faith in the acceptability of its outcome\u2014no doubt, an embarrassment for the occupant of highest constitutional office.\nSo what options did the president have? Could he have declined to hold the dialogues? That would have been a cause of serious embarrassment for the government. But he could have negotiated some process that would have added more credibility to the outcome.\nHere, we feel, the \"Moral Authority\" of the president could have played a positive role. The government knew very well that involving the president lent enormous credibility to the process. The president, in turn, could have significantly added to the credibility of the whole exercise by ensuring that the process remained without interference. The president could have insisted that the government commit to enact a law on formation of the Election Commission within the shortest possible time. The government, we think, in deference to the importance of the president's office, would have acquiesced to that.\nAt least it was worth a try, to fulfil the letter and the spirit of our constitution.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The restrictive, illiberal trend that has come to characterise India over the last five years has a new data point. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government decided that Christmas Day was a good time to deny renewal of a licence for the Missionaries of Charity to receive foreign funding.\nFounded by Mother Teresa, whom the Catholic Church canonised in 2016, this order of Christian nuns has been operating in India since 1950. But because Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swear by a \"Hindutva\" ideology\u2014committing them to a vision of India as a Hindu nation\u2014the government has been conducting a sweeping campaign against organisations that its bigotry will not abide.\nBecause all NGOs in India need official permission to receive foreign funds for their operations in accordance with the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) of 2010, the government can wield significant power over civil society. And Modi's national security adviser, Ajit Doval, has made it clear that the government intends to use that power. In a recent speech that stunned the country, Doval singled out NGOs as \"the new frontiers of war,\" arguing that \"it is the civil society that can be subverted, suborned, divided, manipulated to hurt the interests of a nation.\"\nThe government has seized on unwanted NGOs' Achilles' heel: many are sustained in large part by international donors, foundations, and charities. Hence, in 2015, the union home ministry revoked the foreign-funding licence for Greenpeace and, in 2020, froze Amnesty International's accounts, effectively crippling their Indian operations. In June 2021, it did the same to the highly respected Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.\nBut while these secular groups were targeted for their liberal policy orientations and human rights work, the government has reserved a special level of hostility for foreign-funded religious NGOs, which it suspects of trying to convert unwitting Hindus.\nIn the action against Missionaries of Charity, Modi and the BJP have broken sharply from previous Indian governments, all of which hailed Mother Teresa's noble (and Nobel Prize-winning) work ministering to the poor, dying, and destitute.\nIn response to media queries about the Missionaries of Charity decision, the home ministry claimed that \"some adverse inputs were noticed\" while reviewing the charity's renewal application. In December, a police complaint was filed against the organisation in Gujarat, alleging that the Missionaries were forcing Hindu girls to convert. But the group denies the allegations, insisting that it has \"not converted anyone or forced anyone to marry into the Christian faith.\" Formal charges have yet to be filed in court.\nWhile the government has made clear that it will crack down on efforts to use charity as an inducement for conversion, the targeted organisations have made equally clear that they do nothing of the kind. There is a widespread perception that only Christian and Muslim organisations face critical scrutiny, whereas Hindu charities continue to receive foreign funding. For example, Hindu groups have been openly trying to convert India's aboriginal Adivasi people in the country's northeast, but none has been targeted by the government crackdown on foreign funding.\nThe government's efforts have already had a measurable impact. According to Bain & Company, there was a 30 percent decline in international funding to nonprofits in India between 2016 and 2021. During that period, the home ministry pursued action against 13,000 NGOs and cancelled 4,800 licences, for a variety of reasons.\nThe focus on conversions is in keeping with the broader Hindutva project. Hindutva votaries see India as a Hindu nation that has been historically beset by invaders and interlopers, who want to change its essential character. In their view, converting Hindus to other faiths would dilute Indian-ness itself. The BJP is thus engaged in a systematic effort to curb entities whose work, ethos, or principles fall afoul of the government's narrow-minded vision of India.\nIndia is at an inflection point. For decades, it was seen as a rare democratic success story in the developing world. It had a reputation for celebrating its diversity, embracing differences, and allowing all groups, faiths, and ideologies to flourish. But with its restrictive, bigoted, and increasingly autocratic approach, Modi's government is signaling to the world that it would not mind if India earned a very different reputation.\n\u00a0\nShashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general, is an MP for Indian National Congress\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2022www.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n\u00a0\n",

Having tried all avenues, many of them get allured by the promises of regular work and good pay in a foreign country given by the agents of human traffickers. In their desperation for financial support from the Bangladesh government, the deportees from Greece staged a sit-in and token hunger strike in front of Jatiya Press Club in Dhaka on January 3. They narrated their story before the media saying some of them had paid the agents Tk 13-14 lakh to go to Greece.\nIt was quite perturbing to learn that some of them went to the Middle East a couple of years back, but as their employers did not pay them for two months, they decided to go to Greece\u2014some fellow migrant workers had told them that the European countries offered better opportunities. The group of deportees said that local traffickers took about 70 illegal migrants, including 20 Bangladeshis, on a two-week hectic journey to enter Greece from Turkey via an illegal route. They endured immense hardships, often having to walk up to 20 hours a day through the jungle and mountainous roads, and even crossing a river on a plastic boat. The final chapter of their sad saga began when, after about two months, they were caught by the Greek police for illegal entry into the country and working as undocumented workers. About 18 of the Bangladeshis were sent to a detention centre, and after about 15 months, were deported back to Bangladesh.\nIt may be mentioned here that deportation of illegal migrants happens on a regular basis, but despite wide coverage in the print and electronic media, young men from our country continue to seek illegal migration to the EU and other rich countries in search for a better life. The community members, we feel, have a role to play in collecting information regarding the fate of those who have already set out for the unknown destinations. They should remain informed through the media about migration laws of different countries, and take caution when manpower agents come with unusual offers of good jobs abroad.\nThe department of social welfare, local government officials, UNO's office and the police should help the young men and women in verifying the job offers and checking the identities of the agents. Moreover, the government should help the returnees with whatever aid is necessary, as well as seek to establish lawful channels for them to work legally in countries like Greece.\n",

        "full_article": "Following the detection of 10 new Omicron cases in Bangladesh, the government is considering taking fresh steps to prevent further spread of the new coronavirus variant. We welcome this as a positive sign. The government has to proactively try and prevent Omicron transmission, particularly seeing how rapidly it has spread in other countries.\nFrom what we can gather so far, Omicron, although reportedly less deadly than the Delta variant, is far more easily transmissible. This, in some ways, makes it even more of a threat. We have seen how Delta wreaked havoc across the country last year, when the number of cases peaked around July and August. The number of daily new cases during those months regularly stayed above 10,000, putting immense pressure on our healthcare system. It would, therefore, be much wiser for the government to act now to prevent a similar outburst of new cases.\nAmong the measures that the government is considering taking are: stepping up its inoculation campaign; lowering the age limit for booster doses; and preventing the gathering of unvaccinated people at public places. Moreover, it is also considering not allowing anyone to enter restaurants and shopping malls, and board buses and trains without vaccine certificates, besides making it mandatory for school children above the age of 12 years to receive at least one dose of the vaccine to attend in-person classes. While we appreciate the government planning these measures, we wonder how realistic they would be, particularly given that, so far, only 31 percent of the targeted population have received both doses of the vaccine. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see the government step up its vaccination campaign, which we hope will continue without many hiccups. At the same time, rather than forcing the population to get vaccinated, we hope the government will educate the people why it is important to get the vaccine.\nAdditionally, the government needs to renew its awareness campaign to encourage people to follow the health guidelines such as wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and going into early isolation if they suspect they have contracted the coronavirus. Ramping up screening at airports and other border points is also crucial\u2014especially since quite a few of the new cases have been detected among people who have come into the country from abroad.\nWhile these preventive measures are extremely important, the government should also upgrade the country's healthcare facilities on an urgent basis. Making sure that hospitals are well equipped and have centralised oxygen systems installed and working properly are agendas that the government should pursue with equal focus.\n",
