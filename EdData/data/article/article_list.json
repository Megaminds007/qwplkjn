Close observers of the Maoist insurgency had warned that despite the Maoists\u2019 decline, they were still active in South Bastar, the Andhra-Odisha border or in some districts in Jharkhand. The killing on Wednesday of a District Reserve Guard team of the Chhattisgarh police in a powerful IED blast followed by gunfire is reflective of the threat still posed by Maoists in the south Bastar region. The fact that these 10 personnel were returning from a counter-insurgency operation that they had conducted after a tip-off indicates that the Maoist attacks could have been a trap and points to a possible intelligence failure. With the Maoists known to ramp up attacks on security forces before the onset of the monsoon season, the killings suggest a failure in anticipating such an attack. It is incumbent upon the government to investigate the incident, plug security loopholes, find out the Maoist cadre responsible for the attack and to bring them to justice. But it is a task that is easier said than done as this is tough terrain in a region which could be the last stronghold of the Maoists.The inability of the Maoists to graduate beyond a violent guerrilla-based movement that utilises the remote and inaccessible forested terrain of central India, and home to tribal communities, is largely because of their incoherent and outdated ideology that has found few takers even among the most marginalised of communities. Diligent security actions have certainly curbed their presence outside their stronghold even as the responsiveness and penetration of the Indian state into areas where governmental sway was hitherto absent, has had a mitigatory effect. Yet, it is not just the terrain and topography that have acted as the obstacles in defeating the Maoists in south Bastar. The alienation of a section of tribals caught in the crossfire between security forces and the Maoists has allowed the Maoists to tap into discontent and to retain a presence in the area. In the years of counter-insurgency, hard-edged strategies of creating wedges among the tribal population to defeat the Maoists have been counter-productive. The government must continue to try to win the support and confidence of the tribal people of south Bastar as that is the surest way of defeating the Maoist movement. Any military action that is hastily put together for retribution and which could target innocent tribals will only exacerbate the problem.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChhattisgarh\n\n/\n\nact of terror\n\n/\n\ntribals\n\n/\n\nguerrilla activity\n\n/\n\nOrissa\n\n/\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n/\n\nexplosion\n\n/\n\nsecurity measures",

        "full_article": "The gruesome murder of Lourdhu Francis, a Village Administrative Officer (VAO) in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, on Tuesday \u2014 he was in his office \u2014 is a reminder of the lengths to which the sand mafia will go to protect its lucrative activities involving illegal quarrying. The official had been informing the police and his superiors about mafia operations. This is not the first such case in Tamil Nadu. Five years ago, in neighbouring Tirunelveli, a 33-year-old police constable was brutally murdered by the sand mafia when he was about to arrest the culprits who had mined river sand from the Nambiyar. The State has had a long history of attacks on public servants who have sought to enforce the rules governing sand quarrying and book wrongdoers. Over 25 years ago, the then District Collector of Tiruvallur, Jayashree Raghunandan, nearly lost her life when leading a raid on illegal quarrying; the driver of a lorry was arrested on charges of attempting to kill her. The killing of a Deputy Tahsildar near Chengalpattu, in December 2004, is another case. Both the Madras High Court and the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal have, on many occasions, sought to address the issue of illegal sand quarrying and mining. In October 2013, after the High Court came down on the administration of Kancheepuram district (near Chennai), over alleged illegal quarrying, the State government went to the extent of suspending the Collector. Over the past five to six years, the government\u2019s launching of measures such as online system of booking of sand and payment (with plans to fine tune technology applications in this regard) as well as the unveiling of a policy document on \u201cM-sand\u201d (or manufactured sand, as an alternative to river sand), in March this year, are steps that have hardly stopped illegal sand quarrying.What is critical is that the government should send a strong message: of its zero tolerance towards illegal sand quarrying. Unless this is done in unequivocal terms, any other move to tone up the system will fall short. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin ordering \u20b91 crore as solatium and the appointment of a member of the VAO\u2019s family in government service on compassionate grounds should be of some comfort to the family, but the government should apprehend the killers and ensure their conviction expeditiously. At the same time, the government should ponder over the efficacy of the existing system concerning the sale and use of river sand. It also needs to strengthen the regulatory mechanism. The authorities would do well to promote research on the production and quality of M-sand. Regardless of any other steps it takes, the government should not give room for any more murderous violence in the State.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nmurder\n\n/\n\nmining\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ntribunal\n\n/\n\nenvironmental issues",

        "full_article": "Little can be more brazen, or cynical, than to alter prison rules to facilitate the release of a murder convict for political reasons. But that is exactly what Nitish Kumar\u2019s JDU government in Bihar did earlier in April when it amended the Bihar Prison Manual 2012 to remove the phrase \u201cthe murder of a public servant\u201d. The existing rule disallowed remission of convicts of terrorism, rape-cum-murder and murder of state officers. Within a fortnight of the change, former RJD MLA Anand Mohan was set to be freed from prison, purportedly to re-enter the electoral arena ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. His political influence is expected to pull in some of Bihar\u2019s approximately 6-7% Rajput vote. It is also seemingly why the opposition in Bihar spoke with a forked tongue: criticising the change in rule yet not criticising Mohan\u2019s release.\nThe 1990s-2000s saw criminality in politics countrywide reach epidemic proportions. Mohan as a regional strongman had made his political name on an anti-Mandal, anti-Dalit plank in the Bihar of early 1990s, the peak time of anti-Mandal protests. In 2007, a trial court sentenced Mohan to death for the 1994 lynching of Gopalganj DM, a Dalit officer. Patna HC commuted that sentence to life.\nCut to another remission case. The Supreme Court last week pulled up the Gujarat government and GoI for their reluctance to share files on the early release, which was also just ahead of Gujarat assembly elections, of 11 lifers in the Bilkis Bano case. SC said it was critiquing the grant of remission that showed \u201ccomplete non-consideration for the gravity of the offences\u201d. Recently, the Haryana government, presumably with an eye on 2024, justified frequent paroles to Dera chief and rape-and-murder convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim, claiming he wasn\u2019t a \u201chardcore prisoner\u201d.\nPoliticians flouting due process is not new. But it\u2019s something worse entirely when the executive appears to arrogate to itself the right to lay waste criminal justice procedure \u2013 Bihar government is unmoved by the criticism over Mohan\u2019s release. GoI and Gujarat government have told SC they may challenge the court\u2019s order to share the Bilkis Bano files. Remission, fairly applied, is a chance at a second life. But, and this is as distressing as it is unsurprising, governments are rarely concerned over remissions for politically irrelevant convicts.\n\n",

If Sudan heads the Libya way, it will see another dangerous flood of weapons in the Horn of Africa region. That in turn would provide a huge fillip to an assortment of armed groups, including ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates. Add to this the loss of lives and destruction of public assets in the region.\nWhile on the surface the Sudan conflict appears to be a straightforward power struggle between two branches of that country\u2019s armed forces, the conflict is also symptomatic of a deeper malaise afflicting multiple countries in Africa and beyond \u2013 the Dutch disease phenomenon. This sees countries like Sudan become burdened by abundant natural resources that ought to have been a blessing. For, a chronic dependence on export of these natural resources hollows out other sectors of the economy. This is precisely what happened to Sudan. After South Sudan\u2019s secession in 2011, Khartoum\u2019s economy was severely undermined by the loss of oil revenue which constituted more than 50% of the Sudanese government\u2019s revenues and 95% of its exports.\n\nThis is why Sudan remains one of the poorest countries in the world with its 46 million people living on an average annual income of $750 per capita. Factor in the illegal extraction of natural resources by local warlords due to fragile governance-security structures, and countries like Sudan are staring at an economic abyss. True, there have been experiments to get around Dutch disease like Kazakhstan\u2019s National Fund that is financed by oil, gas and mineral revenues and delinked from the country\u2019s budget to lessen the impact of price volatility. But the lesson from Sudan is that failure to soberly manage natural resources can have deep economic and security implications. Sometimes, a bounty is a curse.\n\n",

First, the solicitor general sounded like a one-man fire-and-brimstone evangelists convention while dissing the Supreme Court\u2019s right to adjudicate on same-sex marriage. Then the Bar Council of India switched over to the sarkar\u2019s bench.

The Joker\u2019s other twin is equally shaped by the (non)container of indignation. Here, morality is out of syllabus because sexual orientation isn\u2019t a multiple choice question. As the wise CJI pointed out, only love should determine the legitimacy of marriage, not genitals.

        "full_article": "When the brain is full, information is localised and does not move. However, if the brain is partially empty, it has room for new ideas and creativity. However, random ideas are no good. These must be focused by a driving force. Only then these can take a concrete shape. If the driving force is external, then the effectiveness of ideas lasts as long as the driving force is there. When the driving force is switched off, then the ideas are lost, in the absence of focus. If, however, the driving force is internal or a self-created one, then the ideas have a perennial effect. Excitations, if these are vigorous, can block the flow of ideas. However, controlled excitations can discipline the ideas to become cohesive and effective. From this, we learn that what is an obstruction to creativity can also be its facilitator, if properly controlled. When the world is changing so fast and is under different kinds of influences, good and bad, we should be ready for unpredictable challenges and predicaments. Only creative minds can make us fit to face unfolded events and situations. If we are to be self-reliant, then we should create our own ideas and translate them into effective solutions for our future. However, since it is an interdependent world, mutual, constructive cooperation can help.\nScientists used conductors and nonconductors of energy and current, without knowing how they were different. With the advent of quantum theory, things began to be clear. The band theory of solids explained the difference between conductors and non-conductors. It also showed that there are other electronic systems known as semiconductors. These semiconductors in the form ofelectronics technology brought enormous changes in our lives.\nThe difference in solids comes from the filling, emptiness and partial filling of the bands. In a non-conductor, the bands are either completely full or completely empty. Electrons in nonconductors do not possess freedom and are bound. Thus, a filled band can be compared to a filled brain. Filled bands are useless for conductivity, as filled brains are useless for creativity.\nIn a metal, the band of importance is partially filled with electrons. Therefore, the electrons have the freedom to move, and when triggered by an electric voltage, these give the current. Thus, freedom is associated with partial fill.\nIn a semiconductor, we can control the fill and hence its utility. In an ordinary conductor, a particle-like excitation phonon causes resistance. However, in a superconductor, the same phonon pairs two electrons and makes them superconducting. In the foregoing analysis, we saw the virtues of partially fill over complete fill, both in life and matter. We also learn from science how something that obstructs can also support excellence. In looking for philosophy in science and science in philosophy, we simply emphasise that diverse things coexist and their recognition can lead to clarity. Homogeneity is an idea; heterogeneity is a reality and seeing homogeneity in heterogeneity is the best practice.\nTossing through the turmoil of cause and effect, we invariably arrive at the calmness of results and facts. It is a way of life. We may not have control over unknowns but should have control to face them and convert some of them to our advantage, into opportunities for new and more exciting phases of life.

        "full_article": "April 26, apparently, was Alien Day. Before your imagination runs wild (which it is supposed to do on this occasion), this was not a day when the first alien was discovered on Earth or when aliens celebrated their domination of our planet, or when they declared their \"alienable\" rights in the galaxies. It is a day for the celebration of science fiction, especially in films that have captured the fascination of many humans. Held on 4/26, it is a reference to LV-426, the moon where a human crew discovers aliens in the 1979 Ridley Scott film\u00a0Alien. Thanks to the abundance of sci-fi films, many of us have grown up with that irresistible fascination for life outside Earth and a nagging desire to believe in its existence.\nIt is interesting, though, how the word \"alien\" is used in a country where many of the most famous films on aliens have been born. In the US, an alien is not just an extraterrestrial; it could simply mean someone from a foreign country. So an illegal alien (the lowest rung in the immigration ladder) is a foreigner who got into the US without legal documentation or stayed longer than permitted by their visa. A legal alien on the other hand, is a foreign-born person who has all the right documents to be in the US. Remember how Sting famously announced his immigration status: \"I'm a legal alien. I'm an Englishman in New York\"?\nOther than that curious deviation, in general, an alien refers to a being from another planet. And it's not just sci-fi movies that harp on extraterrestrials coming down to Earth, usually with sinister purposes (though sometimes they are cute little fellows who just want to go home).\nThe Pentagon, for years, had projects to investigate \"military sightings of UFOs\" (now known as \"unidentified aerial phenomena\"). In fact, just this February, after all the excitement over \"Chinese balloons\" and other unidentified objects, a US Air Force general said he would \"not rule out aliens or any other explanation,\" though other defence and intelligence officials have said that the military has not yet found evidence of extraterrestrial activity in the US. Well, of course they have to say that, silly. It's classified information.\nNow that one thinks of it, even our own land could be a site of alien activity. Remember the alien abductions in films like\u00a0The X Files\u00a0where humans were taken and then sent back, traumatised and with amnesia? Well, this could explain all the unexplained disappearances of people for days and months, after which they \"reappeared\" in far-off places, usually near the border, looking confused and disoriented. Most of all, they never talk about what had happened to them, just like those stupefied human abductees who can barely explain anything about their time aboard the alien ship.\nIn most sci-fi movies, the ill intentions of the aliens are amply displayed \u2013 how they just want to suck out our life force in order to survive, invade our planet altogether as their own abode is dying. This could explain the unsolved murders that keep adding to our repertoire of grisly events. The Sagar-Runi murder case, for instance, the probe report of which could not be submitted for the 97th time on April 9. If the concerned law enforcement agency has failed for 97 times to come up with some sort of deduction from the last 11 years of investigation, does this not sound a little \"science fiction-y\"? Other unsolved murders continue to pile up, with no clues regarding who could have carried them out. Sounds suspiciously like alien aggression.\nSpeaking of aggression, if any of you have seen\u00a0Mars Attacks, you will know just how vicious and sarcastic little Martians can be. Not to mention, ugly as sin. Initially, when the humongous-headed Martians arrive, the people of the world (which basically means the US) herald their coming as they would that of a messiah. People from all walks of life travel thousands of miles to welcome them with open arms and doves that symbolise peace and friendship. Only the intentions of these little green men are not as noble, as is soon revealed when the officials of the welcoming committee are blown into smithereens with a ray gun by a cackling Martian, triggered by a hippie setting free a dove. After a lot of mayhem and destruction, a young boy saves the day when he inadvertently plays a favourite song of his grandmother's, whom he has rescued. The yodelling sounds of the song \"Indian Love Call\", that the boy plays in the car, is by default the only weapon to annihilate the marauding aliens \u2013 the melody causes their slimy green brains to explode. The hidden message in this: it is music (denoting love and soft power, perhaps?), not state-of-the-art arms, that can conquer the enemy and save the world. Superpowers of the world, which are so infatuated with war and sophisticated weaponry, should take heed.\nScience fiction may stretch scientific phenomena for dramatic effect and to ensure box office hits, but many things in sci-fi films have predicted future scenarios \u2013 like holograms, smartphones, smart watches, and eye glasses that can be used as computer screens. Whether we will ever encounter little green or grey men with creepy eyes and bulbous heads, or amorphously shaped beings with superior intelligence, is something that at this time will remain within the confines of sci-fi films and literature. But the idea of life outside our planet is something that will fascinate scientists and ordinary people alike. There is something hopeful and humbling about thinking that there are living beings besides the ones we are familiar with in our earthly abode.\nMeanwhile, there is that strange smell wafting from the kitchens, sending many a human out on the streets of Dhaka. Titas Gas says it's because of high pressure of gas in the pipes and the idea that there are major leaks is baseless. Maybe it's just aliens breathing.\nAasha Mehreen Amin\u00a0is joint editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Amid uncertainty over the extension of a fragile 72-hour ceasefire \u2013 due to expire late on Thursday \u2013 in conflict-ridden Sudan, it is the safety of foreign nationals trapped in the country that has emerged as a major headache for all concerned. Even if the so-called truce between the military government and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is extended for another 72 hours, following the initial approval given by the former late on Wednesday, it is unlikely to lead to an immediate improvement on the ground. This makes it extremely important that, whatever window of opportunity is opened in the event of an extension, countries including Bangladesh make the best use of it to evacuate their citizens.\nAccording to an estimate, some 1,500 Bangladeshis, who mostly work in construction or domestic services, are presently in Sudan. It is not a labour-hiring country, so Bangladeshis go there mostly for an opportunity to move to other countries like Libya later. But with the scope of such migrations now diminished, many who could not move to other countries stayed back. We must acknowledge that the government of Bangladesh has been sincere if not decisive enough on the issue of their evacuation since fighting erupted in the country on April 15. After the state minister for foreign affairs announced initiatives to evacuate them on April 25 \u2013 when the ceasefire took hold \u2013 around 500 Bangladeshis reportedly registered, and we are told that they will be evacuated via Jeddah in Saudi Arabia early next month. While we would have appreciated it more if the government had intervened earlier or more strongly, like some other countries did, we hope that any casualty can be avoided before that time arrives.\nThe problem for Bangladesh came into focus after its embassy building in Sudan was hit by bullets on April 22, damaging the third-floor wall. Earlier, on April 15, the residence of Charge De Affaires Tareq Ahmed, which is close to the Khartoum International Airport, had machine gun bullets hitting and piercing through its windows. However, no one was hurt in either of the incidents. Since then, we have come across reports on how trapped Bangladeshis, along with other foreign nationals and the local population, have been struggling to find food, water, electricity, medicine and other basic essentials. Since the fighting began, at least 512 people have been killed in air raids and artillery attacks so far. Thousands have been wounded. The ceasefire has had little effect on this situation, which makes us worried about the outcome of any possible extension.\nStill, there is no alternative to a ceasefire and a political solution to the crisis. We urge global leaders to make decisive interventions in Sudan so that lasting peace can be secured as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we hope that our government will make sure that all Bangladeshis who want to return to the country can do so without delay or any hassle on the way. Their safety is of utmost importance.\n",

        "full_article": "Sometimes, the line between reality and fiction becomes blurry, and one must ask some fundamental questions to ground oneself in the truth. In the strange times that we live in today, I would like to posit some fundamental questions to you, dear reader: Can democracy exist without freedom of expression? Can there be free and fair elections without freedom of the press? I believe that, for any soul who believes in the tenets of democracy, the answer will always be a resounding \"no.\"\nOn March 29, at about 4am, a group of around 15 plainclothes officers of the Criminal Investigation Department picked up Prothom Alo correspondent Samsuzzaman Shams from his residence in Savar. Shams is now facing two legal charges under the Digital Security Act 2018, one of which also names Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman.\nUnfortunately, this recent abuse of the DSA is only another grim statistic in Bangladesh's morbid trajectory of decline in media freedom. The Centre for Governance Studies' DSA tracker project paints a clear picture of how the law has been turned into a weapon of naked partisanship, primarily used to censor and suppress information that the incumbent government does not want the public to see, and has created a climate of self-censorship among journalists and reporters.\nThe project's principal investigator, Illinois State University's distinguished professor Prof Ali Riaz, recently stated that at least 355 journalists, 403 politicians and even 26 children were accused under the Digital Security Act. According to his study published in January titled, \"What's Happening: Trends and Patterns of the Use of the Digital Security Act 2018 in Bangladesh,\" of all those accused under the DSA, 29.25 percent are politicians and 27.21 percent are journalists.\nOf the plaintiffs, the study finds, 29 percent were people related to government service and 40 percent were directly involved with a political party, primarily Awami League.\nThe heavy-handed application of the law against journalists and opposition politicians is a black mark against the image of Bangladesh both at home and abroad. Not only is the law being used as a tool of censorship, but it also allows the violation of multiple international human rights.\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has repeatedly brought the issue forth to Bangladesh. The response from the Bangladesh side has been agonisingly weak. The \"OHCHR Technical Note to the Government of Bangladesh on Review of the Digital Security Act,\" issued to Bangladesh in June last year, stated that the \"OHCHR is concerned that the blocking and removal powers granted to the authorities are extremely broad, given the vagueness and vast scope of possibly affected material and that the removal orders do not require the content to be unlawful or criminal, thus unduly restricting freedom of expression and access to information.\"\nIn the technical note, the UN Human Rights Office expressed concerns over the power of the DSA to detain those accused without a warrant and under harsh sentencing periods. Various amendments and annulments to and of various DSA clauses were suggested to the government, only to be promptly rejected by the law minister. It now appears that the government has no intention to let go of this weapon before the upcoming national election.\nBut how can there be any talk of free and fair elections if such draconian laws as the DSA continue to exist? Needless to say, for a democracy to thrive, press freedom is essential. To ensure that individuals in authority are held responsible to the public, journalists must have the liberty to probe and report on government acts, policies, and decisions. In order to form educated opinions about their government and actively engage in the democratic process, citizens need access to this data.\nWithout press freedom, governments may censor or restrict information, preventing the public from receiving important information about their leaders and the policies they are enacting. Corruption, power abuse, and a decline of the public's faith in government are all possible outcomes of a breakdown in accountability and transparency. The right to free speech and expression is also intrinsically tied to journalistic freedom. A free and open press is crucial to foster an atmosphere where differing viewpoints may be heard and debated.\nA tell-tale sign of an authoritarian regime is the undermining of journalistic institutions. The most common play in the dictator's handbook is to paint the media as the enemy of the people. There can be no proper election if the government keeps using the DSA against journalists. A free and independent press plays a critical role in informing citizens about the electoral process, including the positions of candidates, the issues at stake, and particularly the conduct of the election itself.\nFurthermore, a free press is needed to provide a platform for all candidates and parties to present their views and engage in public debate, helping to ensure a level playing field and preventing any one group from dominating the discussion.\nWithout a free press, citizens may be subject to biassed or incomplete information, and this can impact their ability to make informed choices at the ballot box. Bangladesh is already mired in accusations of electoral fraud, election time violence, and abusing law enforcement institutions to harass opposition candidates.\nWhether or not Bangladesh can salvage its image as a democracy will entirely depend on how the next election is conducted. However, the government's stubborn refusal to get rid of its tools of censorship does not bode well for us in the slightest.\nZillur Rahman is the executive director of the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) and a television talk show host.

        "full_article": "Amid uncertainty over the extension of a fragile 72-hour ceasefire \u2013 due to expire late on Thursday \u2013 in conflict-ridden Sudan, it is the safety of foreign nationals trapped in the country that has emerged as a major headache for all concerned. Even if the so-called truce between the military government and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is extended for another 72 hours, following the initial approval given by the former late on Wednesday, it is unlikely to lead to an immediate improvement on the ground. This makes it extremely important that, whatever window of opportunity is opened in the event of an extension, countries including Bangladesh make the best use of it to evacuate their citizens.\nAccording to an estimate, some 1,500 Bangladeshis, who mostly work in construction or domestic services, are presently in Sudan. It is not a labour-hiring country, so Bangladeshis go there mostly for an opportunity to move to other countries like Libya later. But with the scope of such migrations now diminished, many who could not move to other countries stayed back. We must acknowledge that the government of Bangladesh has been sincere if not decisive enough on the issue of their evacuation since fighting erupted in the country on April 15. After the state minister for foreign affairs announced initiatives to evacuate them on April 25 \u2013 when the ceasefire took hold \u2013 around 500 Bangladeshis reportedly registered, and we are told that they will be evacuated via Jeddah in Saudi Arabia early next month. While we would have appreciated it more if the government had intervened earlier or more strongly, like some other countries did, we hope that any casualty can be avoided before that time arrives.\nThe problem for Bangladesh came into focus after its embassy building in Sudan was hit by bullets on April 22, damaging the third-floor wall. Earlier, on April 15, the residence of Charge De Affaires Tareq Ahmed, which is close to the Khartoum International Airport, had machine gun bullets hitting and piercing through its windows. However, no one was hurt in either of the incidents. Since then, we have come across reports on how trapped Bangladeshis, along with other foreign nationals and the local population, have been struggling to find food, water, electricity, medicine and other basic essentials. Since the fighting began, at least 512 people have been killed in air raids and artillery attacks so far. Thousands have been wounded. The ceasefire has had little effect on this situation, which makes us worried about the outcome of any possible extension.\nStill, there is no alternative to a ceasefire and a political solution to the crisis. We urge global leaders to make decisive interventions in Sudan so that lasting peace can be secured as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we hope that our government will make sure that all Bangladeshis who want to return to the country can do so without delay or any hassle on the way. Their safety is of utmost importance.\n",

        "full_article": "The latest antidote being mulled by police to rising crime in Dhaka is expanding the central monitoring system of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) by incorporating private CCTV cameras. According to a report by this daily, the DMP plans to incorporate around 50,000 such devices initially. Eventually, the goal is to bring the whole capital under the CCTV network. As part of that initiative, the DMP has already started to reach out to area-based housing societies, apartment cooperatives, individual households and businesses, requesting them to upgrade their CCTV cameras so that those can supply live feed with 11 specialised features like face detection, vehicle number plate tracing, etc.\nWe commend this initiative which comes amid concerns over rising crime in Dhaka. With the patterns of criminal behaviour changing thanks to technology, the police too should adapt and change their tactics. Early results from the CCTV initiative are said to have been encouraging, especially in terms of combating petty crimes. Currently, the DMP has about 680 CCTVs of its own. There are also 625 CCTVs under the Dhaka South City Corporation. Clearly, there is a need for more given the challenge posed by the massive number of people who live and work here. Police already can use CCTV footage from private establishments in case of investigations, but access to live feed from all available CCTVs in the city can help with preventing crimes. It can also generally boost their crime-fighting chances.\nThere are, however, a few concerns that should be addressed for this initiative to work. Firstly, its limited scope. Such an undertaking may not work in slums and poorer neighbourhoods where most households can ill-afford expensive technology like CCTV. The DMP must ensure that it is not seen as discriminatory in combating crimes. Also, why are the authorities not installing more CCTVs of their own to support the initiative? Public funding is vital for this to deliver expected results.\nSecondly, its reliance on voluntary public support. In its effort to broaden the CCTV network, the DMP is relying heavily on private individuals, which comes with the challenge of earning their trust in the first place. The question is, have the police been able to do so? Can they be trusted to respect their privacy? More importantly, can the DMP prevent any misuse of the initiative? What chance does this have of succeeding if the police authorities fail to use feed from private CCTVs properly or establish accountability for errant cops who continue to give the force a bad name? These concerns are quite valid at this stage. Over the years, we have seen how members of the police force frequently got involved in various crimes including murder, extortion and so on through various covert and overt means.\nSo while we think that the latest DMP initiative is a step in the right direction, its success will depend a lot on how sincere and proactive the police are in combatting crimes. We urge the police to step up their game under the present circumstances. They must show their integrity, honesty, neutrality and professionalism at all times.\n",

        "full_article": "It's a welcome piece of news that the export of apparel to Japan from Bangladesh fetched $1.22 billion during the first nine months of the current financial year. The earnings during the corresponding period of the last financial year were around $850 million. Thus, the export revenues went up by nearly 44 per cent during the period under review. The notable growth of apparel exports, however, was in line with the trend witnessed in the bilateral trade with Japan in recent years.The value of overall exports to Japan which was $1.44 billion in 2018 continued to grow until 2022 barring the two pandemic-hit years. In 2022, Bangladesh fetched $1.71 billion from exports to Japan and apparel contributed the most. The uptrend is expected to continue this year as well. However, there is one not-so-encouraging development in the bilateral trade between the two countries. The trade balance moderately favours Japan, and the deficit has been going up constantly amidst talk of signing a free trade/preferential trade agreement between the two countries. The immediate past ambassador of Japan in Bangladesh while addressing an event organised by the Japan-Bangladesh Chamber in Dhaka in October last year sounded very optimistic about the bilateral trade reaching $20 billion in 2030 with each country sharing half of it. The size of the bilateral trade now is more than $3.0 billion. The trade growth envisaged by the Japanese envoy over the next seven years would be very difficult to achieve on the part of Bangladesh unless some improvements are made in policy issues and beyond. Obviously, the focus should primarily be on apparel that now helps the country earn the most revenues from Japan, a non-traditional export destination. Both the government and the businesses concerned will have to do a lot to enhance their presence in the Japanese apparel market which is worth over $24 billion. The Bangladesh readymade garment exporters will have to know the product-based demand in that country and work accordingly, keeping an eye on the quality issues. A good number of apparel sector leaders are now in Japan as members of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's entourage. They are expected to make interactions with Japanese stakeholders in furthering the prospects of apparel exports to that country. In addition to boosting exports to help offset the trade imbalance with Japan now and also in the future, what will be needed most is luring more Japanese investments to Bangladesh. At the moment more than 340 Japanese firms are operating in this country, but their total investment is worth less than $500 million. A survey done recently by the JETRO (Japan External Trade Organisation) has found that Japanese companies are eager to expand their operations in Bangladesh. Japan has been moving their investments in a big way from China to other Asian countries. Their investments have been more in medium to higher technology-based industries. To attract such investments, Bangladesh needs to ensure skilled manpower, necessary infrastructures and integrated logistical services. Besides, reform of taxation and government incentives will be necessary to remove discrimination, if there is any, between local and foreign companies. Greater Japanese investments would also help protect Bangladesh's interests better if the two countries finally strike an FTA or a PTA.",

        "full_article": "This is peak Boro harvesting time. Farmers are busy gathering crops manually or in some places mowing with harvesters thanks to a late shift to mechanisation of agriculture. In fact, shortage of farm labourers has long been a problem during this non-traditional harvesting period marked by unpredictable foul weather, storms and lightning in particular. With the introduction of high yielding varieties of paddy, the entire cycle of cropping pattern has changed putting farmers to a test of both physical endurance and at risk of danger on account of soaring temperature of the high summer and storms accompanied with lightning. No wonder, in some southern districts, farmers opt for cultivation of coarse varieties of paddy because it can be harvested 15-20 days earlier than Bri 28 and 29. The coarse varieties are priced at Tk100-150 less a maund (37.32 kilogram) than the finer varieties of paddy. But farmers want to avoid the natural hazards of heat, storm and lightning, the incidence of the last of which is showing an alarming rise. So an advantage of 15-20 days early harvesting makes a lot of difference in terms of protecting crops from damage and their physical exposure to the dreaded scorching heat, storms called Kalbaishakhi and even more dangerous lightning. This is a fine example of adaptability to climate change. But the weather is increasingly becoming erratic and hostile and much as farmers may be adaptive, there is a limit to their resilience. Of late, lightning has become a cause for serious concern because of its frequencies and lethal strikes. If temperature rises by 1.0 degree Celsisus, the probability of lightning is triggered 12 per cent more. This year recorded the highest temperature ever in some areas of the country and true to the coefficient, lightning incidence rose unusually. On Sunday last, 11 people died from lightning strikes which also left three more people injured in six districts. The yearly toll on an average is 265.Climate science has advanced quite appreciably but those who are at the helm of state affairs, particularly in powerful and advanced countries which incidentally are the worst polluters, have been maintaining a double standard in keeping the planet Earth cool. Small countries like Bangladesh, more particularly their farmers and labourers who have to toil in the open under the blazing sun, fish in turbulent rivers and seas and live in coastal areas, suffer more for no fault of their own. Life and livelihoods of vast numbers of human beings on the backyard of prosperous continents and nations are viciously threatened. The lightning bolts are coming down from the sky on unsuspecting farmers in open fields in Bangladesh and India along with other countries of the region.Scientists warned of serious consequences if the rising temperature cannot be arrested to 1.5 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial level. The prediction is particularly dire for South Asian countries. Farmers in Bangladesh like their South Asian counterparts are to encounter what is called 'wet-bulb temperature'. It means the severe temperature will get wrapped in pockets like heat domes that killed about 2,000 people in Canada and on the other side of border in the USA. So the twin problem of heat and lightning strikes are threatening lives and livelihoods of farmers in an unprecedented way. When the wet-bulb temperature takes effect, farmers can at least stay home or take shelter under trees but lightning strikes them often unannounced. Now, is there any protection against this heavenly shaft striking at a phenomenal speed? Sure enough, there is lightning early warning system that can alert people of the danger of the approaching lightning in an area well before they can move to a safe shelter. In Odisha, India, the system has been quite effective to reduce casualties by 31 per cent so far. Odisha's State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA) in collaboration with other agencies has been working on lessening the damaging impacts of lightning strikes on life and property. Bangladesh has, albeit belatedly, also initiated a move towards minimising the havoc lightning strikes wreak. The ministry of disaster management and relief has reportedly set about putting in place arresters which can protect lives of humans and other animals within 300 feet. The device is set up on top of a steel pole of 30 feet height. Already the arresters have been set up in seven upzalias of the 16 highly lightning-prone upazilas. The rest nine districts will be brought under the programme's coverage soon. However there is a plan to gradually bring all the 64 districts under its coverage.In fact, a project for setting up arresters in 23 lightning-prone districts at a cost of Tk9.0 billion is waiting to be approved by the planning ministry. Then there is yet another programme of building lightning protection shelter in the areas more at risk of lightning strikes. The project were to cost Tk4.76 billion originally but it has long remained dormant and should be revived even if the cost goes up. Coordination between an early warning system and lightning protection shelter can be most helpful in bringing down death and destruction from lightning strikes. Farmers who feed the nation deserve this technological support. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "India is now free to use two seaports of Bangladesh---one at Chattogram and the other at Mongla--- to transship goods and also transit the same to and from its landlocked northeastern states. The National Board of Revenue (NBR), according to a report published in this paper, issued a 'permanent' order to this effect on Monday last, detailing all the procedures and fees to apply for the transportation of goods to and from the landlocked northeastern states of India. India should reciprocate on this issue. Transportation of goods from the Indian mainland to the northeastern states involves a long time and huge cost because of the distance. Bangladesh's next-door neighbour for long has been aspiring to use the Bangladesh seaports to cut both cost and time. Against this background, the two countries in April 2018 penned an agreement titled, 'Agreement on the Use of Chattogram and Mongla ports for Movement of Goods to and from India. An instrument on Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on transit and transhipment was also signed in 2019. The Transit and Transshipment Rules were issued later in 2021. Since then, India has used the Bangladesh ports to transship goods at least on four occasions on a trial basis. And finally, the NBR issued the order on April 24 facilitating the use of the two ports by India under a permanent arrangement. Under the latest NBR order, fees that were set in 2020 for experimental run have remained almost unchanged barring the 15 per cent VAT imposed on all services rendered by Bangladesh agencies. The SOP and other necessary orders have tried to ensure the security and safety of goods to be transshipped and transited. It also has addressed the security issues concerning Bangladesh. Undoubtedly, India will be extremely happy because of the latest NBR order since the latter would make things easy for it to transport goods at low costs and in a short time to its northeastern states. The relations between the two neighbours, hopefully, would get yet another boost and open up new areas of cooperation. However, a few questions might crop up in the minds of many here following the latest Bangladesh move. The first and foremost will be: what Bangladesh would get in return? Bangladeshi traders have a soured feeling as far as trade relations with India are concerned. Their principal allegation is that the neighbour has offered notable trade concessions in recent years, but non-tariff and para-tariff barriers have made things difficult for Bangladeshi goods to enter its market. However, such barriers are usually put up by the Indian government to 'protect' the interests of domestic producers.Besides trade, there are some other unresolved issues, sharing of Teesta waters being at the top. India has got what it wanted. It is now for Bangladesh to play its part to get the due and reap the most out of the permanent transit and transhipment deal. Bangladesh is yet to get access to Nepal and Bhutan through Indian land. Once allowed to use the Indian corridor, two landlocked countries will also get uninterrupted access to Bangladesh seaports which would make their external trade easier.Besides, Bangladesh should also try to employ the maximum number of its transports, ships and vessels in the transportation of goods under the transit and transhipment facility granted to India. When the issue of transhipment and transit of Indian goods first came, concerns were expressed about the capacity of Bangladeshi ports and other infrastructures, including roads and highways, to handle those. It was not possible to see the true impact during the trial runs that were very limited in nature. The problems will be visible only when the transhipment and transit of goods start in full gear. Everything will depend on the extent of use of the ports and roads by India and Bangladesh's capacity to address the problems. Let's wait and see what happens next. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh Bank has recently asked scheduled banks in the country to organise meetings using online platforms. The central bank's directive to hold meetings in a hybrid mode is to ensure cost savings and efficient use of electricity. In my view, it is, of course, an admirable initiative. The central bank advised the banks to organise meetings on online platform instead of hundred per cent in-person attendance, to ensure economical use of power and energy under austerity measures. Online meetings require less cost and time compared to physical sessions. Conducting a physical meeting requires hotel accommodation costs, arrangements of facilities, travel expenses, etc. The attendees need to come from different locations, due to which there may be a delay in gathering of all participants. Setting a virtual meeting saves plenty of time. By avoiding trips and working from a specific location, one can maximise one's productivity. The Bangladesh Bank has been implementing various initiatives to tackle economic headwinds and keep foreign exchange reserves stable amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The instruction to hold virtual meetings is one such initiative. With the advancement of technology, it is now very much possible to maintain austerity by organising meetings and training programmes online. A few commercial banks including the Export Import Bank of Bangladesh Limited (EXIM Bank) have been, however, holding online meetings since 2020. This bank has even arranged training courses recently in a hybrid manner. All the banks should follow the system to ensure frugality in the banks' expenses and the cost-effective use of electricity and energy complying with the central bank instruction. Md.
