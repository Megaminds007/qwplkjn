Moscow has mobilised some 5,00,000 troops, more than twice the size of the forces it deployed to launch the invasion last February, for a widely expected spring offensive. The West, Kyiv\u2019s main financial and military backer, is sending armoured vehicles, precision bombs, battle tanks and missile defence systems to Ukraine to bolster its defensive and offensive capabilities. In his surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged America\u2019s lasting support to the war-battered nation. The next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his State of the Nation address, signalled his country\u2019s readiness for a long war, and suspended its participation in the New START treaty, which marked a breakdown of ties with the West and could also trigger a nuclear arms race. The past year has been disastrous for all parties. Mr. Putin, who wanted a quick victory, miscalculated Kyiv\u2019s response and the West\u2019s resolve to back it. Ukraine inflicted huge human and material costs on Russia, but still lost swathes of its territories. The West stays united, despite differences over its approach towards Russia, but has also been reeling under the economic costs of the war.However, despite the setbacks, no side is ready for talks. Mr. Putin is ready to fight as long as it takes and the West is ready to arm Ukraine as long as it takes. A long war would be catastrophic for Ukraine as the entire fighting is taking place within its borders. The country has lost land, weapons and tens of thousands of lives. Its infrastructure is under attack and the economy has been battered. Without the steady supply of arms from the West, it is unlikely to survive the Russian onslaught. Further, if the war prolongs, the risks of a Russia-NATO direct conflict would be higher. The rapid destruction of security in Europe and the deepening mistrust between major powers is comparable with the pre-First World War situation in the continent. An open confrontation between the great powers today would be cataclysmic because of the threat of nuclear weapons. The possibility of such a conflict would mean that the war is not just a European problem. Bringing the war to an end is imperative for global security and safety. Wars typically come to an end either through outright victories or talks. The first year of the war suggests that the first option is unrealistic for either side, which means Russia, Ukraine and the West should prepare for an eventual settlement. The earlier they begin talking to each other the better it would be for the whole world.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nUkraine\n\n/\n\ndefence equipment\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nnuclear weapons\n\n/\n\nNATO",

An amendment to the Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2022 and, separately, approval by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change via the Paris and Glasgow agreements ensured that carbon markets (where \u2018carbon credits\u2019 and \u2018emission certificates\u2019 can be traded) have acquired greater global currency. \u2018Carbon markets\u2019 are a catch-all term and need clarity, especially in the Indian context. A decade or more ago, they meant stock-market-like exchanges that traded in \u2018carbon offsets\u2019 made legitimate under the Clean Development Mechanism. Here, industrial projects in developing countries that avoided greenhouse gas emissions were eligible for credits that, after verification, could be sold to European companies that could buy them in lieu of cutting emissions themselves. Alongside are the EU-Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) where government-mandated emission limits on industrial sectors such as aluminium or steel plants require industries to either cut emissions or buy government-certified permits from companies that cut more emissions than required or were auctioned by governments. Carbon credits became valuable because they could be used as permits in EU-ETS exchanges. Such permits are a \u2018right to pollute\u2019 and being tradeable on an exchange, akin to shares, are expected to fluctuate in value depending on a company\u2019s need to balance profitability and comply with pollution norms.The objective of such markets is to incentivise investments in renewable energy sources. While India has maintained its right to grow its carbon emissions in the near future, it has committed to cutting the emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) of its growth by 45% (of 2005 levels) by 2030. It has been doing this, partly, via the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, where around 1,000 industries have been involved in procuring and trading energy saving certificates (ESCerts). Since 2015, various cycles of the PAT have shown emission reductions of around 3%-5%. The European Union, which runs the oldest emission trading scheme since 2005, had cut emissions by 35% from 2005-2019 and 9% in 2009, over the previous years. Whether carbon trading can meaningfully lead to emissions reductions in the Indian context is a question that can be answered only decades later. It would, however, be a victory in itself, if it is able to mobilise domestic finance and accelerate the shift away from fossil fuel. With that end in mind, the government must intervene to bring in the right amount of pressure on industry to participate in the market but not ignore proven non-market initiatives to achieve greenhouse gas reductions.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncarbon emissions\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nrenewable energy\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations (climate change)\n\n/\n \n Paris Climate Summit COP21",

        "full_article": "Bengal assembly on Tuesday amended a 51-year-old legislation, to punish vandalism. The amendment, Maintenance of Public Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023, makes the original act more stringent to deter destruction of private and public property during protests. Both governments and judiciary have rightly taken a dim view of vandalism. Dissatisfied with the relevant central and state legislations, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the problem in 2007 and set up two committees to look into it.\nThe suggestions made by two committees represent both the justifiable position on cracking down on vandals, and the challenge in enacting a law that deters theft and destruction of property. The committees didn\u2019t want the burden of proof to be on the accused and were also wary of guilt by association \u2013 someone who did not vandalise but was a part of a protest that turned violent. The gap between the right intent and loose laws leads to abuse of power. Consider the law introduced by UP in 2020 to deal with vandalism during protests. Its implementation ran into problems with the apex court because all stages of the legal process were controlled by the executive, thereby, violating the principle of separation of powers.\nThis is an important reason why legislation to deter damage to property, public or private, can end up losing support. The Bengal legislation has tried to follow due process by providing an opportunity for the accused to be heard in the event the property is attached. However, the initiation of the process on the grounds of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d is bound to be tricky in India as a weak criminal justice system often leads to miscarriage of justice.\nPerversely, such laws can end up magnifying what is called the doctrine of chilling effect \u2013 a law or a set of practices that have the effect of undermining freedom of expression. This is in fact already in play thanks to vaguely worded laws enacted in multiple states. The legislature is duty-bound to ensure that vandalism does not hide behind legitimate expression of dissent or protest. But even more important perhaps is that laws to deal with this do not, because of poor drafting, compromised police forces and weak investigation, end up stifling dissent. On the face of it, Bengal\u2019s law provides for due process. However, its fallout will depend largely on the quality of policing.\n\n",

If they act at odds instead, it will easily sabotage the thorny investigation. Those named in the FIR registered in Rajasthan include Haryana police informers and Rajasthan police\u2019s first arrest in the case has led to damning claims about Haryana police\u2019s role in the vigilante killing. But \u201c30-40\u201d unnamed Rajasthan cops have themselves been charged by Haryana police with serious crimes in a February 17 raid, including causing miscarriage.\nAs it is, police are poor at prosecuting their own wrongdoing. In this case that weakness is being worsened by an even larger problem in India\u2019s law and order system. Remember how the Supreme Court found the Rhea Chakrabarty investigation put under a cloud by the acrimony between Maharashtra and Bihar, back when one was governed by MVA and the other by NDA. Last year, Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga was in the middle of the overtly politicised faceoff between Punjab police and Haryana/Delhi police. More recently, when a Chhattisgarh police team visited Greater Noida to pick up suspects in a multi-city betting racket, local police invoked kidnapping charges against the visiting cops.\nIn the current case, Rajasthan police underline their argument by saying they were accompanied by local Haryana police during the raid there. But why was the raid not videographed? And meanwhile, the Tuesday mahapanchayat held in Haryana in support of the accused saw threats that if Rajasthan police came to arrest them, it wouldn\u2019t get to \u201creturn on the same feet\u201d.

        "full_article": "With the soaring inflation rate in recent times, the importance of effective public food distribution cannot be emphasised enough. While already recovering from pandemic-incurred losses, it is proving difficult for people at the lower end of the distribution chain to cope with the price hikes without adequate support from the government. However, the recent statistics from public food distribution appear to be not addressing this inflationary pressure.\nAccording to the latest data of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), despite showing a slight decline, food inflation (from the base of 2005-06) is recorded at 7.76 percent, with the rate in rural areas being 7.92 percent and that in the urban areas being 7.41 percent. If we take into account people's income growth, we can observe that their real earnings, based on these two indicators, are in fact exhibiting a declining trend. For example, point-to-point growth of the wage index (with 2010-11 being the base year) across several months was less than that of the consumer price index. The average increase in the price levels for January-October 2022 was 7.45 percent, whereas the average growth of the wage index for the same period was 6.44 percent (rebased for the year 2010-11).\nAgainst this backdrop, we can also observe a downward trend of the public food distribution system (PFDS). Between July 2022 and February 9, 2023, around 1.62 million metric tons of rice and wheat was distributed under the PFDS, while the amount was 1.72 million metric tons between July 2021 and February 3, 2022 \u2013 as per food ministry data. The decline is linked to the steep fall in the distribution of wheat (from 400,000 metric tons to 290,000 metric tons during the corresponding time periods) with a moderate decline in rice distribution (from 1.62 million metric tons to 1.33 million metric tons). As for rice, 197,000 metric tons were distributed under the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme, 133,000 metric tons under the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) programme, and 27,000 metric tons under the food for work programme. On the other hand, within the wheat distribution scheme, the corresponding amounts were 46 metric tons, 262 metric tons, and 40,000 metric tons, respectively. The overall fall in wheat distribution can be linked to the supply disruption caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. In such cases, however, it would be expected that the distribution of rice would be raised to compensate for this decline in wheat stock.\nIt is worth noting that, despite a relative decline in the overall price level in the last few months, on February 16, 2023, the retail price per kilogramme of coarse rice was as high as Tk 50, and the price of wheat flour ranged between Tk 58 and Tk 60. The importance of expanding PFDS is, therefore, obvious.\n\nDespite a relative decline in the overall price level in the last few months, on February 16, 2023, the retail price per kilogramme of coarse rice was as high as Tk 50, and the price of wheat flour ranged between Tk 58 and Tk 60. The importance of expanding PFDS is, therefore, obvious.\nHowever, despite there being sufficient stock of rice, this is not reflected in the distribution process. According to data from the food ministry, till February 15, 2023, the total public stock of cereals (comprising rice, wheat, and paddy) amounted to around two million metric tons, with the stock of wheat amounting to 390,000 metric tons, that of rice being 1.63 million metric tons, and paddy amounting to 3,000 metric tons. It is crucial that the government utilises its stock of cereals, especially that of rice, under its food distribution system.\nThere is no denying that, against the backdrop of the adjustments made to accommodate post-Covid recovery, the steep rise in the prices of commodities have put people with fixed incomes under immense pressure. The PFDS can therefore act as a crucial tool for providing support not only to the poor and the vulnerable, but also to middle-income people with fixed earnings.\nThe authorities must expand the distribution system to reach those at the bottom of the distribution chain, while also ensuring transparency in the system. Stricter monitoring is needed at different stages of distribution, and inefficiencies at the administrative and distributional levels must be dealt with seriously. The total budgetary allocation for the safety net programme is also inadequate; raising that budget will be the first step towards ensuring food security.\nOne important consideration in this regard would be to expand the PFDS in a way that, in addition to the poor, the non-poor yet vulnerable population can also be accommodated. As for the middle-income group, fair price shops (in addition to the PFDS) can be administered by employers in urban areas to support their workers.\nAll these initiatives should, however, be complemented by sufficient distribution of foodgrains. In maintaining the minimum stock, the distribution of foodgrains should match not only the requirement, but also the domestic production. In this regard, total procurement and distribution should not be affected even if the amount of production or import price of one of the cereals is unfavourable.\nDr Sayema Haque Bidisha\u00a0is professor at the Department of Economics in Dhaka University, and research director at the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem).\n\n",

        "full_article": "Ensuring safe water to urban households remains a major public health challenge in Bangladesh. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is to ensure access to water and sanitation for all. Bangladesh has been experiencing rapid increase in urban population since independence: urban population as a percentage of total population increased from about eight percent in 1971 to nearly 40 percent in 2022.\nWith the rise in urban population, the number of municipalities has also increased in Bangladesh. In 1974, there were only 50 municipalities in the country, which went up to 329 in 2020. However, about half of the municipalities have no piped water supply system, most of which are small towns. Again, except the four largest cities, less than 10 percent of the population in most other towns are connected to the piped water networks. Although access to water in the residential premises increased from 74.2 percent to 82.4 percent between 2013 and 2019 in the country, the water sources are mainly deep or shallow tube wells and are not necessarily free from contamination.\nThe quality of water is critical for maintaining household health, since poor quality water is directly linked with communicable diseases, such as diarrhoea. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of diarrhoeal disease is attributable to drinking contaminated water, improper sanitation, and poor hygiene.\nThe Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), which is under the LGED ministry, is mandated to construct water supply infrastructure, such as production tube wells, water treatment plants, and distribution pipelines in all the municipal areas across the country. When the construction work is completed, the DPHE hands over the system to the municipalities to operate and maintain. The capital assets are provided free of cost to the municipalities through the Annual Development Programme (ADP) without any repayment requirements, but the local bodies are expected to cover operating costs and the overall financial viability of the water supply systems. The government has been strongly emphasising the need for cost recovery in the water sector in recent years.\nThe Local Government (Municipality) Act, 2009 legally delegated the responsibility to the municipalities for providing clean water to their urban residents. However, despite the fact that the DPHE is constructing the systems and upgrading them where needed, the municipalities cannot afford to run the water supply systems in an efficient manner. They also cannot make it financially viable due to low water tariff on the consumer end. Most of the municipalities impose water tariffs ranging from Tk 200 to Tk 400 per household per month. The industrial and commercial water tariffs are slightly higher than the domestic rates. The water metres are not in use in smaller municipalities. With low water tariffs, the collection efficiency is also low and may vary between 50 percent and 70 percent, depending on the municipal council's initiatives and the collection efforts made by the water supply staff.\nWhile the DPHE is yet to install the water infrastructure to cover most of the smaller municipalities in Bangladesh, the urban local bodies are unable to run them properly where they do have the system. The revenue earned from water supply is inadequate to maintain a basic piped water system, and therefore remain virtually dependent on the subsidy given out of the holding tax revenue collected by the municipal bodies. Most of the municipalities have also failed to increase the number of water connections, maintain the required quality of water, and collect higher water fees from the consumers. In this situation, most of the urban households continue to use groundwater from both deep and shallow tube wells.\nThe government has a Sector Development Plan (2011-2025) for drinking water and sanitation. The plan had a target for piped water supply coverage of 80 percent in large municipalities and 70 percent in small municipalities by 2020. By 2025, the sectoral plan has a target of 90 percent coverage in large municipalities and 80 percent in small municipalities. In order to achieve these targets, there is an urgent need to enhance the level of investment in the water sector in the municipalities. It is essential to raise investment in water supply to also achieve the SDG 6 target of \"safe and sustainable sanitation, hygiene and drinking water used by all.\"\nThe municipal bodies must take water supply as their mandatory function more seriously and draw up a medium-term plan to bring 100 percent of urban population under a piped water supply network by 2030. They are expected to provide clean water to the people and at the same time establish a water tariff as per Model By-Laws (Water Supply), 1999 that is adequate for achieving full cost recovery of water supply. The municipalities should use modern methods such as computerised billing and collection of water tariffs to attain financial viability.\nWhile it is essential to increase piped water supply provision, it is also necessary to raise public awareness to increase demand for clean water and regularly pay the bills. There is a tendency among many urban households, as socioeconomic studies have shown, to continue using water from tube wells for drinking and everyday use and not accept piped water because they need to pay the water tariff.\nTo change this attitude, the government should revisit its policy of free or heavily subsidised distribution of tube wells in urban areas. When the urban households compare the cost of piped water with tube well water, they find it cheaper to continue with their tube well water. Therefore, there is a need to undertake a communication campaign to popularise piped water and raise demand for it from the perspective of its health consequence, as tube well water contains many impurities.\nTherefore, in densely populated municipal areas of Bangladesh, all households must be brought under safe piped water supply networks within the shortest possible time.\nDr Nawshad Ahmed,\u00a0a former UN official, is an economist and urban planner.\n\n",

Fast forward two years, and we still don't have any such dedicated authority. What was the point of the revised building code then? Was it so that the authorities could simply pretend that they did something to ensure proper building safety? Or was it to actually ensure that building safety is maintained in our country? If it was the latter, then the authorities have done an atrocious job at it.\nUrban planning expert M Abu Sadeque, who was in the team that formulated the revised BNBC, said the revised code is a complete set of rules to ensure safe construction of buildings, use of quality materials, accountability of professionals, and conservation of the environment. But in the absence of a regulatory body to implement it, loss of lives and properties continue to happen in various building disasters. Fire safety measures are being largely ignored during building construction across the country. And such negligence makes high-rise buildings particularly vulnerable to fires, as we very recently saw in Gulshan, Dhaka.\nFollowing the devastating FR Tower fire in the capital's Banani area in 2019, the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) carried out a field survey on buildings that are 10 storeys and higher, and found 475 of them to have been constructed without its approval and 1,343 others with more floors or floor space than approved by Rajuk.

Yet, in spite of the disasters that have take place in our country in recent times, and even the devastating disasters that we have seen occurring elsewhere \u2013 the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, for example \u2013 the authorities seem to be least concerned about enforcing the necessary safety measures that could make the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of people.\nSuch attitude on the part of the authorities is not only unacceptable, but it is criminal. They are literally putting hundreds of thousands of lives at risk on a daily basis. There is no reason for the authorities to be arrogant enough to believe that sooner or later Bangladesh, too, would not be a victim of a serious natural disaster such as an earthquake. In fact, it is almost guaranteed that it eventually will be. Are we to hold our breath and hope that the authorities will come to their senses before that?\nThe authorities need to realise that waiting and hoping in this case is a recipe for disaster. The government should urgently form the BBRA, and work on enforcing the BNBC for all our sakes.\n",

Yet, in spite of the disasters that have take place in our country in recent times, and even the devastating disasters that we have seen occurring elsewhere \u2013 the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, for example \u2013 the authorities seem to be least concerned about enforcing the necessary safety measures that could make the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of people.\nSuch attitude on the part of the authorities is not only unacceptable, but it is criminal. They are literally putting hundreds of thousands of lives at risk on a daily basis. There is no reason for the authorities to be arrogant enough to believe that sooner or later Bangladesh, too, would not be a victim of a serious natural disaster such as an earthquake. In fact, it is almost guaranteed that it eventually will be. Are we to hold our breath and hope that the authorities will come to their senses before that?\nThe authorities need to realise that waiting and hoping in this case is a recipe for disaster. The government should urgently form the BBRA, and work on enforcing the BNBC for all our sakes.\n",

        "full_article": "The recent incident of brutal torture inflicted on Phulpori, a first-year student of Islamic University in Kushtia, by two leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and their cohorts at a residential hall of the university has once again exposed the terror tactics that BCL leaders and activists generally use to establish their supremacy on our public university campuses. By now, we all know the details of how Phulpori was tortured for hours and threatened by the female leaders of the IU BCL unit for staying at a residential hall without taking their permission.\nUnfortunately, after Phulpori filed a written complaint with the university authorities, it took them a while to take any action in the incident. They only ordered Sanjida and Tabassum, the two accused in the incident, to leave the hall following a High Court directive. But is this enough of a punishment for committing such a heinous crime? While we understand that the university authorities cannot take any action against the accused before their probe committee submits its report, given our past experiences, we cannot be assured that such a committee would form its reports independently and on time \u2013 particularly when none other than the BCL is involved.\n\nThe courage that young Phulpori showed in the face of opposition from all, including the university administration, should encourage all students to stand united against such atrocious activities of the ill-intentioned groups in all university campuses.\nThe IU episode has reminded us of the many past incidents where ordinary students were tortured, harassed or even had to die at the hands of BCL cadres at our public universities. The brutal murder of Buet student Abrar Fahad by BCL goons is still fresh in our minds. And, only the other day, we came to know of another incident at Rajshahi University where a male student was mentally and physically tortured by BCL men. Around the same time, we also learned how BCL leaders and activists at Dhaka University are mugging commuters and general students on campus, creating an atmosphere of fear. The ruling party's student wing has literally turned the gono rooms of public universities into torture cells, under the very noses of hall authorities.\nHowever, the news that the university's BCL unit has suspended the two accused members has given us some hope that change is possible, if we all fight together. The courage that young Phulpori showed in the face of opposition from all, including the university administration, should encourage all students to stand united against such atrocious activities of the ill-intentioned groups in all university campuses.\nWe urge the IU authorities to conduct an impartial probe into the incident and give exemplary punishment to those involved in torturing Phulpori. Until then, they must take responsibility for ensuring her safety and security, and that of her family members, so that they are not harmed in any way by the BCL and their followers.\n",

        "full_article": "If the officials of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge (PMB) are right to consider dredging in the upstream of its location a threat to it, the view should not be taken lightly. Well, dredging in the downstream, however, poses no such threat, according to the project authorities. Now the question is, how grave the threat is and if it is immediate or will give enough time to obviate it. The officials involved with the maintenance of the bridge fear that random dredging within 10-15 kilometre of the bridge in the upstream can prove dangerous. Given treacherous nature of shifting soil of the river bed and a sudden change in channels, river erosion has ever remained unpredictable. Even at a far greater distance, dredging can change the contour of the river prompting sudden changes in the direction of water flows, particularly in the monsoon and post-monsoon period. However, there is a catch-22 situation as the project authorities have their jurisdiction only within 250 metres upstream and downstream from the bridge proper. But the entities like the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) and the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) have authorities over all matters related to rivers. What happens in this country when different government organisations are involved with an issue ---one that is challenging and demand maximum cooperation between and among them, is nothing to boast of. Putting their act together mostly takes eternity if it ever happens. Even these corporations and agencies are ill-equipped to have a measure of the potential threat unplanned dredging in the upstream poses to the Padma Bridge. Experts in river training are the right people to have adequate knowledge of the swirling current that might carry away all things on its path. The good thing is that extensive river training was carried out for long before confirming the sustainability of the bridge for at least 100 years. What, however, is a cause for concern is the total disappearance of the two-kilometre long islet (char) stretching from pier-13 to pier 27 by now. The islet, let it be noted, had been formed just before the construction of the bridge began. Does it not indicate the unpredictability of the river's channel shift? Dredging can cause irreparable damage to infrastructure, human settlements of hundreds of years old and land masses. It is therefore prudent to take opinion of the river training experts before carrying out extensive dredging in the upstream. What is the urgency of dredging now that the transportation has become easier by road and the ferry service is no longer an imperative? After all, the Tk 301.93-billion bridge project cannot be made vulnerable either for facilitating ferry service or for the spitting bonanza from dredging for some influential people whose main concern is immediate big personal gains no matter if the country's interests or future have to be sacrificed. The maintenance team's command area of 250 metres on either side of water cannot serve the purpose. It has to be incorporated with the overall course, including river erosion and sudden channel shifts and littoral conditions in order to offset any threat to the bridge. It would be wise to form a permanent commission involving river training experts, the bridge authority, BIWTA and BWDB to get the safety of the bridge protected.",

        "full_article": "Jimmy Carter is an ailing man today.In November 1976, when we were young, Jimmy Carter became President of the United States. He had defeated Gerald Ford. And for those of us who watched post-Watergate politics unfold in distant America from home here in Bangladesh, it was a thrilling moment. Here was a man, absolutely an unknown quantity in high stakes politics --- and he was a peanut farmer who had served as Governor of the state of Georgia --- who through sheer grit and determination had risen to the top.It was the debates Carter engaged in with President Ford that we watched at the American Centre in Dhanmondi and which convinced us that he was unbeatable. At one of those encounters, Ford made the terrible gaffe of stating that there was no Soviet influence in Poland. The remark devastated the Ford campaign and was certainly one of the reasons why voters put Carter over the top. We celebrated --- my friends and I --- when Jimmy Carter triumphed over Gerald Ford.That was decades ago. Decades on, Carter's life draws to an end at his home in Georgia, home where he is taking hospice treatment as he waits for the sunset. He is ninety-eight, the oldest former President to have lived to such an advanced age. It would be easy to regard a declining Carter as just another episode in American presidential history, but the record of his post-presidential years precludes that possibility. Carter's greatness has fundamentally been his achievements since the end of his single term in the White House in 1981, when a changing America, a conservative America, saw Ronald Reagan beat him hollow at the presidential election in November 1980.And yet it would not be proper to ignore the light emitted by the Carter presidency, particularly through his efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East. He reached out to Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, convincing them to come to Washington and reach a deal that would transform the history of the region. The Camp David Accords were an achievement that should have brought him the Nobel for Peace, but that prize went instead to the Egyptian and the Israeli. It would be a long number of years later, not till 2002, that Carter would have the Nobel come to him.As Carter waits serenely for death to come to him, it is the nobility in the man which serves as a reminder of the decency that has consistently underscored his worldview. He began his presidency on a plank he thought would be appreciated by the world. Human rights, he fervently believed, would underpin American foreign policy on his watch. And yet the ways of the political world soon made him realise that realpolitik was not about noble ideas but about tough global imponderables. He travelled to Tehran in the fading days of the Shah's rule and mistakenly described Iran as an island of stability. Months later, the ayatollahs sent Reza Pahlavi packing. An embarrassed Carter was then treated to the indignity of seeing Iran's Revolutionary Guards seize the US embassy and keep America's diplomats hostage for as many as 444 days.Good men, in every region of life, are often tripped up by unexpected roadblocks of misfortune. And so it was with Carter that bad tidings undermined his presidency at nearly every turn. The economy was a mess, so much so that the President himself informed Americans that a malaise was abroad in the land. Americans did not like what they heard. Carter's efforts to spring the diplomats in Tehran to freedom came to naught when helicopters sent out on the rescue mission crashed in the Iranian desert. Leonid Brezhnev undermined him when he sent Soviet troops into Afghanistan in December 1979.At home, his popularity plummeting, Jimmy Carter was compelled to use every ounce of energy to beat back the challenge for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1980 from Edward Kennedy. He survived the challenge, but with the Republicans coming forth with a confidence-inspiring Reagan as the election approached, Carter's was a doomed candidacy. All the stars seemed aligned against him. He lost badly. Moments into Reagan's inauguration in January 1981, the Iranians freed the hostages. The ayatollahs had seen to it that Carter lost his bid for a second term but were quick to ensure the hostages did not become an issue for his successor.Like so many of his presidential predecessors, Carter could have walked quietly away into the sunset and into oblivion. But that was not to be his style. With wife Rosalynn, a woman devoted to him and his causes beyond measure, he set up the Carter Centre as his way of attempting solutions to the manifold problems confronting nations in the deprived regions of the world. He went into the noble job of observing elections where politics has largely been in a state of chaos. The health of underprivileged, malnourished children in Africa and Asia brought him squarely up against the thousand and one maladies societies have historically been laid low by. Bad governance he railed against.Carter, despite advancing age, showed not the least fatigue in jetting off to trouble spots around the world, where government leaders and civil societies waited for him. Trust was what they equated with Carter, who dispensed with protocol as he sat talking to impoverished villagers in the hamlets of Africa and argued for credible elections before the mighty in Asia. It was much the same he did in Latin America. Purity of character lit up his very being as he commiserated with the world's underdogs.For Jimmy Carter, religion was a powerful element which sustained him in politics and beyond politics. A born-again Christian, he was not averse to speaking from the heart, even though he knew it might lead to problems for him. At the height of the presidential campaign in 1976, he candidly told a journal that he had committed adultery many times in his heart. The comments led to an uproar, with some even fearing they might cost him the election. Carter did not seek to clarify his remarks. He was not ready to engage in semantics to explain what he had so truthfully stated.At age ninety-eight, Jimmy Carter is the embodiment of a career which shines far more brilliantly than the careers of so many of his predecessors and successors in the White House. He has never pretended to have been a great President, but the world has since his sad departure from office increasingly come to regard him as a great former President. The moral arc which has defined him --- as a politician, as a husband and father, as a man of God --- will remain his claim on history.Jimmy Carter is and will be a powerful, insistent political metaphor --- in our era and beyond. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "With the end of winter and a steady rise in temperature, the demand for electricity has started increasing just before the onset of summer. The demand primarily goes up due to the extensive use of electrical fans and airconditioners. The higher demand for electricity remains in the months between March and September. The peak demand during this summer is projected to be around 16,500 megawatts (MW) as against the country's total installed power generation capacity of around 22,700MW. However, the country had a bitter experience in the second half of last year when consumers across the board witnessed severe load-shedding due to a substantial cut in power generation. The government had to suspend power generation in some plants due to the shortage of energy, mainly gas and fuel oils. It had been meeting the energy demand more or less up to the satisfaction of the consumers until the first half of last year by importing primary energy. But the import dependence proved not to be sustainable as the international energy market started getting volatile due to the war in Ukraine. Economic activities across the world got momentum following the Covid-19 pandemic, already pushing up the demand for energy and their prices to some extent. Bangladesh has been able to absorb the shock until then, but the situation went beyond its control when the prices started hitting record highs due to the prolonged war. The rising import expenditure put pressure on the budget by way of ballooning subsidies, followed by the suspension of importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the highly-priced spot market as well as generation in some plants and rationing supplies. The fast depletion of foreign exchange reserves added fuel to the fire, deepening the crisis. The government, however, passed the price pressure to an extent on to the consumers by raising the energy prices on a few occasions. The power subscribers did not experience frequent load-shedding during the immediate past winter season. The power utilities had been able to maintain a balance between demand and supply, facing not many complaints about power cuts. In addition to lower winter demand, power supply from the Payra coal-based power plant at full capacity contributed a lot. However, it cannot be said if the upcoming summer demand could be served with the new plants, including the one at Rampal, coming online and resuming LNG imports from the spot market. There is every possibility that the ongoing US dollar crisis would hold back the authorities concerned to spend less on energy imports. They would be compelled to limit imports, which may result in a power generation that would fall short of demand. Although the import prices of energy presently remain almost stable at their high levels, there is every possibility of further hikes as the Ukraine war is prolonged. Latest projections by different international research bodies offer no hope that the prices would fall soon. The cash-strapped private power producers would not be able to contribute much unless they get their due bills released. Thus, the utilities would have to struggle especially when they will have to meet the occasional rise in the demand for power during the upcoming irrigation season and the holy month of Ramadan. Taking all the downsides into account, it is highly unlikely that the demand for power during the upcoming summer could be met. In the best-case scenario, according to experts, 13,500-14,000MW of electricity would be possible to supply during this season against the demand for around 16,500MW. The authorities would have hardly any option to make up for the gap during this short period. All the plans they have are mid-to long-term ones. However, an aggressive campaign to develop a switching-off habit may greatly help save electricity.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

The alleged assault on a female student in Kushtia Islamic University in the name of ragging has already made headlines. She has made serious allegations of being torture by a leader of the ruling party's student wing. Also, four female students of Jashore University of Science and Technology fell ill a few days ago after being harassed by senior students. Ragging is not a new thing in Bangladesh. When a new batch of students arrives in a university, some senior students start making fun of them in the name of getting introduced to them. Instead of welcoming them cordially, the seniors start teaching them the so-called manners of the university, which is often called 'guest room culture' or ragging. Sometimes, they make the juniors sing and dance in public. This is quite humiliating and disturbing for the new students. In many countries, ragging is a crime. There must be strict punishment for those who are involved in such activities. Ragging not only affects a person mentally but sometimes it can lead to physical harm. We urge the authorities concerned to stop the ragging culture from spreading. There is an urgent need to pay attention to ridding our educational institutions of this menace. We need to frame and implement rules and laws that can curb this immoral and unlawful practice.\nAshikujaman Syed,Research Assistant,Bioinformatics Research Lab,Center for Research Innovation and Development (CRID),[email\u00a0protected]",
