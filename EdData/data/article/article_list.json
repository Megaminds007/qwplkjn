        "full_article": "A special Bench of the Supreme Court of India, headed by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, will begin hearing on December 12 a batch of petitions that question the validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, a law that freezes the status of places of worship in the country as on the day of its independence and bars suits that seek to alter such status. It is no exaggeration to say these petitions pose a virulent challenge to the survival of secularism. The outcome may well decide the trajectory of communal relations and the future of secular thought in the country. The 1991 Act does have some exemptions: it did not apply to what was then the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, which ended in favour of the Ram temple. Nor does it apply to monuments, sites and remains covered by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. It will also not apply to any suit that has been finally settled or disposed of, any dispute that has been settled by the parties before the 1991 Act came into force, or to the conversion of any place that took place by acquiescence. The challenge has come in the backdrop of a renewed attempt through motivated litigation by some Hindu organisations and devotees to target mosques such as the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, the Shahi Idgah mosque in Mathura and the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal, among others. Any order that strikes down or dilutes the 1991 law is likely to have a malign influence on these proceedings.The petitions highlight the demolition of temples by invaders in the past and contend that many mosques have been built on their ruins. The Places of Worship Act, they claim, legalises such depredations, and also violates the right of Hindus and other communities to reclaim their places of worship through legal proceedings. It also violates the right to practise and propagate religion and manage and administer places of worship. Ironically, they also contend that the Act goes against the principle of secularism, which would surely stand to be undermined if their attempts to reclaim these sites succeed. Fortunately, there are some clearly established principles in favour of the Act. In its Ayodhya judgment, a five-member Bench observed that the law \u201cimposes a non-derogable obligation towards enforcing our commitment to secularism\u201d. It also called it a \u201clegislative intervention that preserves non-retrogression as an essential feature of our secular values\u201d. For the present, it does not seem likely that the Court will depart from the Constitution\u2019s secular vision and Parliament\u2019s mandate against misusing judicial fora to remedy historical wrongs.

        "full_article": "The regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen in Syria. The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former arm of al-Qaeda that had rebranded itself, is now the most powerful force in the country. Between a secular dictatorship that collapsed like a house of cards and a surging group of militants with a menacing recent past lies the present and future of 23.5 million Syrians. Eight years ago, Mr. Assad seemed to be winning the civil war. He had recaptured most of the lost territories, with help from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. A tense calm prevailed as militants holed themselves up in the tiny northwestern region of Idlib. In the southeast, the Kurds enjoyed limited autonomy, but bought peace with Damascus. Syria was readmitted into the Arab League. Gulf monarchs, who once funded the anti-Assad militancy, embraced him. But his victory was hollow, as he relied on external allies for security. His army, which fought years of civil war, was in bad shape. Under crippling U.S. sanctions, the government\u2019s finances were in a shambles. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. To tackle dissent, the regime turned up repression, widening the social schisms.However, what made Mr. Assad\u2019s dramatic fall on December 8 possible were factors beyond his direct control. After the Israel-Hamas war broke out in 2023, Israel has carried out air strikes in Syria, which weakened its armed forces. Israel\u2019s war against Hezbollah substantially limited the Lebanese outfit\u2019s ability to continue to help Mr. Assad. Iran, which lost officers in Syria, also took a step back, while Russia has been preoccupied with the Ukraine war. The weakening and distraction of the alliance provided the HTS, backed by T\u00fcrkiye, a golden opportunity. And it took just 12 days for the HTS, and other militias, to reach Damascus as the regime army melted away. With Mr. Assad gone, Syria has an opportunity to build a new future. But the key actors of change are far from promising. The HTS wants to turn Syria, a diverse country with Sunnis, Alawites, Christians, Shias and Druze, into an Islamic state. The Syrian National Army, a sidekick of the HTS, is a Turkish proxy. In the south, there are numerous local militias. It is to be seen whether the winners of the civil war are going to unite under a national flag or, as in the case of the post-Communist Afghanistan or post-Qadhafi Libya, going to start a new one. A desirable outcome would be the establishment of a transition government, a disarming of the militias and the laying of the foundations of an inclusive new republic. But given Syria\u2019s tumultuous history, societal fissures, and the ideological and programmatic characteristics of the militias, a likelier outcome would be more chaos and instability. That is the tragedy of Syria.

        "full_article": "Moscow\u2019s welcome to ex-Syrian despot is part of an old story of political elites looking after each other\u00a0\nAssad has found asylum in Russia, escaping the bloody fates of Saddam and Gaddafi. Expect details of his last-minute flight from Damascus to land on OTT soon. Meanwhile, his survival shows the timeless compact of the ruling class to watch each other\u2019s backs is alive. Down ages, asylum has been a privilege of the elite. Mughal king Humayun sought refuge in Persia, and was well treated. French and Russian royal exiles were accommodated by other European powers. India granted the Dalai Lama asylum in 1959, and a safe house to Sheikh Hasina in Aug this year. Even Gaddafi, once hailed in Africa as \u2018king of kings\u2019, was offered asylum by tiny Guinea-Bissau before his convoy took a wrong turn and fate bayoneted him in the posterior.\nFor all their crimes against humanity, fallen dictators aren\u2019t pursued with the same zeal as Nazi war criminals. In fact, some of them have gone on to lead lives of luxury. Idi Amin was variously held responsible for 80,000 to half-a-million killings in Uganda, but when his regime collapsed he found refuge in Saudi Arabia, a villa in Jeddah and a choice of cars. Haiti\u2019s Jean-Claude Duvalier made Paris his home after embezzling some $100mn. Mengistu Haile Mariam, architect of Ethiopia\u2019s \u2018red terror\u2019, was made welcome in Zimbabwe despite accusations of genocide. Not just dictators, Russian oligarchs qualify for the West\u2019s hospitality with their wealth, and the odd political fugitive, like a Julian Assange or an Edward Snowden, makes the cut on my-enemy\u2019s-enemy-is-my-friend basis.\nThe bottom line for asylum is political utility, something three-year-old Alan Kurdi didn\u2019t have. It\u2019s been nine years since the toddler\u2019s body washed up on Turkey\u2019s shore. He was a victim of Assad\u2019s war, trying to reach the safety of Europe in a hopeless boat.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Delhi\u2019s next election\u2019s a hot potato, but what really counts will barely be discussed\nPolitical twins Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have staked their political futures on Delhi assembly election 2025 \u2013 both out on bail and both back to earnestly campaigning on their 2013 \u2018honest neta\u2019 plank. In the aftermath of money laundering allegations that played out through the year, both proclaimed when they quit, separately, that they\u2019d return to office only if voters gave them a clean chit. It was hitting two birds with one stone: making the election a trial by voter, and reiterating the alleged unfairness of law enforcement.\nJail stint clearly served another CM, Hemant Soren, well in Jharkhand, who went on to win handsomely on a tribal identity plank. Unlike Soren, Kejriwal had refused to resign when arrested, opting to play a king-in-exile card. AAP\u2019s constant Hindu-hum continued when Atishi, a rare first-time legislator to assume the post, had posed next to an empty chair to symbolise Kejriwal as the \u2018real\u2019 Ram. Another CM, Omar Abdullah in newest UT J&K, just days ago, said \u201cdual power system should end\u201d, while his party talked of certain issues as \u201cjob of an elected govt, not a nominated person\u201d. Kejriwal knows this tune well \u2013 he\u2019s had dealings, to put it mildly, with three LGs.\nPowers of Delhi\u2019s elected govt stand considerably whittled. AAP govt\u2019s been on a collision course with its bureaucracy. It bickers with its allies. Having won 62 of 70 seats in 2020, this time\u2019s poll strategy hangs entirely on Kejriwal\u2019s political acumen \u2013 his netagiri sharper than his anti-corruption crusader role. In a smart move, Sisodia, who won by just a little over 3,000 votes in 2020, has been shifted, his traditional middle-class east Delhi seat clearly not safe anymore.\nAAP became a national party last Sep after winning 5 seats in Gujarat state polls \u2013 alongside govts in Delhi and Punjab, where it made electoral capital from farmers\u2019 protests, and 2 MLAs in Goa. In home turf Delhi, it\u2019s AAP\u2019s toughest battle yet. Delhi\u2019s 2020 election was held at the height of anti-CAA protests \u2013 with its epicentre the women\u2019s resistance at Shaheen Bagh, even as Covid crept up rapidly while the Centre prepared for Trump\u2019s visit, followed by communal clashes in Delhi. Yesterday, the former CM worried over law and order in Delhi. Kejriwal\u2019s spoilt for political issues to campaign on \u2013 sadly, none of it will likely be about the decay of India\u2019s richest city, its toxic air, or mismanaged waste, appalling urban transport system, its traffic woes or the desperation of its lower middle classes, where mid-day meal cooks are paid 1,000 a month.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We love pressing it, whether the injury be grave or slight\nIn the midst of a fairly fierce diplomatic row between India and Bangladesh, a senior BNP neta has called upon Bangladeshis to boycott all Indian products and to instead buy and use only \u2018national\u2019 products. As a symbolic gesture, he burned a Made in India sari that belonged to his wife. This presumably has strained relations with both India and his wife.\nThis looks oddly like a page from the Indian playbook. It reminds me of a popular Kannada idiom Suryange torch aa? and the equally funny Lakshmige blank cheque aa? which roughly translate to \u2018flashing a torch at the sun\u2019 and \u2018having the audacity to give a blank cheque to Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth\u2019. Indians are masters of taking offence and boycotting goods and services as a response to the slightest slight or the most grievous infringement.\nCalls for boycott of goods, movies, books, persons and communities at large seem to be the most popular Indian hashtag on X, including a present counter-call to boycott Bangladesh products. A boycott seems to be our first line of defence against foreign aggression and quite a popular national pastime. Though India\u2019s share of total Chinese exports is a measly 3%, we have tried to teach a lesson to China for border transgressions by boycotting minor products, not to mention our social media war cries scripted on Chinese-made mobile phones.\nEqually, we boycott movies, streaming platforms and even the entire Bollywood movie industry for hurting religious sentiments, actors for not dressing appropriately, companies for running ad campaigns that promote interfaith marriages, and so on. Aren\u2019t we worried that, at this rate, we will not be left with much in terms of choice? Many of our boycott movements take inspiration from the Swadeshi movement, probably the last time such boycott worked.\nThere also seems to be a universal \u2018pay it forward\u2019 scheme. Bangladesh boycotts Indian products, India boycotts Chinese goods, China itself had boycotted Japanese goods, Americans have boycotted both Chinese and Japanese products, and almost all countries have tried and failed to boycott American products. The only common element is that all these movements failed in achieving their objectives, except giving a minor sense of self-righteous accomplishment. Given its ineffectiveness, can we finally say that it\u2019s time to develop better responses to serious issues and maybe boycott the boycott as our action of first resort?\n\n",

It wasn\u2019t just good \u2014 it was awesomely beautiful, almost like printed letters on a textbook.\n\u00a0Unable to contain my admiration, I asked him, \u201cWhat a beautiful handwriting you have! How did you master it?\u201d\u00a0\nHe smiled, a quiet pride lighting up his face. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s all because of my elder brother. I studied in a village school where we didn\u2019t have much access to modern tools or even proper stationery. One day, my elder brother told me, \u2018You see those words printed in your textbook? Make your handwriting look like that.\u2019 I took his advice to heart and diligently practiced, copying every curve and line as if I were engraving it onto my future.\u201d\u00a0\nThe postmaster paused, reminiscing. \u201cI was good at studies, too. But life had its plans. I couldn\u2019t pursue higher education beyond my graduation. Instead, I took up this government job, which allowed me to support my family. Whatever I\u2019ve achieved, it\u2019s because of my elder brother. He taught me two invaluable lessons: to write beautifully and to live honestly, no matter what one earns.\u201d\n\u00a0His voice softened with humility as he continued. \u201cNow, I try to give back in my own small way. I help students from my village who, like me, face financial constraints and limited resources. And as a nod to my own journey, I\u2019ve started a prize for good handwriting at the school I once attended. It\u2019s my way of reminding them that even small efforts can shape their future.\u201d\u00a0\nAs he spoke, I couldn\u2019t help but reflect on his words. \u201cThese days,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople hardly write. Everything is typed on laptops or phones. Writing by hand is becoming a lost art.\u201d\u00a0\nHe is right, of course. Whether we are jotting down FM\u2019s budget speech, documenting the news, or a story we are planning \u2014 we have become accustomed to keyboards and screens. The tactile joy of pen meeting paper, the patience it demands, and the personal touch it imparts are fading away.\u00a0\nThe postmaster\u2019s story stayed with me long after I left the post office. His handwriting is more than a skill; it\u2019s a legacy \u2014 a testament to perseverance and gratitude. It definitely shows the enduring power of simple, honest efforts. It\u2019s a reminder that even in an increasingly digitized world, the written word, crafted by hand, holds a unique kind of beauty.\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "History is complicated; simplifying it is the work of politicians. My research on Bangladesh challenges the national memory of the 1971 war, as represented at the Liberation War Museum. The national archive on display at the museum feeds nationalism by creating a national memory of the 1971 war and reminds people of the common suffering encountered by the collectivity. My work investigates how gender has operated in service of Bangladeshi nationalist ideology. The representation of women's experiences at the museum lacks complexities of gender and seeks erasure of any experience that deviates from the nationalist narrative. The images in the archives of the war museum tell the story of a nation's unease with women's place in nationalist discourse.\nGender in Bangladesh, similar to everywhere else, is not a homogenous or unified category. Gender as a social construct creates social subjects whose experiences vary based on their belonging to different identity groups. Examining gendered experiences of war helps us understand the complex social relationships that construct gender in the first place and lead to the gendered experiences of war situated at the intersection of religion, ethnicity and class.\n\nDuring the war of 1971, many women were militarized and wanted to defend their nation in the war efforts, but they were not able to find an entry point into a male-dominated battlefield. They were encouraged to provide support in assisting and nurturing roles, instead of engaging in combat.\nAroma Dutta and her mother Pratiti Devi Ghatak come from a prominent political and cultural Hindu family in South Asia. The partition of India divided Ghatak's family, as some members of her family migrated to Calcutta, India and others remained in Dhaka, East Pakistan. Her brothers, Ritwik Ghatak, an acclaimed filmmaker, and Manik Ghatak, a Bengali poet and novelist left Dhaka. Mahasweta Devi is Manik Ghatak's daughter and an influential postcolonial feminist writer whose work has been translated from Bengali to English by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. The stories featured in Mahasweta Devi's Imaginary Maps concern women in tribal India haunted by the region's colonial history, or as Spivak calls them \"gendered subaltern subjects.\" Spivak writes, \"Mahasweta invites us to realize that, in the context of this fiction, for the subaltern, and especially the subaltern woman, 'Empire' and 'Nation' are interchangeable names.\" For subaltern gendered subjects, the empire-nation reversal means the substitution of one system of difference for another as the political goals of the old colony are carried forward by the new nation, as was the case in 1947 when the British left India. In post-1947 Pakistan and in Bangladesh after the liberation war of 1971, Hindus not only found themselves targeted due to their religion but their experiences have also been excluded from the dominant narratives on nationalism.\nAroma Dutta's grandfather Dhirendranath Dutta, a renowned Congressman from East Bengal, was against the partition of India. At the time of the partition, he was offered the position of the first Chief Minister of West Bengal, which meant opting for India instead of Pakistan, but more importantly it would mean leaving his home in Comilla. He declined the offer and played a crucial role in the politics of East Pakistan. When Urdu was declared the state language of Pakistan, despite the fact that only 10 per cent of the entire country's population had any knowledge of Urdu and the majority spoke Bengali, Dutta started what is now remembered as the Language Movement. In the 1960s many Bengali politicians, including Dutta, were barred from participating in politics and put under house arrest. Three days after the war started in 1971, Dutta and one of his sons were picked up by the Pakistani army, tortured and killed. While Aroma Dutta clearly remembers the events leading up to 1971, Dhirendranath Dutta's contributions to the independence of Bangladesh have been minimized, if not entirely forgotten, in the displays at the war museum. Challenging the national forgetting, Aroma Dutta's daughter and Dhirendranath Dutta's great-granddaughter, Esha Aurora wrote an opinion piece for The Daily Star on 27 March 2015 in which she candidly shared her frustration over omissions of contributions made by Hindus in the 1971 liberation war. History in South Asia is written and reproduced along the divisive line of Hindu and Muslim and that is the narrative on display at the war museum.\nWhen examining the archives of the war museum, it is impossible to miss the fact that rape took place in 1971. Instead of silencing the stories of wartime rape, the war museum offers evidence, invokes the history of rape and appropriates the rape of women for the nationalist cause. The rape of Bangladeshi women is narrated as a way of acting out power relationships by the Pakistani army \u2013 a policy implemented to humiliate the Bengali nation and to change the racial makeup of Bengalis who were considered Hindu-like and an inferior race. The highly evocative images on display remind us about the many women who were raped and killed during the war and seek justice, but these representations remain limited and they only show women who are no longer alive. Additionally, the namelessness of the women in the pictures gives rise to an ambiguity, which marks the trajectory of post-war experiences of many women.\nFerdousi Priyobhashini became a household name in the 1990s when she publicly acknowledged that she had been raped in the war and demanded accountability. While her entire life has been crystallized in a moment when the rape took place during the nine-month-long war, her experiences before and after the war have been largely considered insignificant to an exploration of gender constructions in Bangladeshi society. Priyobhashini narrates a complex story of her troubled childhood and a marriage that came to an end in 1971 after years of physical and verbal abuse by her husband. Her economic needs made her vulnerable to abuse at workplace, which took the form of sexual abuse when the war started. During the war, she was young and alone and seen as sexually available not only by the Pakistani army but also by Bangladeshi men and women who refused to provide her shelter. She was accused of killing a university professor, arrested and taken to a camp where she was raped repeatedly by Pakistani soldiers. Priyobhashini's ordeal came to an end with a friendly encounter with a Pakistani army officer, who after rescuing her proposed a marriage. But Priyobhashini saw that as a betrayal to her nation and declined the proposal. After the war, Priyobhashini was betrayed by her nation and abandoned as she was seen complicit in the crime of rape. Even though the rape survivors were given the title \"Birangana,\" in the local memory, as Yasmin Saikia's research points out, Birangana (meaning female hero) transformed into \"Baranganas\" (meaning prostitutes) soon after the war.\nAlso subject to erasure and selective remembering are the refugees from the 1971 war. The images of refugees on display at the war museum comprise primarily women who became refugees in India but without any markers of identification or any mention of the Bihari refugees who have been living in refugee camps in Bangladesh for over five decades. During the war of 1971, a number of Biharis, loyal to their nation-state, collaborated with the Pakistani army; some created their own militia and participated in mass killing, rape and looting. After the war, for a majority of Bangladeshis, the entire Bihari community came to be perceived as enemy and traitors. Many Biharis were killed and much of their property was seized. Those who survived were forced to seek refuge in camps set up by the International Committee for Red Cross and were labeled as \"Stranded Pakistanis.\" There are approximately 160,000 members of the Bihari/Urdu-speaking community who live in 116 refugee camps across the country.\nI met Saira Bano in the Central Relief Organization (CRO) camp in Dhaka. The living conditions inside the camp are challenging as the camp has a crumbling infrastructure, unclean water, scant garbage pick-up, communal toilets, footpaths that are often broken, staircase that appears to be deteriorating and roofs that are collapsing. For Saira Bano and other Bihari women refugees, the trauma of the 1971 war remains visibly present today. Bano, originally from Calcutta, remembers arriving in Dhaka as a child, but does not remember her exact age, her life before the war and what she saw during the war. The significant gaps in her memory depict her relationship to the violence that was committed during the war, the denial of her suffering which became commonplace in the post-war remembering, and her complex relationship with the society at large. The denial of suffering of the Urdu-speaking Biharis of Bangladesh has resulted in a mourning that is endless. Mourning, according to Dominick LaCapra, brings the possibility of engaging trauma in order for life to begin again. However, LaCapra notes, \"When mourning turns to absence and absence is conflated with loss, then mourning becomes impossible, endless, quasi- transcendental grieving, scarcely distinguishable (if at all) from interminable melancholy.\" Bano suffered personal losses in 1971, but her story is considered insignificant because of her identity as an Urdu-speaking Bihari woman. Without an opportunity to share her haunting story and mourn for her loss, Bano's trauma remains unengaged and she is unable to work through it. The trauma for Bano endlessly continues in her present life.\nThe Liberation War Museum also has on display numerous images of women holding guns, but it downplays the fact that only two out of the 426 officially recognized freedom fighters and recipients of \"Bir Protik\" award were women. During the war of 1971, many women were militarized and wanted to defend their nation in the war efforts, but they were not able to find an entry point into a male-dominated battlefield. They were encouraged to provide support in assisting and nurturing roles, instead of engaging in combat.\nThe gendered nature of women's militarization is evident in the testimony offered by Taramon Bibi, one of the two recipients of the Bir Protik award, who talks about the familial structures that were reproduced in battlefield. After joining the militia, Bibi started calling Muhib Habilder \"father\" and her primary role was to cook for the freedom fighters. The sexual division of labour during the war remained and shifted only temporarily when the group came under attack and the roles went back to \"normal\" after the war ended. Sultana Kamal, a lawyer, human rights activist and the Executive Director of Ain-o-Salish Kendra, also confirms that women were generally pushed out of the battlefield and encouraged to offer support in secondary roles as care providers and nurses. Kamal remembers, \"The leadership in the war also had a particular idea of men's role and women's role. Like we were immediately engaged to build a hospital and run the hospital rather than them thinking that we could be trained in arms to really fight the guerrilla warfare.\" The photographs of women raising their arms and holding rifles, despite being inaccurate, provide for a moving imagery, depicting women as equal participants in the war against a common national enemy. However, the exhibit shows ambivalence towards the gender politics that ensued after the war which led to a national forgetting of women fighters like Taramon Bibi.\nThe archives of the Liberation War Museum of Bangladesh through their inclusion and omission perform the function of narrativizing the war as a unified account of history where all the outliers are muted and a generalization is forced upon women. The nationalist discourse on display at the war museum performs the act of selecting from life and death the stories that are worth telling and subjects women to a double marginalization within the ideologies of nation and nationalism. The images of war memorialized and widely circulated at the museum perform the function of assigning significance to shared experiences, common ideas and nationalist formations in an attempt to create a nationalist history of the war, but gender representations in the exhibits remain problematic. The testimonies of female survivors resist the national memory and help to create an account of the war which is more inclusive.\nDr. Azra Rashid is an Instructor in the Humanities department at John Abbott College, Montreal.

        "full_article": "With the end of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal 24-year reign on December 8, the Syrian people finally have an opportunity to now rebuild their nation. Islamist-led rebel groups swept into Damascus, forcing Assad to flee to Russia, marking a spectacular end of five decades of Ba'ath Party rule in the country. After more than 13 years of civil war, during which Assad's forces ruthlessly suppressed protesters, his government collapsed in the face of a surprising 11-day offensive launched by rebel groups. Only weeks ago, few could have anticipated this dramatic turn in Syria's fate, which now stands at a crossroads as the Middle East grapples with widespread chaos and instability.\nFollowing Assad's ouster, huge crowds were seen cheering in the streets of Damascus. Prisoners held in notorious black sites were reportedly freed by the rebels. Notably, Assad's reign ended after Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)\u2014listed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments and others, including Russia\u2014captured the strategic city of Homs. However, HTS and other rebel groups themselves have dubious human rights records. Given this reality, the UN war crimes investigators have urged those now taking charge in Syria to ensure that the atrocities committed under Assad's rule are not repeated.\nSince the start of the most recent rebel offensive, it is estimated that at least 910 people have been killed, including 138 civilians. The war in Syria has already claimed a conservative estimate of 500,000 lives and displaced nearly half of the country's population. It is, therefore, imperative that, with the fall of the previous regime, the country moves forward and begins to heal. The first step towards stability is ending the violence, with all parties in Syria engaging in dialogue to reach a solution that reflects people's will. Moreover, it is crucial that the transition of power proceeds peacefully and that all ethnic, religious and social groups in the country are protected from persecution.\nDespite Assad's ruthless actions against his own people, internal factors were not the sole drivers of his regime's collapse. Syria became a battleground for geopolitical rivalries, as external powers exploited the crisis to further their own agendas. Already after the regime change, Israel has seized territory in Syria-controlled areas of the Golan Heights, with its prime minister ordering forces to establish a buffer zone in the region. Reports also indicate that Israel has resumed bombing campaigns in Syria, violating international law and further exacerbating uncertainty both within the country and across the region.\nGiven the years of suffering endured by the Syrian people\u2014caused by both internal and external factors\u2014it is imperative that foreign interference in the country comes to an end. While the international community should step forward to provide aid and funding for Syria's reconstruction, foreign powers must cease using the country as a pawn in their geopolitical chessboards. The future of Syria must be determined by its own people. Only then can the nation truly reap the benefits of ousting a brutal dictator.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "If you had the power to end violence against women through one single initiative, what would you say that initiative is? I would say, changing the mindset of the people. It is not an overnight change, rather a continuous effort by raising awareness, ensuring justice for the victims and empowering women so that they can fight back against their perpetrators and put an end to such violence.\nBut the problem is people do not actively think of violence against women if it is not related to them. The same old stories of beating, murder, rape and sexual assault do not appeal the news consumers anymore. But the fact is, gender-based violence (GBV) is still a grim reality in the country just as before, irrespective of the progress we claim to make for democracy and human rights.\nDomestic violence is still one of the main reasons for female deaths in Bangladesh, and is mostly perpetrated by the husband. According to Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), 155 women have been killed by their husbands between January to October 2024. During the same period, 365 women were raped, out of whom 32 died and seven committed suicide.149 women faced sexual harassment. Ain O Salish Kendra refers to reports from news-outlets as source.\nTherefore, this campaign of 16 Days of Activism initiated in 1991 by the Center for Women's Global Leadership, aims to highlight and combat all forms of GBV, emphasising its pervasive impact on individuals, families and societies. It encourages advocacy, public awareness and policy change globally. In Bangladesh, a country with deeply rooted patriarchy, the relevance of this campaign is paramount. The voice of the victims and survivors must be heard.\nNews Media plays a pivotal role in exposing violence, holding the perpetrators accountable and supporting the victim to get justice. They can amplify the voice of the victims. As a part of the news monitoring activity, Media Resources Development Initiative (MRDI) went through the data of media coverage of 16 Days of Activism in the last two years. In 2023, the monitoring team found 18 news content featuring gender issues, not necessarily on GBV, rather on overall gender equality issues in a combined selection of 15 newspapers, television channels and online news portals. The same time frame a year ago, in 2022, the number was 113, showing a significant comparative drop in 2023. The content varied from several formats, editorial, op-ed to event-based news, success and survival stories, and on campaigns run by different organisations.\nNot to generalise but gender issue is not receiving the deserved media exposure and the number of reports is declining. Thus, 16 Days of Activism is a good opportunity to evolve the mindset of the people. And the campaign can provide news media with a chance to be the catalyst for that change. This can be done by bringing the issues into the spotlight, challenging harmful societal norms and mobilising stakeholders toward creating a safer and more equitable society. If we really mean to change the scenario, we need to be vocal about the violence against women and collaborate towards a holistic approach to end the violence. GBV cannot be eliminated without going through the deeper matrix of gender inequality globally through the ages.\nWorking towards development of Bangladesh's news media and capacity building of journalists for two decades, MRDI found that presence of women in the news outlets and contents is still very low. In the television channels there is a significant number of women, but they are mostly news anchor and newsroom editor. Even amongst the reporters, few women are working in political, crime or business beat. The tendency of the media managers is to offer the women reporter the so called 'soft beat'. Women are also few and far in between in the decision-making level.\nConsequently, MRDI took and initiative in reminding the news media to play their role. In partnership with Sweden based Fojo Media Institute, a Charter of Commitment on Gender in news media has been developed. Led by Dr. Gitiara Nasreen, Professor, Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, a ten-member group consisting of journalism teachers, journalist, news media decision-makers, activists, researchers, writers, and legal experts finalised the charter. In the process, interactions with stakeholders from and outside of Dhaka focus group discussions, the perspectives and suggestions of over 100 stakeholders from both Dhaka were conducted through focus group discussions. This Charter can make the news organisations commit to ensure presence, participation, equality and equity of genders in the content and in organisation. If the news outlets commit to implement the charter by signing, we can hope it will have important implications in establishing gender equity in the news media and contribute to developing self-regulation mechanisms in the newsrooms. Even if the number of the signatories is not many, we will take it as a bold step towards achieving gender equality.\nSarwat Tarannum Nadia is the gender focal of a project aiming at improving quality journalism in Bangladesh,\u00a0implemented by MRDI. She has worked as a journalist in print and electronic media for more than a decade.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
