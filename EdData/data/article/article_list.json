It\u2019s expected to be 106% of the long period average of 87 cm. It\u2019s positive for the kharif crop season, which was affected last year by a below normal monsoon that was also erratic in terms of monthly rainfall.\nMonsoon-output link weakens\u00a0| India\u2019s agricultural output is no longer as closely tied to annual rainfall, thanks to widespread irrigation. For example, take a look at water guzzling rice. Data since 2000 shows that it\u2019s only in 2002 and 2009 that output dropped sharply because of a large rainfall deficiency. Leave aside those two shocks, output has generally trended upwards even though below normal monsoon years have sometimes led to a modest decline in production.\n\nGroundwater\u2019s the reason\u00a0| The reason for this resilience is largely the surge in groundwater extraction through tube wells for irrigation. Irrigation through tube wells accounts for over 60% of total irrigation.\nRainfall still matters\u00a0| But even as tube well irrigation may have partially insulated crop output from annual swings in rainfall, the southwest monsoon\u2019s influence over agriculture hasn\u2019t weakened if we look at it from a longer-term perspective. This is because groundwater extraction for irrigation is sustainable only if it\u2019s adequately recharged. And about 75% of annual recharge takes place during the southwest monsoon.\nRecharge\u2019s the challenge\u00a0| At the national level, India appears to be using its groundwater sustainably. Only 59% of the annual extractable groundwater is drawn. However, this national average masks worrisome regional variations.\nPunjab and Haryana are critical to India\u2019s overall food security. In these states, groundwater extraction is way past the point of sustainability. Punjab\u2019s ratio of annual groundwater extraction to total annual extractable groundwater in 2022 was 164.15%. Haryana\u2019s ratio is around 136%. While UP\u2019s ratio is 71%, agriculturally important western UP is hurtling towards unsustainability.\nReminder of unfinished business\u00a0| IMD\u2019s 2024 monsoon forecast is positive for recharge of groundwater. But it\u2019s also a reminder that India\u2019s agriculture is pushing its luck on climate change. Regional variations in rainfall and groundwater extraction matter greatly for crop output. The story so far is that some of the most productive agri regions in terms of yield have insulated themselves from annual rainfall variations but not their dependence on the monsoon.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Collateral casualties of big and joyous festivals have become routine in this country. Network of road communication with the addition of six-lane highways has not only expanded but also improved in most places. This has its reflection on comparably smoother journeys home during the Eid vacation this time. But the advantage has been terribly undermined by tragic road accidents and a bizarre incident at Sadarghat launch terminal. According to reports carried in newspapers, both the number of road accidents and casualties between April 4 and April 14, the time of celebrations of two great festivals, 189 people were killed and 278 left injured. As many as 17 lives lost every day on an average during the 11 days. What is most concerning is the higher incidence of road crashes and casualties this year compared to the same period last year when 161 such accidents claimed 153 lives and left 267 people injured. Although, no launch disaster was reported during this time, the launch terminal mishap accounted for five lives--- three of them from a family. Now the intriguing issue here is the discord between improved roads and rise in accidents. Even improvement in ticketing and somewhat regulated arrival and departure of buses on long routes could not lower the high incidence of road crashes and casualties. What went amiss? The Faridpur accident between a bus and mini-truck, which occurred on Tuesday last, killing 15 people and injuring 15 others provides a classic example of such tragic inevitability due to gross violation of law and a lack of traffic management. This has now become almost routine that after almost all road crashes, the authorities concerned come up with the revelation that either the vehicle was unregistered or had no fitness certificate or the driver had no licence or if he had, it was not renewed and the list goes on. In this case, initial reports indicate that a pothole on the road caused the passenger bus, which also had no route permit, to veer sideways across the road. The mini-track that hit it was carrying passengers in violation of the law and all the dead were its passengers. Yesterday's accident at Gabkhan toll plaza in Jhalakathi with a toll of 14 lives and injury to 25 others gives the impression of inept driving. An ominous prospect of more road tragedies looms. It is common knowledge that during festival times, old and rickety buses are pressed into service after applying a fresh coat of paints on them. Granted that the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the highway police have not adequate manpower to check all such buses but what about the mini-truck that was carrying passengers on the highway? There is no reason why the highway police would fail to notice this. If they and the BRTA turn a blind eye to violation of legal provisions, roads and highways, much as they may be improved, cannot guarantee fewer road crashes. True, not all accidents are preventable. But if the roads and highways are developed and managed better with strict enforcement of legal provisions both at offices and on roads, the man-made accidents can be prevented. Enforcement of laws can see off unfit and dilapidated vehicles. Several times did the authorities promise to send such vehicles to junkyards and then backtracked for political considerations. The problem lies there and unless the authorities demonstrate enough resolve to do away with all the known malaises in the system, roads and highways will continue to witness such fatal accidents.",

        "full_article": "A green RMG factory in Bangladesh \nThe ready-made garment (RMG) industry of Bangladesh has made considerable strides in increasing the number of green garment factories. So far with 213 factories certified by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) category, Bangladesh can boast of being home to the highest number of green factories in the world. Moreover, five hundred more garment factories are also in the pipeline of receiving the LEED certification, which is a manifestation of the fact that an increasing number of apparel manufacturers are embracing environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient practices in their manufacturing process. Now the bustling and vibrant industry, with an annual export turnover of nearly $ 47 billion that is about 84 per cent of the country's total export earnings, is well positioned to take its sustainability practices up a notch by embracing circular transformation of the industry.The RMG industry has so far been following a linear business model of \"make, use and throw away\" or \"take, make and dispose\". But the world is slowly but steadily transitioning from linear to circular production model. It is, however, heartening to see that stakeholders of the RMG industry started dabbling in circular economy model. In simple terms, the circular economy calls for eliminating maximum waste in the market by adopting a regenerative manufacturing system that treats waste as a source of new materials and new revenue. In this way, the requirement for virgin material can be reduced to a bare minimum or would not be needed at all. In a circular system, products are designed and manufactured with such materials that they can be used, reused, repaired and recycled, thereby reducing waste and extending the lifecycle of materials incalculably. In this way, circular production method strives to ensure the majority of products or product materials do not end up as waste. It also embraces responsible sourcing of materials, reducing water and energy consumption and minimising waste at each and every stage. Take the example of global sportswear giant Nike's formula of a circular economy for its products. It designs products in a way that they can be used, re-used, recycled, and composted at the end of their life. Nike says it is working to reduce its use of virgin materials and to increase its use of recycled materials.The practice of circular economy is gaining ground worldwide because linear production system is not only negatively impacting the environment, but also leading to rapid depletion of finite natural resources. The European Union says by 2030 all textile products placed on the EU market must be made of recycled fibers, free of hazardous substances, and produced in respect of social and environmental rights.Bangladesh is also experiencing environmental degradation of extreme measures. Textile and dyeing factories are one of the main culprits for polluting the rivers and canals and creating havoc to the environment. Putting all of these issues together, embracing a circular economy is not just a choice, but a necessity for the RMG industry. If the circular economy model can be implemented in a substantive and meaningful way, it would be enormously beneficial for both the environment and business. It would also reduce the industry's pressure on natural sources. For all these reasons circular fashion can be a major thrust towards sustainable growth of the apparel industry. However, when it comes to embracing circular business models, there is no 'one size fits all' solution. The procedure varies depending on the industry's context. As the second largest garment supplier in the world, Bangladesh's RMG industry has to deal with a huge volume of pre-consumer waste, not post-consumer waste. According to BGMEA, the apparel industry annually produces about 400,000 tonnes of pre-consumer textile waste. This waste is currently collected in an informal way, and only 5 per cent of it is recycled locally. The remaining waste is either incinerated in furnaces or dumped in landfills, which has a negative impact on the environment and human health.To break free from the linear model of production, the RMG industry should prioritise upstream circularity, which refers to reducing waste at the source, during the design, production, and cutting processes. Technology can play a vital role here as innovations such as 3D printing and digital platforms for garment customization enhance efficiency and sustainability. These technologies enable a closer connection between manufacturers and buyers, fostering a sense of mutual responsibility for reducing pre-consumer waste to a bare minimum. Upstream circularity will help reduce waste, but it will not eliminate waste. So the next stage should be to follow the principle of 'recycle and recover' through which textile waste (jhoot) can be turned into the fiber; and the fiber into fabric, and RMG products made from that recycled fabric. Recycling textile waste into new fabrics or products, also reduces the need for virgin resources. In this way not only is the pre-consumer textile waste eliminated, but also, according to an estimate, the industry can save as much as US$500 million a year.To this end, a platform named Reverse Resources has been collaborating with manufacturers across Bangladesh as part of the Circular Fashion Partnership project since 2020. So far it has teamed up with about 170 manufacturers to segregate their waste and digitally trace it to recycling solutions. Clearly, this is the sort of solution BGMEA should bring into the mainstream if it wants to fulfil its Sustainability Vision 2030 where embracing circular economy is one of the key targets.To build a circular ecosystem in the RMG industry, there is also a need for greater collaboration between all stakeholders, including brands, manufacturers, policymakers and waste management companies. Overall, there is a need for the development of a national circularity strategy, as well as fiscal incentives and other forms of support for factories that are investing in upstream circularity measures. The role of innovation is also of paramount importance for developing new circularity solutions for the textile industry. This includes developing new sustainable materials, designing for recyclability, and improving manufacturing efficiency. Factories that are willing to innovate and re-invent themselves by embracing this new business model will gain a competitive advantage over their peers because circularity matters for a sustainable future.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "\nIn the early hours of Saturday, when people in the subcontinent, were preparing to embrace the new Bengali Year, more than 300 missiles and drones simultaneously cruised through the airspace of Iraq and Jordan. By that time the entire world came to know that they were ejected from Iran and the target was Israel.And at the same time top military analysts were analysing the probable impact of the attack in the talk-shows in the world's top TV channels, with almost all of them predicting that Iran's 'retaliation' would not be that much damaging as Israel has one of the strongest air-defence capabilities in the world.Their predictions came true. Out of 300 drones and missiles, only nine could hit the target, the rest were intercepted and destroyed in the sky by Israeli military, and its allies mainly the USA and the UK.International affairs' experts were found divided in their opinions regarding the outcome of the Iran's retaliatory mission as many felt that it would strengthen the hardliner Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, Netanyahu has been facing protests in his own country since last year and his popularity was heavily dipping. Then, came the Hamas attack in October last, which changed his luck as the people of Israel pledged their support to their prime minister in his mission to eliminate the Hamas.But when despite carrying out unprecedented brutality against unarmed civilians in Gaza, Netanyahu and his trigger-happy Generals neither succeeded in rescuing the Israeli hostages nor could eliminate the Hamas, the popular sentiment at home started to turn against him again.Even the western allies of Israel started to say 'enough is enough' when they did observe the inhuman attack against the Palestinian children and women in Gaza.Then on April 1, killing of seven volunteers of an international aid agency by Israeli attack in Gaza made the world stunned and shocked. Apparently losing patience, the US and the UK, who have been backing Israel unconditionally, started to grill Netanyahu publicly.The New York Times went one step ahead by calling for an embargo on supplying arms to Israel in its editorial.On the same day, Israel attacked Iran consulate in Damascus killing seven top officers, including two Generals of Iranian army.Many felt that it was a calculated move by Netanyahu, to rope in Iran in the scene so that the attention was diverted from the incident of killing of the aid workers in Gaza.And a section of foreign affairs' experts believe that by retaliating though the drone and missile attack Iran fell in the trap of Netanyahu, who is regarded as a maestro in the art of surviving in power.However, another section of analysts felt that Netanyahu's trick to prolong the escalation with Iran may prove to be a boomerang for him as by attacking inside Israel for the first time Iran managed to present a spectacular display of its military capability.The western allies of Israel have been urging Mr Netanyahu in the last couple of days not to respond to Iranian attack warning that they would not back any Israeli effort in that direction.But is it possible for a man to refrain from doing so whose very survival as Prime Minister depends on war and escalation?It is widely believed that as long as Netanyahu wants to remain in power he has no option but to prolong the conflict.Here lies the problem of ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East.Netanyahu hates the idea of co-existence and is always in favour of expansion of Jewish settlement in Gaza by forcibly evicting the Palestinian people from their homeland and thus enlarge his vote bank.So taming leaders like Mr Netanyahu should be the utmost task of the world powers to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
