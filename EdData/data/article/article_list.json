        "full_article": "The US government has passed well-documented \"anti-dumping laws\" aimed at providing a level playing field and protection for the local industries. These laws have been enforced with regards to the textile industry several times in recent years, when polyester producers from outside the US \"dumped\" their product on the US market at prices that were substantially below the market rate.\nThe US authorities take a hard-line stance on dumping and have issued anti-dumping tariffs as high as 50 percent to some external businesses selling polyester in the US market.\nI am beginning to wonder whether we need our own internal anti-dumping laws in Bangladesh when it comes to cotton apparel.\nConfused? Well, allow me to explain.\nAs a ready-made garment manufacturing hub, we have been trapped in a spiral of declining unit prices for years. There are many theories as to why it is so. People often make the link between the end price of clothing and the prices paid to apparel makers. It is also argued that too many suppliers are chasing too many buyers in Bangladesh, and that these supply-demand dynamics force the prices downwards\u2014with buyers taking advantage of the market situation.\nI believe there is some truth in both these theories. However, perhaps it is time to start looking inwards as garment manufacturers if we wish to resolve this issue for the benefit of all. At present, we are seeing relatively healthy orders in Bangladesh's RMG sector as the market bounces back, thanks to the reopening of economies in Europe and the US.\nIn theory, this should mean that prices would hold relatively firm. But this is not the case now and, indeed, it has not been the case on previous occasions, when demand has been robust. Instead, we continue to see a tendency of some manufacturers to offer products at way below the prevailing market rates. In effect, such manufacturers are \"dumping\" products on the domestic market in the same way that polyester exporters to the US were dumping their product in the situation I highlighted earlier.\nIs dumping too strong a word? Perhaps it is, but there is no doubt that some manufacturers are selling at or below the cost in some circumstances. This is madness. It creates problems for us all, and risks dragging us down into a perpetual race to the bottom.\nAre other garment production hubs like this? The picture is varied; however, as an example of where garment makers have a stronger reputation for offering \"take it or leave it\" prices, one needs to look no further than China. Chinese factories appear better equipped when it comes to negotiation, and hold their ground where pricing is concerned. There seems to be more collaboration and a collective understanding that it is not in the interests of any manufacturer to have a glut of under-priced products flooding the domestic market.\nI hear anecdotes from our own industry about manufacturers taking orders at prices below the cost\u2014even at a time when the market is strong. This suggests to me that this problem will always be with us unless it is tackled head-on.\nThe issue with accepting such low prices is that it is not sustainable. The people who suffer are, of course, the garment workers. It is also unrealistic to think that one can run a sustainable operation in a market where prices are continuously being dragged down by factories, which are happy to offload garment products for next to nothing.\nI believe our industry needs to take action\u2014and by that I mean the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), and perhaps the Ministry of Commerce as well. Shipping and customs declaration records would provide a means by which to gain an insight into what is being shipped and for what prices.\nSurely as an industry we have to consider some kind of minimum pricing, with warnings for factories that do not comply and potentially the removal of export licences for repeated offenders.\nIf this sounds draconian, consider again the anti-dumping laws cited earlier. Minimum prices are simply a way of protecting our industry as well as raising standards across the board. Better prices will also enable factory owners to take a more long-term view of sustainability issues, which all buyers are demanding right now. This, in turn, could lead to more orders for all of us.\nIt would be for the BGMEA and other industry leaders to decide whether such an initiative would merit being implemented and what form it might take.\nFor my own part, I would add a few final thoughts. The first is that we cannot, as an industry, continue to blame buyers for requesting lower prices or consumers for demanding cheaper fashion. We have been complaining about such issues for far too long when, in reality, we have to ask if there is anything we can do to make our industry more stable, professional, and sustainable.\nThe second is that perhaps it is time to think more collaboratively and look at the bigger picture as an industry. Obviously, there will always be intense local competition, and this is one of the factors that makes us such a popular choice for buyers and ensures that the quality standards remain high. But the \"race to the bottom\" prices help none of us and only serve to tarnish us all with the \"cheap and cheerful\" brush, ruining our industry's image. We are better than that.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited. He is also the founder and CEO of Bangladesh Denim Expo and Bangladesh Apparel Exchange (BAE).\n",

        "full_article": "\"To be more sustainable and effective, the United Nations needs to revisit priorities and respond to the needs and challenges of time.\"\n\u2014Trygve Lie, the first secretary-general of the United Nations (1949)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is set to open tomorrow. The secretary-general has already outlined a well-articulated and focused 10-point agenda for discussion that covers several broad challenges the world needs to overcome\u2014ranging from poverty to climate change and adaptation, as well as SDG implementation. However, right now, the core thrust should be on enabling member countries to overcome the severely adverse impacts of Covid-19. At the same time, the international community needs to undertake broader collaboration in addressing the key issues and concerns that impede economic and social development, the disproportionate trend in resource mobilisation and utilisation, as well as critical challenges in building up a robust health infrastructure.\nIn addition to the well-articulated priorities, the forthcoming UN session is expected to take into account the optimum means for recovery, making up for the deficits in trade and services sectors, and providing support to revive growth levels. Keeping this in view, some of the critical areas that warrant the UN's focused intervention in the medium term are highlighted below:\nGlobal and regional thrust on food security \nDue to the prolonged pandemic and the severe disruptions in global production and supply chains, there is a need for special emphasis on strengthening food security. The UNGA may ask Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) to coordinate with the countries in taking concrete measures to ensure consistent and stable food supply and security, based on the key strategic pillars envisioned by these institutions. A global commission on ensuring food security and prevention of hunger, under the umbrella of WFP, would be relevant at this stage.\nAnti-poverty focus through reinforcing stimulus incentives \nRespective country policies have prioritised specific interventions to reduce poverty and inequalities. It would be pertinent for the UN to coordinate with multilateral agencies to gear up support for country systems and programmes to ensure effective implementation of the stimulus incentives, and promote safety nets and social protection instruments of the governments. This should be aimed at maximising the welfare impact.\nEnhancing concessional assistance\nBased on the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, development partners are required to strengthen the overall alignment of country strategies and programmes to respective national development strategies and programmes. The subsequent Aid Effectiveness discourse in 2009 and 2011 added further impetus through better tracking, monitoring and evaluation tools. To combat the Covid impact, the UN may ask multilateral financing institutions to have in place a window for extremely concessional assistance, outside the ambit of country partnership strategy/country assistance allocations. This would enable budgetary support, meet current deficits and compensate for the jobs and incomes due to Covid.\nCreating platform for private sector and NGO collaboration\nCovid-19 has resulted in severe challenges for the key sectors of growth, and the overall pace of recovery has slackened critically. The UNGA may facilitate a platform for a coordinated and integrated role to be played by the private sector, NGOs and CSOs to supplement and strengthen programmes undertaken by the governments, especially for stimulating the recovery and compensatory programmes in the services and social sectors.\nStrengthening regional incentives\nThe UN may consider an integrated programme of action that would propel Regional Cooperation and Integration (RCI) frameworks to streamline, strengthen and align core programmes on minimising the Covid-19 fallout, aimed at a further substantive and long-term impact and effectiveness. In this context, a key element would be to enable member countries to work on integrated mechanisms for monitoring and surveillance of health and service sectors. There is evidence that regional approaches enhance abilities to cushion external shocks.\nForced migration\nIn the past decade, forced displacement has worsened the migration and refugee crisis in several areas of the world. Pushing out citizens forcibly to neighbouring countries is one of the most critical humanitarian challenges in recent times. Displacement creates pressure on limited resources, erodes gains achieved through effective policy interventions, and slackens service delivery. The current UN conventions may be restructured to enforce provisions for violations in this regard.\nRestructuring SDG focus to counter Covid impact\nAccomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will continue to reflect the trend of social and economic progress. Overall, the response in SDG implementation has been satisfactory. The UN may consider upgrading institutional and functional frameworks to review and assess challenges caused by Covid, and take concrete measures for effective SDG implementation. Support to country capacities and systems could ensure sustainable and effective outcomes in this regard. The renewed commitment and focus on the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is expected to ensure sustainable outcomes.\nBusiness continuity plans\nThe UN needs to emphasise supporting countries and institutions on undertaking business continuity plans (BCP) for strengthened leverage to continue programmes, despite disruptions. Performance-based and results-based components can render BCPs to economise resources and facilitate smooth transition to overcome unforeseen contingencies.\nFinally, the success of the UN interventions depends on having in place resilient institutions, effective development partnership, and improved governance mechanisms. Flexibility in the modus operandi of bilateral and multilateral collaboration, restoring broadened market access and overall competitiveness, and robust RCI programmes could lead to better outcomes. The UN and overall multilateralism need a significant paradigm shift both in operational and structural terms, to overcome the current challenges and support countries to move ahead towards the perspectives of higher levels of inclusive growth.\n\u00a0\nDr Mohammed Parvez Imdad is an economist, governance specialist and policy analyst. \nEmail: mpinayefmimdad@gmail.com\n",

        "full_article": "Technically, on Saturday, the US War on Terror came to an end.\nAccording to the Brown University \"Cost of War\" study, since 9/11, the US will have spent USD 4.7 trillion waging war by the end of 2022, excluding the interest on debt used to finance the wars (USD 1.1 trillion) and war veteran care costs (USD 2.2 trillion). The human cost was 929,000 people killed and 38 million displaced. Look how the US Treasury debt ballooned from USD 5.8 trillion\u2014or 54.9 percent of GDP\u2014in September 2001 to USD 28.4 trillion\u2014135.7 percent of GDP\u2014by August 2021.\nSuch financial and human costs of the War on Terror may be trivial compared to the coming climate change costs on the whole planet. War costs only add to climate warming. The Brown University study showed that \"the US Department of Defence is the largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels in the world and a key contributor to climate change. Between 2001 and 2017, the years for which data is available since the beginning of the war on terrorism with the US invasion of Afghanistan, the US military emitted 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases.\"\nToday, the IPCC 2021 Sixth Assessment has warned that the planet is running out of time to deal with climate change. This is an existential crisis not just for one country, but the whole of mankind. Like the pandemic, we need a \"whole of government\" and \"whole of society\" approach to act decisively in the war on climate change.\nThe European Union has got its act together with a Circular Economy Plan. It sees the problem clearly: \"There is only one Planet Earth, yet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three. Global consumption of materials such as biomass, fossil fuels, metals and minerals is expected to double in the next 40 years, while annual waste generation is projected to increase by 70 percent by 2050.\"\nThe world spent USD 2 trillion on military expenditure in 2020\u2014four times the amount spent on energy transformation. The first can only add to global carbon emission and more human and natural destruction; the other addresses our common fate.\nSo why should business take the lead in this war on climate change?\nThe simple answer is that the business community makes almost all the products that the world consumes, including weapons of war. Just 100 of these private and state-owned companies were responsible for 71 percent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that caused global warming since 1998, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Up to 80 percent of the products' environmental impacts are determined at the design phase, so the business sector can re-tool these green products fast. That is the profit opportunity.\nAnother reason is that governments or politics simply do not have their act together. Harvard strategy guru Michael Porter, in his 2020 book \"The Politics Industry,\" put it this way: \"Most people believe that our political system is a public institution with high-minded principles and impartial rules derived from the constitution. In reality, it has become a private industry dominated by a textbook duo\u2026 incapable of delivering solutions to America's key economic and social challenges.\" Put climate change in that basket of problems.\nMichael Porter recognised that there are no scientific or business model barriers to finding solutions to tackle climate warming. Guess what? There is also no shortage of money with central banks providing all the money to tackle the pandemic and financial crises. We have an existential crisis where the rich are getting richer, whereas the people at the bottom half of society are paying for the climate change disasters through loss of habitat, jobs and lives.\nThis is neither sustainable for politicians nor for businesses.\nIn 2012, billionaire businessman Richard Branson claimed: \"Our only option to stop climate change is for industry to make money from it.\" After the pandemic and this year's hurricanes, forest fires and floods, businesses around the world are waking up to the fact that there is no alternative to embracing climate change in their business models. The \"business as usual\" of denial has shifted quickly to adaptation and mitigation.\nOne reason for the change of mind is that the finance industry has realised that climate change imposes huge financial risks. They created the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure (TCFD) to pressure the industry to act on climate change through financial disclosure. In its first report, the TCFD reported that USD 640 billion costs were incurred from climate-related natural disasters and that up to USD 43 trillion financial assets would be at risk by 2100.\nIf politics is toxic, the only group of people who can lead action on climate change is the corporate sector. Of course, corporate captains are not themselves the owners of these corporations, since many are owned by institutional funds. The top 500 asset managers control over USD 104 trillion of assets, with the top 20 controlling 43 percent. So, convincing a small number of key corporate owners to act will make a serious difference on climate action.\nOne example suggests that serious climate action by the global rich is not just possible, but feasible.\nThanks to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his profit-driven business allies, the Amazon Forest is disappearing rapidly. The Amazon forests and biodiversity-rich soils store the equivalent of four or five years' worth of human-made carbon emissions, up to 200 gigatonnes of carbon. At USD 50 per tonne for carbon, the real Amazon is worth USD 10 trillion to everyone in the world. By comparison, Amazon.com's market cap is now USD 1.8 trillion. The top one percent of the world's rich people owned USD 173.3 trillion in 2019\u2014almost double the world GDP.\nCan some friendly billionaires club together to buy the real Amazon from Brazil, whose total external debt is currently USD 548 billion?\nThis may sound like a joke, but climate warming is a deadly serious business. If business is not serious about the climate war, then start scrambling to get on the next space flight organised by Richard Branson or Jeff Bezos.\n\u00a0\nAndrew Sheng from Malaysia is adjunct professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing and University of Malaya.

        "full_article": "Examinees of PECE, SSC and HSC will attend in-person classes every day while the rest of the students will go to school once a week after schools and colleges reopen on September 12, Education Minister Dipu Moni announced on September 5. The SSC and HSC exams are planned to be held in November and December, respectively.\nState Minister of Primary and Mass Education Zakir Hossain said the next day that plans are underway to hold the primary completion exam (PECE) at the end of November and early December with a shortened syllabus on all six subjects.\nSchools remained closed for the better part of two school years and students were deprived of their normal school life. Children and their families are still subject to the trauma of the pandemic and the disruption of life and livelihood. Emotional stress and the mental health effects of the pandemic on children have been severe, according to surveys and expert opinion. In light of that, how justified is the single minded-focus of the education authorities on holding the exams?\nEver since the PECE (at the end of grade five) and JSC (at the end of grade eight) national examinations were introduced in 2009 and 2010, education experts have been questioning the need and value of adding these high stake examinations to the existing SSC and HSC examinations (at the end of grades 10 and 12).. With the hindsight of a decade, it has become obvious that the two additional exams for the young children have not helped to improve pedagogy in schools or the learning outcome for children. Instead, the exams have diverted the attention and energy of teachers, parents and students to preparing and securing high scores at any cost in the public exams. As documented by Education Watch study (2014), these have created a new industry of coaching centres, guidebooks, mock tests, second guessing of probable exam questions, memorising answers, and even criminal activities related to question paper leaks and cheating in exams.\nThe simple logic seems to have been forgotten that it is teaching and learning in the classroom, not testing and exams, that help students and improve quality of education. There is an important role for assessing student's learning in good pedagogy. A teacher has to ensure that students are learning every day and making progress during the school year. This is known as formative assessment in contrast to summative assessment, such as the public exams and the annual exams in schools. Regrettably, in our schools, formative assessment as a tool for pedagogy is neglected, while formal exams, especially the national ones, are given all the attention.\nThe culture and habit of inordinate attention on public exams have affected the assessment undertaken within the school in the way their frequent periodic exams dominate the school routine. A distraught parent of a well-known private primary and secondary school that run Bangla and English medium sections sent me a half-yearly exam paper for class three maths received by his 8-year-old daughter to be returned online. The girl is expected to complete the exam in two and half hours. The closely printed four-page question paper included 46 questions in four parts plus 18 alternative questions and a geometry part of six questions.\nIt was surprising to see the level of reading comprehension required of the class three student (after more than a year of missed schooling) to answer the math questions, memorisation of definitions of mathematical terms required, and solving mathematical problems, which would be a challenge for a student at levels two or three grades higher. The girl spent a whole day trying to understand and answer the first 28 questions and in desperation turned to her father for help. One wonders what purpose is served by this kind of testing, except perhaps to justify to parents the high fees they charge; and adding to the mental stress of the child.\nA conundrum seems to have escaped the attention of the decision-makers as the school restarts. It is difficult to decide at what grade level children are ready to restart. Should it be where they were last year when school closed, or one grade higher now where they would normally be without Covid-19. It is almost the last quarter of the current school year and by the time the trial and error of the phased reopening is carried out, the year will be over. Come January 2022, should the students then be in the next higher grade\u2014skipping two grades without much teaching undertaken in school? Whatever the education authorities' narrative about online and distant teaching and weekly \"assignments\" may be, most observers agree that the large majority of students, who live in rural areas and belong to low income families, were practically out of touch with learning activities for most of two academic years.\nThe official thinking seems to be that\u2014regardless of total school shutdown for almost two academic years\u2014students who were in grade three in March 2020, should be considered in grade four in 2021 and would be in grade five in January 2022. But with no schooling for most of two years, are the students prepared for the lessons in their new grade level? How will the teachers adjust and adapt their lessons for the students' level of readiness? How will the students cope with the new grade level content without the pre-requisites learned earlier? Will the accumulated deficits handicap a generation in their future learning, except perhaps the few fortunate ones who are highly gifted or whose families can afford expensive private tutoring? Should there be a rapid assessment of students' core skill level when school restarts to decide where they should be placed?\nAn alternative approach is, of course, a set pattern of examinations and testing, for which students are drilled to memorise the answers in school and in coaching centres and they pass their exams. Acquiring the knowledge and competencies from studying the subjects is not necessary to pass these exams. Is this desirable, though this seems to be the accepted practice in our schools?\nThe decision-makers have forgotten or are not willing to admit that when schools ran normally before the pandemic, the majority of students did not acquire the basic competencies in Bangla and maths, i.e., literacy and numeracy, expected at the grade level by the national curriculum. This outcome unfortunately has been revealed by national student assessment (NSA) at the primary level and learning assessment at secondary institutions (LASI). It is highly likely that the situation has further aggravated, especially for the disadvantaged children from low income families.\nThe Directorate of Secondary Education claims that late last year, 94 percent of the students collected assignments from schools and returned them. It is not known whether the students' work were marked properly by teachers, how well students performed or how credible was the reported data from schools. But on the basis of this information, it was claimed that students were very much engaged in learning. The officials seem to live in a make-believe world of their own!\nThe key messages, emphasised by me in an earlier op-ed (\"To open or not to open schools,\" ...The Daily Star, May 31, 2021) remain valid. First, going for reopening in stages observing health and safety protocol is the right decision, but more effort is needed for coordinated planning by health and education authorities, especially at the local level. Secondly, a learning loss recovery plan has to be formulated and implemented with at least a three year time-line including extension of the current academic year by six months to June 2022, and opportunistically, changing school calendar permanently to September-June.\nThere are also pedagogy, curricular arrangements, teacher support and learning assessment elements which need attention. Curriculum shortening and public exams have to be based on epistemological reasoning focusing on \"core competencies\", rather than sticking to the whole gamut of subjects in the syllabus. The latter path seems to be favoured by the officials. PECE and JSC examinations this year should be abandoned and a sound alternative should be considered for the future. Abridged SSC and HSC exams should be held on core subjects early next year, instead of rushing to exams within this calendar year.\u00a0\nThirdly, effective management and implementation of the recovery plan is critical with upazila-based and institution-based planning, work teams formed involving non-government stakeholders and adequate financing. The financial support should include institutions, teachers and students currently outside of government support. Finally, the short-term actions have to be placed within a medium term and longer term framework.\nThe pandemic is not over yet. Physical and mental well-being of children and helping them return to a meaningful learning process should be the priority. Students falling behind by a year, if necessary, will not be the end of the world, if a proper learning recovery plan is implemented effectively.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDr Manzoor Ahmed is professor emeritus at Brac University.\n",

        "full_article": "It is surprising to know how the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) circumvented due process to bring in new licensing regulations in 2016 allegedly to favour businesses in the energy sector. This is a highly unusual practice, not to mention illegal\u2014one that the regulator kept under wraps until the Ministry of Law intervened in 2018. According to a report by The Daily Star, prior to bringing in the 2016 amendment\u2014replacing the previous licencing regulations of 2006\u2014BERC had failed to seek the law ministry's permission, forgone the mandatory public hearing, and also published a gazette on said amendment without the ministry's vetting, leading the latter to term the whole exercise illegal. As a result, the fate of over 3,500 licences issued or renewed since 2016 has become uncertain.\nBERC has now started to rectify its mistakes by publishing the draft copy of a new regulation. We hope due process will be followed this time. But even if we ignore the fact that it took the regulator over two years to act on the ministry's objections, we must ask: Why did BERC amend its regulations illegally in the first place? What emboldened it to think it could get away with such activities? And what could it have possibly achieved from this? Clearly, it wasn't out of the kindness of their heart that the commission brought in relaxed provisions favouring those in the energy business.\nFor example, the 2016 amendment dropped three sub-sections under Section 3 of the 2006 regulations\u2014the first two required licensees to submit details of ownership and assets, while the third required that companies seeking licences provide an estimated production size and the amount of fuel needed for the purpose. It also added a completely new section saying prices of fuel (gas, oil, coal, LNG, etc) would be determined by the \"government or according to the fuel distribution agreement between manufacturer and supplier,\" although according to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act, 2003, the commission is supposed to determine the price of power generation in consultation with the government. Also, all types of licence fees were changed, while the licence period was extended from one year to three years.\nSo, we must ask again: What did BERC authorities gain from relaxing or reworking these provisions? There is a hint of corruption that must be investigated. These provisions are not legally tenable anymore\u2014nor are the licences provided under them. Of more than 3,500 licences issued or renewed since 2016, 1,058 were in power sector, 932 in gas sector and 1,600 in petroleum sector. Legal experts are of the opinion that these companies shouldn't have to suffer for how things have turned out, but the illegal status of said regulations means every licence issued under it must be renewed. Whatever course of action is taken, BERC must go through a process of legal scrutiny and accountability for what it did in 2016.\n",

With better planned roads, stricter compliance regarding fitness of the vehicles, better training for our bus drivers, and stronger awareness among our public, these deaths could be easily prevented. According to a police report, a total of 3,095 citizens of Bangladesh were killed in 3,259 road accidents in the first seven months of this year. Just to put these figures into perspective, it is more than the total number of people killed in the Twin Towers attack and far more than the total number of US soldiers killed in the 20-year war in Afghanistan.\nThe above figures for seven months make for the average monthly deaths of\u00a0442 and daily deaths of four. The question is\u2014what, if anything, have the authorities done to prevent these tragedies on our roads from occurring? Most probably nothing. Inaction is perhaps a bigger tragedy than the deaths, as it indicates that such a huge loss of lives of our citizens does not lead to any official action.\nOne would have expected that lockdowns and closures of intercity bus services would have led to a big dip in road accidents. But the opposite happened as it led to a greater number of battery-run rickshaws, vans and other unlicensed and unroadworthy vehicles filling the void created by the ban on regular transportation.\nWhatever the specific reasons may be for the high death figure this time around, the truth is that our roads are among the most unsafe in the world, and the number of road accidents recorded appears at the top of any global list.\nStarting from the lack of careful planning\u2014like scientifically calculated space and place in designing turns, curves\u00a0and width\u2014while constructing our roads, to monitoring the compliance of buses and trucks with road safety rules, to training of the drivers, etc, the whole chain of actors that cause the accidents must be seriously looked into and reformed as per the need of a modern road system. The fitness of vehicles that ply on our roads remains a serious but unaddressed issue. Corruption in the system allows the unfit vehicles to ply on the roads, causing serious accidents.\nWe urge the home minister-led special task force to take their own work seriously and implement the decisions that they make. While we agree with the BRTA chair that reckless driving by small vehicles is a big problem, it is, by no means, the only one. There are several other regulatory and monitoring problems that need to be addressed immediately. Our economic advancement must be accompanied by other features, indicating an all-round progress.
