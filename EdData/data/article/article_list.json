Faced with sharp questions that it could not answer satisfactorily, the Union government has obtained time to reconsider the criteria, especially the income norm that only those from a family with annual income less than \u20b98 lakh can avail of the 10% reservation earmarked for the EWS category. It is now a settled principle that quantifiable data or proof of a detailed study are required to justify any category of reservation, as well as the norms that determine which section gets it and which does not. In this backdrop, it is logical that the Court would want to know whether there was any study before the Centre prescribed the norms for identifying EWS beneficiaries based on indicators of economic disadvantage. The enquiry by the three-judge Bench is necessarily circumscribed by the fact that the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment, through which the EWS quota was introduced in 2019, is before a Constitution Bench. In the ongoing proceedings, the Bench is considering the validity of the 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10% for Economically Weaker Sections introduced for admission to the All-India Quota (AIQ) of seats in medical admissions throughout the country. It has clarified that it is not examining any policy issue, but wants to determine if constitutional requirements have been complied with.The income criterion is undoubtedly an anomalous aspect of the EWS quota. An annual income of \u20b98 lakh is the limit beyond which an OBC family would fall under the \u2018creamy layer\u2019 and will be denied reservation. The same income figure is being used as the ceiling for identifying EWS. The moot question is whether those who do not face the impediments that come with social and educational backwardness can be equated with those who do. However, the current proceeding will only decide the validity of OBC and EWS reservation in admissions under the AIQ. It must be noted that the introduction of OBC quota in AIQ only brings the admission norms in line with prevailing policy. OBC reservation is applicable to admissions done separately by the Union and State governments in their respective medical institutions, but it was not implemented all these years for all-India quota seats. This pool is formed by the surrender of 15% of undergraduate seats and 50% of PG seats by the States. The absence of OBC quota in this category was an anomaly that has now been rectified. The larger issue that remains is whether reservation can be treated as a poverty alleviation measure and those not well-off but belonging to socially advanced communities can be given a share of the reservation pie. The Constitution Bench should resolve this question early.",

        "full_article": "When 197 countries sit together to achieve something, it is almost certain that there will not be full agreement on the issues tabled for negotiation. Hence, it is no surprise that the outcome of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a compromise, and not enough for accomplishing the mission of reducing the challenges of climate change. Leaders of countries held tough negotiations for two weeks in Glasgow during October 31 to November 12, 2021, at the end of which, the outcome document, the Glasgow Climate Pact, was prepared. The Pact sets various targets and obligations to be met by member countries.\nOne of these was an agreement on accelerating action towards cutting global emissions in half in order to reach the temperature rise goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement on climate change had already set this target in 2015, but the Glasgow Climate Pact calls on countries for stronger national action plans and commiting to ambitious climate actions. In an attempt to cut their emissions by 2020, 151 countries submitted new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that spell out their climate plans. This is also the first time a COP decision text clearly mentioned \"accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies\".\u202fBesides, the Glasgow Pact calls on countries to consider actions to curb potent non-CO2 gases as welll, such as methane.\nHowever, according to UN estimates on emission gaps, the world will see a 2.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century despite these commitments, which is very dangerous. Stronger commitments are required from all countries. At COP26, countries were urged to strengthen their emissions reduction targets by 2030, particularly Australia, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Russia, which have so far made weaker commitments.\u00a0\u00a0\nA positive in the latest COP is the attention towards a global goal on and finance for adaptation. At COP26, the comprehensive two-year Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation (GGA) was launched. The objectives are to strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts. From 2022 to 2024, there will be workshops to assess this progress. Countries will have to work on devising methodologies for assessing progress on adaptation goals.\nThe Glasgow Climate Pact refers to the inadequate mobilisation of climate funds by rich countries. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising USD 100 billion a year by 2020 and through 2025 for vulnerable, climate-affected countries. However, only USD 78.9 billion has been mobilised as of 2019, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Moreover, mitigation funds comprise about 64 percent of total climate funding. At COP26, developed countries committed to at least double their funding for adaptation by 2025, which is an important step forward.\nAnother significant outcome of COP26 has been the call for doubling adaptation finance so that developing countries are able to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Of course, the need for adaptation funds is large and this commitment is still not enough to meet global needs, but it is a positive move nonetheless. Higher adaptation funding is required for protecting lives and livelihoods of climate-vulnerable, small island countries and least developed countries (LDCs). For example, early warning systems for natural disasters, such as floods and cyclones, would help save people's lives. Food security of poor communities could be protected through water-tolerant agriculture. A total of USD 356 million new pledges has been made for the Adaptation Fund. The Paris Agreement urged for a balance between different types of climate finance, which has been historically biased towards mitigation activities and is mostly needed in the polluting developed countries. New contribution pledges also came for LDCs under the Least Developed Countries Fund. USD 413 million new contributions were made for increasing resilience of LDCs to climate change.\nThere are some unavoidable climate impacts that cannot be addressed by adaptation, and those are the permanent losses of lives, land and livelihoods. Climate vulnerable countries have been asking for compensation for such impacts, which is known as \"loss and damage\". Prior to COP26, several climate vulnerable countries have demanded the creation of a new financing facility exclusively for loss and damage. However, the idea has been resisted by many developed countries. The Glasgow Pact calls for action and support, such as finance, technology transfer and capacity building, \"for implementing approaches for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage\".\nFor the first time, financial commitments for loss and damage have been made. Scotland and the Wallonia region in Belgium made commitments for USD 2.6 million and USD 1.1 million, respectively. A number of philanthropies such as the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, the European Climate Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, and the Global Green Grants Fund committed USD 3 million initially to complement and advance the objectives of the Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility. In the previous COP held in Madrid, the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage was established. At COP26, countries finally agreed to operationalise and fund the Santiago Network. The need to catalyse the technical assistance for addressing loss and damage effectively was highlighted.\u00a0\nThere have been a number of announcements made at COP26 which are significant too, outside of negotiations. For example, the Global Methane Pledge to cut down methane emission by 30 percent by 2030, and the pledge to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, are important measures announced at COP26.\nOn the whole, the momentum that was built since the Paris Agreement and in the run-up to COP26 has ended with a few pledges in some areas. However, the pledges still fall short of the requirements and urgency needed to tackle climate change. Of course, the pledges made at COP26 have great potential, but much depends on how they are implemented. There has been reluctance from developed countries in fulfilling their climate pledges in the past, and time will be the test for the Glasgow commitments. Unfortunately, there is no scope for wasting any time in taking robust and effective actions to fulfil the commitments made in the recently concluded COP26.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun is the Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue.

        "full_article": "In the leadup to COP26 in Glasgow, the first in two years, there was much talk about how this COP would make or break the collective global target to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was deemed as the \"one last chance\" to avert climate catastrophe by a plethora of global talking heads. What Glasgow delivered, was instead, as Greta Thunberg put it, \"blah blah blah\".\nThere were several key points that Glasgow promised significant progress on. This was to be the COP where loss and damage would be operationalised carrying on from Madrid in 2019, where we would see adaptation come into focus and climate finance finally ironed out, even if the existing pledges remain woefully inadequate. Ambition was a key word, as countries were appealed to return with newer, better, and more urgent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Alok Sharma, the COP26 President, promised this would be the COP that would consign coal to history, and explicit action on fossil fuels was what many hoped for. Of course, no one realistically expected Glasgow to deliver on everything, but as it quickly emerged within the first week of November, the struggle would rather be to get Glasgow to deliver on anything.\nThe warning signs were evident. The UK is said to have hosted the least inclusive, whitest and most Global North-centric COP. A British visa is an ordeal in the best of times for those of us with weak passports, but the added requirements around the UK's Red List Covid travel restrictions made travelling to Glasgow out of reach for many. Any sane person would balk at the idea of quarantining in a Heathrow hotel out-of-pocket. The lack of access to Covid vaccines in many parts of the world added an extra obstacle. While the UK government had a scheme for vaccinating COP participants, the programme was limited in scale.\nA much better faith policy would have been to ensure the spread of vaccines to the Global South rather than being hoarded in developed nations. Within the COP Venue, the SEC, civil society access to the plenary rooms where negotiations took place was severely limited, as were meeting spaces due to so-called Covid restrictions. As a result, many observers were shepherded into the expo-style pavilion area. It is no surprise then when climate justice activists were outraged at the news that while they were being excluded, the fossil fuel lobby had a larger combined delegation at COP than any country.\nThere were pushes for the outcomes necessary to call COP26 a success. The Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), presided by Bangladesh, pushed for the adoption of the Glasgow Emergency Pact, an acknowledgement of the short-term action required to stave off climate collapse rather than vague 2050 targets. But often proposals such as these, and discussions on loss and damage, climate finance, and fossil fuels (not just coal, but also oil and gas), were met by stern opposition by a variety of actors, including developed states such as the US, Australia and Norway, as well as certain non-Western states like Saudi Arabia. The Glasgow Facility on Loss and Damage pushed by developing countries was similarly scrapped. Meanwhile, developed states diverted negotiations primarily toward carbon markets, nature-based solutions and offsets.\nThere are several reasons why it was highly problematic that negotiations got bogged down on offsets rather than meaningful action on loss and damage, adaptation or strong language on fossil fuels. The first and foremost is that offsets aren't proven to work as effective climate action and at a time when ambition and urgency is needed for action in the near term, they provide excuses and loopholes for the polluters that landed us in this mess to continue polluting. Carbon markets have never been proven to reduce emissions and the pricing of carbon remains a sticking point. In theory, carbon markets could work as effective offsets, but in practice, the pricing of carbon has remained far too low in an unequal market to be anything more than a loophole for big polluters.\nSimilarly, nature-based solutions are iffy when it comes to efficacy. Net zero targets (rather than absolute reductions) are an easy get-out clause. By 2050, for most of these geriatric world leaders, it will be someone else's problem. In addition, they rely on projections based on unproven, or in some cases, non-existent technologies. Carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen, molten salt reactors, nuclear fission, etc all sound really nice\u2014but none of them are ready for deployment on the scale we need in the timeframe that is necessary. All in all, as environmental group Friends of the Earth International put it, no deal would have been preferable to the one we got.\nThe reason why this feels like a betrayal is that, while rich countries look for ways to continue their business-as-usual approach, the climate catastrophe is no longer a future possibility for vulnerable countries. We simply do not have time\u2014Bangladesh loses around 30m of coastline every year and will face a displacement crisis of unimaginable proportions if sea level rise is not controlled. Displacement is already underway.\nBefore the land gives way, people suffer as saltwater encroaches. An often-bandied statistic is that 19 coastal districts could at least partially go underwater and 30 million people may move further inland. Inaction by large emitters, both with their own commitments and with their reluctance to provide necessary resources to the vulnerable countries, is a death sentence for millions. With all this in mind, it felt quite gloom and doom as I left Glasgow.\nHowever, there were certain hopeful takeaways, as slight as they are. The first is that through the tireless work of activists, NGOs, indigenous peoples and vulnerable states, Loss and Damage has moved from being the unloved black sheep of the climate framework to an increasingly popular talking point. While we didn't see meaningful operationalisation of the topic, this is no longer a niche topic for climate nerds\u2014it has entered mainstream vocabulary and movements have embraced the concept as fundamental to climate justice. While this deserves an article of its own, one hopes that the ball has started rolling irreversibly, especially as hosts Scotland themselves committed a symbolic amount of money to a loss and damage fund, the first country to do so.\nSecondly, as I met activists from across the world, I saw anger, both in the hallways of the SEC, especially as coalitions of civil society organisations including youth, indigenous peoples, farmers, researchers, etc, marched out of the SEC in protest on the last day, and on the streets of Glasgow as 150,000 people braved the torrential Scottish weather to demand action. Anger is an extremely potent emotion and for the climate movement, this COP reiterated that there is no rest. That anger must be funnelled into making the lives of policymakers a living hell until they act. That anger must be directed against the fossil fuel companies who lied about their knowledge about the effects of burning carbon and continue to lobby to protect their profits rather than protecting human life.\nGlasgow failed the developing world. This cannot be forgotten in Egypt next year. As the travelling circus of COP goes to Africa, developing states and the climate justice movement must lick their wounds and reorganise, remobilise and have their voices heard. Climate action is inevitable. The question is whether COP, as a platform, will deliver it in time.\n\u00a0\nBareesh Chowdhury works at the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association.\nHis Twitter handle is: @brshhc\n",

        "full_article": "Displaced, colonised, marginalised, terrorised, tortured, victimised, killed; these are just some of the many forms of dispossession and ethnic cleansing the Palestinian people have had to endure at the hands of the Zionists and Israelis since the turn of the 20th century.\nTo be specific, things started getting edgy for Palestinians as the mighty Ottoman Empire neared its end, and the British and the French found themselves in an advantageous position from where they could easily exploit the rich resources of the vast Middle Eastern hinterland.\nMaking good of this opportunity, British diplomat Sir Mark Sykes and his French counterpart Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot got down to work to redefine the Middle Eastern landscape: tearing apart the map with their inconsiderate and reckless judgement, which they did with complete disregard for the ethno-political sensitives of the people inhabiting the region. The Sykes-Picot Agreement resulted in the decades-old bloodbath that the region is still reeling from.\nIn the face of growing animosity between the Arabs and the Jews, in 1947, the United Nations adopted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan, aimed at creating Arab and Jewish states. The State of Israel was created on May 14, 1948, leading to the end of the British Mandate of Palestine and sowing the seeds of the first Arab-Israel War. By the time the nine-month-long war ended on March 10, 1949, with Israel emerging as the victor, the Palestinians helplessly endured the Nakba or \"Catastrophe.\"\nAround 750,000 Palestinians were displaced during the Nakba, with about 500 Palestinian villages being depopulated. Over a span of a few months, the native Palestinians became outcasts in their own lands. Those who fled the war, lost their right to return home, most of them turning into poor refugees in neighbouring countries, with a new nightmare unfurling in their lives.\nThe result of the first Arab-Israel War was the division of the territory into three chunks: the biggest was Israel, followed by the smaller Gaza Strip, and the West Bank. This was only the beginning of a new era of subjugation, persecution and dispossession of the Palestinians at the hands of Israel.\nOver the years, the displacement of the Palestinians continued as Israel became more aggressive and more vicious in its apartheid-like misadventures. To this day, Israel keeps encroaching on Palestinian territories, and expanding unlawful Israeli settlement inside what is supposed to be Palestinian lands. The result: the Palestinians are being uprooted from their own homes and lands by a bunch of outsiders, albeit powerful. The recent major conflict between Israel and Palestine in May this year was the outcome of one such attempt by Israel. They tried to oust several Palestinian families from their own homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. When the Palestinians resisted the forced eviction, Israel not only used law enforcement agencies to coerce the Palestinian victims into subjugation, but also encouraged hard-line Jewish settlers to attack the protesting Palestinians.\nWith regard to Israel's aggression in Sheikh Jarrah, Rupert Colville, a rights office spokesman for the United Nations, stated, \"We wish to emphasise that East Jerusalem remains part of the occupied Palestinian territory, in which international humanitarian law applies . . . The occupying power\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 . . . cannot confiscate private property in occupied territory.\"\nColville further suggested that Israel's attempt at forced eviction of the Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah \"may amount to war crimes.\"\nHowever, while the United Nations and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, had been vocal in condemning Israeli actions, Israel's major ally the United States, along with many European countries, had been prosaic in their response to this incident, to say the least. When the conflict between Israel and Palestine escalated, with Israeli forces attacking worshippers in Al Aqsa mosque, and Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip in retaliation of Hamas' homespun rocket attacks, Germany even suggested that Israel has a right to defend itself.\nBut one might be pardoned for asking: if the aggressor has the right to defend itself, why is the same right not afforded to the victim? Are Palestinians not human beings? Do they not qualify to demand their basic human rights: right to life and liberty, right to dignity? Or are human rights exclusive to the West and its cronies, including Israel?\nIn a fair world, Israel would not have the patronage and tools to carry out the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. They would not have the licence to kill Palestinians, including children; Israel would not have the support to carry on its colonisation of Palestine. But then, perhaps the world is not a fair place.\nWhile every year, on November 29, we observe the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, we have done very little to actually support, promote and facilitate the cause of the Palestinians. Other than issuing a few templated statements, the day makes no difference for the rest of the world. As a result, Israel keeps gaining ground, while the Palestinians keep suffering\u2014their spaces shrinking every day.\nWhat the Palestinians need right now are not hollow words, but action from the global community. The world can stop Israel in its tracks by imposing the same stringent sanctions that they have imposed on Iran for lesser ambitions. Why does the US create maximum pressure campaign on Iran for trying to enrich uranium, but does not apply the same on Israel for killing innocent civilians, for imposing an apartheid regime? And why does the global community not speak up against these inconsistencies and injustices?\nRather than contemplating these questions, many countries around the world are now normalising ties with Israel, betraying the cause of the Palestinian people. And Israel is taking advantage of these situations to carry on with its nefarious activities in the Middle East, especially against Palestinians and its supporters. This must stop.\nThe world community must now reflect on where they are going wrong with their Middle East policy; on what they could do to effectively support the cause of the Palestinians; or even what their priorities are, because many of their actions do not complement their words.\nThe Palestinians are caught alone, in the middle of nowhere, and their time is running out. But so is ours to show meaningful solidarity with them. Let this display of solidarity not be a cosmetic one-day-a-year show-off. Let this day be an occasion for us to play a thoughtful and effective role in the Palestinians' quest for their right to self-determination, for their basic human rights.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.\nHer Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "The fact that a rape victim's journey towards justice is a grueling one is not unknown to us. There have been several reports and extensive research in the past identifying causes for such hurdles in rape prosecution, including those that focused on the extremely low rate of conviction in rape cases. Added to those causes is how various levels of justice services often receive victims of sexual offences with utmost suspicion, making the already difficult task of proving the accused's guilt \"beyond all reasonable doubt\" further challenging. The suspicion also commonly results in an overwhelming reliance on medical evidence suggesting specific injuries on the victim's body. This particular aspect came into even greater focus recently when a Nari o Shishu Nirjaton Daman Tribunal decided to acquit all five suspects in the much-discussed Banani Raintree Hotel rape case trial. While it is unclear what exactly had been said by the recently revoked Judge of the Tribunal regarding the suggestion to police to not accept rape cases 72 hours after the incident, there's no doubt that the concerned Judge was simply following the dominant trend of insisting on the need for medical evidence that indicates signs of violence present on the victim's body and DNA evidence to corroborate the truthfulness of the victim's testimony.\nHaving medical evidence that strongly suggests that the victim had been subjected to forcible intercourse will surely make it easier for the victim to prove her case. But when there is no such evidence, it should not lead to conclusions of falsity regarding the victim's complaint. Of course, absence of medical evidence often makes it rather impossible for the occurrence of rape to be proven. In addition, there are also sometimes pointless efforts to gather DNA evidence even in cases where matching the DNA won't have any impact in proving or disproving rape. DNA evidence would, of course, be essential when the accused has altogether denied the (forced) intercourse. But when both the parties acknowledge that sexual intercourse had happened, then the question that needs to be answered is whether it happened with or without both parties' consent, and not whether the DNA samples had matched.\nThis heavy reliance on medical evidence can be largely attributed to the stereotypical understanding of rape, which perceives it to always be a violent and forcible act of sexual intercourse. A \"modest and truthful\" victim as such, is expected to have resisted the attack with all possible force. This misogynistic perception often brushes over the question of legal consent, which is in fact the key element that needs to be proved in a rape case wherein the occurrence sexual intercourse is not disputable. There can be many contexts wherein the victim may not actively resist the attacker. In some cases, even if she did resist, the injury marks might not be visible during medical examination. To mention a few examples, a rape that happened on gunpoint would most likely be without much resistance from the victim; or a victim might have fainted, seized, or been otherwise threatened with death if she resisted. Similarly, because of prevalent social barriers in accessing justice, when a rape victim files a case after a considerable time has elapsed since the occurrence of the attack, there would most likely be no injury marks found during the medical examination.\nBesides, certain special attributes are often attached to the patriarchal portrayal of a rape victim. A victim who belongs to a lesser economic background or is uneducated, has an existing or a past sexual life, or has a lifestyle that does not match the traditional image of a \"helpless and shunned\" victim of rape, such a victim will likely not match the description of \"modest and truthful\" and hence, the burden of proving her testimony would probably be even heavier.\nWhile we are circling around the age-old misogynistic questions of whether the medical evidence shows injury marks or not, or whether she was \"habituated\" to sex or not\u2014our Supreme Court had long set the rule in a number of cases that there is no bar for the court to act on the sole testimony of a rape victim except in rarest of rare cases. The Supreme Court had even held onto that to insist on corroboration of the statement of a victim of sexual assault before putting reliance upon the same, as a rule amounts to adding insult to injury and as such, unless there are compelling reasons, the court should find no difficulty in acting on the sole testimony of the victim. But unfortunately, such rulings are not consistently followed in rape prosecutions. Rather, because of the inherent suspicion imposed on a rape victim's complaint, the necessity of corroboration is often overtly emphasised. The fear embedded by the British colonial jurisprudence, that a rape victim may have falsely accused an innocent man, sadly still influences modern day decisions in rape prosecutions.\nAs Bangladesh prepares to step into the developing country category, it is our sincere hope that, as a nation, we will now positively take up the plight of the victims of sexual offences and carry them to justice. Together, we need to build a platform for action to break the patriarchal and misogynist narratives around victims of rape who are brave enough to knock on the doors of justice.\n\u00a0\nTaslima Yasmin is Associate Professor, Department of Law at Dhaka University.\nEmail: taslima47@yahoo.com\n",

The collective profits of 288 listed companies stood at Tk 7,203 crore in the July-September period of 2021-22, up from Tk 6,631 crore a year earlier, according to Sandhani Asset Management Company. Some experts have suggested that this is a sign of the economy returning to normalcy from the pandemic-induced slowdown.\nThe increased earning also has the potential to have a multiplier effect. As earnings go up, business and consumer confidence could go up, leading to a net positive effect on the economy in the foreseeable future. Investment, which also took a big hit during the pandemic, may rise as a result of increased confidence. This could provide the economy with another much-needed boost.\nOn the other hand, some experts have warned that the economy is still some way off from recovering. For example, according to data from various private organisations, poverty in the country has gone up significantly due to the pandemic. And the increase in the profits of listed companies could be due to rising exports\u2014not because of higher domestic demand. Another thing to consider is the fact that most listed companies are large corporations, and it is mostly the micro and small businesses that are still struggling to recover from the pandemic\u2014and their performance has a much bigger impact on the overall economy. Given that the country's employment rate and other economic factors are largely dependent on small businesses, relying on data that only considers the profits of listed companies to judge overall economic performance could be a mistake.\nDespite the contradictory pictures that could be drawn from the available data on listed companies, the fact that their profits have risen is good news. And although it might be overly optimistic to interpret this data as a sign of full economic recovery, it does signify that the economy is showing some signs of rebounding from the pandemic. Therefore, now is the perfect time for policymakers to provide the type of support that is needed for a quick and full recovery. In line with that, we hope the concerned authorities are constantly working with experts and industry stakeholders to formulate policies that can help businesses thrive and the economy recover fully.\n",

Hardly had we been able to take a breath of respite after combatting the first and second wave which was brought about by the Delta variant, that we are again confronted with a new variant of the coronavirus, Omicron. It so far remains an unknown quantity. What we know so far about it is that it has a faster rate of growth and WHO has categorised it as the most troubling category of coronavirus variant at par with its predecessor the Delta variant. As of now, the new variant has been detected in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong, the UK and Israel.\nAs disturbing as it is, the news of the emergence of a new variant should not set off our panic buttons. We would do well to take the situation in our stride but prepare well to face it. In this context, we would like to reiterate Michael Ryan, the Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, that viruses evolve and we pick up variants. It's not the end of the world, the sky is not falling in. His warning against knee-jerk reaction is also worth noting.\u00a0\nWe believe that instead of panicking, we should enforce the health and other regulatory measures forcefully when the time comes, prepare the healthcare system well and invest in it adequately with both material and human resources so as to avoid being overwhelmed should the virus go out of control. It is essential that public awareness programmes be spruced up and that the use of masks be enforced outdoors and in large gatherings. In fact, wearing masks should become our second habit.\u00a0\nOne doesn't know yet to what extent the new virus is resistant to the available vaccines. But that notwithstanding, the government's vaccination programme should be geared up further, since as of now, only 20.65 percent of the population have got two shots, and 33 percent only the first shot.\nWe ought to learn from our mistakes of the past. The previous lockdown, enforced with the second surge in May this year, was lifted in August. But regrettably, the enforcement was lax, which resulted in an unacceptable number of deaths. We believe that the only way to stem the growth of the new virus is to deprive it of its vectors and prevent its germination. The virus grows in people and is carried around and spread by people; therefore, first and foremost, every effort must be devoted so that the new virus is prevented from entering the country in the first place.\u00a0\n",
