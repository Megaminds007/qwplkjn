ISRO launched the XPoSat, in a two-part mission, onboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) on its C58 flight on January 1. The relative timing of these launches may be a coincidence but it is heartening because the ratio of scientific to technological missions ISRO has launched is skewed in favour of the latter, at the expense of research in the sense of discovery. Those science-oriented missions have all been exceptional in their own right. For example, XPoSat is only the second space-based experiment to study X-ray polarisation, and at higher x-ray energies than the other, NASA\u2019s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. Its POLIX payload, realised by the Raman Research Institute, will track X-rays in the 8-30 kilo-electron-volt (keV) energy range and observe emissions from around 50 sources in five years. The XSPECT payload, by ISRO\u2019s U.R. Rao Satellite Centre, will study X-rays of energy 0.8-15 keV and changes in continuous X-ray emissions. Together, they are expected to shed light on intense X-ray sources such as pulsars and black holes.Then again, the science-technology skew is a reminder that ISRO among the world\u2019s spacefaring organisations has unique needs and priorities. This is exemplified by the second part of the C58 mission. After launching XPoSat in a 650-km circular orbit around the earth, the fourth stage of the rocket lowered itself into a 350-km-high orbit and unfurled solar panels, becoming a rudimentary satellite and orbital testbed for the 10 payloads it carried. These are a radio payload by the K.J. Somaiya Institute of Technology and a device to measure ultraviolet radiation from L.B.S. Institute of Technology for Women; a \u2018green\u2019 cubesat propulsion unit, a \u2018green\u2019 monopropellant thruster, a tantalum-based radiation shield, a heater-less hollow cathode, and a nanosatellite platform, all from private entities; and an interplanetary dust counter, a fuel-cell power system, and a high-energy cell from ISRO centres. This is only the third time ISRO has operated the PSLV fourth stage in this way. As such, the C58 mission represents a union of the aspirations of professional scientists, aspiring students of science, and India\u2019s private spaceflight sector. This again is a vignette of the demands of ISRO itself as it navigates an era in which a permanent lunar station seems inevitable, drawing as much on technological capabilities as \u2014 based on scientific missions \u2014 humankind\u2019s knowledge of the universe.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nISRO\n\n/\n\nspace programme\n\n/\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\nscience and technology\n\n/\n\nengineering colleges",

Three Houthi boats were sunk and 10 militants killed in a rare close combat with the rebels who control much of Yemen. The Houthis say that to express solidarity with the Palestinians, they would continue to attack commercial vessels passing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, through which the Red Sea opens into the Gulf of Aden. Since late November, at least 20 commercial tankers have come under Houthi attacks, including a chemical vessel off the Indian coast, forcing some of the world\u2019s largest shipping companies, including Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and MSC, to suspend trading on the Red Sea routes, and use the circuitous route around Africa. Traffic through the Red Sea, a crucial link between the Mediterranean and the Arabian Seas through the Suez Canal, has dropped by some 35% in recent weeks, increasing shipping and insurance costs. The crisis has prompted the U.S. to announce a new naval task force to ensure security in one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.But the U.S.\u2019s attempt to deal with the Houthi threats as a stand-alone security crisis might run into its own limitations. No Red Sea basin country has joined the U.S.-led task force, which includes even Egypt, whose economy has taken a hit due to the drop in the Suez traffic. This shows the growing anger in the Arab world towards the Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s unconditional support for Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, which has killed at least 22,000 people in 11 weeks. The Houthi control of Yemen\u2019s Red Sea Coast, including the port of Hodeidah, which is some 250 km north of the Bab el-Mandeb, just 29 km wide at its narrowest point, gives them a natural advantage in carrying out sea denial attacks in and around the Strait. Over the past few weeks, the U.S. has shot down several Houthi missiles and drones over the Red Sea. But that has not stopped the Houthis from launching new attacks. Even if the U.S. carries out airstrikes in Yemen, it is not clear whether aerial attacks could deter the Houthis, who survived intense Saudi bombing for seven years. Beefing up security in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea has now become inevitable, but the U.S. should first work towards achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, addressing the core issue behind the escalation. That would help Washington build a regional consensus against the Houthis. But if the U.S. turns a blind eye towards the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians by its ally and stays focused only on the Houthis, it risks getting dragged deeper into a widening regional conflict.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nact of terror\n\n/\n\noceans\n\n/\n\nYemen\n\n/\n\nsecurity measures\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nshipping service\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nEgypt\n\n/\n\nmissile systems",

The good news is that this year, India\u2019s economy may again be better placed than its peers. IMF\u2019s latest forecast for 2024 makes India the fastest growing major economy.\n\nBut let\u2019s be careful. Hence our to-do list for governments, Union and states.\nTrack oil, food:\u00a0Oil price has defied conventional wisdom. A major conflict broke out in West Asia in October, but the monthly average oil price trended downward thereafter. At the current level of $80, oil is not the headache it could have been. But that might not persist. What\u2019s certain is that for India, food inflation will be the biggest source of domestic uncertainty this year. Keeping it under check is important to keep the economy moving at around the same speed.\nDo reforms:\u00a0Till general elections, expect no major policy initiatives, bar some pre-poll budget goodies. But if, as predicted, Modi comes back for a third time, he should use his enormous political capital to initiate reforms. If India is to grow at 7%-plus for the next 10 years, it needs a few systemic changes now. Modi\u2019s third term is the perfect launch pad.\nMake Houses relevant: The winter session of Parliament showed how dysfunctional the legislature has become. Important changes to criminal justice laws were made with a big part of the opposition missing. Intra-party debates in Parliament are not the best way to discuss a proposed law. Debates in Parliament when laws are made provide the judiciary a clue on their interpretation. When laws are made without adequate debate, the interpretation later is dicey. It adds to delays and confusion. GOI has to take the lead here.\nHuman capital:\u00a0It\u2019s people who determine how sophisticated a society is. India is in urgent need of a big upgrade to reach its potential. Even smart laws will not deliver satisfactory results if they are worked by underequipped people. Recently, two members of NCLAT were pulled up by the Supreme Court for contempt. It should, therefore, be no surprise that bankruptcy cases rarely stick to their timelines despite a good law.\nListen to mountains: There have been a series of calamities in the Himalayas, where senseless human activities played a role. It\u2019s a warning that environmental risks cannot be brushed away. In 2024, India needs to move away from false binaries on development and environment.\nHoping some of this gets done, we wish India a Happy New Year.\n\n",

We really, really wish the fares will come down, so we can see some new towns.\n\nHorn No OK: You\u2019re sitting in the same traffic as me. No matter how murderously you honk, you know I am not going anywhere. I cannot. But yeah, now my eardrums and nerves are fried. Honking is as much of a passion for Indians as samosas. But it\u2019s a bigger health threat. It can trigger accidents. Let\u2019s kick this road ragey habit.\n\nWhatsApp groups, take rest:\u00a0Kids to grannies, everyone is chained to too many WhatsApp groups, endlessly scrolling, posting, forwarding, always \u2018on\u2019. We say rest The Thumb. It\u2019s about how much misinformation WhatsApp University spreads. Also, that daily Good Morning rose from your mausi and hazaar chaddi buddis is utterly useless. Declutter today.\n\nCricket-itis, take footy meds:\u00a0We saw a cricket World Cup, and then another in 2023. It\u2019s hard to keep track with the insane amount of cricket, but we lost both. Now yet another one\u2019s coming up. This is too much. How about our football team qualifying for the Fifa 2026 World Cup? Let\u2019s get out of the rut of being a one-sport nation.\n\nPannun on OTT trial: There were some conversations about the man during the farmers\u2019 protests. But between them Kanada and Amrika have now got us all being total argumentative Indians over the Pannun kaand. It\u2019s ripe for a racy/risky take on OTT. That\u2019s where we really like to see true crime. The real deal on reel. OTT\u2019ll give you the gist, and plenty grist.\n\nInstant noodles, go to dustbin: It\u2019s the only meal you get on many remote mountaintops. The staple of bachelor/ bachelorette diets. And after years of Maggi monopoly we can now chow Nissins, Paldos, Vit\u2019s too. But though these come with fancier seasonings, they\u2019re just as evil healthwise. Let\u2019s bin sodium and/or MSG, and do some real cooking.\n\nMichelin star, come to India: These fine-dining guides are being published across more than 25 countries. Does it make sense that the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, with so much food to die for, is yet to get a Michelin guide in any of its cities? This Frenchie prejudice must end. We also want to be able to wear our Rolex to a starred restaurant. We want gastronomic \u00e9galit\u00e9.\n\nNobel for Rushdie: The decades since the publication of Midnight\u2019s Children have seen the fandom of Salman\u2019s writing and personal story spread phenomenally, one translation after another. It\u2019s time the Swedish Academy stops dissing him and picking sundry, obscure white Europeans. The anxiety of will he, won\u2019t he must end.\n\nFast fashion, slow down: Do you really need to buy two new shirts this week? To add to the 43 you already have, after giving 15 to the kabadiwala last week. The more the distance between us and Covid\u2019s second wave grows, the less sense all this \u2018revenge buying\u2019 makes. C\u2019mon, give the wastelands a break. That kurta that you have had for a decade, is what really deserves bragging rights.\n\nAI guru, namaste:\u00a0Let this tech now service our spiritual needs. Imagine a customised digi-guru, free of parochial undertones & overtones, rites & rituals. Free of ego and perhaps free of cost too! Ever-present but never intrusive. Free from divisive religiosity, melting all gyan borders, folding itself to all your moods. It isn\u2019t maya.\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is now increasingly recognised that 2024 will be the biggest year for democracy ever. Ballots in more than 50 nations will offer a say to two out of every three adults in the democratic world next year \u2014 a record year of voting since data collection began.\nThe year kicks off with the presidential election in the relatively small but geopolitically significant state of Taiwan followed by polls in the more populous powers from Indonesia to India and Mexico to the United States. The political implications of this historic pageant of democracy are far from clear but on the economic front, it seems an epic clash is in the making.\nRuchir Sharma\nIncumbents seeking another term will be tempted as always to ramp up public spending before the vote while the challengers will often counter with promises of even bigger spending splurges. That puts them on a collision course with global investors who, reawakened from a long slumber by an era of higher interest rates, will be quick to punish profligate politicians by selling off their stocks, bonds and currency. In the US and Europe, these investors became known as \u201cbond market vigilantes\u201d the last time rates were this high \u2014 in the 1980s and \u201990s.\nMany countries, having run up massive debts during the pandemic, are newly vulnerable to these attacks. Battles are most likely in nations where leaders are under pressure to increase spending because their own popularity is so low. The rub: that is most countries. I track polls in 10 developed and 10 developing countries; approval ratings have fallen over the past year in three out of four, and the median rating is now just 45% in developing countries, and a near-record low 36% for the 10 developed countries.\nBond vigilantes, usually triggered by inflation, will be quick to act in countries where a free-spending leader is making a bad fiscal situation worse. Six leaders face a 2024 election in countries where the deficit is now higher than 5% of gross domestic product \u2014 a level many bond investors would consider a danger zone. They range from India and Bangladesh to South Africa and the US.\nIndia\u2019s risks are offset by the fact that its economy has been growing faster than most, easing the debt servicing burden. The central government\u2019s deficit is still very high compared to other emerging markets, at around 6% of GDP, but has come down from nearly 10% during the pandemic. And though BJP\u2019s overwhelming recent victories in the Hindi heartland states should reduce pressure on the government to dole out freebies before the 2024 election, 60% of government spending is carried out by the states, double the average level in developed countries. Lately, Indian states have been spending more on subsidies, less on investment, a turn bond markets dislike. And in some of the recent electoral battlegrounds, including Rajasthan and MP, the state deficit spiked sharply before the vote. Competitive populism is gaining momentum, and the risk for India is that Modi too succumbs to its appeal in the run-up to the national vote.\nIn the US, the deficit and spending trends have already moved into another orbit. Its deficit is expected to remain above 6% of GDP in coming years \u2014 nearly double its pre-pandemic trend, and six times the average in other developed economies. Now that interest rates have risen, US government interest payments will exceed spending on defence and on social programmes such as Medicaid within the next 10 years. Neither of the likely candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, are expected to exercise spending restraint, raising the potential for vigilante attacks.\nSouth Africa is also at a high risk. Facing power outages and rising inflation, president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s approval rating slumped nearly 10 points in the last year to just over 40%, and the country\u2019s deficit has tripled since the 2000s to more than 5%. Recent steps to restrain spending such as higher public wages have also been targeted at pleasing voters, and public debt is still growing.\nMeanwhile, Mexico\u2019s deficit is rising rapidly towards 5% of GDP, the highest since the 1990s, and its relatively popular president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, is passing on the problem to an untested successor. While several other developing economies from Ghana to Sri Lanka have been forced over the past couple of years to cut spending as they faced bankruptcy, their leaders will find it increasingly hard to stay the course in an election year.\nNo country is immune. Going back to at least 1960, research shows, leaders have often raised spending or cut taxes to improve their re-election prospects. Until recently, however, borrowing costs were so cheap that bond investors tended to overlook these bad habits, except in extreme cases like Argentina.\nThat changed in 2022 with the return of inflation and higher rates. Since then, the vigilantes have targeted nations all over the world. They helped force UK Prime Minister Liz Truss out of office, by selling off the UK\u2019s bonds and currency in response to a budget-busting tax scheme. They compelled two old populist warhorses, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, to embrace fiscal restraint. Erdogan shelved bizarrely unorthodox policies and appointed financial market veterans to restore investor confidence.\nNotice the pattern. Financial markets are now so large, dwarfing any national economy, that the vigilantes usually prevail. Leaders take them on at their own risk. In the US and India, where complacency is high and many seem to think that investors will never tire of buying their debt, it\u2019s worth pondering the fate of the losers. Brazil, Turkey and the UK changed their wayward ways under vigilante pressure and are so far better for it. Taking on the bond vigilantes is mostly a losing battle but that won\u2019t stop many politicians from trying.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The economy, now on a roller coaster ride, is like a tumour, which, if ignored or left untreated, might turn cancerous and deadly. Similarly, the vexing issues of money laundering, default bank loan and macro-economic mismanagement which became a culture over the years have meanwhile taken ominous proportions. Sadly, all the alarm bells and the calls to fix those growing economic ills went unheeded. Now we face the rude awakening of what happens when we don't pay adequate attention to economic risk factors. The inherent weakness of our economy was exposed by the external shocks of Covid-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war. Since then a myriad of macroeconomic instabilities have manifested in the form of prolonged high inflation, high exchange rate volatility, fast-depleting foreign reserves unprecedented liquidity crisis in banks, high volume of capital flight, low tax revenue generation and so on. There is no denying that external shocks have greatly contributed to landing us in this financial crisis. But had the foundation of our economy been strong, it could absorb the external shocks better.Against this backdrop, a reputed economist during his interactions with the members of the Economic Reporters' Forum (ERF) recently has concluded that the piecemeal steps taken by the government will not work. Instead, he prescribed 'shock therapy' to bring the economy back to good health with three urgent reform measures, which he said could be painful in the short term but would pay off eventually. The first reform measure he recommends is the implementation of the new bank company and income tax laws to restore good governance in the banking sector as well as increase tax revenue earnings. The strict implementation of these two laws might put some people under tremendous financial pressure, but the nation will benefit from it. It is, therefore, essential that the government demonstrate a strong political will to implement the measures.That the country's banking sector is hostage to politically powerful quarters is no secret. As a result, an increasing number of banks are not only grappling with non-performing loans (NPLs), but also facing severe liquidity crisis. To overcome this situation, economists are advocating for banking sector reforms that would ensure independence of the central bank. Additionally, the proposal of facilitating mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the banking sector deserves attention. The idea is to create an exit policy for non-viable banks through measures like merger, acquisition, restructuring and liquidation. Some of the new generation banks, which were set up with ulterior motives and given licenses under political consideration, have clearly exacerbated the situation. It provides a lesson for policymakers about the consequence of facilitating the creation of bad banks under political patronage.The other two reform measures listed on the economist's prescription are adopting market-based dollar rates and withdrawing caps from bank interest rates for deposits and lending. The measures proposed by our economists are also in sync with the reforms IMF wants to see in our economic system as part of its 4.7 billion loan. The policymakers would do well to kick-start the reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and ensure the structural integrity of key economic sectors. Any delay in implementing the reform measures will only add to our economic woes.",

        "full_article": "With fast-depleting reserves of non-renewable sources of energy, Bangladesh's power sector's dependence on imported fuel is increasing. Of late, imported coal and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) are becoming the driver of the country's power generation regime based on non-renewable fossil fuels. From the existing power plants, the country produces some 3 gigawatts (GW) from imported coal and LNG. An additional 6.2 GW of power are planned to be added to the existing capacity of coal-based power in the country. Similarly, CNG-run power plants will increase excess power reserve further. But how long will the country be able to bear the mounting costs of importing fossil fuels? And being in the frontline of climate change, can Bangladesh go on increasing its carbon footprints indefinitely? The time is up for the country to shift its energy base from the non-renewable fossil fuels to a sustainable, renewable one. And it is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. The San Francisco-based non-government body, Global Energy Monitor (GEM), which studies evolving global energy landscape by generating database and reports said some months back that Bangladeshis one of the world's top 20 countries with prospective solar farm capacity. So far, Bangladesh could develop capacity for generating 541.17 MW electricity from solar power and 2.9 MW from wind power.  Also, according to the National Solar Energy Roadmap, with an average solar radiation of 4.5 (kWh/m2)(kilowatt-hour per square metre), Bangladesh has a huge potential for harvesting this abundant green energy through both photovoltaic and thermal devices. Going by the draft Integrated Energy and Power Masterplan (IEPMP), Bangladesh's renewable energy sector generates approximately 777 MW of power, of which close to 70 per cent was from solar energy till 2021. In Bangladesh's solar energy sector, the major categories include solar parks, solar home system (SHS), rooftop solar power and solar irrigation system. Though solar parks have the highest potential to play the biggest role in transitioning to the green energy system, yet scarcity of land that solar parks require comes in the way. In that case, the next best option is the rooftop solar system. It can well meet both the industrial and residential needs for power. And roof spaces of the industrial facilities and residential buildings are also not as limited as the spaces on the ground. For in a land-scarce country, the first priority should be to have enough land for agriculture for the nation's sustenance. There is also the need for having sufficient amount of forestland which has meanwhile receded alarmingly. Against this backdrop, the government has set the target of adding 300 MW of rooftop solar power by 2025. These rooftop solar power systems can be installed on high-rise buildings and the financial support for the project is also available from IDCOL (Infrastructure Development Company Limited) , a government-owned non-bank financial body to finance mainly infrastructural projects for renewable energy. But for making the rooftop solar energy project successful, high import duties of solar power inverters need to be reduced. And, at the same time, arrangements should be there to produce quality inverters locally. In fact, challenges of transitioning to a clean energy phase for Bangladesh, like any other country of the world, are enormous. The technology on which life and economy of the modern world hinges is still basically based on fossil energy. So, switching to an energy technology base different from the prevailing one overnight is a pipe dream. Moreover, alternative technologies, for instance, the ones based on solar power, or hydrogen fuel, or even nuclear power have not yet proved to be viable ones to replace fossil fuel any time soon. Which is why, the Ukraine war created so much impact across the globe as a major source of global fossil fuel, Russia, stopped supplying natural gas to Europe. Ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is yet another source of global tension due to its potential for spreading into the oil-producing nation of that region. So, green, or for that matter, clean energy transition cannot be achieved in one stroke. It has to be done in a phased manner. And so the strategies for transitioning to clean energy will vary from country to country. In Bangladesh, for example, the recently drafted Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP) provides a long-term strategy that forecasts like this. If the country aspires for net zero emissions or if advanced technologies could be put into use, it has to utilise solar and wind technologies, expand nuclear capacity, turn coal-fired plants into ammonia co-firing ones, replace gas with hydrogen, adopt carbon-capture and storage technology and minimise oil and captive power. Clearly, carbon-emitting technology will continue at least till 2040, according to the plan. So, it is a mix of both dirty and clean technologies that will continue for some time before a fully clean energy transition can be achieved. However, the actual time required will perhaps be longer than envisaged. But considering the ever-worsening climate conditions, the innovations for more efficient clean-energy technologies are not progressing fast enough. Even so Bangladeshi researchers working in the field should keep track of the new innovations being made and try to replicate those at home. In many cases, some innovations do not involve high technology, which Bangladeshi researchers can work on to see if those could be adapted to local conditions.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Dengue, a vector-borne disease that usually appears in wet monsoon, especially during the months from June to September has evidently changed its behaviour in Bangladesh. For it is still raging during the unlikely season of winter with reports of hospitalisation coming from outlying districts. It is also unusual because, so far as our previous experience goes, it is the densely populated cities where dengue infections generally occur, but it is not so now in Bangladesh. According to Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) data, this year 65 per cent of the dengue cases have been reported from outside Dhaka. This is also happening for the first time in the country's dengue history. So, it is history after history that dengue virus and its carrier, Aedes mosquito, have been making in Bangladesh, thanks to climate change, if not to a lack of effective human intervention to control the affliction. Consider the recent invasion of every house in the city by swarms of mosquitoes. Who knows what percentage of them are dengue-carrying ones? Though there is no rain now, there may still be unattended roadside Aedes-larvae-filled puddles, plastic cans or coconut shells strewn across the open spaces between buildings of the city's mahallahs and in the water tanks of under-construction buildings. To corroborate this view, it would be worthwhile to refer to a recently published media report on the post-monsoon survey on Aedes mosquito larvae in the capital's two city corporations for the month of December. The survey conducted by the disease control wing of the DGHS found that compared with last year's findings from a similar survey, the just-ended December saw a threefold increase in the larva population of Aedes mosquito in the city. Such surveys, according to those involved in the study, provide an idea of what is going to be the picture of things next monsoon. In fact, from last year's survey results, experts did indeed predict exactly what we have been experiencing now. Though the government people would say that they left no stone unturned to prevent the spread of dengue through destroying both adult Aedes mosquitoes and their larvae from their breeding grounds, their claim flies in the face of the uncontrolled spread of dengue across the country with accompanying fatalities. Consider that between 2,000 and 2022, a total of 244,246 people contracted dengue while only 849 patients died of the disease. But in 2023 alone, the number of people infected with dengue was 321,179 while those succumbing to the disease was 1705. If one looks at the dengue-related deaths in the years preceding 2023, the fatalities from dengue was 86 in 2022, and 22 in 2021. Evidently, 2023 was an exceptional year when dengue struck the nation with a vengeance. Bur do those in authority really comprehend the scale of public health problem they are encountering at the moment? It has indeed been a case of health emergency, though the authorities concerned did not declare it as such. To many in the medical profession, this year's dengue outbreak was of epidemic proportion. And if adequate preparations are not taken to face the emerging threat, next year may prove to be a catastrophic one as far as dengue is concerned. And DGHS's survey findings for December, 2023 speaks volumes for that. Granted that 2023's irruption of dengue took people engaged in mosquito eradication or those in the health department by surprise. In that case, the element of surprise should not at least be there next year when the nation is faced with a similar or worse case of dengue outbreak. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The foreign exchange (forex) market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies. Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce and finance, forex markets tend to be the world's largest and most liquid asset markets. Currencies trade against each other as exchange rate pairs. Forex prices move constantly and create more opportunities to make speculative profits. Forex trading works like any other transaction where investors buy one asset using a currency. The only difference is that in Forex, investors purchase currency using another currency. In the case of forex, the market price tells an investor how much of one currency is required to purchase another. For example, the current market price of the BDT/USD shows how much taka it would take to buy one US dollar.Forex market is a very profitable marketplace for investors. As this market changes constantly, investors need good knowledge to make a profit from it. However, forex trading is illegal for unlicensed individuals in Bangladesh. Foreign currency can be purchased and sold through the dealers or the money changers authorised by Bangladesh Bank. Only licensed dealers and money exchangers can run this business. This law should be updated and the government should legalise forex trading for everyone. If forex is legalised companies will be able to arrange their foreign currency for trading. We need foreign currency to import necessary products and raw materials for our industry. If forex is legalised, companies will be able to arrange their foreign currency easily to conduct their businesses. The government can open a platform for forex trading and monitor it in case of any kind of scam or illegal activities. And the government can earn high revenues from this trading as tax or service charge. Forex will help balance the foreign currency reserve and help companies hedge exchange rate risk. From the forex market, an investor can make a profit by speculation. If an investor thinks any currency rate will increase in the future, he can buy it now and sell it later. This is how this trade can go on. \nShefat Bin Hossain, Student of North South University, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
