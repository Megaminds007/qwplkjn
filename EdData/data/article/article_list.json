With a 5-1 majority, it has committed to keeping monetary policy unambiguously disinflationary so as to anchor inflation expectations, especially at a time when \u2018large and repetitive price shocks are interrupting the pace of disinflation\u2019. On the rationale to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for a sixth straight meeting, Governor Shaktikanta Das observed that while domestic economic momentum remained strong, uncertainties in food prices continued to impinge on the headline inflation trajectory. The tangible risk that food price pressures could become more generalised and impact broader headline inflation was the main consideration, he explained. That the majority of the MPC was aligned in prioritising the battle against inflation needs to be seen in the backdrop of the recent trends in retail inflation. Headline retail inflation, which had eased from July\u2019s 15-month peak of 7.4% to 4.87% in October, however, rebounded to a four-month high of 5.69% in December, with food price gains gauged by the Consumer Food Price Index racing ahead to 9.53%, a sizeable 292 basis points faster than October\u2019s 6.61%.That the uncertainty surrounding food price gains has begun to vex policymakers is reflected in a recent RBI Bulletin article that pointedly sought to find an answer to the question, \u2018Are Food Prices the \u2018True\u2019 Core of India\u2019s Inflation?\u2019. Concluding that there is enough empirical evidence to support an assertion that \u2018there are times when food inflation mimics core inflation\u2019, the officials caution that given food\u2019s substantial share in the consumption basket, large and repeated food price shocks have the potential to ripple outward and undermine the goal of price stability by de-anchoring inflation expectations. The MPC\u2019s downward revision of its projection for average retail inflation in the January-March quarter to 5.0%, 20 basis points lower than its December forecast, reflects the small comfort policymakers have taken from the improvement in rabi sowing as well as a seasonal correction in vegetable prices. Still, the Department of Consumer Affairs\u2019 daily price monitoring dashboard shows the average retail price of more than two-thirds of the key food items it tracks remained higher on a year-on-year basis as on February 8. Policymakers need to stay steadfast in their resolve to durably slow price gains towards the 4% target or risk dampening consumption and thereby undermining the growth momentum. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nprices\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nfruit and vegetable\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

The police adds that they were involved in spreading propaganda on voter fraud, pushing for new elections, recruiting troops to organise a coup, bringing judges under surveillance and encouraging the mob to stage protests defying the results. Well before the elections, Mr. Bolsonaro had raised doubts about the election systems. He had refused to concede defeat to his leftist rival Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, while his far-right supporters continued their protests, which culminated in the January 2023 riots at Brazil\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and Presidential office. A court has ordered Mr. Bolsonaro to surrender his passport, and three of his allies and the head of his party have been arrested. The far-right leader, under whose watch Brazil\u2019s economy tanked, social tensions rose, the health-care system crumbled under the weight of COVID-19, and institutions came under attack, says the allegations are politically motivated. But he does not have an easy way out of the mess.Those who were in power being targeted by the system is nothing new in Brazil. Former leftist President Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016 on charges of violating budget rules. Lula, the incumbent President, spent 580 days in jail between his terms, on a corruption conviction, which was later annulled by the Supreme Court. While Ms. Rousseff and Lula were accused of corruption and fell prey to the powerful lobbies in Brazil\u2019s Congress and judiciary, the charges against Mr. Bolsonaro, a defender of the brutal dictatorship of 1964-1985, are far more serious. Democracy remains fragile and for the military, memories of the dictatorship are still fresh. Any attempt by politicians or officers to defy the election process and undermine democracy should be dealt with utmost seriousness. But it should be done as per the law, avoiding political vendetta. Lula returned to power on promises that he would strengthen democracy and enable prosperity and growth. His hands are full. He should also make sure that there are impartial investigations and the truth about the riots and the alleged coup plot is uncovered. Earlier, the \u2018car wash\u2019 scandal had exposed deep-rooted corruption in the political system, which led to the weakening of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party and the rise of the far-right. He should not allow the coup scandal to further fracture the country\u2019s polity and erode the legitimacy of its democratic system.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBrazil\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\ncorruption & bribery",

The meaning of right or wrong, just or unjust, even traditional or modern, keeps shifting in new directions. Consider that most enduring stratification, patriarchy. Its look has been changing decade by decade, let alone century by century. Male domination could hardly remain impervious to young Indian women\u2019s literacy rising from 40% to 96% since 1981. A society undergoing such momentous changes wears out older laws at express pace. Like India\u2019s new criminal law codes, this is the most welcome quality of the Uttarakhand UCC bill. To meet needs of society as they are, rather than as they were. But such legislations need revision wherever they suffer tone deafness. Particularly to young people\u2019s thinking, living, doing.\n\nA lot of this dissonance is centred around assertions of individuality. Marriage is seen as being in service of family, live-in relationships are not. Why doesn\u2019t Uttarakhand govt feel the need to properly justify its plan to aggressively track live-in relationships, even though this is unprecedented? Because it is assumed that all parents will tacitly consent and clap. Lawmakers and judges are often only loyal to parents\u2019 generations. Their jobs require them to be much more open. Young people are pulling away from past scripts to write uncharted stories. Old headed institutions are made anxious by this confident adventurism. But while greybeards\u2019 entrenched power can inflict setback after setback on young \u2019uns, there is no stopping this tide. They will keep pursuing legalisation of gay marriage, criminalisation of marital rape, surrogacy rights for singletons, mandatory paternal leave, unsurveilled live-in relationships. Yes, the young lack the political heft of usual identity-based mobilisations. Yes, they don\u2019t threaten other people\u2019s life or property. They only challenge worldviews. Like income taxpayers, 3% of whom contribute to 48% of total collection, they have no vote-value. And yet, disregarding young people\u2019s voices is a giant socioeconomic self-goal.\nHow will young people chained up by past social mores, individual desires bent to bygone codes, live up to their potential? That\u2019s why it\u2019s in urgent national interest that lawmakers be guided by what Supreme Court said in its landmark Right to Privacy judgment. State should not intrude upon a citizen\u2019s personal liberty. In fact, protection of liberty is one of state\u2019s key remits. State isn\u2019t Papa. In any case, Papa doesn\u2019t know best.

Key question: why\u2019s there a huge demand for cheating\nStudents who spend years preparing for govt exams truly feel cheated when some fellow candidates cheat. GOI has tried to address this growing problem with a new bill, cleared by Lok Sabha on Feb 5.\nSevere punishment |\u00a0Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act 2024 sets store on deterrence through harsh punishments. Offences under this legislation are cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. In design, it\u2019s on par with legislations dealing with grave crimes.\n\nAll about supply |\u00a0Cheating in exams needs to be understood from both demand and supply sides. GOI\u2019s bill focuses exclusively on supply side. Punishments are all aimed at collusions and disruptions that may facilitate cheating. That\u2019s necessary but not sufficient.\nDemand measures |\u00a0Students are absent from bill\u2019s provisions. They are buyers of dodgy services that lead to exam malpractice. It\u2019s likely that anti-cheating law sidesteps addressing demand issues because core problems are beyond its scope.\nCraze for govt jobs |ASER 2023 survey of rural students threw up insightful results about their aspirations. Most popular choices among boys were army and police posts. Police was a popular choice amongst girls too. ASER survey showed that underlying virtually all responses were students\u2019 assumption that good jobs are only to be found in govt institutions.\nQuality matters |\u00a0But govt jobs are a small fraction of total jobs. But student responses showed they are preferred because they offer job security and pension, and command \u2018social respect\u2019. This feeds into a huge coaching ecosystem and eventually creates demand for clearing exams \u2013 and for means to cheat exam systems.\nSo, this bill may deter cheating to an extent but it\u2019s unlikely to really dent it.

        "full_article": "Though insurance coverage cushions a person or business against financial shock, especially during crisis time, yet its penetration in Bangladesh is on the decline. Put simply, insurance penetration is measured as a percentage of total premiums collected to a country's gross domestic product (GDP), where the insurance premium is the amount of money an individual or a business must pay to obtain an insurance policy that covers the policyholder's investment, healthcare, life, home, etc.According to an estimate, insurance penetration in the country came down to 0.40 per cent in 2022, from 0.55 per cent in 2018. That was undoubtedly low according to global standards. This poor rate of insurance penetration in the country is generally attributed to the public's lack of awareness about the importance of the service. But in many cases, it is also due to a lack of public trust in the service, which has to do with the poor performance of some companies or even fraudulent practice on the part of their agents when it comes to providing the proceeds to the policyholders. As a result, as some estimates hold, in the case of life insurance, the penetration has almost halved in the past decade. This is indeed ironical when the country boasts 81 insurance companies (35 life insurance and 46 non-life ones). Interestingly, with more than eight times the population of Bangladesh, India has only 57 insurance companies, while Malaysia with a trillion-dollar economy has only 17.Evidently, Bangladesh has more insurance companies than it needs leading to undue competitions and performance anomalies. So, when all these negative aspects are factored into the estimation, it is not hard to understand the progressive decline of insurance penetration in the country. Oddly enough, even as penetration is dropping, premium earnings from both life and non-life insurance policies have, reportedly, been growing over the years. As could be gathered, the report on the development came out at a recent presentation made before the financial institutions division of the finance ministry. There it was told that the premium growth was 10.71 per cent in 2018 and excepting a falling trend in the pandemic-stricken years, it again started to gather pace rising to a 9.56 per cent growth in 2021 followed by 10.6 per cent in 2022. Considering the continued negative growth on the country's insurance penetration front vis-\u00e0-vis the rising trend in premium growth though dichotomous, it becomes evident that the insurance industry is falling behind the GDP growth at a faster rate. Notably, the country's GDP, which stood at Tk29.5 trillion in the FY 2017-18 grew to Tk44.44 trillion in the FY23. The point is how to reduce the gap. The responsibility, of course, falls on the industry's regulatory body, the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA). Going by a recent report carried by this paper, it is good to learn that IDRA is actively pursuing to build the sector's positive image before the public. It is important at this point to identify the insurance companies involved in questionable dealings with clients and rid the industry of those bad elements. Given the IDRA data that compared to 2010 when life insurance penetration was 0.94 per cent, in 2021 it dropped to 0.5 per cent, it only points to the fact that public awareness of and trust in the insurance service is now at its nadir. Understandably, to rebuild the image of the insurance service, the challenges ahead are enormous. The industry leaders and the sector's regulator should take note of it.",

        "full_article": "The decision to slash incentives to exporters has kicked up a hornet's nest. The various chambers of commerce and the different associations of readymade apparel companies (RMG) have joined together to raise the issue with the finance minister. Their principal argument against withdrawal of the facility is that Bangladesh still has two years to go before LDC (least developed country) graduation, i.e., when such incentives will have to go anyway. So, why reduce it drastically? Why not withdraw it in several phases at nominal rates to cushion industries at a critical time? There is some merit in such line of thinking. One example of how a sudden decision taken by the ministry of finance during the last fiscal year (and how that seriously slashed government earning) was the disastrous decision to double the land registration rate. No one could figure out why the ministry had taken such a decision in the first place. Instead of magically boosting revenue it dipped to ridiculously low levels. Today, people simply do not register land or fixed assets when there is a change of ownership. Revenues are down manifold. People and business entities have found loopholes in the system and it is business as usual.Getting back to the issue at hand, the government has taken a broad sword and cut incentives for almost all export items. According to a report published in this newspaper, the decision is due to be effective as of January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024. There is no denying the fact that the largest contributor to exports is dominated by a single sector, i.e., RMG which also happens to be the largest employer. With millions of workers, the vast majority of whom are women have been a game changer when it comes to women empowerment in this country and despite all the flak the industry receives on the issue of low wages it pays its workers, it remains a major employer in the country.The government has its own set of arguments not without merit. However, the fact is that the industry has been battling a slew of issues together and is increasingly becoming unprofitable. Those issues need to be taken into cognizance by the government. As pointed out by a certain chamber president, business houses have to deal with an upward adjustment of interest rates on loans, slashing of exporters' retention quota by 50 per cent, customs difficulties, etc. Could the decision by the government to go hard line on the issue be based on something else entirely? One simply cannot wish away certain uncomfortable truths. For instance, the one revolving around trade-based mis-invoicing - a rampant malpractice that is costing the national exchequer billions in uncollected taxes and precious foreign exchange because a significant portion of foreign currency earned by exporters simply do not come back to the country. This is a widely prevalent malpractice that has been going on for decades and one that has paid for entire posh neighbourhoods in foreign countries (2nd and 3rd homes), lavish lifestyles in-country, fancy cars, fancy trips to the French Riviera, the Bahamas and what not. A recent report in media has been making the rounds. Apparently, an investigation by customs intelligence has found an exporter mis-labelling containers of apparels being exported in connivance with some unscrupulous officials. The incident came to light during an investigation and the two containers' shipment was halted. The misdeclaration, had it gone through would have allowed for the exporter to launder a few hundred thousand dollars. If that is the case, imagine what has been happening on the export side where tens of thousands of such containers are being shipped to overseas markets every year. There is no exact figure on how many billions of dollars have been siphoned off by exporters in this country. The Global Financial Integrity (GFI) report that comes out every year only records and reports a fraction of the illicit trade practices around the globe. As pointed out by GFI's 'Illicit Financial Flows to and from 148 Developing Countries: 2006-2015', \"trade misinvoicing is a method of moving IFFs, and includes the deliberate misrepresentation of the value of imports or exports in order to evade customs duties and VAT taxes, launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to hide offshore the proceeds of legitimate trade transactions, among other motivations.\" The illicit outflow through trade mis-invoicing stood at around $6.0 billion during the stated period and economists put this estimate to be a fraction of the real figure. Hence when one looks at the bigger picture from policy level, the decision to take corrective action makes sense. However, given that businesses and industry are facing multiple issues on various fronts that have raised cost of production, a phase-by-phase reduction in incentive should be considered.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The piece of news is disappointing. Most of the graduates from the departments of Urdu and Sanskrit, coupled with Persian language and literature and Pali and Buddhist studies, cannot communicate in these languages. Only a few of them are eligible to read and write fluently, and still fewer are good at speaking. The depressing situation has sparked debate about the necessity of operating these departments in three public universities--- Dhaka, Rajshahi and Chottogram. Suggestions are already there to close these departments or merge with language institute. When the journey of the University of Dhaka started in 1921, one of the departments was 'Persian and Urdu.' It was a vibrant department for many years thanks to the presence of some eminent scholars of Persian and Urdu languages and literature. A good number of students also graduated from the department in later decades who had a good command of both languages and engaged in literary activities and research. In course of time, the demand for the languages diminished, and the attraction of the department also started to be marginalised. Nevertheless, in 2006, Persian and Urdu were separated into two independent departments. Again, the Department of Sanskrit, named initially as Sanskritic Studies and Sanskrit and Bengali, was also established in 1921. In 1970, Sanskrit became separated from Bengali, and the department was renamed the Department of Sanskrit and Pali. In 2007, two independent departments emerged: one is Sanskrit, and the other is Pali and Buddhist Studies.These four departments are for higher studies in these languages and literature rather than to provide primary teaching. So, it requires students to have adequate basic knowledge and command of these languages. Due to the flawed admission process, those who do not have any knowledge of these languages become undergraduate students and struggle to cope with higher studies. The outcome is graduates without the necessary skills in these languages. They take the admission to become students of Dhaka University only. Having no job opportunities, they also deploy themselves to other works instead of paying attention to study and trying to pass out. Teachers, also finding no alternative, allow students to write answers in Bangla in examinations. The need for well-qualified teachers is also there. Thus, the four departments become unproductive, although they should not. Winding up the departments is also not the solution, and the authorities need to think of various alternatives like merging the Urdu and Persian departments together as well as Sanskrit and Pali departments, reducing the number of seats for undergraduate candidates, and introducing basic language courses for freshmen. Again, a voluminous number of books, manuscripts, journals and notes in Arabic, Persian and Urdu are preserved in the libraries of public universities. These valuable resources are largely unused or unexplored, mainly due to a lack of interest and necessary support. Graduates from these departments may be engaged to study the materials under the guidance of professors and experts. Later, books and journals may be selected for translation in Bangla. Universities should provide necessary support by acquiring funds from government and private organisations. These libraries also preserve a large number of manuscripts written in Sanskrit language. These are, no doubt, rare collections. Translating some of these will be good work. Teachers and students of the Sanskrit department may do the work with necessary patronage to back up the effort. Though the relevance of these languages has reduced significantly over time, these departments are part of history and heritage of the university and the country. So, preserving the heritage and using the resources productively are essential. Moreover, extensive collaboration with the countries where these languages are widely functioning may open a window of opportunity. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Generational diversity is beneficial and can assist organisations in hiring employees with the required skills, engaging them in proper job roles, and maintaining a talent pool.As people are working longer and more young people are joining the workforce, generational diversity in the workplace is becoming a challenging issue for HR departments to manage. Working with people from different age groups creates certain dilemmas, such as seniority in the workplace, transparency of information, attitudes toward technology, and customisation.A workforce that comprises a mix of energetic youth, diverse mindsets, and skilled and experienced seniors requires open communication channels to bridge generational differences. Failure to understand each other's contexts could lead to misunderstandings among employees, resulting in discord and soured relations.Applying tailored solutions to any emerging issues may resolve the problem and improve workplace empathy. DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) strategies need to be more focused on maintaining the unity of a diverse workforce where each employee feels valued.
