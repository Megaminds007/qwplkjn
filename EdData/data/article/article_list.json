        "full_article": "Indian households find themselves yet again struggling to cope with a sharp surge in the prices of essential kitchen staples \u2014 ranging from tomatoes, onions and potatoes to tur dal and rice. Tomato prices have more than doubled month-on-month with the all-India average retail price as on June 29 soaring to \u20b953.59 a kilogram, from \u20b924.37 on May 29, data from the Consumer Affairs Department\u2019s Price Monitoring Division show. And while the rise in onion and potato prices over the same one-month period is a seemingly far more benign 7.5% and 4.5%, respectively, the overall trajectory in price gains across the wider food basket is symptomatic of the unsettling build-up of underlying inflation pressures in the economy. For instance, the price of tur dal, a key protein source in the diets of vegetarian households, continues to keep rising; it had climbed 7.8% month-on-month to \u20b9130.75 a kilogram on June 29, as per the government\u2019s data. Official retail inflation data for May, released earlier this month, had shown that prices of pulses, which includes tur dal, had quickened by 128 basis points year-on-year to a 31-month high of 6.56%. The government\u2019s imposition of stock limits on urad and tur on June 2 seems to have so far done little to cool price gains in lentils.To be sure there is a seasonality component to the prices of farm produce and their supply is largely determined by factors including timing of the harvest and the prices prevailing at the mandis when the farmers transport their crop to the markets. Just last month, tomato growers in rural Maharashtra had dumped sizeable quantities of their produce on the roads after being offered unremunerative prices. However, prices of several of these food items, including tomatoes, are still substantially higher than even the same time last year with the modal daily weighted average arrival prices at the mandis as per the government\u2019s agmarket website revealing tomato prices almost tripled year-on-year to \u20b95,579 a quintal as on June 29. The same arrival price data show a 35% jump in tur dal and a 19% increase in common paddy (rice). With the monsoon rains 13% in deficit so far this year, and the outlook for spatial and temporal distribution in the coming months clouded with uncertainty by the El Ni\u00f1o, there is a real risk that food prices could cause retail inflation to accelerate again. Policymakers need to walk the talk and retain laser focus on taming inflation. After all, as the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s economists noted in the latest bulletin, \u201cthe path to high but sustainable inclusive growth has to be paved by price stability\u201d.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nAgriculture\n\n/\n\nMaharashtra\n\n/\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

But none of these developments dented the public perception about Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the 55-year-old conservative leader whose centre-right New Democracy had a resounding victory in the June 25 parliamentary elections. This was the second election in Greece in less than two months. In May, New Democracy emerged as the single largest party but was short of securing an absolute majority. In the second vote, held under a different electoral system, Mr. Mitsotakis\u2019s party won 40.55% of the votes or 158 seats in the 300-member Parliament, while the main Opposition Syriza secured 18% votes (48 seats). The centre-left PASOK, which once dominated Greek politics, ended up with 12% votes (32 seats), while the newly formed far-right Spartans, which has been endorsed by Ilias Kasidiaris, an imprisoned former leader of the fascist Golden Dawn, made a surprise entry into Parliament with 4.6% of the vote.Mr. Mitsotakis, who came to power in 2019, ran a campaign focused on his policies aimed at economic recovery, his government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis in Europe. Greece\u2019s economic recovery is still an ongoing story. After the depression and acute debt crisis of the 2010s, which pushed the country to the brink of exiting the eurozone, Greece has seen stable growth in recent years (now above the EU average). Investment and exports have improved, thanks to EU funds, and its credit is close to regaining an investment grade credit rating. GDP, despite its high growth rate, is still 20% smaller than in 2008, before the global financial and debt crisis. Mr. Mitsotakis\u2019s biggest achievement and promise was relative economic stability. He blended his message with a hardline immigrant policy that often saw authorities sending asylum seekers back to Turkey (the Greek coast guard was also blamed for not doing enough to avert the boat tragedy), and a tough foreign policy that kept tensions with Turkey in the Aegean Sea high. This conservative nationalism helped him emerge as Greece\u2019s most powerful politician since the economic crisis. Mr. Mitsotakis should now make bold decisions in the economic and social realms. He has to continue the journey of economic recovery and also get back the country\u2019s investment grade credit rating. But he should also take a more humanitarian view of asylum seekers and improve the overall relationship with Turkey to reduce geopolitical tensions.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nrefugee\n\n/\n\nTurkey",

        "full_article": "The southwest monsoon on June 28 was 16% below normal, following both a rapid advance and heavy precipitation in the second fortnight of the month. This development, however, is tempered by three other aspects that cloud the outlook for agricultural output and food inflation. As the monsoon began to pick up pace, the market for some vegetables witnessed a surge in prices \u2013 tomato prices are hitting headlines now. While the surge is on account of events prior to the monsoon, it does highlight the inadequacy of using the average seasonal rainfall to gauge the impact of farm output and inflation. GOI\u2019s weighted average price for tomato arrivals across markets on June 26 showed that at Rs 4,011/quintal, it was 66% higher than a year ago. Among the factors that led to this surge are unusually high temperatures and pest attacks three months ago.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of the higher level of risk farmers now bear on account of extreme climate events.\nThe other two intertwined aspects that lead to uncertainty are the El Nino phenomenon and the prospect for paddy. El Nino is a climate pattern that comes from unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It can lead to both a reduction in rainfall here as well as disturb its distribution. This is an El Nino year. RBI in a study last week concluded El Nino years are generally ones where agricultural output is adversely affected. The biggest risk it poses is to paddy, the most important crop of the kharif season. On June 23, paddy acreage was 35% lower than last year following the delay in the monsoon\u2019s onset. Add to this a relatively low rice stock with GOI. In June, the central pool stock of rice was 26. 2 million tonnes, the lowest level in five years. The size of GOI\u2019s stock influences price expectations. In this context, it\u2019s pertinent that on June 26, the weighted average market price of paddy arrivals had risen 9% year-on-year.\nThe other point, especially for vegetables, is that India\u2019s cold chain infrastructure is not expanding fast enough. Cold chains can offset higher climatic risks by reducing wastage and price volatility in perishables. Monsoons remain a potential source of supply shocks and the best way to insulate the economy is to upgrade infrastructure.\n\n",

What\u2019s different in this case is the context \u2013 a much-publicised joint press conference of two heads of governments of the two largest democracies where Siddiqui asked the Indian PM a question on minority rights and free speech.

And if they do face intimidation, all stakeholders in a democracy must condemn such behaviour, no matter which side of the political divide the harassers seem to belong to.

IMD has called for a normal monsoon despite the forecasts of an El Nino.\nEl Nino tends to produce a deficit monsoon but only about 60% of the time. Many compensating effects exist and the monsoon also tends to have its own mind.\nEl Nino is already born in the tropical Pacific.

Since Eid-ul-Azha involves a lot of activities and preparations for both individuals and institutions, it is important that all of us do our part so that the spirit of the festival can be upheld.\nThere are three aspects that deserve particular attention.

Also, why would government institutions take supplies from it if they do not need them, and also at inflated prices? Clearly, the CMSD has been conducting these illegal activities with help from inside the hospitals, which must be looked into.\nOur health sector has been riddled with corruption for long.

        "full_article": "Do you feel, whenever the realms of books and bureaucracy converge, that something very non-bibliophilic is about to happen? I do, and my instincts tend to be accurate. After all, it is bureaucracy that is largely responsible for restricting the free flow of ideas and undermining academic freedom in Bangladesh. It is bureaucracy that punishes critical publications. It is bureaucracy that compromises the integrity of school textbooks through undue additions or omissions. It is bureaucracy that has reduced the quest for knowledge to a quest for BCS jobs. It is bureaucracy that has robbed the spirit of our Language Movement by marginalising mother languages \u2013 including Bangla. It is because of bureaucracy that once-revered state awards for writers are now objects of ridicule.\nI can go on and on about the detrimental effects of bureaucracy on the world of literary endeavours, but you get the point. There is something about the intertwining of paperwork, protocols and politics that can lead to a tragic loss in translation. As grand visions and initiatives of the government are filtered through layers of bureaucracy, they emerge altered, diluted, or even entirely lost.\nTake, for example, the case of Jatiya Grantha Kendro, or National Book Centre. Few people are perhaps aware that there is a specific government institution responsible for overseeing non-government libraries. There can be any number of reasons for its relative lack of familiarity. If I had to guess, I would say it's because this is how those in charge of it want it to be \u2013 less known, less scrutinised.\u00a0\nFor there is a lot about this institution that, bureaucrats would hope, is better left buried under the rug. As per a recent report by this daily, the centre, since its establishment following the enactment of the National Book Centre Act, 1995, has been consistently failing to fulfil its mandate due to poor infrastructure, a shortage of manpower and resources, and lack of care and planning. There it goes again: the bureaucratic mechanism being an Achilles' heel in literary initiatives. Everything about the centre is thus ill-conceived and poorly executed, ranging from the shabby, largely nondescript building in which it is housed, to its lack of promotional activities, to the way it engages with the recipients of its annual grants.\nIts pathetic state is perhaps best reflected in the management of its own library, which has over 11,000 books, including many rare reference materials. However, as the librarian himself admits, there hasn't been a visitor looking for books in years! What is a library for, then? To read newspapers? To play host to BCS crazies? To collect books (and dust)? The disorganised arrangement of the books in this library, with stacks of old newspapers and rare books piled haphazardly in dark corners, would be an eyesore to any bibliophile. The authorities couldn't archive them systematically, let alone digitise them, even after 28 years of its establishment.\n\nIt was only in 2018 that the government started to observe the National Library Day, on February 5. Given how the day is observed \u2013 through issuing a circular, some discussion, maybe a procession if someone is feeling outdoorsy \u2013 you cannot help but see \"perfunctory\" written all over it.\nIn addition to the poor management of its library, the centre is also being hamstrung by various problems in its handling of non-government libraries. For one, the financial assistance given to the listed libraries is woefully insufficient. The annual allocations \u2013 divided into categories A, B, and C \u2013 barely cover a couple of months' operational costs for them, leaving them financially strained. The bureaucratic hurdles involved in accessing the funds further compound their difficulties. There are also allegations of favouritism and lack of quality control when it comes to giving them books. Often, substandard books on political and administrative issues, written by ruling party leaders and bureaucrats, dominate the offerings, while books of diverse genres and perspectives are ignored. We have seen the same thing happening in August 2022 when a book reading programme for government officials included over a hundred books written by 25 high officials. Why select books that no one in the four hemispheres would want to read?\nAll this is quite hard to accept because the National Book Centre could be a vital player in building a strong library culture in the country, as is its mandate. Private libraries, built through voluntary initiatives all over the country, give us hope amid the deteriorating state of most public libraries. They have challenges of their own, of course, especially in terms of finances, quality of services and book collection. In this digital era, they also suffer from the prevailing apathy towards books. But their very existence is a defiant counterpoint to this situation. And with proper assistance and guidance, they could be moulded into genuine drivers of change in local communities.\nAlthough any private initiative must ultimately depend on its own strength for survival, government oversight, and grants, if properly distributed and followed up on, can help in a big way. Such assistance must be provided with a genuine interest in promoting a culture of reading and intellectual engagement among people, especially the younger generation. This interest is precisely what is lacking now. It was only in 2018 that the government started to observe the National Library Day, on February 5. Given how the day is observed \u2013 through issuing a circular, some discussion, maybe a procession if someone is feeling outdoorsy \u2013 you cannot help but see \"perfunctory\" written all over it. It almost seems as if bureaucrats merely wanted to tick a box. It makes them look good, and feel useful, except it is of no use in a practical sense. No change to our troubled interaction with books was sought, none achieved.\u00a0\nWhy should we read? Because books \u2013 the right kind of books \u2013 can educate, inspire, and transform. It is not for nothing that the pen is believed to be mightier than the sword. But don't expect much when bureaucrats wield their pens to shape the destiny of literary initiatives. Their ability to complicate the simplest of decisions, their blunders and misplaced priorities, and their interest in preserving the prevailing politico-administrative status quo can derail even the noblest of efforts. A reader-friendly environment that helps to think and critically engage is not in their best interest.\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n",

We urge the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the irregularities done by the CMSD in connivance with public hospitals, and identify those responsible for such a waste of public money.\n",
