        "full_article": "A few years back, a reputed non-governmental think tank in Europe saw its sad demise after more than two decades of operation. The organisation gained prominence by working on globally important issues and by attracting a pool of experts from around the world. As a result, it was also able to draw the attention of several donors for funding its activities. Many South Asian experts had the opportunity to work with the organisation. The think tank also successfully brought international policymakers on board while discussing issues that affect larger communities, including the global South. So, the closure of the organisation was unfortunate. But what was more unfortunate was the reason for the shutdown. It was closed after the revelation of massive financial irregularities of its founding leader\u2014a person who earned fame as an organisation builder and advocate of a just global order. An inquiry into the organisation found that he was taking an abnormally high salary and benefits, paying for personal travels with office funds, and employing relatives in the office without informing the governing body, among many other allegations.\nThe reason for citing this example is that civil society organisations (CSOs) around the world have a challenge to play their role with integrity and sincerity. They are under the radar, not only of the government but of everyone else in society as they are engaged in scrutinising the activities of others, particularly policymakers. Clearly, if they are pinpointing limitations of policies and actions of other actors, and suggesting improvements\u2014they themselves have to be on a strong moral footing by being transparent at the highest level.\u00a0\u00a0\nBangladesh has a rich history of vibrant CSOs which have come into existence over the years. Broadly, these organisations include policy-oriented think tanks, private development organisations, issue-based advocacy groups, voluntary community-based organisations, and service delivery organisations. The range of their activities is also diverse\u2014these non-governmental, non-profit and non-partisan organisations work on issues that cover economic, social, political, and cultural areas. While promoting various causes in these four broad areas, they focus on raising awareness on public policies and programmes. They also engage themselves in influencing the design, implementation, and management of public policies and programmes. A large number of such CSOs in Bangladesh are funded by foreign donors.\nSome CSOs in Bangladesh have gained good reputations and respect for successfully advocating issues of public interest and diligently following up on the implementation of public policies. However, examples of similar stories of CSOs as mentioned above are not uncommon too. The accountability of CSOs regularly comes under inspection, the findings sometimes leading to a negative image of CSOs. This makes the task of credible CSOs difficult, particularly at a time when the space for CSOs for undertaking their activities is shrinking.\nActivities of CSOs are rarely appreciated by the government of the day. As these organisations raise the appropriateness of certain policies, the effectiveness of actions, the quality of various government services, and flag the issue of governance attached to its initiatives, the government mostly takes a defensive position. At certain points, such a defensive role ends up in imposition of stringent regulations on CSO activities, making it difficult for them to work meaningfully.\nThe curtailment of the breadth of their work also affects the people for whom they work\u2014the voiceless marginalised people with limited or no opportunity to change their lives for betterment. The broader objective of CSO activities is to have a society based on equity and justice. Therefore, CSO activities are in fact complementary to what the government does. There is no conflict between the objectives of these two actors.\u00a0\nWhile the space for CSOs to work must be upheld for making development and democracy meaningful and rewarding for each and every citizen of the country, the accountability of CSOs themselves is critically important. Unfortunately, at times there are reports which do not match with the stated objective and spirit of CSOs. The cause for which they fight is absent in many organisations. If CSOs want to make their engagement with policymakers and communities constructive, their own credibility must be established first. Among several issues, the three most important ones are highlighted below.\nFirst, the internal governance of some organisations is weak and designed in a way to serve the interests of the founders and leaders of these CSOs. A lack of robust administrative and governance structure helps to pursue such objectives and change of leadership is extremely rare in several of these organisations. The heads of the institute\u2014usually the founders\u2014hold onto the position for an indefinite or a long period of time as it is perceived to be their right. The excuse given is the absence of any replacement for the position, which is flawed. Of course, there is a shortage of skilled human resources in Bangladesh. Moreover, CSOs are not considered the most sought-after sector among job-seekers. However, there is also less interest among CSOs themselves to find and groom prospective future leaders for the organisation. Sometimes, leadership is transferred to the next generation of family members\u2014just like in private businesses.\nIn certain organisations, which have attempted to establish a system of leadership change, the shadow leadership of previous top officials haunts the new leaders as the former continue to interfere in organisational decisions. There is a peculiar system to accommodate the old guard in the mainstream activities of the organisations which undermines independent management and the decision-making process. The idea of taking an advisory role and contributing to the organisation is unusual among CSO leaders.\nSecond, the lack of a strong financial system gives rise to questions about the financial integrity of some organisations. Audit by reputed firms and independent internal audits are the basic requirements for establishing transparency on financial matters. Organisations sometimes shy away from financial best practices as it might reveal many wrongdoings. Often, salaries and perquisites of the founding and long-lasting leaders are fixed by themselves and at their own will\u2014their taste for high living ignores organisational policies.\nThird, the role of the governing bodies of the organisation is also critical. CSOs are\u00a0 usually governed by a board consisting of respected persons in the country. However, at times, the overseeing mechanism does not work well due to low commitment of the board members. Some members only want to be associated with CSOs for self-gratification and name recognition. Some organisations also like to upgrade their image by including big names, but who may not necessarily add real value to the organisation in terms of improving its governance. Ironically, for some organisations, this could be a blessing as they do not want the board to interfere\u2014not only because it can become a pain for the management to run the organisation if the board gets involved in day-to-day affairs, but also because the CSO officials do not want the board to learn about acts which violate the rules. Indeed, maintaining a fine balance between diligently overseeing the governance of the organisation and not interfering in the daily operation of the organisation requires not only skills but also the right attitude of the governing body.\nThe credibility of an organisation is built over a long period but is destroyed through a small mistake. It sets examples for others. Therefore, CSOs have to continue their arduous journey of advocating for accountable and transparent public policies and programmes by setting good examples for themselves.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun is the Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue.\nViews expressed in this article are personal.\n",

        "full_article": "Around the world, the issue of human rights due diligence in global supply chains is rapidly rising up the agenda. But what does this mean and how will it impact garment manufacturers in Bangladesh?\nFor many years, fashion brands and retailers have been implementing their own, internal human rights and corporate social responsibility policies. These are designed to ensure that their garment suppliers and workers are treated fairly, paid appropriate minimum wages and so on.\nYet it has become clear that such policies are proving to be not always effective at addressing key human rights issues. Some fashion brands have very strong CSR policies and collaborate closely with their suppliers, while others are weak in this area. The industry needs a level playing field.\nThus, in the past five years, we have seen a shift towards binding laws around human rights due diligence, both at an individual country level and also at a broader level\u2014such as within the European Union.\nLast year, for instance, members of the European Parliament urged the European Union to push forward with rules on mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence in EU companies' global supply chains. They called for the EU to join United Nations negotiations for a binding treaty on business and human rights which, they say, \"reflects the EU's own assessment that voluntary measures have failed to prevent companies from committing human rights violations and environmental harms, or hold them accountable for harm.\"\nLater this year will see the introduction of legislation on mandatory sustainable due diligence for companies as part of the EU Commission's 2021 work plan and the European Green Deal.\nIndividual countries are also acting. The French Corporate Duty of Vigilance Law places the onus on large companies in France to identify and prevent risks to human rights and the environment that could occur as a result of their business activities in supply chains. These activities can include those of the company itself, of their suppliers or subcontractors, of companies they control and more. The law, in brief, requires companies to create and implement publicly-available vigilance plans for which they can be held accountable.\nIt is important to note that fashion brands, our customers, are also supportive of human rights due diligence proposals. Last year, ASOS\u2014a major buyer from Bangladesh\u2014called for the implementation of mandatory human rights due diligence legislation in the UK in order to strengthen the 2015 Modern Slavery Act (the UK's own due diligence legislation for supply chains).\nWhat does this all mean for us as manufacturers?\nThere are several issues to consider here. Firstly, human rights due diligence legislation will mean that buyers need to become increasingly vigilant as far as supply chains are concerned. I expect a \"fight to safety\" by which I mean brands and retailers will move toward suppliers that are best in class.\nThe reason for this is that they could potentially face falling foul of the law in their own country\u2014and face hefty fines\u2014if violations are uncovered in their supply chains.\nThis, in turn, has major implications for RMG suppliers. They will be under increased scrutiny from brands to have systems and processes in place to ensure workers are being properly treated. This includes issues such as health and safety, wages, general worker rights. I expect brands could become increasingly vigilant in terms of audits to ensure suppliers are meeting expected requirements on these issues. Remember, brands will not want to expose themselves to risk here for it could land them in legal hot water. If there is a risk that a supplier may fail to meet expectations around human rights due diligence, that supplier faces losing out on business\u2014the brand will simply shop elsewhere. That, I believe, is the harsh reality.\nThe other issue is one of transparency. Transparency is a central mechanism by which the fashion industry is seeking to gain greater control and oversight of global supply chains. In some cases, this means simply having a list of suppliers on their websites (this can be first or second tier suppliers, or sometimes even beyond).\nThe requirement for due diligence very much ties in with the transparency agenda. In the west, more and more consumers are demanding to know about the conditions in which their garments were made\u2014regular surveys of consumers bear this out. They are shopping with fashion brands which can show them this. Bangladesh has to be ahead of the game on this issue.\nI expect the fashion industry to further clamp down on this issue as regulations around due diligence become the norm over the next 18 months.\nMy takeaway point from all of this is that the RMG sector in Bangladesh should view human rights due diligence regulations as an opportunity to cement our place as a trusted partner of the global fashion sector.\nWe have made great progress on worker rights and\u2014mentioning no names\u2014I would certainly say some are ahead of most of our competitors in this area. So, let's embrace due diligence regulations as an opportunity to further improve the way we do business on the global stage.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin is the Managing Director of Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of our great independence. As a sovereign nation, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in economic growth, poverty reduction, life expectancy, the human development index, and many other social development indicators in the recent past. By keeping this momentum continuing, Bangladesh is also advancing towards fulfilling the Global Agenda 2030 with the theme \"Leaving No One Behind\".\nBut how far we have achieved the concerned goals and targets for our marginalised people, like our country's indigenous communities, is another question. They are not big in numbers compared to the total population, only around two percent, but they nevertheless deserve development and all basic rights that are enshrined in the national constitution. These communities also sacrificed their lives for the independence of the country, as did other citizens.\nIf we see government statements on indigenous peoples' situation\u2014that the government is doing everything possible for the betterment of marginalised groups like indigenous peoples\u2014and compare it to the reality, they would not add up. So far, through its 15th amendment of the Constitution the government has recognised indigenous peoples as \"tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities\". This is a positive development on part of the government as it recognises the identity of these marginalised groups. Further, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs has amended the controversial list of ethnic communities that was included in the Small Ethnic Groups Cultural Institution Act of 2010 and corrected it, as recommended by a National Advisory Committee. Now, 50 indigenous groups are officially recognised in the country.\nAnother remarkable step from the government was to introduce school textbooks in five indigenous languages to facilitate mother tongue based primary education as stipulated in the National Education Policy. Also, signing the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Accord of 1997 (popularly known as the \"Peace Accord\") was another bold step to facilitating development, peace, and harmony in the southeastern part of the country, by establishing a kind of power-sharing mechanism with the indigenous and local people of the CHT. In the 50 years since independence, these are significant developments for the rights of the country's indigenous peoples.\nHowever, if we observe the situation of indigenous peoples critically we will see the harsh realities in their lives. Indigenous communities, with their distinct languages, traditions, cultures, values, and customs, contribute significantly to the beauty, development, and sustainability of the country. Their contribution, manifested in all the elements that make up the country\u2014including in the war of independence\u2014in fact serves as its source of strength. Ironically, however, the overall situation of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh is decidedly poor. Like other parts of the world, indigenous peoples in Bangladesh are among the most disadvantaged, neglected, and vulnerable citizens in the country. They often face eviction from their ancestral lands in the name of development, tourism, bases of security forces, economic zones, eco-parks, national parks, and reserved forestland. Their lands are often taken away without their consent.\nThe best example of this kind of land grabbing is the construction of a luxury five-star hotel on Mro people's traditional land in the Chimbuk range of Bandarban hill district. The ancestral lands of the Mro people have been reportedly encroached jointly by a welfare trust and business corporate giant Sikder Group's R&R Holdings Ltd. The hotel and its accompanying modern recreational facilities\u2014including a dozen luxury villas, cable cars, and swimming pool\u2014will adversely affect an estimated 800-1,000 acres of land belonging to nearly 600 indigenous families. Some Mro families have already been evicted while others are under threat of losing their lands. Mro villagers as well as different national and international advocacy groups staged rallies and signed petitions addressing policymakers, including the prime minister, amidst the Covid-19 crisis. However, a positive response is yet to come from the authorities to address the matter. As a consequence, the affected Mro community is passing its days in great uncertainty. Similarly, indigenous peoples in Madhupur of Tangail district, the Khasi people in Moulvibazar district, and the Rakhaine people in Barguna-Patuakhali are living under threat of eviction due to government-declared reserved forest or their lands, including cremation grounds, being grabbed by local goons. As a result, these communities are facing uncertain times.\nApart from land issues, indigenous peoples are also vulnerable in terms of gender-based violence, climate change, extraction of natural resources, accessing government facilities, and even in political representation. As a result, some indigenous-inhabited regions lag behind in accessing education, healthcare services, and social safety net programmes. Even during the government's Covid-19 response programmes, many indigenous communities did not get any support as they live in remote areas and do not have representatives among those implementing these programmes. Therefore, they are still leading miserable lives with food shortages and lack of income. The ongoing countrywide Covid-19 vaccination programme is also not accessible for many indigenous communities due to their remoteness and lack of information and awareness.\nFor the people of the CHT now, the historic CHT Accord has turned into an illusion. Hope is now fading. The Accord is considered a constructive arrangement between indigenous peoples and the Bangladesh government. But even after 23 years, major issues of the Accord\u2014such as making the CHT Land Commission functional, devolution of power and functions to the CHT institutions, preservation of tribal area characteristics of the CHT region, demilitarisation, and rehabilitation of internally displaced people\u2014remain un-implemented. This is very frustrating for all indigenous peoples and their communities. We are observing how a state's promise is being violated and ignored.\nThe 8th Five Year Plan undertaken by the Bangladesh government for the period 2021-2025 also brought some other promises for the development of indigenous peoples of the country in sugar-coated words. With the theme \"Promoting Prosperity and Fostering Inclusiveness\", the plan rightly observed the vulnerable situation of the indigenous peoples (\"ethnic minorities\" as used by government) by stating: \"the ethnic communities in Bangladesh are the most deprived of economic, social, cultural and political rights, mainly due to their ethnic status. Ethnic identities are creating barriers to ethnic minority peoples' inclusion in wider social networks\u2026 the result is that ethnic people are socially isolated, with little access to mainstream economic and political spheres.\"\nAgainst this dire situation of indigenous peoples, the government proposed some strategic plans and commitments for the socio-economic and political rights, fundamental human rights, and social security of indigenous peoples, along with safeguards for their social, cultural, and traditional identities. The Five Year Plan also assured citizens that the rights to access education, healthcare, food and nutrition, employment, overseas employment, and protection of rights to land and other resources for indigenous peoples would be honoured. Furthermore, it mentions the formulation of a Perspective Plan for the development of the CHT through a consultative process with key stakeholders. It reiterates that the government will consider implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of 2007 and the ratification of the ILO Convention 169, among others. All these commitments are truly encouraging for all of us.\nWe have stepped into the sixth year of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, indigenous peoples are still invisible in SDG implementation processes. If we really want to fulfil the government's promises for the true development of the indigenous peoples in the country, we need to bring them on board and ensure their meaningful engagement in all development programmes. Their voices need to be heard and their issues need to be addressed without further delay. Without their active participation, it is not possible to narrow the gaps and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To bring them into the development process, including for the realisation of their political rights, as those currently the furthest behind to where they should be now, requires a strong social contract among all stakeholders. Otherwise, all these promises will remain on paper only and the essence of our great independence will be meaningless for the indigenous peoples of this land.\nPallab Chakma is the Executive Director of Kapaeeng Foundation.\n",

        "full_article": "Work, education, entertainment, or simply better connectivity all draw people to cities. By the end of this century around 85 percent of the world population are predicted to live in cities.\nThere are speculations that the Covid-19 pandemic will slow down this urbanisation trend, but I think it's unlikely to stop it.\nCities remain the primary location for job opportunities, education and cultural offers, and the continued rise in housing prices in many European cities over the past year indicates that city life is still high in demand.\nSome find this trend worrying, as\u2014globally\u2014urbanisation has worsened the climate crisis, and cities are often blamed for boosting energy consumption and carbon emissions.\nThe World Bank estimates that 80 percent of global GDP is produced in urban areas. This results in higher income, consumption and associated levels of emissions.\nIt is certain that a considerable share of the global carbon budget will be used up for building new infrastructure, particularly in fast-growing cities. Further emissions take place when cities expand and land use changes\u2014turning vegetation into city grounds.\nOn the other hand, cities cover only about 3 percent of the global land surface while, at present, accounting for 58 percent of the world's population. This compact structure can render emission savings linked to higher densities, connectivity, accessibility and land use. Copenhagen and Amsterdam, for instance, are great examples of cities that make good use of these compact structures and offer a low emission lifestyle.\nWhat's better for the climate?\nRural homes are surrounded by nature, but are often larger than urban houses or apartments and people who live in them require cars to get around. City homes are usually smaller and offer short distances, but also a world of shiny consumption goods, takeaway food and entertainment options\u2014at least in non-Covid times.\nBut what does this mean for individual carbon footprints: are they bigger in the city or in the countryside, if the income level is similar?\nTo answer this question, my colleague Pablo Munoz and I looked at the consumption patterns of more than 8,000 households in Austria. We clustered them into urban, semi-urban and rural areas, estimated their carbon footprints, and found that people in urban areas, on average, had the smallest carbon footprints.\nPeople in semi-urban areas had the biggest carbon footprints, with those in rural areas in between.\nThe main difference we found is that the city dwellers we analysed had lower direct emissions from transport, heating and cooking. They did have more indirect emissions, that is, emissions released upstream in the production chain\u2014by factories producing TVs for example.\nBut in total, we found that the emissions of urban dwellers were still comparatively low. Even when controlling for other socioeconomic factors including income, we found that people in semi-urban areas in Austria emit around 8 percent more CO2\u00a0than those in cities, and people in rural areas around 4 percent more.\nThis evidence that a city lifestyle is the least carbon intense in Austria is replicated by other studies for high-income countries in Europe (such as the UK and Finland).\nBut it doesn't mean that it applies to everywhere: research shows that urbanisation in low-income countries usually increases emissions.\nThis isn't to say we should discourage urbanisation in these countries. One of the principle reasons for this pattern is the income gap between urban and rural areas in these countries: higher urban incomes lead to more consumption and resulting emissions.\nIn high-income countries on the other hand, the urban-rural income gap is much smaller as consumption levels are high everywhere. So, in countries such as Austria or the UK, living in cities tends to be better for the climate, as dense living can reduce transport and heating emissions.\nCurse or cure\nDoes this mean that urbanisation is good or bad in the long run? There is no simple answer to this. The link between urbanisation and income, to take just one factor, is very complex.\nGlobally, we know that urbanisation has been a driver of higher emissions. But results like ours give hope that city life is the sustainable option after all, at least once countries reach a certain income level and when doing it right.\nKey to this is a strong commitment to climate action and implementing it fast. Governments around the globe should make best use of high densities, connectivity, accessibility and land in urban areas\u2014and plan cities and their surroundings in a smart and climate friendly way.\nBut efforts should not be limited to cities, given that semi-urban areas are the worst for emissions. This is especially true in light of increasing housing prices in cities and a post-Covid digitalised world, which make suburbs increasingly attractive for many of us.\nWays to decrease emissions are numerous: good public transport systems and bicycle routes, short distances to basic infrastructure, efficient buildings, and green heating and cooling systems are all proven ways of cutting carbon costs.\nIn addition, carbon pricing can create incentives for greener value chains and more sustainable consumption. When planning land use, rural-urban migration trends and other behavioural aspects should be taken into account.\nThe way urban and rural areas are designed will affect people's choices\u2014such as their preferred mode of transport\u2014and associated emissions.\nBut ultimately, we as individuals determine our own consumption patterns and our carbon footprint can be large or small, whether we live in the city or elsewhere.\n\u00a0\nSabrina Zwick is Research Associate at United Nations University.\nThis work was partially supported by the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund through the project \"Innovative climate policy instruments to reduce consumption-based emissions to complement territorial emission reduction efforts\".\nCopyright: Inter Press Service\n",

        "full_article": "To any casual observer, Saturday's daylong mass vaccination trial run\u2014meant to set the stage for a planned special vaccination campaign starting on August 14\u2014would appear as yet another exhibition of our failures to fashion a workable response against Covid-19. It was an operation poorly planned and executed\u2014there was no surprise there. According to our correspondents, people showed genuine enthusiasm to get vaccinated by spontaneously turning up at designated centres across the country. But there were just way more people than there were vaccines available. The whole exercise was marred by chaos, mismanagement and lack of coordination, as many centres ran out of doses two or three hours after vaccination began. In many places, people were seen standing in mile-long queues on roads, crowds jammed themselves into the centres, and protests and brawls broke out.\nIf the purpose of this exercise, as the health minister had earlier said, was to identify the problems of vaccine rollout and fix those before the main drive, it's evident that it will require a lot of fixing. Unfortunately, there is a lot to be done but not a lot of time to do it in. The trial run came at a time when the country just recorded its deadliest week during this pandemic. On Saturday, Bangladesh recorded 261 deaths from Covid-19\u2014the second-highest daily death toll from Covid-19. Just two days ago, it had recorded 264 deaths, the highest single-day toll. Overall, a total of 1,726 died from Covid-19 in the past week, an increase of 5.3 percent from the week earlier, according to the data of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Meanwhile, infections continue to be on the rise.\nWhat these grim numbers tell us, beyond the urgency of further improving the treatment and testing protocols, is that we must now, more than any time before, build a functioning vaccination system based on timely supply and proper delivery. The time of experimentation is over, and we must look back to know what mistakes have been made and ensure those never occur again. As we have already said in this column before, the constant flip-flops and confusion over the government's plans, not just in terms of vaccination but also lockdowns and other Covid-related decisions, could place it in a serious credibility crisis.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Public awareness\u2014both to check the pandemic by following safety rules and participate in the vaccination drive\u2014is of course an important part of our fight. But the government cannot deny its responsibility to ensure people comply and cooperate. Right now, it appears the most important challenge is to ensure availability of enough vaccines to sustain the upcoming drive and build a well-coordinated system of delivery so that it doesn't, again, become a potential superspreading event. All arms of the state's vaccine-giving apparatus must learn their mistakes from the chaotic trial run they just conducted.\n",

        "full_article": "Today, on the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, even as we celebrate the culture, heritage and diversity of the indigenous peoples of Bangladesh, we also express our concern at the various challenges that many minority communities within the country continue to face. While it is commendable that the Bangladesh government has included the development of these marginalised populations in the country's Eighth Five Year Plan, it is important to remember that inclusive development has to go beyond increases in per capita income only\u2014it must involve legal, land, health, educational and cultural rights as well.\nAlthough there has been progress since the signing of the historic CHT Accord and numerous sections have been implemented over the past two decades, according to human rights activists, the issue of a land commission to protect land rights is still a thorn in the side of the country's ethnic minorities. In a recent discussion on the inclusion of indigenous peoples in sustainable development, jointly organised by the Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD) and Bangladesh Indigenous People Forum, activists spoke of how it is not only homesteads, gardens, trees, forestlands and lakes that are being taken over by land-grabbers\u2014even crematoriums are at risk as well. Going forward, it is imperative that such instance of land-grabbing no longer go unpunished, and that the evicted are able to access justice from the state.\nIn March last year, The Daily Star also reported on a measles outbreak in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, revealing how the government's immunisation programme for infants and children had failed to reach some of the most remote areas of the country. While emergency assistance was given to the affected areas at the time, we hope that the government's long-term plans for the region will also involve increasing access to critical healthcare. Now more than ever, the Covid-19 pandemic has shone a renewed light on how important it is to invest in health systems alongside prioritising economic development. We also hope, once education is allowed to resume, that the authorities will continue to stress on the importance of education in the mother tongue of children from different ethnic communities.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The pandemic has had widespread negative repercussions across Bangladesh, but with vulnerable communities bearing a disproportionate burden of its impacts. As we roll out the nationwide vaccination programme and begin to plan for the post-pandemic recovery, we urge the government to ensure that vulnerable indigenous communities are not left behind. We must not only celebrate our cultural and ethnic diversity on such days, but ensure that minority communities are able to be part of the economic development of the nation while also having their rights and identities respected.\n",
