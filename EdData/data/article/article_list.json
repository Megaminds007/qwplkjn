Mr. Kumar had been at the forefront of championing a broad alliance of Opposition parties to take on the might of the ruling BJP in the upcoming general election. The Centre\u2019s decision to honour Karpoori Thakur, an icon of social justice politics in Bihar, with the Bharat Ratna, has given Mr. Kumar a convenient excuse to warm up to the BJP. Mr. Kumar recalled his demand for conferment of the Bharat Ratna on the socialist leader since 2006, obliquely blaming the Congress which was in power then for overlooking his demand. He has also expressed the hope that other demands of Bihar would be met by the Centre, which many see as a prelude to yet another alliance between his party, the Janata Dal (United), and the BJP. Mr. Kumar has clearly distanced himself from the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, his partners in the State government; the BJP, which had ruled out a revival of its alliance with Mr. Kumar until recently, has now said it is possible. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s Bhagwant Mann, Chief Ministers of West Bengal and Punjab, respectively, have meanwhile ruled out seat-sharing with the Congress in their States.Except for closed door meetings followed by press conferences, the INDIA bloc has not had any big public outreach programme since its formation seven months ago in Patna. Time is running out and there is no clarity on when the bloc will be able to seal the division of seats among its constituents. The alliance is staring at a crisis in the battle of perception and in building a robust structure for a joint campaign or election strategy. The initial euphoria had blinded the parties to the political peculiarities in each State, and the ambitions and fears of regional leaders that soon began to emerge. On January 13, Ms. Banerjee skipped a virtual meeting of the bloc that had been organised in haste. The Shiv Sena\u2019s Uddhav Thackeray and the Samajwadi Party\u2019s Akhilesh Yadav also stayed away. It is still possible that partial seat sharing arrangements depending on tactical considerations in individual States might still emerge, but any programmatic national alliance against the BJP seems to be out of reach. The Opposition parties may have to look at State-level alliances, and the possibility of post-poll alliances. The BJP, meanwhile, has ramped up its campaign, not merely to win the election but also to extinguish the last signs of opposition to it. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\nPunjab\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\naward and prize\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nJanata Dal (United)\n\n/\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n/\n\nShiv Sena-Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray\n\n/\n\nSamajwadi Party\n\n/\n\nBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi",

        "full_article": "The crash of a Russian plane with Ukrainian prisoners of war on board has once again shown how delicate the situation between the two countries that have been at war since February 2022 is. Russia says Kyiv downed the plane, which had 65 Ukrainian soldiers, in Belgorod, a Russian border town, that has seen repeated Ukrainian shelling in recent months. Kyiv has slammed Russia for spreading propaganda, but has not ruled out its possible role in the downing. The incident comes at a time when Ukraine\u2019s troops are struggling to keep up the fight on the front line amid Russia\u2019s incremental advances. Russia, which suffered humiliating setbacks in 2022, has since retaken the battlefield momentum. Last year, Ukraine\u2019s top general said the counteroffensive, which began in June 2023, aimed at recapturing Russia-held territories in the south and east, had failed. Russia has made territorial gains in the east, capturing Mariinka and making advances towards Avdiivka and Kupiansk. With its huge losses on the battlefield, Ukraine\u2019s generals are calling for the mobilisation of up to 5,00,000 soldiers \u2014 which would be hugely unpopular. Worse, the changing mood in Washington has sent an alarming message to Kyiv.Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government has vowed to uncover the truth behind the plane crash. If it has been downed by a Ukrainian missile, it would pose a political challenge to Mr. Zelensky. But a bigger problem he is facing is the future of the war. Until now, he has put up a brave face, saying Ukraine would fight until victory \u2014 which is, recapturing all the territories Russia has taken. While Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine regions and its war are a violation of international laws, Ukraine does not seem to have a practical path towards victory. Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, which has the Biden administration\u2019s full support, has also distracted global attention from Ukraine. If Donald Trump, the U.S. Republican leader, is re-elected in November \u2014 he has vowed to end the war in days \u2014 Ukraine could come under heavy pressure. The war cannot be sustained without uninterrupted support from the U.S. and its NATO partners. When pressure increases on the battlefield, what Ukraine is doing is to carry out missile and drone attacks inside Russia. Ukraine\u2019s possession of advanced weapons, supplied by the West, has enhanced its fire power. Last week, a fuel export terminal on Russia\u2019s Baltic coast came under attack. There is suspicion, deep mistrust and misinformation on both sides, which could lead to more violence and accidents. Russia, Ukraine and NATO should take a more practical assessment of the progress of the war and be ready for talks, instead of continuing an endless war which is hurting all sides. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nNATO\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\ninternational law",

        "full_article": "Freddie\u2019s sense of smell is as sharp as a scalpel. His approach towards the bird is precise. He leaps on the balcony railing, an orchestra of sharp teeth and claws clanging on the metal bar, snapping and crunching against a wing. Slicing and dicing at nature\u2019s boulangerie serving pigeon meat. Then, before anyone can react, he pads over to me with the remnants of the dead bird in his mouth. Freddie eats anything: socks, erasers, dolls, and recently, a garment that he found in a garbage heap by the road. A traumatic event because he had to be cut open to remove this piece of offensive clothing which turned out to be a relatively intact, black, half-chewed men\u2019s underwear.\nIllustration Credit: Chad Crowe\nMy cousin and I share Freddie. Like the only child of divorced parents, he is showered with affection as he shuttles between our homes. While Freddie is deeply loved, caring for him involves a strict vigil to see he doesn\u2019t ingest potentially dangerous objects along with fluttering pigeons. Yet, we do it happily, albeit with a bit of theatrical moaning.\nIf aliens were watching us, they would find it bizarre that we accept these furry creatures into our lives where, for the next decade, we pick up their defecation multiple times a day. We feed, clean, and occasionally pick out ticks between their toes without asking for anything in return.\nEven Pope Francis seems bewildered by this love for domesticated animals and believes that people are replacing children with pets. While discussing parenthood at the Vatican, he recounted an incident where a woman opened her bag and asked him to bless her baby. Except it was not a baby but a tiny dog tucked inside her handbag. He said, \u2018People have dogs and cats that take the place of children\u2026Denial of fatherhood and motherhood diminishes us, takes away our humanity.\u2019\nThere is a definite cost when it comes to having pets. And it may be more than vet bills and kibbles, like the recent battle over Henry which reached Parliament. Mahua Moitra and her ex-partner, Jai Anant Dehadrai, fought over their rottweiler. Moitra had filed a police case against Dehadrai to get custody of the dog, and he, in turn, filed a complaint alleging that Moitra had been accepting bribes. Currently, Moitra has been expelled from Parliament, a slightly heavier price for loving her dog than the ones I have paid in the form of chewed-up armchairs and stained carpets.\nThere is a scientific reason for our attachment to dogs. Researchers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle found that the brain activation patterns evoked by images of women\u2019s own children and when watching their dogs were similar in nature. Also, those puppy dog eyes that melt our hearts? Dogs figured out our weakness, and over centuries of domestication acquired a new forehead muscle called the levator anguli oculi medialis that helps them create that lost but hopeful expression.\nIt may seem like a lopsided equation where dogs get food and poop-cleaning services without humans getting tangible rewards, but there are myriad benefits to having a dog. According to Swedish scientists, having a pet was associated with a 23% reduction in heart disease deaths. Dogs also increase social interactions along with your step count. I even know a couple who recently got married, thanks to their dog. The man was buying a sweater for his beagle, and the woman\u2019s daughter started playing with the dog in the store. Conversation over the pet\u2019s clothing led to a series of coffees, and a year later, they were scrambling down the aisle with the beagle in attendance as the best dog.\nAs for children, having a dog is an antidote to the allure of the omnipresent digital world. Pets provide companionship, help get them off their screens, and teach them selflessness and a sense of responsibility.\nThis Christmas, someone accidentally placed a plate of chicken satay in front of the kids while Freddie was around. He jumped on the plate and started gulping down the pieces. My 11-year-old, worried about him swallowing the wooden skewers holding the chicken together, tried pulling the pointed skewers out of his mouth. She got bitten on both hands. Three shots of rabies and one shot of tetanus later, she claims she has no regrets. \u2018It was an accident. He didn\u2019t mean to bite me, and it doesn\u2019t matter as long as Freddie is fine.\u2019\nNow, if I had inadvertently chomped on her fingers, not only would there be unceasing accusations, but 20 years later, it would be a subject of intense discussion during her therapy sessions. But this is part of the covenant we make with our pets: to honour and protect each other from the vagaries of life.\nRecently, after a particularly miserable day, I walked into the house, and Freddie jumped on me in excitement, his tail whipping back and forth like a metronome keeping time with his happy heart. I patted him on his head, enveloped in his joy. It occurred to me that if people greeted their spouses the way dogs greet you when you return home, there would be fewer divorces. Reminded of my own absentminded and distracted response when my husband had called that afternoon, I sent him a picture of the two of us with a heart emoji, the human version of wagging my tail. And I waited for him to wag his in return.\nThe Pope suggests that denial of parenthood may diminish our humanity, but having a dog is a persistent reminder that we are never more human than when we express our need to love and be loved in return. It\u2019s about having someone in our lives who, if it were possible, would swallow all our weary emptiness along with discarded underwear and dead birds.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Let\u2019s get the basics out of the way \u2014 we celebrate the Republic because it prohibits any majority from running roughshod based on its numerical strength. The Constitution limits the power of governments and groups to protect the minority of One, i.e. every individual. The Republic grants fundamental rights to individuals to live, trade, work and protest peacefully. Yet, among these freedoms, the one that governments most readily and frequently trample upon \u2014 with little or no opposition\u2014is the right to economic freedom. We can endlessly debate the current state of political or religious freedom and the decline of the freedom of expression, and that is partly the point \u2014 there is at least a debate. When the State encroaches upon these freedoms, there is pushback and widespread alarm. However, the freedom to pursue economic activity without any encumbrance is a forgotten ideal and is breached constantly with careless abandon by the State.\n\n\nBeyond elite: It is not just about an industrialist\u2019s freedom but also about letting a farmer export his produce\n\n\nArticle 19(1) enshrines the fundamental right to practice any profession, carry out an occupation, trade, or business for all citizens within the country\u2019s jurisdiction, which is the essence of economic freedom. Yet, since becoming a Republic, governments have largely looked at this as an optional extra, and the Supreme Court, through its various judgments, has regularly emphasised the need to balance individual economic liberty with a vaguely defined \u2018greater public good\u2019.\n\nEconomic freedom is mistakenly assumed to benefit the elite alone. It\u2019s not only about an industrialist\u2019s freedom to run a business but also about letting a farmer export his produce and not obstructing women from working at night in factories. Most of all, it\u2019s about letting people take charge of their economic destinies. It\u2019s no wonder that one of the first writ petitions asking the government to uphold his right to trade and profession was filed by a vegetable vendor and not by a wealthy builder or a politician. Historian Rohit De\u2019s book \u2018A People\u2019s Constitution\u2019 explains that this wasn\u2019t an exception. Many ordinary Indians used their newly enshrined economic freedoms in the first decade of Independence to challenge colonial-era laws. And yet, we let the State decide and control our economic destiny through bans, restrictions, and \u2018monitoring systems\u2019. Whereas the State has little interest in strengthening the one thing that underpins voluntary cooperation in the marketplace: a robust criminal justice system to enforce contracts and protect property rights.\n\nConsider the post-Independence period \u2014 India took a socialist economic route, which resulted in severe restrictions on economic liberty. Firms and businesses were subject to draconian laws on what they could produce and how much of it, who they could hire or fire, what inputs they could use, where they could sell and distribute, etc. \u2018Profit\u2019 became a filthy word. The result of excessive State control over the economy is well known \u2014 a prolonged period of excruciatingly slow economic growth and suppressed political freedoms.\n\nSome of the worst excesses were tempered down after the liberalisation of the economy in 1991. Yet, even today, economic freedom is seen as a favour bestowed upon the population by its discretion rather than an inalienable fundamental right. Therein lies the problem \u2014 without genuine economic freedom, every other freedom is under threat. Economists like von Mises, Hayek, and Friedman insist that economic freedom precedes political and other freedoms. Strong property rights protection and economic freedom is a necessary condition for democracy. It is nearly impossible to recollect or imagine a society with a large measure of political freedom without an accompanying dose of free markets to organise economic activity.\n\nControl by the government over means of production can directly affect freedom of expression and political freedom. A government does not necessarily need the threat of raids by IT departments and enforcement agencies to have a pliant media. This can be achieved by much more subtle forms of subduing economic freedom, like imposing costly licenses and price caps on news channels which increase reliance on government advertisements. If the government wants to control a political protest, it can shut down the internet for days, censor social media companies, or shut down phone networks in an extreme case. The Indira Gandhi government famously cut off electricity supply to Delhi newspaper offices during the Emergency period to suppress news of the arrest of opposition leaders. Some years ago, UP government said it would cut off diesel supplies to protesting farmers to prevent them from undertaking a Republic Day parade with their tractors. In both cases, government monopoly of key resources enabled squashing of freedoms.\n\nEvery price control, license requirement, trade restriction, new tax and onerous regulation should be seen for what it is \u2014 an inexorable assault on our freedoms and a breach of the Constitution of India.\n\nManur and Kotasthane are co-authors, along with Khyati Pathak, of a new comic book titled \u2018We, the Citizens: Strengthening the Republic\u2019\n\n",

        "full_article": "The education ministry recently unveiled new guidelines aimed at regulating coaching institutions across the country. These encompass various aspects, including restricting age for admission to those above the age of 16, registration of coaching centres, greater transparency in fee structures, infrastructure requirements, limiting coaching hours, mandatory relaxation time, reporting of student success etc. The consequences for institutions found in violation of these rules range from fines to potential cancellation of licenses for repeat offenders. While these regulations have sparked considerable debate, it\u2019s important to note that the challenges lie not only in their practical implementation but also in addressing the root causes of the issues associated with coaching institutes and student stress.\n\nTo truly tackle the problems associated with coaching institutes and reduce anxiety among students, the country needs to adopt a comprehensive approach that goes beyond mere symptom treatment. Here are several steps that could address these challenges:\n\n1. Improve supply-to-demand ratio: One of the core issues leading to the proliferation of coaching institutes is the intense competition for limited seats in premier institutions. A national plan should be devised to significantly increase seats, perhaps aiming for a fivefold increase over the next five years. This could be achieved through a sustainable financial model, such as study-now-pay-later schemes, establishment of extension campuses in various cities, international collaborations, and multi-institutional engagements.\n\n2. Develop effective online programs: Building on successful initiatives like the IIT Professor Assisted Learning (PAL) program, which provided free lecture material for JEE preparation, the country should invest in advanced online programs. These programs should be designed to offer high-quality content using cutting-edge technologies and involve top-ranking students from premier institutions. This approach not only provides accessible resources but also reduces undue reliance on physical coaching centres.\n\n3. Invest in teacher training: Recognising that students often seek additional coaching due to inadequacies in regular classes, investing in teacher training initiatives is crucial. Enhancing skills of educators can bridge the gap and provide students with necessary guidance within the classroom setting itself, reducing need for supplementary coaching.\n\n4. Reporting norms for placement claims in institutes: Every placement season, the media is full of reports of students bagging big pay packages, sparking unrealistic hopes among others. To address the allure of such exorbitant placement packages advertised by our educational institutes, reporting norms should be established. Emphasis should shift from highlighting the highest salaries to disclosing median salaries, preventing the glorification of pay packages received by a fraction of students. According to reports, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are contemplating such a move. If this happens, it will provide prospective students with a more realistic understanding of the potential outcomes of clearing entrance examinations.\n\n5. Transparent exam process: Entrance examinations for premier institutions currently operate as a process of rejection rather than selection, fostering an environment conducive to the coaching industry. To alleviate student stress, examination processes should evolve to be more transparent and reflective of real-world problem-solving. Emphasis should be placed on assessing understanding rather than speed, minimising the advantage gained through time-sensitive tricks taught by coaching institutes.\n\n6. Public awareness campaigns: It\u2019s also important to educate students and parents on the diversity of career pathways and highlight success stories of individuals who pursued alternative educational paths and achieved success. Currently, many students choose their career paths owing to parental and peer pressure and have \u00a0limited knowledge of alternative career choices.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to organise lectures for them from stalwarts in other domains so students can make more informed choices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the new guidelines for coaching institutions offer a regulatory framework, addressing the larger issues requires a holistic approach. By focusing on increasing educational capacity, leveraging technology for online tutoring, investing in teacher training, reevaluating placement reporting norms, reforming the exam process and launching public awareness campaigns on alternative career choices, \u00a0 the country can pave the way for a more equitable and stress-free educational landscape.\n\nProf V Ramgopal Rao is group vice-chancellor for BITS Pilani campuses and former director of IIT Delhi. Views are personal.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It would appear that the year hasn't started well for the State. Although the sticky question concerning continuation of the government has been settled through the holding of the 12th parliamentary election, things on the economic front are not that comfortable, it seems. On the face of things, the government appears to have been getting tough on law breakers, particularly the ones hoarding essential food stuffs. Yet, the national board of revenue (NBR), which is the principal generator of revenue for the State, has failed to meet the stated revenue target by as much as Tk232.27 billion in the first half of the current fiscal year (July 2023 - June 2024).This situation should be ringing alarm bells for policymakers. Although the NBR remains hopeful about meeting that target, there are issues that need to be resolved first. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had tagged the condition of raising the tax-GDP ratio by 0.5 per cent this fiscal year with its latest $4.7 billion loan package. Both domestic and external issues, including dollar crunch and restrictions on import have affected revenue mobilization by the NBR. The decline in domestic consumption in view of the rising prices of most commodities has also shrunk revenue receipts. The NBR isn't solely to blame of course. As pointed out by certain economists, the IMF demand can be largely met if the NBR rationalizes tax exemptions that have long been enjoyed by a number of sectors in the economy. The question is whether such large-scale tax exemptions should be given to companies under various sectors at a time of national economic crisis. Many tend to believe that such exemption retards the natural growth of sectors that have become complacent and aren't doing enough to become competitive. There is no denying the fact that manufacturing has taken a nosedive due to several factors including, failure to import requisite capital machinery and raw materials, rise in labour and energy costs, a general fall in demand for goods as inflationary pressure on essential commodities hammered consumers. All these factors have played their role and it is unjust to place blame on any particular regulatory authority for what is essentially a failure to manage the situation better at policy level. However, the NBR has consistently failed to improve its performance primarily due to its inability to carry out the much-needed internal reforms and automation. According to provisional data that has been made available, the NBR collected Tk1.65 trillion in taxes over the July-December period against a target of Tk1.88 trillion. The problems lie in the fact that revenue collection was missed by three wings of NBR, i.e. income tax, customs and VAT (value added tax). VAT collection came in Tk60.70 billion short, customs revenue at Tk86.63 billion and income and travel taxes fell short by Tk85. 92 billion. Setting higher targets by policymakers has always been the norm to keep revenue authorities on their toes. Targets, however, have never been met. The problem, of course, is that planning is done based on revenues. Unless the policymakers make requisite changes in the manner revenue is targeted and vigorously pursued, these shortfalls will remain. A fundamental rethinking is required here and the answers are all there. What is lacking perhaps is the political will to make an earnest attempt to do what are needed most.",

        "full_article": "It may be good news that overall global foreign direct investment (FDI) increased modestly in the past year. The preliminary estimate of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), released last week, showed that global FDI posted a modest 3 per cent growth in 2023 after a big fall of around 20 per cent in 2022. Thus, global FDI stood at US$1.37 trillion last year, up from $1.33 trillion the previous year. A relevant question is, how good is the news?The latest issue of the Global Investment Trends Monitor provided the answer in brief with a useful explanation of the annual world foreign investment trend. It showed that FDI in the developed world increased by around 23 per cent in the past year, mainly due to a big rise in FDI in a few European 'conduit' economies like Luxembourg and the Netherlands. These countries usually act as 'intermediaries for FDI destined for other nations.' If the FDI in these countries is excluded, foreign investment in the rest of the developed world witnessed a 28 per cent drop from the previous year. Similarly, global FDI flows showed an 18 per cent decline in 2023. In other words, last year, the estimated 3 per cent growth in the global economy was not a modest rebound of FDI in real terms. The different aspects of the world FDI flows support the proposition.UNCTAD report mentioned that the number of international project finance deals declined by 21 per cent, and the value of these deals was also reduced by one-fourth of the previous year. Due to the rise in financing costs, the cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) deals declined most in the past year. A merger is defined as the combination of two or more firms subsequently forming a new entity under the banner of a single corporate name. An acquisition is a process where one company ultimately purchases another entity.In 2023, greenfield project announcements were also 6 per cent lower in number, though they were 6 per cent up in value, which is a positive thing. The manufacturing greenfield projects showed higher numbers, which indicates an 'initial sign of recovery following a long-term declining trend.' In a greenfield investment, usually, a parent company, the company already in commercial operation, creates a new venture in a foreign country from the ground up. So, it is clear that the global flow of FDI is yet to gain adequate pace. Instead, to the pessimist, the latest trend indicates much-dubbed deglobalisation. It is defined as a 'movement towards a less connected world, characterised by powerful nation-states, local solutions, and border controls rather than global institutions, treaties, and free movement.' Experts opined that recent disruptions to global value chains (GVCs) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, growing ideological differences and the green transition have prompted various governments and corporations to reconsider external dependencies. (WEF, 2023) So, they are looking closer to home and to trusted partners for more resilient growth models. Simply put, deglobalisation is a combination of less trade with more restriction, less FDI, less cross-border movement of people and more small blocs of countries. Many also observed that in recent years, the benefits of FDI have been threatened by geopolitical risks and chronic supply chain disruptions, ultimately helpingdeglobalisation. The issue of deglobalisation has been a big debate, especially in the last few years, although it is not new. Moreover, only some are convinced that the reverse course of globalisation has been getting stronger, although many have agreed that the 'slowbalisation', the slow pace of globalisation, is already there. UNCTAD report further showed that FDI in the developing world dropped by 9 per cent in the past year after it had posted a modest 5 per cent growth in 2022. Asia faced a 12 per cent decline in the annual flow of FDI in 2023, and South Asia witnessed the biggest drop of 43 per cent.In line with the regional trend, FDI in Bangladesh also showed a declining trend in the past year. Statistics available with Bangladesh Bank showed that net inflow of FDI in the first nine months of 2023 stood at $2.12 billion which was $2.78 billion in the same period of 2022. Even if the last quarter of 2023 witnessed a big jump in FDI, it is unlikely that the annual inflow of net FDI in 2023 would cross the previous year's level of $3.48 billion. One of the main reasons behind the decline in FDI in the country last year was election-centric political uncertainty. Central bank statistics revealed that annual inflow of net FDI declined before the past two national elections. It dropped slightly, less than one per cent, in 2014. In 2019, net FDI declined by 20.50 per cent. What is alarming is that the country saw a decline in FDI at a time when the balance of payments (BoP) is under serious pressure due to the rapid depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Net foreign exchange reserve came down to $21.87 billion at the end of December 2023 from $24.75 billion at the end of June 2023. In the latest annual report, Bangladesh Bank said: \"A significant deficit in the financial account along with a deficit in the current account led to a sharp fall of foreign exchange reserves.\" In the first five months of the current fiscal year or the July-November period of 2023, the financial account posted a big deficit of $5.40 billion against a modest surplus of $1.20 billion in the same period of 2022.The reversal of the declining trend of FDI will help to offset the depletion of forex reserves to some extent. Though there is no magic wand to do so immediately, the post-election stability is expected to attract foreign investors in the near future. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh, like many other countries of the world, has a community of non-binary gender who suffers from a mismatch between their biological sexual gender and their gender identity. In Bangladesh as well as in India, Pakistan and Nepal, they are known as hijras. To the majority of people, the gender identity of hijras may still be confusing because of various subgroups in the community. But it is commonly believed that they are neither male nor female, but a third gender, which the government of Bangladesh has recognised them to be.Even though these people are born and raised in the same country as the majority population, they are not only denied most of the fundamental rights that come with their birthright, but are also socially isolated and stigmatized, leading them to live a peripheral life.A chapter of the History and Social Science textbook for seventh-grade students named 'The Story of Sharifa' gives a vivid illustration of the plight of the hijras. The central character of the story Sharif is born as a male. But as he grows up, he discovers he is actually a she\u2026 a girl in a male body. She then experiences ostracisation from her family and society. Subsequently, she runs away from home and finds acceptance in the Hijra community. Afterwards, she changes her name from Sharif to Sharifa and transforms her lifestyle.Sharifa's story is just one among the thousands that could be told by the hijras in Bangladesh, all of whom suffered stigma, ostracisation, mockery and name calling, even though they are created by the same creator with the same flesh and blood and given a soul just like anyone else. The primary objective of introducing Sharifa's Story in textbook is to sensitise students about the less fortunate sections of people in society. But many think that the way the story has been told is not appropriate, and it could have been incorporated in the books of upper grades, say, class nine or ten. The government has already formed a committee to sort out the issues. Besides, initiatives should be taken to create public awareness about the plight of the hijras. According to the 2022 census, the number of hijras in Bangladesh is 12,629, but the actual figure could be around one lakh, according to estimates of some NGOs. In most cases, the hijras are discriminated against in jobs, education, property ownership and so on. In absence of employment opportunities, to survive they have to beg, resort to prostitution, or play different tricks to coarse people into giving them money, which cause civic menace and drive a bigger wedge between them and society. But did the majority people ever ponder what landed them in this sordid predicament? A handful of these people, however, are gradually finding their way into the mainstream of society. For example, one of them has recently been elected as a UP chairman, another recruited as a TV hostess, and some are doing well in running businesses like beauty parlours and finding jobs thanks to some government and non-government organisations' benevolent initiatives. But still, the biggest difficulty faced by them is the social prejudice, which is blocking their upward social mobility.Two obvious fronts to fight to bring hijras into the mainstream of society are raising awareness in society and ensuring their basic rights. If the predominant social bias and prejudice can be overcome, then half the battle will be won. Secondly, housing, healthcare, education, training and job opportunities are the prime needs of the hijras, as of any under-privileged group. If these needs are addressed, it will go some way towards lifting them out of want and squalor, and help build an inclusive and just society.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The girl had only mistakenly boarded the wrong train, which altered the course of her life. I am referring to a recent unfortunate incident where a girl was raped when she mistakenly boarded the Lalmonirhat-bound 'Lalmoni Express' from Dhaka. Despite efforts by both the government and private organisations to ensure women's safety in public spaces, our daughters and sisters still do not feel secure.In our social system, victims often encounter more challenges than perpetrators, especially in cases of sexual harassment. The girl's father expressed to journalists his reluctance to return to the village out of fear of facing social stigma and derogatory remarks about his daughter. Thus, they plan to reside in the city, where their tragic ordeal remains unknown to prevent further stigmatisation. This scenario sheds light on the profound helplessness experienced by victims of sexual harassment in our society.The country's overall development will remain unattainable if we continue to suppress half of the population. It is evident that legal measures alone cannot eradicate rape and abuse. Therefore, everyone must acknowledge this reality. Only through increased awareness can we hope to diminish violence against women.Md Saad HossainStudentDhaka University",
