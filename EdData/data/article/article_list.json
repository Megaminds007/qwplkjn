The order allowing Sanjay Kumar Mishra, head of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to continue till September 15 at the Centre\u2019s request is needlessly accommodative. It was only on July 11 that the Court declared illegal the extensions given to Mr. Mishra in 2021 and 2022. At the same time, he was permitted to continue till July 31 to ensure a smooth transition. Yet, without any submission that the process to select his successor has been set in motion, the Court has invoked an undefined \u201clarger national interest\u201d to allow him to go on up to September 15. It was a self-serving application in the first place. The ostensible reason that the government finds his services indispensable is that he is helming the country\u2019s efforts to demonstrate its framework to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism during a country review before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The multi-lateral body adopts a mutual evaluation system and India\u2019s ongoing review will go on until June 2024, when the final evaluation report may be considered at a likely plenary discussion on its compliance status. The government sought an extension of his services until October 15, presumably because the country\u2019s agencies and institutions may be ready by then for an on-site visit by an FATF delegation.As the agency that administers the law against money laundering, the ED may have a key role in preparing the country\u2019s presentation, but it is difficult to believe that the process depends on one individual. Even if it were so, nothing prevented the government from utilising Mr. Mishra\u2019s services for FATF purposes alone, while leaving the directorate\u2019s routine activities under his successor. In any case, various agencies and authorities are involved in framing the country\u2019s policies on money laundering and terrorism financing. It is unfortunate that the Court did not countenance arguments that highlighted these points. It did raise questions as to how one person could be indispensable, but ultimately chose to allow him to continue for some more time. One can understand the argument that the country\u2019s image depends on a positive FATF evaluation, but the claim that not giving Mr. Mishra an extension might result in a \u201cnegative image\u201d is quite incomprehensible. India\u2019s credentials will be evaluated on its laws, systems and compliance with global standards and not on who prepared the report. The Court\u2019s permissiveness detracts from its resolve to hold the government to account for actions that it had itself declared illegal.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ninvestigation\n\n/\n\nterrorism (crime)\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nmoney laundering",

The bigger point in the PM\u2019s remark on India\u2019s economic size was that he highlighted the most important tool to guarantee India\u2019s well-being and strategic influence \u2013 the rate of economic growth and the consequent economic size provide both citizenry and governments with opportunities to change things for the better. For India, the 1980s represents an inflection point when decadal economic growth rates increased significantly. The outcome of four decades of brisk growth, by global standards, has pulled millions out of poverty and allowed governments to use the domestic market\u2019s size as a strategic tool.\nOne undoubted achievement of the Modi government is that it has ensured that economic growth continued without compromising macroeconomic stability, by avoiding imprudent fiscal policies. This has added a dimension of durability to India\u2019s growth story. But on the other hand, this government or any government should not remain satisfied with a growth rate of around 6%. GOI\u2019s annual economic survey said that if reforms are executed India\u2019s potential GDP growth can rise to 7-8% a year in the medium-term \u2013 that should be the target.\n\nAt that pace, it will take a decade to double the size of the economy. Keep in mind China\u2019s economy is already around five times bigger. Settling for a durable economic growth rate of anything less than 8% a year will not help in addressing India\u2019s grave employment challenge. Following the outbreak of Covid, there\u2019s been a structural regression in India\u2019s jobs market. Agriculture, the least productive section of the economy, has seen a relative rise in its contribution to employment. In 2021-22, GOI\u2019s jobs report showed 45. 5% of the workforce was in agriculture, three percentage points higher than the pre-Covid period.\nAddressing this problem also requires more imaginative policies to rapidly enhance skill development. Investments are influenced by the quality of human capital. Therefore, while Indians should be happy with the growth story, there\u2019s still a long way to go.\n\n",

Reaching back into colonial and even pre-colonial times, these narratives of kings, empires, injustices and entitlements and debates around them are interesting. But when applied to the present, they hold the danger of making the current crisis worse. The complaints or crimes of today must be judged by today\u2019s standards and laws alone, not by citing history. Remember what the Supreme Court underlined in its Ayodhya judgment. One, with the adoption of the Constitution we, the people of India, submitted to the rule of law. Two, historical wrongs cannot be remedied by anybody taking this law in their own hands.\n\nIncidentally, while we still pay the price of reckless British imperial cartography, look what Britain\u2019s nostalgia for its empire has wrought \u2013 the Brexit vote, widely attributed to the fantasy about making Britain great again, accelerated the country\u2019s economic decline. In Turkey, nostalgia for the Ottoman empire has engendered a sultan-style governance model. Vladimir Putin\u2019s febrile imagining of Russia\u2019s golden age has not only upturned Europe\u2019s decades of peace but inflicted hurt worldwide. The disease flourishes in America too, fierce culture wars over confederate monuments being one of the many symptoms. But where America steals a march is that there\u2019s an equally fierce race to the future (including unknown futures) by its scientists and entrepreneurs.\nBalance is the critical factor. Nostalgia can be an important philosophical support for communities in adverse circumstances. But a society in which recounting past glories or wounds becomes an obstacle for necessary restoration, is caught in a \u201closs of the future\u201d trap. This is what the court had meant by calling Independence a watershed moment to heal the wounds of the past \u2013 to depart from the determination of rights and liabilities on the basis of religion or centuries-old customs or long-gone wars and conquests. Manipur will never find peace via relitigating history. Religious conflicts will never subside if places of worship keep attracting lawsuits. History isn\u2019t always helpful.\n\n",

But naming Prof Delwar Hossain, who is a member of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC), as a member of Bangladesh Awami League's international affairs sub-committee has stoked quite a controversy. According to the media, AL General Secretary Obaidul Quader approved the 56-member sub-committee for 2022-25 on July 24.\nIt is the second instance in less than two and a half years in which a constitutional office holder has been included in the ruling party's organisational structure. Previously, the Awami League included Attorney General AM Amin Uddin in its sub-committee on information and research affairs on February 18, 2021. But the party dropped the attorney general from the sub-committee merely a few days later amid criticism, which is why Prof Delwar Hossain's appointment as a party functionary is quite puzzling. Does it mean that the ruling party no longer thinks that keeping constitutional offices free from its clutches is necessary?\nIn a way, Delwar Hossain's constitutional position is more restrictive than that of the attorney general, though the latter's office appears higher in order in the constitution. The constitution doesn't impose any bar on the person holding the office of the attorney general from being eligible for future appointments in services of the republic.\nBut as far as the office of the members of the BPSC is concerned, the constitution unambiguously debars the person from any such service. Article 139(4) stipulates: On ceasing to hold office, a member of a public service commission shall not be eligible for further employment in the service of the Republic, but, subject to the provisions of Clause (1), (a) a chairman so ceasing shall be eligible for re-appointment for one further term; and (b) a member (other than the chairman) so ceasing shall be eligible for re-appointment for one further term as chairman of a public service commission.\nThis specific and stricter disqualification for any future service of the republic can have only one purpose, which is to ensure one's neutrality and restraint from responding to any kind of enticement. In this case, at least, the framers of our constitution did realise the gravity of the question of conflict of interest. It has also been reflected in the prescribed oath of office for the members of BPSC in the third schedule of the constitution. The last line in the sacred oath says, \"And that I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions.\" Arguably, belonging to a party forum brings in some degree of political commitment to the party, which is bound to influence someone's judgement.\n\nPeople with multiple commitments and working for the better future of the country and society do need appreciation and encouragement. But there are quite a few offices in which the holder has to confine themselves within their remit and sacrifice many other things, including not-for-profit work. That's why we see Supreme Court judges or election commissioners disassociate themselves from non-government organisations, be it research-oriented or charity.\nDelwar, a former chairman of the Department of International Relations at Dhaka University, told the media that he did not apply for the party position, but was made one of the expert members of the committee anyway. However, AL International Affairs Secretary Shammi Ahmed told a local daily that Delwar had been informed of his inclusion and gave his consent. If the professor is to be believed, then the Awami League stands accused of forming an expert committee by not only ignoring the constitution, but also imposing a responsibility upon someone without even checking whether he is willing or not. No one is doubting Delwar's scholarly abilities and contribution to the country's foreign policy area, but it is hard to believe that the ruling party, which could find 55 other willing experts, would have been crippled without him.\nProf Delwar Ahmed has been well-known in the academic circle and beyond as an ardent supporter of the Awami League, and understandably it was one of the prerequisites of a political government to consider appointing him to a very important constitutional position. This practice of political appointments has been going on for successive governments, but has now reached an unprecedented level, which has led to a widely held perception that all state institutions have been fully captured by the party in power. Delwar's failure to recuse himself from the activities of Awami League gives further credence to such a perception.\nPeople with multiple commitments and working for the better future of the country and society do need appreciation and encouragement. But there are quite a few offices in which the holder has to confine themselves within their remit and sacrifice many other things, including not-for-profit work. That's why we see Supreme Court judges or election commissioners disassociate themselves from non-government organisations, be it research-oriented or charity.\nThe BPSC members, too, get and enjoy equal status, job protection and privileges for a purpose, which is to make them neutral and independent both in essence and appearance. If writing newspaper columns, appearing on talk shows and chairing a think tank remain someone's preference, then wouldn't it have been better for them to not take the responsibility of a constitutional office? How can serving a particular party's interest be termed as not against the oath of office of the BPSC?\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist. His Twitter handle is @ahmedka1\n\n",

        "full_article": "In the months of April through July this year, skyrocketing temperatures have already broken records in many parts of the world. Thus, when the summer of 2023 ends, it will perhaps be the hottest in recorded human history, but it may also turn out to be the coolest we will ever enjoy again. That is because in the years ahead, a warming planet will make this summer feel comparatively cool and pleasant.\nUnprecedented temperatures are being recorded at Death Valley in California, where the mercury in July has already reached 53 degrees Celsius. The valley holds the world record for the hottest air temperature \u2013 56.7 degrees Celsius on July 10, 1913 at Furnace Creek, headquarters of the Death Valley National Park.\nBraving the sweltering heat, tourists are nevertheless flocking to Death Valley in droves to experience extreme weather for themselves. And yet, there has been only one death in the park: a 71-year-old man collapsed and died on July 18 as temperatures reached 49.4 degrees.\nOn the other side of the globe, close to 100 people are reported to have died over a period of several days in June from heat-related illness due to a searing heatwave that swept across two of India's most populous states: Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The deaths happened when temperatures soared to 45 degrees Celsius.\nDespite only one death at Death Valley, why did so many people die in India where the temperature was eight degrees less than that in the valley? This raises the question: how hot is too hot for the human body? What determines how much of the punishing heat our body can take and still survive?\nThe answer lies in the wet-bulb temperature (WBT), which is not the same as the ambient air temperature. Measured by a thermometer wrapped in a water-soaked cloth, WBT takes into account both heat and humidity. It is the lowest temperature to which an object can cool down when moisture evaporates from it. For humans, WBT is 35 degrees Celsius, according to a study published in the journal\u00a0Science Advances\u00a0in 2020.\nLike most warm-blooded mammals, we cool ourselves by converting sweat into water vapour around a constant body temperature of 37 degrees. This temperature maintains a constant balance between heat loss and heat gain.\n\nAs global temperatures rise, air will become warmer, and hence will be able to hold more moisture. That, in turn, will increase humidity and cause wet-bulb temperature (WBT) to go up. They will be very high, last for weeks and months, as we are witnessing now, and blanket large areas. Consequently, heat-related deaths will rise, even in moderate summer temperatures.\nThe WBT will be high if there is more moisture in the air. A high WBT will hamper our body's ability to sweat and cool itself down to maintain its core temperature. As a consequence, the body will overheat, forcing blood to rush to our skin to try to release heat, thereby causing damage to the internal organs. Moreover, the body will become hypothermic (different from hypothermia, which happens when our body's temperature drops to dangerously low levels), leading to symptoms such as nausea, weakness, dizziness and dehydration, a rapid pulse, a change in mental state, fainting, coma and eventually death.\nIf the humidity is low but the temperature is high, or vice versa, WBT probably will not be near our body's tipping point. For example, if the temperature is 40 degrees and humidity is 20 percent, WBT is only 32 degrees, whereas when both the humidity and the temperature are very high, WBT can go up towards dangerous levels. Once WBT exceeds 35 degrees, it will be difficult to survive for an extended period of time. This is especially true for people who work outside, and those with underlying health issues.\nAlthough survival becomes difficult at high WBT, lower temperatures can also be deadly. Studies show that the lower limit of our body's temperature is 28 degrees Celsius. Below that, the body expends more energy to maintain its core temperature. One of the ways it does this is by shivering, when our muscles involuntarily contract to produce heat. While the lower range has been established, the upper limit is still uncertain.\nNow, back to fatalities at Death Valley and India. During heatwaves that engulfed Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in June, humidity was 53 percent, resulting in a WBT of 36 degrees Celsius, which is higher than the upper limit of human adaptability to heat and humidity. On the other hand, average humidity at Death Valley is around 15 percent. Therefore, when the ambient temperature is 53 degrees, WBT is a tolerable 29 degrees. Hence, the big difference in the number of deaths.\nAs for Dhaka, with an average July temperature of 33 degrees Celsius and 75 percent humidity, WBT is 29.2 degrees. Because WBT is low enough for the people to sweat profusely, there are seldom any heat-related deaths in Dhaka. However, that does not necessarily mean that life will be comfortable during heatwaves.\nHumans are amazingly adaptable creatures, but there are limits to their adaptability. We can save ourselves from ferocious cyclones by moving to designated shelters. We can build elevated homes \u2013\u00a0machas\u00a0\u2013 in areas inundated by devastating floods or by rising sea levels. But a blazing heatwave is a different beast. Unlike the rich who can keep themselves cool in the comfort of their air-conditioned homes and offices, or go on a long holiday to cooler haunts, adapting to sizzling temperatures for the homeless and poor folks, particularly those who have to work outside for a living and do not have the luxury of air conditioners or even fans in their hovels, is different than adapting to cyclones and floods.\nAs global temperatures rise, air will become warmer, and hence will be able to hold more moisture. That, in turn, will increase humidity and cause WBT to go up. They will be very high, last for weeks and months, as we are witnessing now, and blanket large areas. Consequently, heat-related deaths will rise, even in moderate summer temperatures.\nAccording to Nasa, WBT in many regions, including South and Southeast Asia, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, Eastern China and Brazil, are likely to exceed the optimum value of 35 degrees Celsius by 2050. So, if we really want to save ourselves from being roasted by oppressive heatwaves, the simplest and sanest way is to force our government to stop burning fossil fuels without further delay.\n\u00a0\nDr Quamrul Haider\u00a0is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The government's decision to formulate a policy with the broad objective of including the Bangladeshi diaspora community in its \"march towards development\" and ensuring their wellbeing is a step in the right direction. As per the draft Bangladesh National Diaspora Policy-2023, the diaspora includes those \"Bangladeshi individuals who obtain citizenship of another country or their citizenship status is under process or are permanently living in another country or were born as Bangladeshi-origin or grew up in another country.\" At a recent workshop, the expatriates' welfare minister also confirmed the policy objective, underscoring the importance of involving Bangladeshis living abroad in the country's development journey.\nIt is an unfortunate reality that over the years, there has been a massive amount of \"brain drain\" out of the country. The policy could, in some ways, reverse that as, if properly implemented, it could encourage those Bangladeshis to share their knowledge and expertise leading to a significant boost in the country's development speed. According to a 2021 study of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), there could be an estimated 2.4 million Bangladeshi diaspora members with the UK and the US alone. Therefore, it can be assumed that the total number of Bangladeshis living abroad is huge. Even if a small portion of them contribute their skills and expertise, it could make a huge difference.\nAdditionally, the government will be reportedly looking to facilitate investment opportunities for those living abroad, and the policy will act as a tool to encourage Bangladeshi diaspora to send remittance through authorised channels. This, too, could make a massive difference for our economy. However, it is essential that the government establishes an effective formal framework to complement the policy, which would allow Bangladeshis abroad to make the maximum contribution in terms of our financial, economic and entrepreneurial needs.\nIf we take the case of India, it too has had a similar policy in place for more than two decades. And the reason why it has been successful is because of the foundational blocks that the country's government has managed to lay down over the years. Similarly, we must also develop a strong and transparent system, which makes contributing to the country \u2013 whether in financial or intellectual terms \u2013 easy, rewarding, and hassle-free.\nIt must be acknowledged that Bangladeshis living/working abroad are already making a sizeable contribution to our country. It is incumbent upon the authorities to also ensure their well-being. We are pleased that the government has recognised this. However, its track record of doing so via its missions in foreign countries is not very satisfying. We hope that besides finalising this policy, the government will successfully establish an accountable mechanism that can guarantee that this is done much better in the future.\n",

        "full_article": "It is good to learn that the move to set up a commodity exchange (CX) has gained further momentum as its draft rules are going to be finalised within days. The necessary phases of approval following receiving opinions from stakeholders and the public on the draft rules are also learnt to have been fast tracked. The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE), which initially took the initiative to introduce a CX in the country with the nod from the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) may finally see the light of day this year. In this regard, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) has been assisting CSE in making its bylaws and regulations based on generic regulatory compliance and international best practices.The need for establishing a commodity exchange (CX) which is a legal framework to determine and enforce rules and procedures for trading standardised commodity contracts and related investment products cannot be overemphasised. Given the prevailing volatility in the market where both consumers and producers of farm products and other goods are being deprived of their dues, the creation of a secure marketing system for them has been long overdue.Notably, an effort to this end was made more than one and a half decades back (in 2007). But it could not be materialised thanks to the lack of basic infrastructures such as warehousing facilities, absence of eligible traders and other complexities. Now, with the prospect of having such a platform in the shape of a CX within sight, it is hoped that the existing distortions in the commodity market created by the so-called syndicates or oligopolies could be removed and a level playing field for both producers and consumers could be established. This is also necessary for facilitating proper export and import. It is worthwhile to note at this point that there is a huge global demand for Bangladeshi agricultural products like tea and jute. So, the establishment of the CX would also help exporters to secure the prices of their products. Similarly, some crucial imports are monopolised by a handful of importers. An exchange market, if properly handled, can help break their monopoly. To go by an estimate, the worth of Bangladesh's commodity market is over US$144 billion where an enormous quantity of cotton is imported as a basic raw material, one can easily understand the role CX can play here.However, the CX, also called futures market, is one where traders rarely deliver any physical commodities. On the other hand, what they trade are futures contracts. These are agreements between parties to buy or sell a specific quantity of commodity at a price as agreed at a predetermined date of expiry regardless of what it currently trades in the market. In case of farm produces, experts are of the view that, a CX allows farmers to lock in prices using forward contracting, thus protecting them against any sharp fall in product price. True, the platform (commodity exchange) as envisaged will trade only gold, cotton and crude oil and run on a non-delivery cash settlement system as it does not require warehouse facilities at the preliminary stage. Even so, there is ample scope for inclusion of a wider range of commodities in the future. Hopefully, once CSE's Commodity Exchange (CX) platform takes wings, Bangladesh will soon be able to see itself among its predecessors in the field in South Asia including India, Pakistan and Nepal.",

        "full_article": "Sadly, this is what it has come down to. With the ever-shrinking foreign reserve comes the problem energy experts in the country had been warning about for more than a decade, which policymakers dismissed off-handed. According to a report published in this newspaper, the worst-case scenario is slowly unfolding: \"State energy-agency Petrobangla moves to borrow around US$500 million from the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) at high interest to cover huge LNG-import bills amid forex crunch.\" This is supported by the news published on the ITFC website on May 28 titled, 'ITFC inks $1.4bn Financing Plan with Govt. of Bangladesh for Energy Security'. There it is stated that the Bangladesh government has signed an annual financing plan with ITFC at its headquarter Jeddah whereby this financial package will help facilitate the import of petroleum products by Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) over the period July 2023 to June 2024.Now that the country is squarely in the red in its efforts to balance the books as far as import is concerned, it is increasingly becoming clear that the liquefied natural gas (LNG) experiment is a bust for Bangladesh from an affordability point of view. The foreign loan that is being talked about will be based on secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus 2.0 per cent, or about 7.06 per cent in total. Energy planners are up a gum tree since LNG suppliers and international oil companies (like Chevron) have been pressing the government to pay off unpaid bills for some time now. Both France's Total Energies and Guvnor Singapore issued notices to Petrobangla back in July to clear dues to the tune of $113 million for LNG bought in the Spot market. A failure to pay these dues would result in forfeiture of monetary guarantees with the central bank. Naturally, such a scenario is unthinkable for the State because that would signal to foreign LNG suppliers that Bangladesh is a country that cannot honour its international payments. Petrobangla is also in the soup due to its failure to pay long-term LNG suppliers, i.e., Qatargas and Oman Trading International (OTI) for LNG supplies procured. Reportedly, Petrobangla owes Qatargas $150 million and OTI $80 million. Every time State energy companies miss a regular payment; the government ends up paying LIBOR + 1.0-1.5 per cent on gas bills.Despite pleas from the state agencies and the concerned ministry, the central bank has not been forthcoming to provide dollars to clear invoices. One can understand why. The IMF loan package availed by the government stipulates that foreign exchange reserves cannot go below a certain threshold. Pointing the finger at the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is going to do little to solve the problem of paying for expensive imported fossil fuels. For over a decade, the country's energy planners went overboard building plants to generate more and more power, while neglecting to ensure where the energy needed to fire up these power plants would come from. The last decade was spent building expensive import-centric energy infrastructure and positioning these power plants closer to the coast because it was imagined (erroneously) that there would always be robust economic growth in the country. That the economy would continue to grow at more than 6.0 per cent per annum and the imaginary contracts for long-term sourcing of coal would all fall in place when the power plants came online. With all the focus on LNG and imported coal, successive annual development plans were made with little prioritisation on exploratory drilling (onshore), abandonment of proven domestic coal reserve extraction and lastly, sitting on an outdated model of production sharing contract (PSC) for the offshore gas fields. The country's energy planners are collectively responsible for not doing the multi-client survey and remodelling the PSC in time. Unfortunately, policymakers in this country seem to be suffering from the notion that Bangladesh sits at the centre of the universe and foreign companies are dying to come here for business. No corrective measures were taken when the country's energy-import bills were getting out of control. Despite having ample information about probable natural gas reserves and known coal deposits in the country, the decision to go import-only has resulted in this no-win situation today. The amount of $1.4 billion will take care of energy import bills for the next 12 months. The national exchequer will have to pay that principal amount back plus 7.0 per cent. What will happen if the war in Europe lasts beyond 2025? What will happen if demand for RMG falls and export earning goes down further. It is time to refocus attention to domestic fossil-fuel development. The next few years will be extremely painful financially for the country and all stakeholders because of past mistakes. However, not all is lost. Ample data exist about gas wells in areas like Rashidpur where, if exploration is done in earnest, natural gas may be found and incremental pockets of gas can be added to the national grid. This is the best case scenario for the country at present.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "After five decades of the country's independence, around one-fourth of the country's population is still illiterate. As the current literacy rate stands at 76 per cent, it is a big challenge to attain the 100 per cent literacy in near term especially by 2030 to achieve a critical goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). What is more important is to make the literacy effective and functional. The findings of the latest survey in this connection provide a disappointing picture. Literacy Assessment Survey 2023, prepared and released by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), showed that overall functional literacy rate is around 63 per cent. The rate is higher, 72 per cent, in urban area than rural area where it stood at around 59 per cent. The functional literacy rate is applicable for population above seven years old.It is to be noted that functional literacy is a set of skills that allows individuals to read, write, and comprehend information in a way that enables them to function effectively in their regular lives. It encompasses more than basic reading and writing skills and extends to critical thinking, problem-solving, and language-understanding in various contexts. In other words, it is a kind of tool to measure the strength of general literacy and education. The survey also showed that children or population belonging to age group of 7-14 years has better functional literacy rate, around 73 per cent. It probably indicates that learning process of the children has improved.Though the overall rate of functional literacy is not bad, there are some areas that require more attention to improve the overall literacy in the near future. For instance, some 52 per cent is functionally literate at the advanced level which means people in this category are quite fluent in reading and writing, and also competent in four arithmetic rules (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and mathematical reasoning. At the same time, 12 per cent are functionally illiterate meaning they lack ability to determine alphabet, recognise words or numbers and count money or objects. Again, 14 per cent are functionally semi-literate as they can recognise and write some words and count objects and numbers at a very basic level. Though these are a few of the total findings, some critical things can be inferred from the result. The functional literacy status indicates that the country's overall education system is flawed and disruptive. In the last 50 years, almost all the governments have tried to do some experiments with the education and learning system. Most of the experiments have failed at the cost of students. Instead of properly streamlining the education system, attempts to experiment with curriculum and tests created confusion and chaos. Again, a lack of coordinated approach also undermines the positive efforts to improve the quality of education. Too much focus on tests and grade also drive students to rely on memorisation than comprehension. Though the government has taken various initiatives to make the teaching and learning better, some limitations and drawbacks are still there. That's why, even after completing the secondary level, many people can't write smoothly in Bangla and English. Many also don't comprehend the semi-complex speeches or texts let alone on a higher level. Weakness in basic mathematics is another drawback. The current status of functional literacy also showed the growing disparity in education and learning. Urban students have better logistics and supports in their educational institutions than rural ones. People in urban area has also better options for skill development and training. All these contributed to higher rate of functional literacy in urban areas. Overall, the BBS survey finding is an eye-opener for all and the policymakers need to pay attention to the drawbacks for improvement in the functional literacy. [email\u00a0protected]",
