Last year, it was hailed for developing vaccines that inoculated billions against the coronavirus and underlined its moniker as the \u2018pharmacy of the world\u2019. This year, two Indian drug-manufacturing firms stand accused by two countries of producing toxic cough syrup linked to the deaths of children \u2014 at least 66 in The Gambia and 18 in Uzbekistan. While The Gambia case was highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the second case has been flagged by the Uzbek Health Ministry. In both cases, it is not conclusively established that consuming the syrup directly led to the deaths. What is of concern is that in both countries, batches were spiked with ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol, i.e., industrial chemicals that have no business being inside bottles of cough syrup. The Indian government adopted a truculent stance after the scandal in The Gambia. While the export licence of the Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd., which supplied the syrup to The Gambia, was revoked, Indian authorities, rather than investigating how the cough syrup was spiked, chose to question WHO\u2019s assessment that it was the cough syrup that caused the acute kidney injury linked to the deaths. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) brazened it out with WHO in a letter suggesting that its own tests of \u2018control samples\u2019 of the Maiden Pharma-product showed them to be free of contaminants. It did not address how The Gambian panel\u2019s own tests found the contaminants, or how \u2018control samples\u2019 have nothing to do with the actual spiked samples. The DCGI, and subsequently the Health Ministry, chose to thereafter take the line that The Gambian scandal was part of a conspiracy to \u201cmalign\u201d India\u2019s reputation as a supplier of pharmaceutical goods.In the case of the Noida-based Marion Biotech, which made the Dok-1 Max cough syrup associated with the deaths in Uzbekistan, the Government has again revoked the export licence and, reportedly, ordered a freeze on its production facilities. Because it is early days and there is no WHO-verdict on the causes of contamination here, the Indian government has sought to adopt a wait-and-watch position. It is high time that India takes a serious look at the core issue of why batches of exported cough syrup have been found to be laced with banned chemicals rather than play victim. While mistakes happen, not taking corrective measures is what threatens India\u2019s image and undermines trust in Indian industry.\n\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npharmaceutical\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\nmedicine\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nvaccines",

If in the past his right-wing Likud party had formed diverse governing coalitions with centrist and relatively moderate parties, in the current six-party right-wing coalition, five are ultra-orthodox and far-right Jewish nationalist parties that make even Likud look moderate. The coalition agreement, a document that determines governing agendas, suggests that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government would pursue radical right-wing policies, seeking to expand illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, remake the judicial system by handing more powers to Parliament over courts, and amend the Basic Law, removing hurdles for those with extremist views from contesting elections. Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician convicted for Jewish terror links and inciting racism in 2007, is the Security Minister, with powers over Israel\u2019s police force. Bezalel Smotrich, leader of the ultranationalist Religious Zionism Party, and now the new Finance Minister, wants to fund more Jewish settlements. Some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition members are also known for their anti-LGBT positions.For Mr. Netanyahu and Likud, the formation of Israel\u2019s most right-wing coalition is a natural progression of the politics they have followed. In the past, Mr. Netanyahu embraced ultra-orthodox and right-wing parties, pursued conservative agendas, walked back from peace and cracked down on the Palestinians, and deepened the occupation. It helped him become Israel\u2019s longest serving PM. But the Netanyahu era also reshaped Israel\u2019s politics, pushing it to the extreme right. The Prime Minister has dismissed criticism that his coalition would endanger Israel\u2019s democracy. At the same time, he has projected himself as a tough Prime Minister who would implement the coalition\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to the entire land of Israel,\u201d he said on Wednesday, referring to historical Palestine and suggesting that settlements would continue unabated. If the Knesset passes judicial reforms, the government, with the support of 64 MPs in the 120-member Parliament, can override even Supreme Court rulings. Besides, parties such as the Shas, the United Torah Judaism and Religious Zionism will influence the government\u2019s decisions that could alter the state-religion balance in a country where over 20% of the population are minorities. As Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition seems determined to remake Israel\u2019s politics internally and deepen the occupation and subjugation of the Palestinians externally, it could also quicken the country\u2019s fall into an elected Jewish theocracy.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nPalestine",

The Ukraine-Russia war was the big black swan event of 2022 and what tops the world\u2019s wishlist today is that both of them find a way to negotiate peace. The world\u2019s health and wealth are also closely tied to how China manages its stop-start pandemic games. India has so far done a credible job of riding these geoeconomic headwinds, from managing inflation to rerouting its energy supplies. But the work of returning to its potential growth path will become harder if global recession builds up.\nBesides this knotty economic driving, BJP is also looking at a full election calendar that will specially test its southward skills. New sops for Lingayats and Vokkaligas in Karnataka are indicative of how tough this prestige battle is. Congress\u2019s tough task is to convert Bharat Jodo Yatra\u2019s buzz into electoral successes. Rahul Gandhi must understand that power is not \u2018poison\u2019, it\u2019s a necessity.\n2023 will also test domestic resilience in India\u2019s favourite sport \u2013 cricket. The aesthetic detachment with which Indians could enjoy the football World Cup won\u2019t be available with the ODI World Cup, where the pain of not having won an ICC trophy since 2013 really needs healing.\nBut in addition to resilience, there has to be nimbleness. Past three years are proof that the unexpected happens. If, say, El Nino hurts the monsoon, government and RBI will have to go back to the drawing board, for an even tougher tightrope walk. If Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan pushes Pakistan near implosion, our security will have to step up swiftly. And if the year turns out to be unexpectedly pleasant instead, that will be a welcome breather.\n\n",

Sections of government personnel vote through postal ballots. Since Covid, this facility is available to elderly over 80. But extending voting rights to migrant workers involves far greater numbers and will be through a customised EVM machine that can reportedly cater to 72 constituencies.\nThe 2016-17 Economic Survey tracked annual interstate travel to estimate 6 crore migrant workers between 2001 and 2011. Census 2011 enumerated 45.6 crore migrants, nearly 40% of India\u2019s population. These are huge numbers, suggesting why a large chunk of India isn\u2019t exercising voting rights. The 2020 Bihar and 2022 UP polls clearly point to disenfranchisement of migrant workers. Male electors outnumbered female electors by 40 lakh in Bihar but just 3 lakh more men voted than women, equating to male turnout of 55% and female 60%. Similarly, male electors outnumbered females by 1.1 crore in UP, but just 45 lakh more men voted than women (male turnout was 50%, female 62%).\nWith land, kinship, and sentimental ties to their native state, asking migrants to transfer their vote to the location of work is a sub-par option. The ability to cast votes is key to getting one\u2019s voice heard in the political process. Lack of opportunities triggers most migrations. The exodus of over 1 crore migrant workers during the Covid lockdown hardly became an electoral issue anywhere. With migrants getting to vote, candidates and big netas will have to court this demographic and address their concerns. EC must convince political parties to support this game-changing initiative.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Can you define 2022 in one word? A word that captures the mood and the mode of a year that's passed? What captured your imagination the most: the Ukraine-Russia War, the Fifa World Cup, the inflation, the UK's loss of a Queen and its gain of three PMs in one calendar year, the Climate talks in Egypt, a failed Red Wave in the US, the hair-cutting protests in Iran, the ban on women's higher education in Afghanistan, the resurgence of Covid in China? How about things close at home: the bridge over the river Padma, life in a Metro with a sky-train, or the underwater tunnel in the Karnaphuli River?\nWhile Oxford Dictionary notes that the trendiest term in 2022 was \"goblin mode,\" Collins Dictionary has identified \"splooting.\" The first word means \"a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations.\" We all have a goblin inside of us which needs a little bit of indulgence.\u00a0\nIn 2022, after the Covid-19 inflected hiatus, our inner goblins demanded to be fed, and we obliged.\u00a0\nYou can call it a celebration of life, or a spirit of the age (zeitgeist) that has just had a near-death experience. Then again, the pressure of the overwhelming experience is contained in the verb \"splooting,\" meaning \"the act of lying flat on the stomach with the legs stretched out.\" 2022 made us all feel like a 2D cardboard figure that has just given in (or up).\nThe fascination for a word to express our reality is also evident in the sudden rise of a word game's popularity in 2022. Yes, the most-searched word on Google for 2022 was \"Wordle.\" In February,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0purchased the word-game app created by Welsh software engineer Jonathan Wardle, and the challenge to guess a five-letter word in six attempts became addictive. The feeling of starting a day with a little bit of self-indulgence became popular.\nBut is it possible for words to capture reality? Philosophers, writers, and artists have always debated this issue.\u00a0\nFor some, words limit our expressions. For others, words can be the launching pad for limitless ideas. You can bring home those ideas, or you can use words to set out for new possibilities. 2022 has also been very big for this issue of home and homelessness. The threat of a nuclear Armageddon is more real than ever. We temporarily distracted ourselves by looking for a messiah in Messi. But there remains a sense of uneasiness in all of us. The political, social, and economic crises are creating the push and pull factors that are making people leave their homes.\nQuite fittingly, Dhaka is currently hosting the 19th edition of the Asian Art Biennale, where a total of 649 artworks from 113 countries are being displayed. The theme this year is home and homelessness. Artists creatively articulated their desire of coming together in a place of comfort and their fear of being dislodged and displaced from one's comfort zone. Three main concerns have emerged: poverty, fear, and meaninglessness.\nThe event coincided with the 2022 Fifa World Cup, where the notion of one nation was harped. Morgan Freeman, in his powerful plea at the opening ceremony, called for oneness, inclusion, diversity, and mutual understanding during the greatest show on earth, saying, \"We gather here as one big tribe, and Earth is the tent we all live in.\" The western media, which never liked Qatar being a desert rose, stung back for Freeman's \"paid lip service,\" referring to his earlier comment on his favourite acting role where the veteran actor had quipped, \"The most fun are the ones that pay the most.\"\nThe round leather orb, with its aura of money, had us all under its thrall for an entire month. The glitz and glamour of the Petrodollar made us forget the inflation that has peaked in many parts of the world. Now that winter is here, the pains return like seasonal gouts. The dollar price has soared, and the supply chain of fuel is snapped due to war-related sanctions. Even a rich country such as the UK now runs food banks for six in ten people whose income cannot get them the bare essentials. Even our prime minister has repeatedly urged us to maintain austerity, fearing that there could be a worldwide recession and food shortage.\nHunger has been the main cause of dislocations. In 2022, we noticed unprecedented mass movements. Any visit to a visa service centre will tell you about the movement of skilled and unskilled workers, professionals and intellectuals. Our media often reports how money is flying out of the country to support those who are looking for a home outside their home.\u00a0\nThere is also the movement of less-fortunate refugees and mercenary armed forces, hinting at the troubled territories in different parts of the world. People flee their homes in fear of being persecuted. When they shore up on new shores, they bring new concerns for their hosts. Sometimes they are welcomed, at other times they are not. Politicians and policymakers try their best to bring order through various schemes of control, manoeuvring, and monitoring of the movement. They use big data to control human mobility.\u00a0\nThe apps we had downloaded to acquire vaccine information are now used by the governments to track us. Human mobility data, based on our cellular network locations, helps corporations and government entities to discover population patterns at a micro level. Even when we are away from home, or displaced \u2013 we are never away from their governmentality.\u00a0\nIn 2022, we have become more used to the idea that our private life is no longer private. We all walk wearing the proverbial emperor's new clothes.\nMaybe in 2023, we will stop splooting and switch out of our goblin mode to find a word that is positive and energetic. The mobility next year will be smart and meaningful. Happy new year!\nDr\u00a0Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is a professor of English at Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In the recently concluded Rangpur City Corporation (RpCC) election, Awami League's mayor candidate, Hosne Ara Lutfa Dalia, lost her security deposit as she failed to secure the minimum number of votes required for saving the deposit.\nDefeat of the ruling party candidate was expected, though, as Rangpur is popularly known as a stronghold of the main opposition in the parliament, Jatiya Party (JP), and also the hometown of its founder, the autocratic former ruler HM Ershad. In fact, the AL's top leadership might also have been aware of the possible result and had an intention of giving a walkover to the JP candidate.\nBut did anyone expect that the ruling party candidate would lose her security deposit or manage to bag only eight percent of the votes? Or that she would place fourth in the race?\u00a0\nObviously not. In fact, this is a nightmare for the AL and something it would surely try to shake off as soon as possible.\nAlthough during the election campaign, the AL candidate had highlighted the development activities of the government, none of that seems to have mattered when voting came around.\nDespite it being a stronghold of the Jatiya Party, the ruling AL has a very good position in Rangpur. The first mayor of the city corporation, in 2012-2016, was AL-backed Sarfuddin Ahmed, who had defeated Mostafizar Rahman Mostafa. In the second polls, Mostafizar won, defeating the AL candidate. But this time, the defeat of the ruling party candidate was a shameful one.\nSo, what was different this year?\nOne factor is that the party possibly failed to pick the right candidate for the RpCC polls. Dalia is a lawyer by profession and\u00a0a loyal and seasoned politician. But things changed when\u00a0she was elected through the\u00a0reserved women's seat in the last parliament.\u00a0Since then, she has been disconnected with the people at the grassroots level, as she spent most of her time in Dhaka.\u00a0Hence, other ruling party aspirants getting ahead in that regard and intra-party feuds also contributed to AL's defeat.\nThat's why we saw an Awami League leader, Latifur Rahman, rebelling against the party's decision to contest the election, and subsequently getting more votes than the party-nominated candidate herself. But he, too, lost his security deposit.\nStill, it is evident that the party's selection of a candidate was not right.\nBut the AL general secretary, Obaidul Quader, told journalists that the choice of candidate was correct, and that there were some internal issues.\n\"We have some intra-party problems there [in Rangpur] \u2026We are looking into those. We are going to take major organisational action in Rangpur within a week.\"\nBut intra-party problems are not the only reason behind the defeat of Dalia.\u00a0\nThe other, and to me the most significant point, is that the ruling party's influence over the JP is an open secret to all. And something that the people of Rangpur did not take positively. Whenever the national election comes around, the AL tries to put pressure on the JP. They say that the JP has played a very crucial role for the ruling party in every election since 2009.\u00a0\nBut Jatiya Party leaders were not properly or duly treated by the ruling party members. Many believe that if JP had not sided with the ruling party, it would have been tough for the Awami League to continue in office for as long as it has done.\nThis other point to note is that Ershad's home is located in the RpCC area, whose inhabitants are known to be very close with and loyal to the late former president. In recent months, the drama over JP leadership \u2013 between GM Quader and Rowshan Ershad \u2013 also angered Ershad supporters. So they showed their maximum strength voting for Mostafizar.\nA stunning detail from the RpCC polls is that Amiruzzaman Pial of Islami Andolan Bangladesh secured the second position, defeating both the AL and its rebel candidate. Many said that Amiruzzaman got votes from BNP supporters, who only wanted to ensure a humiliating defeat for the ruling party. Of course, the BNP's position in this northern district is very poor and its election results in recent history have been dismal.\nBesides all this, the RpCC polls also proved that Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) will be a big challenge in countryside polling stations. Media reports show that voting was slowed down due to the use of EVMs. The situation was worse in recent times as voting continued in a few centres till 8pm. Chief election commissioner, Kazi Habibul Awal, said, \"Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) are slow. Besides this, voter turnout is also high. For this reason, voting can be done till 8pm in the night.\"\nSo before taking any final decisions on using EVMs in the next polls, the Election Commission will hopefully think carefully. Otherwise, disaster may ensue as the national election will be held for 300 seats in a single day.\u00a0\nElections are like a festival for the people of Bangladesh. People want to take part in the festivities, and it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to create an atmosphere that people feel welcome to join.\u00a0\nThe lesson to learn for the ruling party is that its activists and supporters are its heart, as they hoisted party flags in the remotest parts of the country defying all odds. So, the AL must think of what those at the grassroots want before picking any candidate. Otherwise, humiliating defeats will occur in free and fair polls.\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "While the government often boasts of its success in bringing the entire country under phone/internet coverage, the situation on the ground is not as rosy as painted. A recent survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has shed some light into the situation, revealing that only 38.9 percent of people in the country use the internet. While around 63.1 percent of households don't think they need to use the internet, 48.2 percent think that internet services are too expensive for them.\nThe survey has found a big gap between the urban and rural internet-using households \u2013 only 29.7 percent of rural households use the internet, while it is 63 percent for urban households. Among other findings by BBS, what's most significant is the division-wise gap in internet usage: while 54.2 percent households in Dhaka use the internet, in Rajshahi, it is only 19.7 percent.\nWhat we can take away from these findings is that affordability is still a big issue when it comes to accessing the internet. At a time when ordinary people are struggling to cope with the high cost of living, using the internet at high costs is a far-fetched dream for many of them. Understandably, it may be one of the reasons why rural people are using internet less than urban people. And the same reason applies for the people of the northern region where the poverty rate is comparatively higher.\nAs Bangladesh is said to be transitioning from \"Digital Bangladesh\" to \"Smart Bangladesh\", the government needs to seriously look into these gaps, which may be a major barrier to reaching its new goal. Although we must admit that the government made major strides in realising the dream of \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021, it would not be wrong to say that it has failed to reach its goal to a large extent. Although the overall number of internet and mobile phone users has increased over the years \u2013 according to BBS, the use of mobile phones at the family level has increased by 9.7 percent in the last 10 years, and their internet usage has also increased by 33.3 percent \u2013 that is not enough. The fact that the percentage of internet users is still as low as 39 percent is simply unacceptable.\nTrue, the BBS survey does not reveal the full picture, but it does give us an idea of the overall situation. The government, therefore, must take the findings seriously and find out the real reasons behind the low internet penetration. Making the internet affordable to all and bringing down the prices of necessary devices will go a long way in making our people digitally active. Last but not the least, only making the internet available and affordable to all will not help, unless people are given the necessary trainings \u2013 on programming, coding, cybersecurity, etc. \u2013 to reap the full benefits of ICT.\n",

        "full_article": "Rajuk is at it again, dragging itself into a problem that didn't exist and making a terrible job of recovering from it. The latest blunder from the city development authority of Dhaka saw it lose from its server documents of some 30,000 customers seeking approval of building plans. What's worse, even after three weeks have passed, it has made no probe committee to investigate the incident and no breakthrough in recovering lost documents, leaving room for corruption and further harassment of the applicants. This is totally unacceptable.\nAccording to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, the lost documents were of customers who had applied for approval of building plans between May 2019 and December 6, 2022. Apparently, the website through which they applied became \"inactive\" then, wiping all their data. Although the website was reactivated later, there has been no progress in restoring the data. This hardly seems like the result of a simple technical glitch, given the timing of the breach and the lukewarm response of the authorities.\nAccording to sources at Rajuk, this could be an inside job, done potentially to allow some quarters to build higher buildings. As per the latest Rajuk-formulated Detailed Area Plan (DAP), which was approved by the government on August 23, buildings must be of lower height than before in most areas. But following requests from landowners and real estate companies, Rajuk decided that those who had applied for permit before August 23 can construct buildings under previous rules, allowing them increased height/size. On December 4, Rajuk published a notice in this regard. Two days later, its website went down, raising suspicion that this was done intentionally to allow manipulating the process to show a pre-August 23 application date, change building plans, etc.\nWhatever the cause or motive may be, questions can be raised about Rajuk's willingness to get to the bottom of the truth: Why has no probe committee been formed yet? Who will take responsibility for the suffering and harassment of applicants? In the absence of verifiable documents, many will also likely have trouble in getting construction loans from banks. And what is the point of putting building services online if there is no guarantee of the safety of documents filed?\nThis lack of action and accountability for those responsible is but a small example of how Rajuk operates, without any concern for the wellbeing of general customers and residents. Over the years, Rajuk has been frequently at the centre of controversies. Corruption and mismanagement have been its two most enduring bywords, which have sustained even after the digitalisation of its services. Rajuk's failure to formulate a suitable plan for our sprawling capital \u2013 or stick to whatever plan there is through proper enforcement \u2013 has cost this city dearly, with its flood flow zones indiscriminately filled up,\u00a0its greenery all but gone through mindless\u00a0development, and residents/applicants harassed regularly through red tape and irregularities.\nDespite that, Rajuk has remained unaccountable. We urge the authorities to address the recent data breach, but also make sure Rajuk is held responsible for its inactions, irregularities and failures.\n",

        "full_article": "While the government often boasts of its success in bringing the entire country under phone/internet coverage, the situation on the ground is not as rosy as painted. A recent survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has shed some light into the situation, revealing that only 38.9 percent of people in the country use the internet. While around 63.1 percent of households don't think they need to use the internet, 48.2 percent think that internet services are too expensive for them.\nThe survey has found a big gap between the urban and rural internet-using households \u2013 only 29.7 percent of rural households use the internet, while it is 63 percent for urban households. Among other findings by BBS, what's most significant is the division-wise gap in internet usage: while 54.2 percent households in Dhaka use the internet, in Rajshahi, it is only 19.7 percent.\nWhat we can take away from these findings is that affordability is still a big issue when it comes to accessing the internet. At a time when ordinary people are struggling to cope with the high cost of living, using the internet at high costs is a far-fetched dream for many of them. Understandably, it may be one of the reasons why rural people are using internet less than urban people. And the same reason applies for the people of the northern region where the poverty rate is comparatively higher.\nAs Bangladesh is said to be transitioning from \"Digital Bangladesh\" to \"Smart Bangladesh\", the government needs to seriously look into these gaps, which may be a major barrier to reaching its new goal. Although we must admit that the government made major strides in realising the dream of \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021, it would not be wrong to say that it has failed to reach its goal to a large extent. Although the overall number of internet and mobile phone users has increased over the years \u2013 according to BBS, the use of mobile phones at the family level has increased by 9.7 percent in the last 10 years, and their internet usage has also increased by 33.3 percent \u2013 that is not enough. The fact that the percentage of internet users is still as low as 39 percent is simply unacceptable.\nTrue, the BBS survey does not reveal the full picture, but it does give us an idea of the overall situation. The government, therefore, must take the findings seriously and find out the real reasons behind the low internet penetration. Making the internet affordable to all and bringing down the prices of necessary devices will go a long way in making our people digitally active. Last but not the least, only making the internet available and affordable to all will not help, unless people are given the necessary trainings \u2013 on programming, coding, cybersecurity, etc. \u2013 to reap the full benefits of ICT.\n",

        "full_article": "Rajuk is at it again, dragging itself into a problem that didn't exist and making a terrible job of recovering from it. The latest blunder from the city development authority of Dhaka saw it lose from its server documents of some 30,000 customers seeking approval of building plans. What's worse, even after three weeks have passed, it has made no probe committee to investigate the incident and no breakthrough in recovering lost documents, leaving room for corruption and further harassment of the applicants. This is totally unacceptable.\nAccording to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, the lost documents were of customers who had applied for approval of building plans between May 2019 and December 6, 2022. Apparently, the website through which they applied became \"inactive\" then, wiping all their data. Although the website was reactivated later, there has been no progress in restoring the data. This hardly seems like the result of a simple technical glitch, given the timing of the breach and the lukewarm response of the authorities.\nAccording to sources at Rajuk, this could be an inside job, done potentially to allow some quarters to build higher buildings. As per the latest Rajuk-formulated Detailed Area Plan (DAP), which was approved by the government on August 23, buildings must be of lower height than before in most areas. But following requests from landowners and real estate companies, Rajuk decided that those who had applied for permit before August 23 can construct buildings under previous rules, allowing them increased height/size. On December 4, Rajuk published a notice in this regard. Two days later, its website went down, raising suspicion that this was done intentionally to allow manipulating the process to show a pre-August 23 application date, change building plans, etc.\nWhatever the cause or motive may be, questions can be raised about Rajuk's willingness to get to the bottom of the truth: Why has no probe committee been formed yet?

        "full_article": "A study presented recently by the Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID) on the corporate tax receipt regime unsurprisingly finds that despite the country charging one of the highest corporate tax rates in the region, the share of the same has remained dismally low at around 1.6 per cent of GDP. This has been the case for many years now. Until 2019-20, the average corporate income tax per company was about Tk 15 million which rose by a third to about Tk 20 million in 2020-21. Globally, the use of direct taxation by governments has had a two-fold result. First it is a primary source of revenue for the exchequer, and second, the regime of progressive taxation is used precisely as a means to tackle income equalities in society. Unfortunately, as things stand now, the very high rate of corporate taxation levied has resulted in distortion of financial statements by companies in order to pay lower amounts of tax. This defeats the whole purpose of taxation to begin with.Experts in the field including former top tax officials, academics and bureaucrats belonging to the finance division have suggested various ways to tackle this problem. If one looks at the current regime of corporate taxation, ranging anywhere from 12 to 45 per cent, it begs the question as to why the revenue body is sticking to this mantra despite its failure to yield the desired results. Looking at what has been presented, it is easy to see that the present progressive income tax regime has not benefitted from the rapid growth of the economy, primarily because the tax authority has kept its focus on a narrow tax base. Indeed, only 15,000 individuals paid the wealth surcharge amounting to Tk 6.0 billion, which is a spit in the ocean. In a country of around 170 million people working in an economy that has crossed the US$400 billion mark, it is obvious that more than 15,000 people should be paying the wealth surcharge. What is understood from recent media reports is that the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is seriously understaffed, lacking in manpower, logistics, infrastructure and technology to keep abreast of the fast expanding individual tax-payer base that has increased to more than 240,000 from about 50,000 a decade ago. The NBR is stretched too thin to service the existing (individual) tax payers. Added to that is the entire corporate world, which in theory, should be paying much higher taxes than individuals, but not to the extent that it becomes convenient for companies to distort financial records. Thus the national exchequer is being deprived of billions of taka in taxation. Again, the NBR's inability to properly scrutinise individual / company tax returns does not help matters.All this leads to widening the rich-poor divide. According to the Household Income-Expenditure Survey (HIES), income share of the bottom 40 per cent of the population fell from 17 per cent in the '90s to 13 per cent in 2016. But income share of the bottom 5.0 per cent declined from 1.03 per cent to just 0.23 per cent. Since the revenue base is shrinking, it is natural for public expenditure to follow suit and this is fuelling inequality. The country needs proper direct taxation as it is directly correlated to public spending for public benefit. For any meaningful change to happen, it is necessary to revamp the NBR, equipping it with the tools and technology so that it can address the loopholes and expand the direct tax base. It is time to move away from indirect taxation, reduce corporate taxation and increase the tax spread. This way the government has more resources to expend for public good and reduce the widening inequality.",

        "full_article": "Winter in this part of the world is mostly pleasant. This is the season when electricity bill plummets with electric fans and air coolers at homes, in office buildings and at other commercial centres remaining out of use. According to a report published in this paper on December 29, \"electricity generation across Bangladesh now hovers over one-third of the capacity with all diesel-fired and many gas-fired power plants lying idle due to sagging winter demand.\" That translates into around 5,500 MW (megawatts) of power that has been laid off for the winter season. No need to get too comfortable, though, because the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the Rural Electrification Board (REB) are presently counting capacity payments to power plants that are deliberately being kept idle. The contracts are signed in such a manner. As we move towards 2023, bad news looms on the horizon in the global fuel oil market. According to international media, the US benchmark oil price rose on Monday (December 26) evening \"and early on Tuesday to above $80 per barrel after China announced on Monday a major easing of its Covid travel quarantine rules\". Now that's great news for China and oil producing nations, but not so good for Bangladesh because we are a net oil-importing country. But then this was inevitable and if our policymakers are under the impression that the country is going to get \"friendship\" discount prices from its existing suppliers, it may be in for a great disappointment.For over a decade energy experts had been demanding that a second oil refinery be set up, but that fell on deaf ears. Hence, when Russia was sanctioned by the West and started selling oil at a discount to China and India, Bangladesh was left high-and-dry. Today, policymakers are talking big about a proposed pipeline from India, which will in all probability, take a while to construct and commission. Working out all the modalities of payment and grade of oil that will be supplied via this proposed pipeline will also take some time to complete.Getting back to the issue of global oil prices, some international energy media outlets are reporting that the price of oil will be going up rather than down, at least in the short term. The Russo-Ukrainian war gives the picture of a war of attrition and inflated egos, with neither side willing to sit at the negotiating table to hammer out a workable peace treaty that would lead to cessation of hostilities. Then there is talk of a possible Belarusian involvement in the war, which could potentially draw in other nations and that could spell even greater trouble, not just geopolitically, but for the overall energy sector on a global scale. Perhaps Armageddon can be avoided, but the economic troubles are just beginning for everyone, including Bangladesh. With China re-emerging from a two-year hiatus, its economy will be hungry for all sorts of fossil fuels. It has both economic might and a deep purse to lure precious energy supplies its way. Unfortunately for the people of this country, hard facts never seemed to make any sense to policymakers. The country has wasted a decade planning for sources of energy that would come from foreign destinations. The leading energy experts of the country had been warning policymakers that this is sheer folly. Regardless of how many proven data sheets were presented in the innumerable seminars on energy security over the last decade, policymakers always knew better. So, the country decided to forgo exploration of natural resources--- both gas and coal. Today, the nation is being told that renewable energy is the way forward for Bangladesh. While in the rest of the world from India to China to Europe, from the Middle East to continental America, nations are all expending billions and expanding the use of coal and LNG (only for the rich), Bangladesh is going to solve the energy crisis using renewable energy. Bangladesh is actually in the \"green\". It doesn't pose any threat to global warming as its carbon footprint is less than negligible. Yet, the country refused to secure its energy basket by doing what the major economies in the region, i.e. India and China have done - secured their economies by investing in coal, gas, oil and nuclear energy. Good luck to Bangladesh in the coming year. Luck and a lot of divine blessings will be needed. Because from February-end or thereabouts, energy demand will rebound and god only knows where the money will come from to import oil for the power plants.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "So, another year draws to its close today. At zero hour midnight in different time zones, people will welcome the New Year, 2023, as they celebrated a year ago to greet the outgoing year. It is an irreversible cycle of Nature. As in the previous years, the outgoing year also has been eventful and will be remembered for happenings, both sweet and sour. From individual to the state, there have been various events of celebrations and sorrows. Besides extraordinary achievements, there have been disappointments as well as tragic moments in the lives of people the world over. On a global scale, the year is remarkable for various things. First, the world substantially recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. After almost two years of lockdown, restrictions, slowdown, deaths, illnesses, sufferings and vaccinations, normalcy came back. Though the spread of Omicron variant had appeared as a new threat and took a heavy toll in the first quarter, it eased later. However, the return to normalcy was seriously jolted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which turned into a full-scale war of devastation. There is no indication that the war will end soon. Thus, the world will embrace 2023 with a prolonged war as well as extended humanitarian crises. The year also witnessed extreme weathers of climate change in the form of unprecedented heat waves, severe droughts and heavy floods in various parts of the world. All these remind us that Nature can no longer absorb the reckless ruinous activities of humans. But, unfortunately, driven by limitless greed and selfishness, human beings are yet to pay attention to the reminder. This will prove costly in the long run. In Bangladesh, the formal inauguration of Padma Bridge is a landmark event. The bridge is not just a physical infrastructure for better connectivity but also a symbol of vibrant Bangladesh. And the opening of the country's first metro rail in Dhaka in the last week of December only adds another feather to the country's development cap. With a number of remarkable advancements, the country has also faced some man-made disasters which exposed the vulnerabilities of unbalanced development. For instance, major fire incidents in Sitakknuda, Narayagang and Chowkbazar took a heavy toll on lives and property in the outgoing year. Although Bangladesh languishes at the bottom of football ranking, the euphoria of fans here over Football World Cup was something exceptional. It was a great relief from the gloomy and unhappy tryst with destiny. The World Cup football tournament, sometimes dubbed the greatest show on earth, took place in several stadiums of Qatar this year. Ended with Lionel Messi of Argentina finally lifting the trophy, the month-long event is unforgettable, no doubt. Finally, Bangladesh, as well as the whole world, has witnessed high inflation in the outgoing year that eroded real income and purchasing power. Inflation which is unlikely to come down soon becomes a big challenge in the Year 2023 and fighting against inflation will continue in the near future. Every year starts with many expectations and hopes notwithstanding many odds and uncertainties. At the end of the year, stocktaking shows that it was a mixed bag for all. So, let's hope for the best in the New Year that will arrive tomorrow. [email\u00a0protected]",
