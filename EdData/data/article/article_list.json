However, a bone of contention relates to intellectual property rights, and has persisted as an issue since 2008. Switzerland and Norway, which are prominent members of EFTA, host several of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are responsible for several of the drugs and therapeutics that underpin health care globally. The nature of the pharma industry \u2014 it costs much to discover a useful effective drug and relatively little to make generic copies of it \u2014 with demand that is far disproportionate to affordability, means that there is a constant tussle between the inventors and the generic-drug companies. Patenting, or an exclusive monopoly for a fixed number of years to originators and a reciprocal right by governments to issue directions for \u2018compulsory licensing,\u2019 thereby selectively breaking such monopolies in the interest of public health, has brokered the peace and sustained the global pharma industry for decades. But new legal innovations such as data exclusivity continue to inveigle themselves in free trade negotiations. Under this provision, all the clinical-trial data that concerns the safety and efficacy of a drug generated by the originator firm becomes proprietary and out of bounds for a minimum period of six years. Permission to make a generic is possible if a country\u2019s regulator can rely on supplied clinical trial data to approve a drug. For this, generic makers usually rely on the originator\u2019s published data.The principle of data exclusivity is present among European countries as well as in agreements involving many developing countries. Were it to take effect in India, it could significantly hinder India\u2019s drug industry which is also a major exporter of affordable drugs. Indian officials have rejected data exclusivity as a point of negotiations in the FTA, though leaked drafts of the agreement suggest that it is alive. However, India\u2019s rise up the drug manufacturing chain in the last few decades means that it must invest in an ecosystem that can conduct ethical drug trials and make new molecules and therapeutics from scratch. The paradigm that drug development will always be expensive and confined to the West need not be permanent, as was seen in the development of several novel technology approaches to developing vaccines in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. But as preparation, India must invest substantially more in fundamental research to incubate the local drug industry into the future.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntrade agreements\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\npharmaceutical\n\n/\n\nbiotechnology\n\n/\n\ngeneric drugs\n\n/\n\nexports\n\n/\n\nmedicine\n\n/\n\nmedical research\n\n/\n\nvaccines\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nSwitzerland",

On the face of it, the action seems disproportionate to the charges, and an appellate tribunal has subsequently allowed the political party to operate the accounts on the condition that an amount of \u20b9115 crore is kept in lien until the case is heard next week. The party says it does not have such amounts in its current accounts. Just weeks before the general election, the principal Opposition party of the country finds itself restrained by a central agency. It is worrying that this falls into a pattern of enforcement agencies targeting those fighting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Income-Tax department action against the Congress relates to tax returns filed by the party for FY2018-19. The party had missed the deadline of December 31, 2019 by about 45 days to file the returns. Of the receipts of \u20b9199 crore recorded in the income-tax returns, \u20b914,40,000 was in cash, which the party says was given by its Members of Parliament and Members of the Legislative Assembly. The demand of a penalty of \u20b9210 crore is for a 45-day delay in filing the returns, and a discrepancy, if at all, of \u20b914.40 lakh. The Income-Tax department\u2019s action appears high-handed and is clearly meant to paralyse the Congress.This unusual I-T move came to light a day after the Supreme Court of India expanded on the link between money and politics in a verdict that held the secretive electoral bond scheme to be unconstitutional. Money has the power to influence politics, and disparity in access to funds can create political inequality and distort electoral outcomes. The Court\u2019s judgment echoed this in its verdict which held the electoral bond scheme as violative of fundamental rights. The BJP has championed the scheme that allows anonymous donors to contribute unlimited amounts to parties as an instrument to combat electoral corruption. Stalling the bank account of the Opposition, regardless of the Income-Tax department\u2019s allegations, cannot be viewed as routine law enforcement. Weaponisation of the law against political opponents of the ruling party has become a serious threat to India\u2019s democracy. The brazen partisanship of central agencies that target the critics of the government is undermining the political system. The claim that all this is being done for fighting corruption and ensuring transparency cannot be taken at face value. All stakeholders must be accountable in a democracy, and the ruling party more so. When accountability is invoked for scuttling the political activity of the Opposition, that can only bode ill for democracy. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntaxes and duties\n\n/\n\nbanking\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nbonds\n\n/\n\ndemocracy",

We recently had frustrated passengers in Mumbai airport sitting on the runway to eat.\nLame excuses |\u00a0The preferred excuse of aviation companies and GOI officials is that there are infra constraints because passenger traffic has exceeded pre-Covid levels. Wasn\u2019t it a normal outcome of mobility constraints being removed and return of normalcy?\nMissing regulatory action |\u00a0GOI pulled out all stops to help the aviation industry, which was severely affected by Covid. For a while even a floor price for tickets was fixed. The same level of attentiveness is not extended to passengers. Aviation regulator DGCA concentrates mainly on operational safety. It did issue a show cause notice to Air India, but recurring offences suggest India doesn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism that\u2019s effective enough.\nDomestic aviation today is a near-duopoly.

        "full_article": "Sadly, bad news never seems to leave consumers alone in this country. The recent report of a study done by the 'Environment al and Social Development Organisation (ESDO) in collaboration with the Wonjin Institute for Occupational and Environmental Health (WIOEH) of South Korea' as carried by this paper says that alarming levels of paraben in toothpaste, handwash and skin care products has been found in Bangladesh. Paraben is known to be a chemical additive and the presence of high levels of this chemical plays havoc with the body's endocrine system, something that is vital for regulating hormones. Apparently, this chemical belongs to a group of compounds that is used as a preservative in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics, as well as the food industry. The problem isn't there. As found by the study conducted by the institutes, samples from Bangladeshi products were compared to similar products from seven other countries to get an estimate about what the levels of the chemical is in local products. Unfortunately, the level of paraben in domestically produced items was found to have the highest concentration of the said chemical in personal care products. Now, care products range from hand wash to beautification. With the advent of Covid-19, the use of handwash became synonymous with people across the nation as a way to rid themselves of unwanted germs. That trend has continued and handwash sales have stayed high in the post-covid period because it also allows for convenience as containers can be refilled using liquid soap and re-used several times. Hand soaps are considered to be an evolution over the bar soap and has been widely accepted for use at homes, restaurants, hotels, commercial establishments and so on.Again, going by what has been published in this newspaper, \"cosmetics and personal care products often contain different types of paraben as preservatives because they are effective and affordable.\" The problem in Bangladesh is oversight. The regulatory mechanism and enforcement of health guidelines are simply not followed in many sectors because of a lack of monitoring and enforcement. The penalty system that exists for law breakers and errant companies favours those establishments and not the consumers. The legal situation is one of great complexity and lengthy and hence litigation against companies that are caught endangering public health get lost in the milieu of hundreds or thousands of other cases that take precedence over the consumers' right to safe products.That this dangerous chemical has been found to be widely prevalent in daily usage products like toothpaste and handwash needs to be treated seriously. This is a public health issue. Had the tests been done in the country, they could be discounted but they were done in foreign laboratories and hence negligence or unprofessionalism can largely be discounted.While many other nations have forbidden the very use of paraben in the products mentioned here, the many variations of paraben continue to see wide usage in the country. There is a general tendency to trash foreign reports as propaganda against the State and one must wait to see if health authorities will take this study seriously or not. The government needs to upgrade its own testing facilities and revamp the safety regime that govern consumer products in Bangladesh. This is but one study that has found non-permissible levels of chemicals that are increasingly being banned in other countries because they are deemed to be a public health hazard issue. The general tendency in this country has been to sweep issues like this under the carpet. One can only hope that the present leadership in the ministry of health will look out for the safety of the general populace over that of profits.",

        "full_article": "As the 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is set to start next week in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are struggling hard to secure their trade benefits in the multilateral forum. Currently, 35 members (including Bangladesh) of the WTO are LDCs, as per the United Nations benchmarks, and formed the LDC Group in the organisation. As the group's coordinator, the African country Djibouti, submitted the draft LDC ministerial declaration in the second week of January. The draft declaration contains two sets of priorities: one is LDC-specific, and the other is general. The LDC-specific priorities are placed in four key areas: (a) agriculture and food security, (b) fisheries subsidies, (c) decisions on graduation, and (d) paragraph 8 of the MC12 outcome document. Of these, LDC graduation is the most critical, especially for the LDCs already on the path to coming out of the category within three to five years. Bangladesh, along with Nepal and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, will formally come out from the UN-defined category by the end of 2026. More LDCs will follow these countries. There are 45 LDCs, of which 15 are now on the path to graduation, and 10 are WTO members. Last December, Bhutan came out from the list.In the document placed for MC13, LDCs categorically emphasised 'the need for fresh support measures by the development partners targeted to LDCs after graduation to ensure smooth and sustainable transition.'Five months ago, in October last, the General Council meeting of the WTO decided to encourage members of the organisations to provide a smooth and sustainable transition period for the graduated LDCs before withdrawing the unilateral tariff or duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access to these countries have been enjoying as LDCs. The decision becomes a big boost to the LDCs, although it is not binding. It is also unlikely that the scheduled ministerial conference will make it binding instead of keeping it voluntary or 'best endeavour' for the member countries. In that case, a continuation of the benefits for the LDCs after graduation will entirely depend on the willingness of the market access-providing countries. In other words, LDCs have to negotiate separately or bilaterally to enjoy the benefit for an extended period. Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), at a proposal regarding MC13, urged the Bangladesh government to take proactive action plans to negotiate with the respective DFQF and GSP granting countries and preferential trade agreements partners for extension of all support measures for at least three years after the graduation following the European Union's Everything But Arms (EBA) extension for three years for graduating LDCs. EU and the United Kingdom (UK) currently offer DFQF benefits for all the graduated LDCs for three additional years. In the last ministerial conference, LDCs stressed the extension of international support measures (ISM) available under WTO in favour of graduating LDCs and proposed to phase out unilateral trade preferences granted to these countries for six years or a period determined by the preference-giving country. It was not accepted at the conference, however. The continuation of the trade-related benefits is necessary to ensure the smooth graduation and contain any abrupt disruption in trade in goods and services of the countries, as per the spirit of the UN General Assembly Resolution. Between 2018 and 2022, LDCs' exports of goods and services increased at an average annual rate of 7.1 per cent, according to the estimate provided by the WTO secretariat. LDCs' share in global trade in goods and commercial services increased from 0.95 per cent in 2018 to 1.02 per cent in 2022. And LDCs' share in global exports reached 1.23 per cent in 2022, which is far below the target set in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Target 17.11 of SDGs underscored doubling the least developed countries' share of global exports by 2020. It means that LDCs' share in global exports should be at least 1.92 per cent in 2020, which was 0.96 per cent in 2015, the year of launching the SDGs. Thus, the countries need continuous support in the multilateral trade forum.Moreover, those advancing to become non-LDC also require support to make the transition smooth and effective. It is, however, challenging to secure support in the upcoming conference as some developed countries, mainly the United States (US), have strong reservations. Advanced developed countries like India are also less interested in backing the LDC's demand. So, there is no alternative to persistent, tough negotiation, no matter how disappointing that is.The LDC-specific international support measures also include exemption from the prohibition of export subsidies and an extended transition period up to 2033 for the LDCs on implementing the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), especially for pharmaceutical products. Currently, there is no provision for a transition period, so when an LDC officially becomes a non-LDC, it will not be able to enjoy the benefits, which means it has to abolish the export subsidies immediately and face stringent IP requirements. Developed and developing countries have already put several issues of their interests on the negotiation table and are working hectically to get some of those in the outcome documents. Decisions on prohibiting fisheries subsidies, permanent solutions on public stockholding (PSH) of foods, and reforms of the WTO's dispute settlement system are top agendas where Bangladesh and all the LDCs can do little but watch. The withdrawal of suspension of e-commerce taxation is also critical, where Bangladesh has some interests. Then, plurilateral deals on domestic regulations on services trade and e-commerce are also proposed by some members. As the final days of the conference approaches, the temperature of intense fighting rises.[email\u00a0protected]",

The biodiversity of Sundarbans has long been under threat due to over-extraction of its resources, poaching, and the adverse effects of climate change. And now a faction of fishermen is spreading certain types of poison in rivers adjacent to the Sundarbans only to catch fish by killing them all! In this way, the predatory and short-sighted fishermen are not only depleting the marine resources by killing even the fry, but also wreaking havoc on the entire biodiversity of the world's largest mangrove forest.All marine and wildlife, without exception, is under threat by all the poison entering this fragile ecosystem. Even the iconic Royal Bengal Tigers, symbols of strength and majesty, are not spared. Observers claim that at least five tigers succumbed to death by poisoning in the Sarankhola range alone over the past four years. Additionally, the indiscriminate disposal of plastic waste by tourists in forest rivers further compounds the dangers faced by the Sundarbans often referred to as the lungs of Bangladesh.The root cause of these challenges lies in the lack of effective forest management, where violations of rules and regulations have become the norm rather than the exception. Poison fishing is just one manifestation of the widespread over-extraction of forest resources, which necessitates immediate action to curb this destructive practice and ensure the proper conservation of this globally renowned mangrove sanctuary.The communities living on the periphery of the Sundarbans face limited employment opportunities, leading to a heavy reliance on dwindling forest resources such as fish, timber, and honey. The poor people trying to eke out a living do not hesitate to violate the law, exacerbating further strain on the forest.Addressing these challenges requires a serious multifaceted approach, encompassing both conservation efforts and socio-economic development initiatives. Sustainable forest management practices, coupled with making fishermen aware of the consequences of dangerous fishing tactics and the creation of alternative livelihood opportunities, are essential to alleviate pressure on the Sundarbans and its inhabitants. Experts have continuously emphasised the urgent need for maintaining biodiversity of the mangrove forest that has great tourism potential and safeguards the southwestern region from the onslaught of storms. But nothing will work as long as the forest department remains passive observers when the water of the rivers crisscrossing the mangrove forest is being made toxic by spreading poison and the fauna is being willfully depleted by poachers. The Coast Guard and local members of law enforcing agencies occasionally conduct drives, but such sporadic actions will not deliver the desired result. The injection of poison into the veins of the Sundarbans, a world heritage site, is bleaching an increasing number of animals to death both in water and on land. These evil acts must not continue with such callous disregard and impunity. A comprehensive drive and constant vigil by a joint team of the Forest Department, Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard is urgently needed before it's too late. The Forest Department and Coast Guard should be equipped with modern facilities necessary to contain the acts of crimes in the Sundarbans and maintain 24-hour vigilance in every corner of the forest. Only through effective concerted efforts and long-term planning now can we ensure the survival of the Sundarbans and preserve its invaluable biodiversity for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.[email\u00a0protected]",
