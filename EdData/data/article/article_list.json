While the day\u2019s developments have not yielded conclusive reasons for the stampede that happened in the early hours of January 29, initial investigations suggest an uncontrolled surge of devotees at the bathing ghats. The Uttar Pradesh government had estimated that a hundred million people would have their holy dips on Mauni Amavasya, an auspicious occasion which fell on January 29. According to government estimates, more than a third of those who were expected had performed the ritual early \u2014 36 million people by 10 a.m. \u2014 despite temporary closures of the roads leading to Prayagraj after the stampede. This measure of regulating traffic into the city could have been proactively implemented, ensuring a steady and manageable stream of devotees, as the government was well aware of a surge in numbers. The focus, unsurprisingly, is again on the lack of crowd management and the prioritisation of VIP visitors over the common man.What has been even more alarming was the State government\u2019s delay in formally announcing the fatalities and those injured \u2014 30 dead and over 60 injured \u2014 deviating from established protocols of transparency during disasters. It is reminiscent of the opacity of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his government after the widespread deaths during the second COVID-19 wave in March 2021, the scale of which was evident later when horrific images of bodies floating in the Ganga emerged. This is the sixth stampede in one of the Kumbhs in the past 70 years, an event that takes place every three years at one of four holy sites for Hindus, at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain. While the reasons for each stampede have been different, they still point to either a lack of fire safety, crowd mismanagement and VIPs disruptions, or creaking infrastructure. They also indicate a post-facto treatment of the cause and a disregard for holistic planning. The State government has been most innovative in managing the 45-day-long Maha Kumbh, with aerial surveillance and a tracking of mobile movements to monitor people. It is also an unprecedented achievement to even attempt to handle a population, although transitionary, that is twice that of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s, between January 13 and February 26 when the Maha Kumbh ends. The Hindu had reported on the arrangements for the 65 kilometre temporary district around the Triveni Sangam, but the confluence itself is only about a kilometre in diameter, requiring constant vigil and steady crowd management.

        "full_article": "The efficacy of a welfare programme is directly proportional to the enthusiasm of the government implementing it. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) will soon be completing 20 years of its implementation. The fact that it has not only survived but also thrived under two regimes across multiple terms suggests its utility and popularity among the rural poor, though, under the National Democratic Alliance, the scheme has acquired a status of being an unwanted necessity after being seen initially as someone else\u2019s baby. But as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, the MGNREGS was a necessity and vital in terms of the sustenance it provided to both rural workers and migrant labour returning to their rural homes after the lockdowns were announced. And it is fair to say that it is now seen as \u201cunwanted\u201d, as allocations in percentage terms of consecutive Budgets have reduced substantially since the pandemic (from 3.2% in FY21 to 1.78% in FY25 (BE)). Besides, despite the fact that the scheme is demand driven, inevitably leading to the allocation of additional funds beyond the budgeted expenditure, no extra allocation for MGNREGS has been made this financial year even as wages have been delayed and, due to this, demand also suppressed artificially. Reportedly, the Rural Development Ministry was short of \u20b94,315 crore for the wages and the Centre has a liability of \u20b95,715 crore against its share for material component of the works to be done under the scheme.There are other issues with MGNREGS implementation that require attention \u2014 the need to adjust wages to inflation, and the issues concerning the seeding of job cards with the Aadhaar-based payment system, among others. But the core of the scheme remains the adequacy of the allocations made for it by the Centre. By pruning funds, the purpose of providing demand-driven employment is under-served and it is unfair to rural workers across the country who have used the scheme to augment their incomes, especially in the agricultural off-seasons. There has been much academic study detailing the fruits of the scheme \u2014 from helping the destitute to creating village assets such as irrigation canals, rural roads, and water conservation facilities. A demand-driven exercise such as this scheme also puts disposable income in the hands of the village poor and helps the rural economy. The importance of MGNREGS in a country still facing rural poverty needs no elaboration. The Union government must change its attitude towards the MGNREGS. A substantial allocation in the Union Budget, that is true to the demand for the scheme, would be a good start.\r Published - January 30, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        welfare\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        National Democratic Alliance\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        budgets and budgeting\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        ministers (government)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Aadhaar\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        personal income\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economy (general)",

        "full_article": "Mountains of data and cutting-edge chips are essential ingredients, but freedom of expression is the secret sauce\nChina aims to be world\u2019s AI superpower by 2030, so when its homemade DeepSeek model pipped ChatGPT on Apple\u2019s app store last weekend, many, including stock markets, thought it had scaled the summit. Markets are fickle. They swing from wild optimism \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s surge since ChatGPT\u2019s release in Nov 2022 \u2013 to despair in a minute. But three days after the funk, maybe we can take stock calmly. Is US beaten in the AI race? Has China\u2019s abundance of data trumped America\u2019s chip might? What happens now?\nFirstly, the race is far from over. The eventual goal is artificial general intelligence or AGI \u2013 endowing machines with the ability to learn and reason like humans \u2013 and nobody\u2019s even close to it. Secondly, DeepSeek\u2019s impressive mainly because it was built on a (claimed) shoestring budget of $6mn, without the benefit of cutting-edge chips. As for research and writing algorithms, China has gone neck-and-neck with US for years, so no surprise there.\nHowever, for AI or any other tech to thrive, openness also matters. Insular USSR took the lead in the space race with Sputnik 1, but we know how the Cold War ended. S Korea is open, N Korea is not, and look how they\u2019ve fared. China isn\u2019t open either. When TOI asked DeepSeek, \u201cWhat happened in Tiananmen Square?\u201d, we got an apology for an answer. No matter how powerful an AI model is, it can\u2019t realise its full potential under censorship. Chinese AI also has to contend with controls on govt data that includes everything from weather to tax returns. In 2015, China was ranked 93rd for openness of govt data, while US was 8th.\nChinese apps can of course siphon user data worldwide, but this opportunity is shrinking. TikTok\u2019s struggles in US are a case in point. India has banned many Chinese apps for years, Western nations are also increasingly uncomfortable with them. US navy has ordered its members not to use DeepSeek over potential security concerns, Australian leaders have advised caution. And reservations about Chinese AI apps will only grow among open societies because AI can spread misinformation, subvert elections and compromise security systems. Besides, censorship and control have been driving many of China\u2019s brightest minds abroad. So, ultimately, openness \u2013 freedom of expression \u2013 might prove to be the X factor in the AI race.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Kala Ghoda fest gallops to rescue heritage\nFor 89 years, King Edward VII\u2019s bronze horse polished to black finish gave its colloquial name to a crescent-shaped layout bordering the business district that brokered Bombay\u2019s fabled wealth. In 1965, nationalism belatedly banished monarch and steed to the Byculla zoo. The name remained \u2013regaining its raison d\u2019etre in 2017 when the precinct again got a spirited, albeit riderless black horse. The statue was funded by Kala Ghoda Association (KGA), supported by public-minded sponsors of\u00a0 Kala Ghoda Arts Festival, currently in the middle of\u00a0 its 25th edition.\u00a0\nBut this column isn\u2019t in praise of\u00a0 the cultural m\u00e9lange or chockablock mela assembled by its low-key, artist-activist, Hon Director, Brinda Miller. More noteworthy is how\u00a0 KGAF and KGA fulfil the original dream of the city\u2019s creative czars: formalizing an art district from this unique concentration of iconic art galleries, colonial architecture, hoary academe, and historic museum given the kiss of life by its director, a decidedly different Sabyasachi Mukherjee. A shifting scape of artisanal, fashion and food outlets has segued into this strollable-in-20-minutes radius.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2018Restoration\u2019 was necessarily on the original agenda, but KGA has bumped it up to \u2018revival\u2019. Splendidly bringing past into present, the association has taken\u00a0 heritage off its dusty shelf, mended it, and made it lovingly usable. Sangita Jindal\u2019s civic generosity, conservation architects Abha Narain Lambah and Vikas Dilawari\u2019s\u00a0 meticulous work,\u00a0 Rahul Mehrotra\u2019s early mapping now allow the \u2018non-cognoscenti\u2019 packing festival sessions to appreciate David Sassoon Library\u2019s exquisite detail, the Gothic grandeur of Elphinstone College.\u00a0 Perhaps create a sense of belonging.\u00a0\nAs has already happened with KGA\u2019s projects beyond the art district. Elegant Mulji Jetha Fountain, once obscured by neglect, is not just playing again but is now \u2018owned\u2019 by its modest neighbourhood. Crowded Bazargate\u2019s Wadia Clock Tower\u00a0 is no longer unnoticed relic, but once again helps those rushing by to keep time.\u00a0\nPerchance, this could lead to a similar connect with less-celebrated but no less-\u2018storied\u2019 precincts. Starting with mill district\u00a0 Girangaon, whose glorious past as spinner of gold is being\u00a0 fast obliterated by towered dross.\u00a0\nHeritage stands its best chance if it earns its keep, more so in as unsentimentally transactional a city as Mumbai. The most sustainable model is \u2018adaptive reuse\u2019. Historic buildings are being superbly repurposed the world over. In his introductory speech at KGAF, cultural impresario Asad Laljee gave a local example. Ballard Estate\u2019s ice factory, one of South Asia\u2019s largest, is now cool exhibition and leisure venue, IFBE. Original Burma teak trusses and roof panels filter in north light; its gantry crane now shifts studio partitions instead of lifting ice-blocks, while an eponymous caf\u00e9 bows at the foot of its ancient banyan.\u00a0\nSuch a heartwarming change\u00a0 from Mumbai\u2019s greedy norm of\u00a0 mills morphing\u00a0 into malls or residential realty whose breathless ads upend reality.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0***\u00a0\n\u00a0Alec Smart said: \u201cDeepSeek and ye shall find.\u201d\n\n",

        "full_article": "When we mourn deaths in big, newsy events like Kumbh, we must also look for the right perspective\nYesterday, around 100mn Kumbh devotees had been expected to take a holy dip. Overall, 450mn devotees are expected, dwarfing the US population. Most accounts had credited govt for proportionate arrangements. Police said 27,000 AI-powered surveillance cameras are intended to work in a preventative way \u2013 guide them to put in barricades and divert the human traffic wherever it starts to build up dangerously. On Wednesday, this arrangement broke down for some time. There was a stampede. Lives were lost.\nBut it\u2019s as important to keep this news in perspective as it\u2019s to mourn the loss of lives. First, we must ask whether in a gathering as vast as Kumbh, some disorder is almost inevitable. Second, when reacting to deaths from stampedes or earthquakes or accidents or murders, our view must be informed by placing the news in the bigger context. A Kumbh stampede is big news. But the bigger picture is that so many crores of devotees came and went unharmed, that deaths from stampedes, even in a crowded country like India, are only a fraction of total deaths from various causes. Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. But deaths from this disease never make Page 1 \u2013 a gruesome murder or a Kumbh stampede does. But Page 1 headlines don\u2019t always give you the proper context.\nThere\u2019s that old newsroom saying, \u2018if it bleeds, it leads\u2019. News of violent deaths (including those from accidents or disasters) offers a sense of drama that the mass media knows will play well with its audience, especially if the news is played up. But even when the media does that, it should put the news in perspective. The conjunction of the two is not antithetical, it\u2019s also necessary.\n\n",

        "full_article": "When the Awami League government fell on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass movement, there was a widespread sense of hope that better days lay ahead. The interim government took office on August 8, promising an efficient, pro-people governance system in line with the spirit of the July uprising. Unfortunately, over five and a half months on, it is struggling to even get on the track of that promise, thanks largely to a non-cooperative, past-bound bureaucracy.\nAccording to a recent report by\u00a0Samakal, several advisers of the interim government have expressed frustration at being unable to carry out their duties properly due to a lack of support from the bureaucrats. Adviser Nahid Islam even spoke about this publicly. As a result, the government has failed to complete 70 percent of the tasks it had set for itself, which is staggering. These unfinished tasks include crucial issues such as the posting of deputy commissioners, withdrawal of politically motivated cases, distribution of free school textbooks, procurement of necessary equipment at various government offices, etc\u2014all matters that needed prompt response.\nApparently, bureaucrats are still being sluggish, resistant, and mostly \"strategic\" in their work knowing the transient nature of this non-political administration; they are cautious to avoid potential trouble when a political party comes to power through election. Strong resistance is also coming from those who benefited from various perks under the Awami League regime; there are allegations that these officials are intentionally creating bottlenecks for the current administration.\nAs frustrating as this situation is, it is not entirely unexpected. Bureaucracy in Bangladesh has historically been politicised, used by the ruling party of the day to varying extents. This abuse peaked under the Awami League's rule, which politicised almost every level of government and provided perks and benefits to officials in exchange for loyalty. In return, these officials helped it maintain its authoritarian grip, stifling democratic practices and good governance. This led to a bureaucratic system so entrenched in corruption that any indication of change or reform triggers adverse, almost visceral reactions from bureaucrats fearing they might lose their positions of power and comfort.\nToday, some of the old players may have changed, but the old system remains firmly in place. A properly functioning government requires a supportive and efficient bureaucracy. To achieve this, our outdated bureaucratic system must be dismantled to make way for a healthy, accountable system. Bureaucrats must realise that their job is not to pander to the rulers, but the people\u2014the taxpayers. They must check their self-serving attitudes and heed the public demand: to uphold the integrity of their duties.\n",

        "full_article": "In one of the most dramatic shifts in the tech industry, the recent release of DeepSeek's R1, an open-source artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning model, sent shockwaves through the US tech giants, wiping more than $1 trillion off the markets. Stalwarts like Nvidia witnessed stock drops by as much as $500 billion (17 percent). The DeepSeek model, originating from a small Hangzhou-based startup, was developed at a fraction of the cost incurred by its US counterparts like OpenAI. This event signifies China's growing prowess in AI, challenging Western tech giants' long-standing dominance.\nDespite stringent US export restrictions on advanced technologies, Chinese inventors showed tenacity and resilience in the burgeoning AI landscape. Companies like Huawei and YMTC underscore China's progress towards creating faster and more efficient chips. This steady climb emphasises how they circumvent Washington's restrictions by fostering high domestic productivity and innovation. The critical question is: are US export restrictions futile, merely strengthening Beijing's resolve to upend US tech dominance, similar to the development of its global satellite navigation system BeiDou?\nDeepSeek's stunning cost efficiency starkly contrasts the exorbitant expenditures typically associated with US tech giants. This comes as welcome news when the conventional AI models are so power-hungry and require so much water to keep them cool that their sustainability is a concern, questioning the high-cost models and their long-term viability in a marketplace increasingly influenced by cost-efficient solutions. China's strategic focus on AI and related technologies has also made significant progress across various domains, from natural language processing to autonomous vehicles.\nAs the efficacy of the export controls is being questioned, evidence suggests mixed results. On the one hand, DeepSeek's accomplishment demonstrates that stringent measures do not entirely curtail innovation and may instead stimulate more. Conversely, the United States's steadfast imposition of export controls underscores the intimate relationship between national security and technological supremacy. The efficacy of these measures is further complicated by the global nature of talent migration, which sees leading experts from the West moving to China.\nChina's allure isn't limited to technological advancements but extends to attracting top-tier talent from all over. For instance, leading cancer scientist Sun Shao-Cong returned to China amid US investigations, while French Nobel-winning laser scientist G\u00e9rard Mourou joined China's top university. Additionally, respected mathematician Kenji Fukaya left the US for China's Tsinghua University, and award-winning mathematician Ma Xiaonan departed Europe for China. Other notable examples include prominent British physicist Prof Zhang Yonghao, who joined China's national hypersonic laboratory in Beijing, and global climate expert Chen Deliang, who returned to China after decades in Europe. Award-winning mathematician Wang Xujia also returned to China after a long career in Australia. These moves highlight a significant trend: China's growing attractiveness as a cutting-edge research and innovation hub.\nThe journey to build advanced semiconductor chips without ASML's state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines exemplifies China's inventive spirit. Chinese scientists are pioneering alternative methods that bypass these restrictions. One breakthrough involves the laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP) method, a process that generates EUV light using laser vaporisation of tin and high-voltage discharge. This innovation, spearheaded by Prof Zhao Yongpeng at the Harbin Institute of Technology, is cost-effective and energy-efficient. The strategic collaborations with institutions like the Shanghai Institute of Optics and Tsinghua University further enhance these efforts.\nAdditionally, Chinese companies are leveraging deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines to make sophisticated chips. Techniques such as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) allow for the etching of lines on silicon wafers multiple times, increasing transistor density and chip performance. This approach underscores Chinese innovation and highlights the country's determination to overcome import dependencies and US-imposed restrictions.\nChina's recent successful space missions, such as the Chang'e 5 lunar sample return and the Tianwen-1 Mars mission, undeniably showcase the country's burgeoning capabilities in advanced chip production and other related technologies. These complex endeavours require sophisticated autonomous navigation and control systems, advanced image recognition for terrain mapping and object identification, and real-time data analysis to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. The successful execution of these missions demonstrates Beijing's mastery of AI-powered robotics, machine learning, and deep learning technologies, solidifying its position as a leading force in the global AI landscape.\nSo, the question is: are we witnessing a steady shift of the global AI capital to China?\nWashington would hate to see that happen, as President Donald Trump has allocated $500 billion to AI research and development to ensure continued US dominance in the AI arena. This only follows his predecessor's tactics without giving it strategic thought. The Biden administration had made the race for chip manufacturing a top priority by offering $53 billion to the industry. Four years later, his Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, \"Trying to hold China back is a fool's errand.\" That gamble failed. Will President Trump's work?\nDr Sayeed Ahmed\u00a0is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "There is no easy way to characterise the crisis emanating from the re-affiliation of Dhaka-based seven colleges with Dhaka University, or the decision for their \"respectful separation\" on Monday. It has been a messy affair through and through\u2014the de-affiliation is meant to resolve an issue that shouldn't have arisen in the first place, and it now potentially ushers in another period of uncertainty not unlike the chaotic buildup to this moment. So, while we welcome the long-overdue decision\u2014following years of student protests and administrative struggles\u2014we must also acknowledge that the road ahead is anything but simple.\nBut before addressing the future, we must ask why those in authority always seem to see reason only after protests and such extreme measures. Why are critical educational decisions taken in haste and without proper considerations? That the re-affiliation with DU\u2014which was in charge of the colleges before the National University (NU) took over in 1992 and managed them until 2017\u2014was a flawed move was no secret. For eight years, college students have suffered as DU, already burdened with its own challenges, failed to handle the additional pressure. The result was increased session jams, delays in exam schedules, inconsistent grading, and growing frustration among students. What then took the authorities so long to separate them? The students' resistance to any reintegration with NU is also understandable, as it would be a step backward rather than forward.\nWhat should happen, then? The UGC is reportedly considering \"various models\" for a separate university or institution combining the seven colleges\u2014an endeavour that requires time, resources, and careful planning. Finding a solution that serves both students and the nation in general will not be easy, given the many complexities involved. Some of the colleges currently offer higher secondary education\u2014will they be separated from the new university? Faculty members in these colleges are recruited under the BCS education cadre\u2014will they continue under the existing structure, or will a new recruitment policy be developed? Moreover, while it has been decided that new college students from the 2025 session will no longer be under DU, it is unclear who will oversee their academic and administrative affairs. And what about the certificates for students graduating in the next few years? These are critical issues that cannot be resolved overnight.\nSo, while the mistake of DU re-affiliation has now been corrected, its consequences will continue to unfold for years. The authorities, therefore, must ensure that the transition is handled with utmost care and foresight. Rushed or poorly-thought-out measures in the face of renewed ultimatums will only create new problems, perpetuating the cycle of discontent and disruptions.\n",
