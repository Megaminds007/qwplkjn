India\u2019s demand last year followed a logjam in the entire process, once held up internationally as a model template for water-sharing agreements. Even in the new millennium, the tenets of the treaty held firm, and India was able to win two major disputes by adhering to the processes laid out, including the Baglihar Dam project in 2007, and another dispute over allegations that India was interfering with Pakistan\u2019s Neelum project in 2013. The issue over how to proceed on dispute resolution for the Kishenganga and Ratle projects has snowballed since 2016, when Pakistan escalated the disputes \u2014 having a neutral expert look at them and demanding a Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). In a moment of weakness, that it may come to regret, the World Bank \u2014 it is a co-signatory and guarantor of the IWT \u2014 decided to allow two parallel processes of the dispute mechanism to run at the same time. To make matters worse, Pakistan turned its back on the neutral expert\u2019s proceedings, while India has boycotted the PCA hearings at The Hague. Pakistan has been cold to India\u2019s notices on renegotiating the treaty and the decision by the Modi government to stop all PIC meetings has put the future of the process in peril. Unlike in past decades, when the IWT was considered off-limits for partisan politics, leaders on both sides are now not above using fiery rhetoric. Mr. Modi\u2019s statement after the 2016 Uri attack, that \u201cblood and water\u201d cannot flow together, is perhaps the most egregious example.It is no coincidence that the spiral mirrors the unravelling of the India-Pakistan bilateral relationship in the same period. There is no political engagement or trade and the 2021 LoC ceasefire agreement is in danger after growing terror attacks and deaths of Indian Army personnel. It may be possible to re-open the treaty talks, but concluding any agreement will be that much more difficult. All eyes are now on New Delhi\u2019s response to Pakistan\u2019s invitation for the SCO Heads of Government meeting on October 15-16. Such an opening could present an opportunity for talks on the way forward. No doubt, new-age issues such as climate change and the need for renewable energy and hydropower options on the Indus necessitate a re-opening of the 64-year-old Treaty. How that is done, along with resolving current disputes, will decide whether the two countries can save the treaty, once referred to as the \u201cone bright spot\u201d in a \u201cvery depressing world picture\u201d by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

        "full_article": "In her very first statement, Delhi\u2019s new chief minister Atishi made clear whom she serves. \u201cDelhi has only one CM and his name is Arvind Kejriwal,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201csole objective\u201d would be to make him CM again.\nThis statement is striking for two reasons. As CM, her primary responsibility is towards the people of Delhi. Indeed, the signs of collapsing governance are all around us \u2014 in the streets flooded after a spell of rain, unchecked pollution, water crisis \u2014 but instead of talking about these and other civic issues, she framed her sole aim as reinstating Kejriwal as CM, placing the party leader\u2019s interests above the public\u2019s. By foregrounding internal organisational preoccupations in its external communication, AAP is making the same mistake that established parties have made at one time or another \u2014 to their inevitable detriment \u2014 of inadvertently communicating that the party exists to serve the interests of leadership rather than representing the interests of the people.\nWhile it may be natural to rally around a leader during a crisis, Atishi\u2019s statement exemplifies a broader, more systemic issue plaguing Indian politics: the culture of sycophancy. This phenomenon, where party members prioritise leadership loyalty over public service, is not unique to AAP but pervasive across the political landscape. The danger lies not just in narrowly defined party priorities or in a fundamental shift of democratic principles but in the party itself. When political discourse centres more around pleasing party leadership than addressing citizens\u2019 needs, it creates a dangerous insularity, disconnecting parties from the very people they claim to represent.\nPARTY BEFORE PUBLIC? Instead of talking about the city\u2019s civic issues, Atishi framed her sole aim as reinstating Kejriwal in CM\u2019s post\nIt\u2019s highly possible that if Atishi had chosen to speak of her obligations to the people of Delhi instead of her obligation to Kejriwal, it would have seemed that she was trying to carve out an independent space for herself and, thus, be perceived as a challenger to his leadership. This is a constant dilemma in Indian politics, where the search for a temporary replacement or placeholder is always fraught with the possibility of losing power altogether. Consequently, Indian political culture has evolved in a manner where, for party leaders outside of the top leader, public interest is almost always expressed as an extension of installing the top leader in power. The corollary is that when party members express independent views on public interest, these are often misinterpreted as challenges to leadership. This misperception ignores the natural and inevitable differences that exist among thoughtful individuals, even when they share a common platform and purpose.\nThis intra-party dynamic may seem expedient but ultimately has negative consequences for both the leadership and the party itself. One common outcome is inevitable atrophy and decay of political parties with time. This occurs because equating control over a party with conformity stifles the very ingredients needed to keep parties connected with its constituents\u2014dialogue, discussion, and feedback. To prevent this decay, parties must promote internal forums for debate where dissent isn\u2019t seen as disloyalty but as part of a robust dialogue and find cohesion in common ideology rather than in leadership alone. Else, genuine solidarity and long-term commitment will be supplanted by sycophancy.\nOvert sycophancy is often a performative act, an attempt to prove loyalty in a landscape filled with opportunism. But those who engage in sycophancy often do so at the expense of their own self-respect \u2014 the trait necessary for integrity and long-term commitment. In the short term, sycophants appear reliable, but examples abound where the loudest, most vocal of them are often the first to shift allegiances when it\u2019s convenient \u2014 and then become loudest sycophants for the other side. This trend has created a pervasive culture of opportunism, mistrust and instability within and across political parties.\nMoreover, sycophancy fosters a culture of groupthink, leading to insularity, where diverse perspectives are sidelined in favour of reinforcing the leader\u2019s agenda. This undermines the party\u2019s ability to engage meaningfully with the public and weakens its capacity to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the people. Equally, a culture of sycophancy tends to sever the ongoing ideological connection with the broader public, making political parties look like closed clubs for private gain, leading to voter alienation.\nUltimately, fostering a political culture that values integrity and self-restraint over sycophancy is essential for the long-term health of political parties \u2014 and Indian democracy. The challenge for party leadership is not how to suppress independent voices, but how to allow leaders to prioritise and express their view of the public interest while maintaining party cohesion. Doing so will make political parties more resilient and strengthen \u2014 not weaken \u2014 party leadership. For Atishi and Kejriwal, the real challenge is reorienting their leadership toward addressing Delhi\u2019s urgent needs. Only by assiduously and exclusively focusing on the public good can Kejriwal regain the niche he seeks to occupy \u2014 the do-gooder aam aadmi.\n\n",

The Earth may need millions of years to heal, to retrieve her balance and restore her beauty. She will be able to recover, but humans and many other species will disappear until the Earth can generate conditions to bring us forth again in new forms.\u201d\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, billions of animals are slaughtered for food every year. One of the reasons for increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the rearing of livestock for human consumption. Add to that deforestation, wars, massive fishing and whaling activities in the oceans, and other human activities that impact millions of different species and expedite the extinction of some.\nThe seeds of the Sixth Extinction may have been sown by modern Western philosopher Rene Descartes\u2019 argument that animals lack self-awareness, or emotions. His proposition \u2013 Cogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am \u2013 may have established humans\u2019 perceived superiority over other species and may have even unintentionally contributed to rationalising mechanised meat production as the Industrial Revolution powered the world.\nDetails of the sixth extinction may be disturbing. In the realm of environmental ethics and philosophy, there are discussions on how human actions impact other species and ecosystems and how different species might be praying for human extinction. This brings us to the question of whether humans are worth saving. What is the point of saving a person who causes suffering by eating the flesh of other animals or destroys their habitat to serve his ends?\nMovements such as the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, VHEMT, has been advocating voluntary extinction of humanity by choosing not to reproduce, furthering the proposition that the cessation of human existence would prevent the degradation of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. Imagine grey wolves, Arctic foxes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, cheetahs, tigers and lions roaming without a worry in urban concrete jungles in cities such as New York, London, Paris, New Delhi, Tokyo and Beijing.\nHowever, should we be worried as the gloom and doom reports regarding climate change and the sixth extinction boosted by algorithms appear on our social media feeds? Perhaps not. From the Indic standpoint, it is comforting to know that existence is cyclical and duties and responsibilities regarding creation, preservation and dissolution are neatly distributed among the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Brahma creates, Vishnu sustains, and Mahesh dissolves creation, only for it to be renewed for another cycle, ad infinitum.\nKrishn says in the Bhagwad Gita, \u201cArjun, if you suppose this soul to be the subject of constant birth and death, even then, you should not grieve\u2026Death is certain for the born, and rebirth is inevitable for the dead. You should not grieve over the inevitable.\u201d For what is existence, if not a brief pause between being manifest and unmanifest, it is all but a Divine play, Krishn\u2019s Lila.\n\n",

But even seasoned espionage agencies are shaken and stirred by the weaponisation of supply chains in Lebanon\u2019s exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks. Vulnerability of supply chains \u2013 compromising hardware or software at source \u2013 has long been flagged in threat assessments, especially when supply chains include rival nations. A terrible successful first, Lebanon attacks were but a demonstration of the extent of harm and synchronicity that can be inbuilt into devices.\nIt is barely disputed the attack has Mossad\u2019s stamp. Satcom, cybertech and advanced surveillance networks have taken the art and science of espionage to levels almost indecipherable for those not fed on a diet of spy thrillers. Even the literature on the genre, of deception and manipulation, infiltration and ciphers, of dead drops and dead men, cyberspies and APTs (advanced persistent threats) has evolved with the changing nature of the world\u2019s second oldest profession. Spying remains mostly boring work, poring over tonnes of info, far removed from the glamour or romance of very early spy tales. If Maugham\u2019s Richard Ashenden (1928) was the first secret agent with a touch of reality \u2013 the short stories based on Maugham\u2019s own experience with British intelligence \u2013 real-life accounts of a Kim Philby or Aldrich Ames, of unlikely spy Virginia Hall or legendary Soviet secret agent Richard Sorge, were about ordinary men and women trained for extraordinary circumstances.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Successful attacks make news, while the novels, stories and reels deal mostly with thwarting plans and attacks. The Lebanon attack, long in the making, came just two weeks before the first anniversary of the Oct 7 Hamas attack \u2013 that Israeli intelligence spectacularly missed. All the spook-gadgetry in the world can come to naught if humint can\u2019t make sense of the chatter. \n\n",

        "full_article": "The incident started with the mob beating of a person named Mohammad Mamum, who had allegedly stolen a motorcycle. He died from the beating. We do not condone such killings. Those who were involved in this incident should not have taken the law into their own hands. Instead, they should have handed him over to the police.\nBut when widespread attacks start based on such an incident, the following chain of events cannot be anything but planned. If the events that took place in the last month and a half were revisited and analysed, one can see there was a big rally on August 16 in Khagrachhari organised by students calling for unity. They called to end the divisiveness or differences of opinion among the various indigenous groups, which is a threat to our survival. No one had organised these students. They communicated amongst each other and organised it themselves.\nA month later on September 18, they arranged yet another rally in Khagrachhari Sadar. This one was bigger and around 10,000-15,000 people participated in it. It was a peaceful rally and they presented an 8-point demand addressed to the chief adviser through the district commissioner, which called for peace in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Now this disciplined and well-organised rally, without any vandalism, without anyone getting hurt, that saw the coming together of various Indigenous groups\u2014Chakma, Marma, Tripura\u2014was not well-received by many, in my opinion. There are quarters that want to sustain the divisiveness among us. They are used to seeing us fight among ourselves\u2014they feel assured watching that. They do not feel comfortable when they see us united. These two rallies, organised by young people, within just one month, created a sense of panic among them. They cannot deny it. To steer the situation towards a different direction, the Dighinala incident was devised.\nPreviously, we had to believe whatever the press reported. Now, in the digital era, things have changed. If you watch the videos, you would see that during the confrontations between the Paharis and Bangalees, no group is attacking each other.\nHowever, according to witnesses, security forces were present when the Dighinala Bazar was burnt down, but they did not prevent it from happening. For a long time, their presence was justified as something necessary for the security and peace of the people of the hill tracts. Where is that safety and security then if such violent incidents take place right in front of their eyes and they remain inactive? We do not need such security.\nThe propaganda that we want a separate state has been there for a long time. When the constitution was formed in 1972, MN Larma was an independent lawmaker and the only representative from the Chittagong Hill Tracts. When he raised the issue of recognising the Indigenous people in the constitution, his proposal was rejected and he was sidelined. If our rights were clearly recognised in the constitution at that time, then we would not have to pay for that mistake in today's Bangladesh.\nSince then, many amendments to the constitution were made, and at last in the 15th amendment, we were included but only as tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and communities. We are raising our voices and demanding to be included in the constitution. Are we doing this because we want separation?\nThe state called us separatists, people working in the previous governments called us separatists, and some groups called us separatists, but we want to be recognised in the constitution and live in this country as citizens. So, who is asking for a separate state? Not us. Through this propaganda, they are creating a negative image of us to execute their own plan. We do not want any separate state, like they have in India, or a separate country. We want to stay together and be included in the constitution. There's been discussion about constitutional reforms, we want our rights and our issues to be included in those reforms.\nWe appreciate that a strong team from the government has visited the areas today. We hope that they will be able to come up with ways to calm the situation and mitigate the anger, fear, and mistrust among the communities. Since our chief adviser won the Nobel prize for peace, we hope that he will take the initiative to reinstate peace in the hill tracts by fully implementing the CHT Peace Accord. The rest of the advisers are progressive-minded as well. So, we trust and hope that they will take this initiative together.\nAt the same time, we urge that the people who were actually involved in the fatal lynching of the alleged motorcycle thief, are identified and brought to book. Justice must also be served for the killing of the four people, whose deaths resulted from the communal riots in Dighinala, Khagrachhari, and Rangamati, which were instigated from the lynching incidents. If the July-August uprising killings can be investigated by a United Nations-led team, then why not these killings in the hill tracts? They should be investigated not just by a judicial body but also through the UN-body probing the killings in the plain land.\nIlira Dewan\u00a0is a human rights activist.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Womenomics, coined by Goldman Sachs analyst Kathy Matsui, was introduced as a policy by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2013 to promote gender equality in the workforce and stimulate economic growth in Japan. Womenomics is a smart social policy to motivate women to be smart and create a smart economy that will increase the world's GDP by $12 trillion by 2025.\nFrench economist Jean-Baptiste Say coined the term entrepreneur in 1800 and defined it as \"one who undertakes an enterprise, especially a contractor, acting as intermediatory between capital and labor.\"\nIn Bangladesh, as per the Industrial Policy 2016, a woman is considered an entrepreneur if she owns a business as a proprietor, or in the case of a partnership organisation, owns 51 percent of a company registered with the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies (RJSC).\nEmpowering women economically paves the way for inclusive and sustainable development. In Bangladesh, women's increasing participation in the job market is one of the main outcomes of Womenomics, especially as an entrepreneur. Bangladesh has a high potential to create \"EntrepreNaari,\" a term invented by Navya Naveli Nanda, an Indian entrepreneur. The word refers to a movement advocating for women's entrepreneurship.\nWomen own just 7.2 percent of enterprises in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) estimates that 28 lakh SMEs in Bangladesh were owned by women in 2020, accounting for roughly 24.6 percent of all SMEs here.\nIn Bangladesh, women's introduction to entrepreneurship is the result of a complex interplay between opportunities and barriers, as well as outside aims and forces. According to the 2013 economic census, the total number of industrial units in Bangladesh stands at 78,18,565. Of them, 563,368 are companies headed by women, and 37,349 are SMEs led by women. According to the SME Foundation, women entrepreneurs have received 30 percent of a Tk 300 crore government incentive.\nAdditionally, in Bangladesh, women created about 40 percent of Facebook groups about entrepreneurship. Women entrepreneurs also have a significant impact on Bangladesh's GDP. They have made substantial contributions to the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, which made up about 25 percent of the country's GDP in 2021.\nOne of Bangladesh's first women entrepreneurs is Selina Qadar. She concentrated on agriculture, one of the nation's main sectors. In 1980, she noted that the government only offered a 10 percent export subsidy for potatoes. In 1985, she founded Agriconcern to promote the export of potatoes and produced 10,000-20,000 metric tonnes of potatoes annually, encouraging farming among women local business owners.\nWomen in urban areas are involved in various small and medium business enterprises such as handicrafts, fashion houses, beauty parlours, home textiles, food, cooperatives, chain shops, ICT, and even some larger businesses to some extent. In rural areas, many women are self-employed in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, engaging in activities such as cropping, rearing livestock and poultry, fish farming, nursery and tree planting, making tools, handcraft, processing food, tailoring, processing rice, etc.\nWomen entrepreneurs in Bangladesh are using a variety of platforms to run their businesses. These include Facebook and Instagram, brick-and-mortar stores, community-based organisations, e-commerce platforms such as Daraz and Amazon, fintech tools such as mobile banking and online lending, and business management software. However, women are still left out of the formal financial system. To address this, the government has launched several efforts, such as programmes to enhance financial literacy, remove barriers based on cultural differences, and increase access to financial services in rural areas. Yet, digital services are still severely hampered by a lack of access to mobile phones, cell coverage and the internet, and this is especially true for women.\nAs of 2024, per the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), mobile internet adoption rates are 40 percent for men and only 24 percent for women in Bangladesh. The use of technology, particularly in mobile financial service/digital financial service (MFS/DFS), highlights issues about the digital gender gap. Minimising this gap in its different forms is essential to ensure inclusive, sustainable economic growth and integrate all adult individuals and small enterprises into a \"financial ecosystem.\"\nA wide range of industries, including technology, manufacturing, e-commerce, agriculture, and services, is seeing significant advancements among women. Microfinance programmes, women-specific financial services, and focused policy interventions are a few examples of initiatives that can significantly contribute to women's entrepreneurial empowerment. The Bangladesh Bank has several noteworthy programmes to foster entrepreneurship, particularly among women. It established the Credit Guarantee Scheme providing SMEs in various cluster regions with more access to financing women entrepreneurs.\nFostering women's economic empowerment in Bangladesh is essential for developing a framework to support women's entrepreneurship. A country's progress towards gender equality and inclusive economic development can be gauged by the number of women entrepreneurs. Their contribution will accelerate the sustainable development of a smart economy with assistance from the government, civil society organisations, and stakeholders. It is high time we helped\u00a0Banglar Nari\u00a0to evolve as \"EntrepreNaari.\"\nDr Soma Dhar\u00a0is a research economist and independent consultant.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "After a recent attack on a doctor at Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital, his colleagues reviewed the CCTV footage to assess his handling of the patient. The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitted the patient, who had a history of bypass surgery, due to acute left ventricular failure. When his condition worsened, the doctor came in and administered CPR. The nurse was seen preparing an adrenaline injection, as is the protocol. The process failed, and the patient passed away. The attendants met with the doctor. He believed they were requesting an explanation. Suddenly, they started beating him mercilessly. They dragged him down to the ground floor lobby, where the beating could be more spectacular. The stairs remained stained with the doctor's blood. Dr Sajeeb Kazi is now fighting for his life at Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) with a brain haemorrhage and a rupture of the inner ear membrane.\nThe incident on September 10 is one of the many instances of workplace violence (WPV) against doctors. Following the tragic death of an accident victim at a private university earlier this month, three doctors from the neurosurgery department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) faced attacks. These incidents are symptomatic of a critical fault line in our healthcare system. They show the risks that healthcare professionals face daily. Doctors face not only the immense emotional and physical pressure of treating patients in a resource-constrained environment, but also the rising possibility of being physically or verbally assaulted.\nUnfortunately, violence against doctors is an issue that is neither unique to our country nor recent. This issue is prevalent all over the world. Systemic healthcare challenges, resource constraints, and rising patient expectations contribute to this issue. The emotional stress during medical crises exacerbates the situation further. Due to high patient expectations, doctors in the US have to pay substantial legal fees to protect themselves from lawsuits, and any perceived failure in medical outcomes can lead to costly malpractice claims, regardless of the complexity or inherent risks of treatment.\nIn Bangladesh, particularly in the current fad of mob justice, it is difficult to guarantee such social and legal succour. The March issue of\u00a0Bangladesh Medical Journal\u00a0reflects on this growing concern. Their study on a public hospital found that a staggering 67.3 percent of surveyed physicians reported experiencing WPV last year. Of these incidents, 84.5 percent were psychological in nature\u2014primarily threats and bullying\u2014while 13.5 percent involved physical violence, and two percent were cases of sexual harassment. These findings are similar to those in South Asia. In Pakistan, for example, 53.4 percent of healthcare workers reported WPV, while in India and Nepal, the figures stood at 63 percent and 45.5 percent, respectively.\nHowever, these numbers don't fully convey the agony that doctors endure when they become targets of anger and frustration from people who are at an emotionally charged height of vulnerability. Despite their efforts to keep a critically ill patient alive, doctors may have to give in to the reality of life. Family members of the patients often confront them with verbal abuse or even physical violence, intensifying their efforts against death. The attendants may experience denial, claiming that their loved one did not receive the care they deserved. A lack of understanding of medical limitations and dissatisfaction with the overall care process fuel their unrealistic expectations. Dr Sajeeb Kazi's case serves as an example. For the doctors who endure such violence, the repercussions are severe. Many express a desire to leave the profession entirely or discourage others from joining this noble profession.\nIt is important for us to examine the causes of this violence. The factors, albeit complex, are not unknown. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are only 5.26 doctors for every 10,000 people in Bangladesh. Overcrowded hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and a shortage of healthcare personnel result in long wait times, rushed consultations, and patient dissatisfaction. Yet, our expectations from doctors run high. They are the last ray of hope, irrespective of the patient's prognosis. Before reaching any conclusion, we must thoroughly judge the charges of perceived neglect or incompetence. Indeed, there can be greedy or negligent doctors, just like professionals in all other sectors.\nHospital administrations need to make efforts to create a friendly, secure environment that allows physicians to work with confidence. The reality is that there are not enough policies to redress WPV. The entire healthcare system suffers when doctors work in fear, and patients ultimately bear the brunt of this crisis. Hospitals must invest in better security infrastructure, including the deployment of security personnel in high-risk areas like emergency wards, installation of surveillance cameras throughout their premises, and restriction of public access to certain areas.\nAbove all, hospitals must adopt a zero tolerance policy against WPV. Legal responses should be swift and just. The government should clearly articulate national-level policies to protect doctors and healthcare workers. To create a greater sense of empathy and patience, there has to be an awareness campaign. These campaigns can focus on managing patient expectations and understanding the limitations of both medical treatment and palliative care. In addition, The health authorities also must set up a system at all hospitals and other healthcare facilities where patients' complaints of malpractice and other grievances are addressed properly.\nDoctors themselves should have their own support services. They can use their collective platform to insist on psychological counselling and emotional support for those who experience violence. All hospital staff should receive training in conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques, helping them manage tense situations more effectively. We should not leave doctors to handle the aftermath of violent incidents alone.\nUnless we address the root causes of violence, none of this will be effective. The healthcare system needs significant investment to improve infrastructure, reduce patient load, and ensure that doctors have the time and resources they need to provide quality care. The amount of foreign currency that we lose due to outbound medical tourists can be invested to bring in these systemic changes.\nDoctors are our last line of defence when life hangs in the balance. To protect them, we must do everything in our power. Without immediate intervention, we risk losing not just our doctors but also the very heart of our healthcare system. Now is the time for action.\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is professor of English at Dhaka University.\n\nThe views expressed in the article are the author's own\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The interim government has initiated a radical shift in annual development plan (ADP) implementation. The current five-year plan that forms the basis of ADPs has been suspended and the new focus is now on skill development of country's human resources, which is a major shift from several previous ADPs that had prioritised infrastructure development. To term the plans radical would be an understatement. For instance, with a view to quicker decision-making and implementation, the current administration has empowered individual ministries to approve projects. It has become abundantly clear that the top-down decision-making approach whereby projects were undertaken whimsically, while wholly or partially disregarding a need-based approach had resulted in very poor ADP implementation. This had been a major bone of contention with bilateral and multilateral foreign development partners who committed billions of dollars in grants and loans only to see partial implementation. Since there was hardly any need felt at the top for either transparency or accountability, it is interesting to note that a taskforce has been set up to deliver direction of the economy and submit a report within the next three months so as to give current policymakers a bird's eye view about the state of the economy.It is good to know that finally, the dire needs of the massively unemployed educated youth are being addressed. The economy had become overly dependent on foreign workers and since the youth were graduating from a broken education system that failed to equip young people with requisite technical knowhow or with knowledge that industry needed, they found no employment. No exact figure exists on how many foreign workers are employed in Bangladesh, but it is more than a million people. They don't pay taxes here and this is why the human resource development has been prioritised to bring young people up to speed on various emerging opportunities like information technology. There is also realisation that the bulk of our expatriate workers are employed in the unskilled category. Hence, remittance value remains low which could be reversed if more technical hands could go abroad to work and whose pay would be many times more than that of unskilled workers. A qualitative improvement is needed and this is very much possible through vocational and IT-education development.Previous government had opted to go for some projects which had bypassed the planning commission. This was done deliberately to favour select companies that opened the door wide for graft on epic proportions. Irregularities happened at the sole discretion of the former prime minister. As far as a number of mega projects are concerned, the country has ended up with a huge foreign debt, the servicing of which has become a burden the economy can ill-afford. These grandiose projects were taken to showcase the \"development\" made possible by the erstwhile government which were not based on any economic need but to serve the hubris of one person. The current administration is having to repair the damage done over the last 15 years. It had become modus operandi that mega-projects mean mega-corruption. One instance of such graft can be cited here. The former roads and highways minister had claimed that it would require one year and Tk 1.5 billion to repair the damage caused by miscreants to two metro rail stations. One of the vandalised station at Kazipara was reopened on Friday last. The repair of the station was completed at a paltry amount of Tk 2.0 million under the new metro rail administration. Had the previous administration remained in power, a substantial amount would have ended up lining the pockets of corrupt politicians and contracting company. Let these be lessons learnt for the new administration. Hopefully, the mistakes of past regimes will not be allowed in the present. Transparency and accountability must become the guiding principles of today's political and economic decisions.",

        "full_article": "After a predictable setback in the country's export earnings in the last fiscal year, the interim government has set a fresh target for the current fiscal year (FY25). The new total export target is set at US$57.50 billion, a figure that carries significant weight as it is 13.30 per cent higher than the actual receipt of FY24. Of this, $50 billion is targeted as earnings from exports of goods and the rest from services. It is to be noted that the country fetched $44.48 billion in exports of goods in the last fiscal year, which was 4.34 per cent lower than the earnings of exports in FY23. Again, the actual receipt in the previous fiscal year missed the original target of $62 billion by 39 per cent. Overambitious targets, coupled with the manipulation of data to artificially inflate the export earnings by the ousted autocratic government, result in a big gap between the targeted and actual figure. The manipulation of data on export earnings also provided a distorted scenario of the country's external trade and overall balance of payments (BoP). After adjusting the export data, initially provided by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), which counted export earnings in some cases inflating the figure, it was found that there was an overestimation of around $9 billion in FY23. This underscores the crucial need for accurate and honest reporting, as the EPB data put the export earnings at $55 billion in FY23, which came down to $46.50 billion after the adjustment. Thus, there was an overestimation of around 16 per cent of the export receipt. However, the new export target is fixed taking into consideration the adjusted figure of the export earnings. So, the figure was low compared to the indicative target set by the Hasina regime. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in May last approved the draft of the Export Policy 2024-2027, eyeing a $110 billion export target in FY27 based on an inflated figure. A valid question in this connection is how feasible the new merchandise export target of $50 billion, set by the interim government in the second week of this month, is. This piece will try to find the answer, taking both external and internal factors into consideration.To understand the external factor, a quick look at the current trend of global trade is necessary. Around three months ago, UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released its global trade update, which showed that the current international trade trends have turned positive. This positive trend, with trade in goods increasing by around one per cent quarter over quarter (QoQ) in the first quarter of 2024, and services trade growing at approximately 1.5 per cent on the same count, brings a sense of optimism. The UNCTAD predicted a stronger positive trend for Q2 in 2024, projecting an approximate 2 per cent increase for the first half of 2024. The UN body also estimated that the growth would add around US$250 billion to trade in goods and about US$100 billion to services trade in the first half of the current year compared to the second half of 2023. Moreover, if positive trends persist, global trade in 2024 could reach almost US$32 trillion, though it is unlikely to surpass its record level seen in 2022. Now, in the first week of this month, the World Trade Organization (WTO) released the latest reading of its Goods Trade Barometer, which is a composite leading indicator for world trade. It revealed that global merchandise trade has been picking up in the third quarter of 2024 after demand for traded goods stalled in 2023 amid high inflation and rising interest rates. In other words, global trade in goods is on the rise in the current year, as predicted by UNCTAD earlier. The reading of the WTO trade barometer also showed the possibility of continuing the rising trend. Taking a cue from these projections, there is hope for Bangladesh, no doubt, as the last half of the current calendar year is also the first half of the current fiscal year.Nevertheless, according to the WTO barometer, the outlook for trade remains highly uncertain due to four downside factors. These are: rising geopolitical tensions, ongoing regional conflicts, shifting monetary policy in advanced economies, and weakening export orders. All these may severely subdue Bangladesh's export potential in the first half of the current fiscal year.The Russia-Ukraine war has been continuing for two and half years. Israel continues to pound the Gaza Strip to uproot Hamas militants for almost a year, killing more than 41,000 Palestinians. Though its goal is yet to be achieved, the Zionist state is now going to launch a big offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, meaning the Middle East will become more volatile. These two key regional conflicts have already disrupted the global supply chain, and continuing the conflicts at a bigger scale will make things worse soon.The looming presidential election in the United States (US) has become a matter of tension across the world, especially when Donald Trump is the candidate from the Republican camp. Winning Trump would mean escalating geopolitical tension and proliferating a trade war. On the domestic front, the first quarter of the current fiscal year is marked by serious disruption of economic activities in the country for obvious reasons. The anti-discrimination movement launched by the students in July to reform the quota system in the public sector turned into a mass uprising against the Hasina regime. The movement forced Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee the country to take shelter in India. Though an interim government under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus has taken charge, the overall situation is still volatile. Several ready-made garments (RMG) and other factories were vandalised and faced labour unrest. Production has not fully resumed in all the industrial units. Imports are also slow, as many banks have been short of funds due to gross irregularities. Some big corporate entities, known for their strong affiliation with the ousted prime minister and mobilised big funds from the banks bypassing the rules, are in trouble now. So, the overall economic activities, including exports in the current fiscal year's first quarter, are undoubtedly dull. However, the situation is expected to start to recover in the second quarter, leading to a gradual rise in exports. Thus, export earnings in the first half of the current fiscal year will grow moderately under the current trend in global and local factors. This will make achieving the target by the end of the fiscal year challenging. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "What was witnessed at Dhaka University's Fazlul Huq Hall last Wednesday is a crime, a tragedy and a heinous act that stunned the entire nation. Woefully, however, it was a mere replay of what often occurs in different parts of the country, yet each incident appears as barbaric and tragic.Tofazzal Hussain was what one might describe as 'a harmless man', in his 30s with mental disabilities and used to wander through the university grounds, surviving on the kindness of students who gave him food. On that fateful evening, however, he was roaming near Fazlul Huq Hall, and some students jumped to the conclusion that he was a thief responsible for stolen phones. Instead of making enquiries and verifying their suspicions or seeking help from the authorities, they detained, interrogated and tortured him.Under intense questioning and non-stop beatings, Tofazzal agreed to tell them whom the real thieves were if they give him something to eat. The students then fed him, but Tofazzal failed to give the promised names. This infuriated the students and they beat him more - from 10:00pm to midnight. They beat him mercilessly to the threshold of death. The university authorities eventually intervened, but it was too late, the damage had been done. The university proctorial team then whisked him off to Shabagh Police Station. The on-duty police officer told them to take the body to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where he was declared dead. All of this barbarity was committed on mere suspicion! According to subsequent media reports, Tofazzal was not a thief, just a man suffering from mental illness, a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Orphaned, emotionally shattered, and socially isolated, he sought food on the university campus and tried to befriend students. One of the most disheartening aspects of this tragedy is that Tofazzal was once a brilliant student at Patharghata Degree College. His life's downward spiral began following the deaths of his parents and brother. His father died in an accident in 2016 and his mother died from cancer in 2019. His elder brother, who was a police officer, also died of cancer in 2023. His mental health deteriorated after that. He didn't live anywhere for long and drifted between his hometown Barguna and Dhaka.There is no evidence to say he was a phone thief. Even if he were, no one had any right to lynch him. He could have been arrested and treated in the legal way. The students no doubt filled with rage and false pride failed to act responsibly by taking the necessary steps to verify his antecedents. So, they will have to live with that shame for the rest of their lives. How can a place that is supposed to be a bastion of knowledge and morality harbour students who have become devoid of human kindness, compassion, and respect for the law and the right to life?The case of Tofazzal Hossain, however, is not isolated. In just over a month, 21 people have been killed in mob lynchings throughout Bangladesh, a shocking reminder of the country's deteriorating law and order. These incidents have become disturbingly common, with two mob killings taking place within hours of each other at two of the nation's premier universities. At Jahangirnagar University, Shamim Molla, a former Chhatra League leader, was also fatally beaten by students.Although the authorities were quick to jump into action to nab six of the DU students who lynched Tofazzal till Saturday, the same cannot be said in the case of other incidents in the last few weeks. As a result, mobs are increasingly taking the law into their own hands, confident they will escape punishment. Issuing statements alone will not restore order; what is needed is stern action to stem the tide of violence.[email\u00a0protected]",
