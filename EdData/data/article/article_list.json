And in that story is hidden many facets of the crucial issue of the state of our governance. It happened because of a bitter political rivalry within the party and the unhealthy practice of dragging public servants into the fray to serve the agenda of politicians.\nIt was not a small incident. A total of 50 people got injured. Two ruling party leaders\u2014one of them the local MP who is also a state minister, and the other the local mayor\u2014are fighting for supremacy in the district. The local UNO, Munibur Rahman, got dragged into the melee and was targeted by the mayor, who comes from a very powerful political family and who, according to local reports, has now arrogated to himself the power to override all administrative prerogatives. The UNO's house was attacked by the staff of the city corporation, allegedly led by the mayor's men, which resulted in the UNO calling for police protection, which in turn led to firing by the law enforcement officers and finally ended up in police cases filed against the mayor.\nThe event became more revealing after the Bangladesh Administrative Service Association (BASA) reacted to it. In a press release dated August 19, it stated that \"the incident shows how a government servant became victim in the hands of Mayor Serniabat Sadiq Abdullah and his city corporation goons\", and termed them to be \"rajnaitik durbritta\" (political thugs/criminals). The press release further said that the mayor had put up many barriers in the work of the administration and was terrorising the whole district. BASA demanded the arrest of the mayor and hoped that the law would take its own course.\nThe mayor countered by lodging a set of his own cases against the UNO, accusing him of attempting to kill him.\nOf course, the incident was not allowed to brew further. It was soon explained to have arisen out of \"misunderstanding\" and steps were taken to patch things up.\nThe event in Barishal is a microcosmic representation of the district-level rivalries that are going on in many parts of the country, among various aspirants of the ruling party for total control of their respective districts. The fight is usually, but not always, between the local member of parliament and the district leadership. This malaise is afflicting almost every district of the country today. When there is virtually no political opposition at the grassroots level, intraparty squabbles intensify resulting in splitting the local units and turning fellow party workers into mutual mortal enemies. This obviously make a mockery of party discipline\u2014something that is almost non-existent even at the best of times\u2014and opens up avenues for the rise of local hoodlums who are then used to disrupt the activities of their rivals in every possible manner, including violence. Thus local politics becomes more and more about violence, and less and less about public concerns.\nThe propensity for violence\u2014nothing new in our politics\u2014leads to the rise of musclemen and the gradual decline in participation of politically conscious elements. In time, the party becomes filled with thuggish elements whose main purpose in joining politics is to extract benefits\u2014and that's what they do, destroying the reputation of the party and eroding public support for it. Just as in economy \"bad money drives out good many\", Gresham's law also applies in politics, where hoodlums drive away genuine political elements from overall politics, allowing the vacuum so created to be filled up by the criminal elements. Thus criminalisation takes over local party politics to the detriment of politics in general, and ruling party politics in particular.\nLeaders, on their part, to maintain their hold on these so-called \"party workers\", give in to their demands and, as it happens all the time, they themselves become deeply involved in it and end up leading this process. This is the inevitable fate of parties who have been in power for a long time and who successfully, politically or otherwise, have destroyed all democratic opposition.\nThen there is the vitiation of the process of law itself. Instead of the law taking its own course, it suddenly stops in its tracks. As a result of an understanding between the rival groups, legal process suddenly stops. Why? After all, guns have been fired, a house was attacked and 50 people in all were injured, some with bullet wounds. We are aware of civil cases where contesting parties may come to an \"out-of-court\" settlement. But for criminal acts?\u00a0\nWhatever may have been the merit of the BASA statement\u2014facts on the ground prove that the allegations deserve to be looked into\u2014the language used in the press statement shocked and surprised all, calling the mayor, an elected person, and his followers \"durbritta\" (criminal elements) and demanding the mayor's arrest. This is something very unusual in the administration's dealing with public representatives, where the elected representatives of the people are always supposed to be the \"political masters\" of the administration. How did the bureaucrats garner the courage to use such language against an elected representative? The answer has two sides to it: 1) The politicians are themselves denigrating their honour, dignity and prestige by what they do and by the people they patronise, and 2) Bureaucrats are not as disciplined as before, and have been significantly politicised and drawn into local politics.\nThis brings us to the delicate question of the relationship between the political leadership and bureaucracy in a democratic system, and how they should function for the benefit of the people. This is a vital question for any country, more so Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country which is on track to graduate from the UN's Least Developed Countries (LDC) list in 2026.\nIn their seminal book \"Why Nations Fail\" (2012), Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson made a simple proposition: countries that build \"institutions\" are able to sustain their development, while those who do not falter after a while. It is only the institutions that guarantee sustainability; everything else may ensure success for a while, but in the long term they all falter.\nOf all the institutions that form the integral part of the governance process of a country, civil administration is among the most important. In Bangladesh, it is made up of a huge and complex structure consisting of, according to latest official figures, 15,04,913 officers and staff. For officers, who are divided into 26 cadres, we spend Tk 11,000 crore to pay salaries, and another Tk 26,000 crore for the staff per year. A staggering Tk 33,000 crore is spent for various perks for the above officers and staff each year. What we have here is a total of Tk 57,000 crore, making for 19 percent of our revenue budget that we, the tax payers, dish out annually. In 2015, the pay scale for the civil administration was doubled. A special interest-free car loan facility of Tk 30 lakh was allowed for officers of the rank of deputy secretary and above (administration cadre) with a monthly car maintenance allowance of Tk 50,000.\nFor all that, we, the public, are supposed to get a clean and honest bureaucracy. Pay and allowances are not the issue here. Efficiency, transparency and accountability are. In fact, we would want everybody who works for the government to be justly paid for the services that they render. But who will ask what is the quality of service they render and how satisfied the public (whose tax money is the basis of all salaries and perks) are? The general public, the sources of all power in our \"People's Republic\", are never asked as to what their evaluation is of the services they get from our public servants. In fact, the term \"public servant\" itself seems more like a mockery as the public is made to feel like the \"servant\" instead of the other way around.\nHas there ever been any study, research or investigation about how efficiently our administration is working? How long does it take for a file to pass through all the stages of government requirement? Has that timing improved? If not, then why? With the rising cost of bureaucracy, shouldn't efficiency become a must?\nThen comes the question of transparency and accountability. Do we really know why certain cases are solved smoothly, while other cases are not? After all, if the ultimate purpose of public administration is to serve the people, then our bureaucracy should be subjected to all the modern accountability process that bureaucracies in other democracies are subjected to. Do we really search to find out why so many projects are delayed repeatedly, with huge increments in costs? Whose money is being so recklessly spent? Our planning minister recently lamented how his efforts to monitor projects are repeatedly thwarted.\nAccording to a letter sent by the chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to the cabinet secretary, a \"huge\" number of civil servants own and run businesses on the side violating their service rules. These government servants have either become contractors in their own names or in the name of their dependents, said the letter, sent on March 29. \"The commission thinks such practices should be stopped immediately,\" the letter said. Section 17 (1) of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1979 forbids a public servant from engaging in any trade or employment. Section 17 (3) says not to permit any members of a public servant's family to engage in any trade over which said government servant has jurisdiction. Till date, we are not aware of any action being taken on this score. Normally such a letter should have created a storm. In this instance, if there was a storm, it was confined to a tea cup.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs stated earlier, graduating from the LDC status also means that we have to establish a more efficient administrative system that is commensurate with the modernisation process that we have embarked on. Tax payers will keep on footing a higher and higher pay bill for our bureaucrats, but their service, attitude and efficiency level will remain the same\u2014this cannot be the ideal way forward for a country aspiring to be the \"model\" for development.\nThe Barishal incident and the letter of ACC chairman to the cabinet secretary make the question \"Who do our public servants serve?\" so much more urgent and relevant.\nMahfuz Anam is Editor and Publisher, The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "In its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, India achieved two milestones in five days between August 27 and 31 while vaccinating its people. Both relate to a new high in the number of vaccine recipients\u20141.03 crore doses on August 27, and 1.28 crore on the last day of a month that saw nearly 18 crore doses being administered, up from 13.45 crore in July and 11.97 crore in June.\nIn all, more than 66.3 crore doses have been given so far and a little more than half of India's 94 crore adult population, who are vulnerable to due to the virus in terms of mortality, have either been fully vaccinated or gotten at least one dose. According to official statistics, almost all healthcare workers have received the first dose, and 83 percent got both the doses. Nearly 84 percent of frontline workers have been fully vaccinated.\nThe latest data on vaccination, coupled with low to moderate pace of new infection reports coming from most parts of India every day\u2014which prompted WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan to suggest that India may be entering \"some stage of endemicity of the pandemic\"\u2014has brought some relief to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after its handling of the devastating second wave in March-April faced severe criticism. Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya lost no time in hailing the highest single-day feat of vaccine dose administration on both the occasions.\nBut numbers are just one, even though important, part of the much larger story in the drive against Covid and, drawing a lesson after the first wave, gloating over them is best avoided because the virus and its unknown number of mutations are highly unpredictable as evidenced by rising breakthrough infections affecting fully-vaccinated people in many parts of the world. There is simply no scope for being lulled into complacency, as had happened in the run-up to the second wave of the pandemic. For example, take the recent report about Indian and South African virologists detecting a new variant named C.1.2, which was first detected in South Africa. This new strain is likely to be much more transmissible, but there is no clarity as yet about its possible virulence.\nThe main reason behind the sharp increase in the speed of vaccination\u2014which had begun on January 16\u2014in July and August is the drastic improvement in supplies of Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, and Covaxin, India's home-grown vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech. According to officials, vaccine availability is set to go up to around 22 crore doses in September and nearly 35 crore in October, while 35 crore doses are expected to be in supply in the final two months of the year, when the government aims to inoculate the majority of the adults. Bharat Biotech plans to ramp up its production at its new plant in the state of Gujarat. Equipped with a capacity of more than one crore doses per month, enhanced supplies from Bharat Biotech's Ankleshwar facility will be available from September.\nIndia has to aggressively push ahead with enhanced vaccine supplies, because schools are gradually set to reopen in different parts of the country\u2014a move that calls for vaccination of children and teachers on an urgent basis. The increase in vaccine availability and the results of nationwide serosurvey covering 70 out of India's 718 districts that indicated the presence of Covid-19 antibody in about 70 percent of the country's population is, no doubt, a good news for the government.\nBut there are reasons not to get carried away and instead be on the side of abundant caution, particularly after the country's apex medical research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research, said vaccines are \"disease-modifying\" and not always \"disease-preventing\", especially when it comes to breakthrough infections, which means a fully-vaccinated person can get the disease again unless Covid-appropriate behaviour is adhered to. Secondly, there are reports that immunity generated by natural antibodies (following infection) or by vaccines are prone to waning, and that is why many countries are thinking about administering booster shots.\nThe increasingly ramped-up vaccine production and supply in India also raise the possibility of resuming vaccine export. Being the biggest manufacturing hub, India needs to step into this area, especially for its South Asian neighbours. India had supplied 6.6 crore doses from 2020 to early 2021 before the second wave of the infection and shortage in production led to a halt amid severe criticism of the Modi government. The government is in a once-bitten-twice-shy situation now.\nDespite its belief that no one is safe until everyone is safe, India may not be able to export vaccines again without first ensuring adequate domestic availability. True, India has an important role in promoting global vaccine cooperation, and the WHO's COVAX window is looking up to the supply of vaccines made in India. But India needs to have a balance between its international obligation and commitment to its own people.\nPallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for\nThe Daily Star.\nHe writes from New Delhi, India.\n",

        "full_article": "Women face discrimination every hour of every day, in various forms. From a greater lack of access to equal opportunity and payment in workplace, educational institutions, social discourses and household decision-making, to the more specific instances of intimate partner violence, domestic abuse, sexual violence and an apathetic lack of acknowledgement for caregiving and household contributions\u2014women are undermined in every sphere of life.\nThis, unfortunately, is not a new phenomenon. From the dawn of civilisation, women have been looked at through a male-oriented lens\u2014except for perhaps a few communities, which followed a matriarchal structure.\nThe world has made significant progress in the last century to drive equality for women, including ensuring their right to vote, own property, have better access to literacy, healthcare and livelihood opportunities. But the problem at the root remains: the patriarchal worldview that sees women as the lesser being, unequal to men.\nAs the world gets ready to observe the 40th anniversary of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) today, we face new challenges posed by Covid-19, which have further exacerbated the discrimination against women.\nAccording to \"Policy Brief: The Impact of Covid-19 on Women,\" a report published by the UN in April 2020, \"Across every sphere, from health to the economy, security to social protection, the impacts of Covid-19 are exacerbated for women and girls simply by virtue of their sex\".\nThe policy brief elaborates on the economic, social and health impact of the pandemic on women and girls. \"Compounded economic impacts are felt especially by women and girls who are generally earning less, saving less, and holding insecure jobs or living close to poverty,\" it says. While early reports reveal more men are dying as a result of Covid-19, the health of women generally is adversely impacted through the reallocation of resources and priorities, including sexual and reproductive health services.\n\"Unpaid care work has increased, with children out-of-school, heightened care needs of older persons and overwhelmed health services. As the Covid-19 pandemic deepens economic and social stress coupled with restricted movement and social isolation measures, gender-based violence is increasing exponentially. Many women are being forced to 'lockdown' at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.\"\nThe situation is no different in Bangladesh where women are facing discrimination due to the pandemic. With lifestyles changing, women now have to manage work-from-home, household chores, children's education during online classes, and provide care to the sick. While men do participate, due to the prevailing patriarchal social mindset, it is the women who are shouldering most of these added workloads.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimilarly, women are increasingly becoming trapped with abusive husbands due to restricted mobility. A research jointly conducted by the NGO Manusher Jonno Foundation and James P Grant School of Public Health of BRAC University on 65,000 women and children in 53 districts, titled \"Life in the time of coronavirus: A gendered perspective,\" revealed that 30 percent of those who survived domestic violence had first encountered such violence during the pandemic. The forms of violence range from sexual and physical torture to economic and mental abuse.\nThe research also found that, trapped at home, the husbands demanded more frequent sexual intercourse from their wives. In one instance, when a wife\u2014tired from her household chores\u2014refused to entertain her husband's overtures, she was subjected to physical and mental torture.\nAnd this problem is not unique to women. With child marriage increasing sharply in the country, this problem is also being faced by many underage girls. Data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics indicate that child marriage increased by 13 percent\u2014the highest child marriage rate in the country in 25 years.\nThese young girls\u2014who should be in school, learning, growing, finding their own feet\u2014are now trapped in the homes of their in-laws, engaged in caregiving, household chores, and giving in to the sexual needs of their husbands, and in the process becoming pregnant at a tender age, often damaging their sexual and reproductive health.\nNot that these problems were not there before the pandemic, but there is no denying that Covid-19 has created multi-layered opportunities to exploit women and further discriminate against them. And this problem cannot be addressed in the short to medium term, because we are perhaps not assessing the problem from the right perspective.\nThe problem is we take discrimination against women for granted. We take it for a fact that the role of a woman in a household includes household management, performing daily chores, cooking, caregiving\u2014all for free, of course. Thus the women are engaged in both productive and reproductive roles within the household, while the men are only engaged in productive roles.\nWe also take it for granted that women as employees are less efficient than their male colleagues. And women are often systematically overlooked in their workplaces to reduce their visibility. An article by Harvard Business Review, titled \"Why Women Stay Out of the Spotlight at Work\", says: \"On the one hand, women's contributions are systematically overlooked at work. This limits their professional advancement and helps to explain why the senior levels of organizations remain overwhelmingly male. Yet when women try to make themselves more visible, they can face backlash for violating expectations about how women should behave, and risk losing their hard-won career gains.\" Under pressure, women have to \"over-invest\"\u2014work harder in order to get equal opportunity at work.\nHowever, since these predominant social perspectives and patriarchal views are not going to change anytime soon, there is no point in simply talking about discrimination against women. We need to leverage these discriminating tendency of the society and turn it into a driver of positive growth for women; in short, we need to actively work on positive discrimination of women.\nIn the household, we need to acknowledge women's contributions and make way for rewarding them financially for the services they are rendering. We also need to provide them with economic empowerment opportunities\u2014access to skills development, access to finance\u2014so that they can work, be financially independent. and have an equal say in the family.\u00a0\nIn the workspace, we need to actively look out for the women performing well and reward them for their performances. There can also be women-friendly promotion policies. These days, many international organisations have certain reserved places for women in leadership positions. This can also be arranged for mid-level female employees. In fact, every organisation must have a minimum requirement to employ women workers as part of HR compliance so that women have better access to work opportunities.\nThese can be the starting points.\u00a0\nSince as of now, there is no way to end discrimination against women, we have to turn this discrimination into an opportunity for women's growth, otherwise there would be no positive outcome.\nThere is clearly no point in just talking about the prevailing discriminations. Women need to step up, actively fight for their rights, turn these discriminations into opportunities and pave way for their own growth. This won't be an easy fight, but without this approach, eliminating inequality and discrimination would become very difficult, even in the long run.\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.\nHer Twitter handle: @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "Seeing the varying degrees of Covid that the world has experienced over the last one and a half years, we can safely assume that this pandemic is here to stay.\nThe experiences of different countries as well as data from scientific research also support this idea. Since we are seeing different variants of the coronavirus as well\u2014such as the widespread and more lethal Delta variant\u2014there is no guarantee that even more lethal variants would not emerge in the future. In the earlier days of the pandemic, we thought it would be gone within a year or two, and we would probably be able to go back to what we call the \"pre-Covid situation\", and we would have something like a \"post-Covid situation\".\nGiven the circumstances, however, it seems there will probably be no post-Covid situation, at least not in the way we had expected. The disease will likely continue to exist at varying degrees across the world. Therefore, we need to be prepared to cope with the situation keeping that in mind. We also need to revisit our development strategies accordingly.\nBut what steps should be considered to achieve that?\nWe can start with developing some protocols for running economic activities amid Covid. These protocols should involve two major segments. One is sector-specific\u2014how different sectors can function in the middle of a pandemic. The sector-specific protocol would demonstrate that the set of guidelines that is applicable for a manufacturing company might not be equally effective for a service-oriented firm. For example, the protocol for running a restaurant would be different from that of running a ready-made garment factory.\nThe other segment of protocols should be area-specific\u2014depending on population size and the types and intensity of economic activities. For example, the protocols for Dhaka would be different from the ones for Rangpur, because the type and intensity of economic activities are different in these two regions.\nIn order to develop sector-specific and area-specific development strategies, the government should involve the major stakeholders\u2014especially the private sector\u2014representatives from different economic fields, the sectors' experts, and the experts on public health. Those responsible for developing these protocols should also take into account the global experience.\nUnfortunately, we have yet to see any initiative from the government to develop such protocols. Over the last one and a half years, we have seen both deterioration and improvement of the Covid situation. The initiatives or steps taken so far to tackle the pandemic have been on an ad hoc basis. We saw that the government was sometimes forced to impose lockdown measures. However, due to weak enforcement capacity, the restrictions were far from effectively executed. The poor implementation of lockdown measures also generated large-scale economic and social losses. A proper assessment of the management of the Covid situation is, therefore, needed to develop the protocols for the coming days.\nCovid has caused some profound economic and social shocks and losses. The major sectors of the economy, in particular the micro, small and medium enterprises, have suffered quite a lot\u2014so much so that a number of micro and small enterprises had to shut down permanently, and many more may follow. At the same time, we have also observed some deep social losses in terms of poverty and labour market turmoil. We are witnessing large-scale disruptions in the education and healthcare sectors.\nIn the case of economic recovery, two areas need urgent attention. One of them is vaccination. Without an effective vaccination programme, we can't keep Covid under control. The vaccination campaign needs to be stronger, and the uncertainties related to it must be dealt with. The second issue is stimulus packages. There has been no proper assessment of the effectiveness of stimulus packages. Whether these packages reached the affected industries properly or not must be evaluated. Some analyses done by the South Asian Network for Economic Remodeling (Sanem), through quarterly surveys of business firms, reveal that although micro and small enterprises are the most affected sectors, a large part of them have remained outside of the benefit of the stimulus packages. Also, there are widespread systemic challenges in terms of implementing the stimulus packages. The management of these packages has to be effective and transparent, and the institutional deficiencies need to be removed. There should also be a proper monitoring mechanism for the implementation of these stimulus packages.\nSince the onset of Covid, educational institutions have remained closed, and we have not seen any effective work plan to be able to reopen them in the midst of Covid. A somewhat functional online education system and some distance learning processes have been in place. But due to various reasons\u2014especially the high poverty rate, low access to the online learning platforms, and many other challenges\u2014many students have not been able to participate in the online education or distant learning processes effectively. As a result, there are high chances of a significant part of the young generation falling out of the education system, as dropout rates at primary and secondary levels and the incidence of early marriage of girls have escalated during the crisis. Findings from some recent surveys by Sanem and other research organisations confirm these situations. Therefore, there is a need for an effective recovery plan for the education sector. The recovery plan must consider running the education system while keeping in mind that Covid is here to stay for long.\u00a0\nThe healthcare sector was in deep trouble even before Covid-19 struck Bangladesh, because of the abysmally low public spending on the sector amid widespread institutional deficiencies in terms of corruption and poor management. Covid intensified these problems. Therefore, the health sector needs major overhauling and institutional reform to combat the long-lasting challenges.\nAs we acknowledge and understand that there is no getting rid of Covid anytime soon, we can re-think different planning processes for economic and social recoveries. We must move away from the conventional planning processes to confront new challenges and situations. The new planning process will require innovative approaches, a lot of effort from the government, and critical institutional reforms, especially addressing the corruption and institutional deficiencies in a more rigorous way. As this planning process must involve the major stakeholders, we need to move away from the top-down approach and adopt a bottom-up approach to combat the crises.\nSelim Raihan is executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem).\n",

        "full_article": "Last month, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released their landmark report on climate change that was termed a \"code red for humanity\" by the UN chief. The section of the report that focused on South Asia warned of increased risks of death, injury, ill health or disrupted livelihoods due to storm surges, coastal flooding, sea-level rise and inland flooding. \"The risk of floods, and loss of life and property associated with floods, is highest in India and Bangladesh,\" it stated.\nIn less than a month since the report came out, we are seeing the real-time impacts of climate change as predicted. According to a report in The Daily Star on Thursday, around 30 percent of Bangladesh's land area is set to be inundated as the water levels of the Jamuna and Padma rivers are forecast to continue rising over the next three days. People from flood-affected districts have already been forced to leave their homes\u2014many of them taking shelter, along with their furniture and livestock, on government roads and Water Development Board dykes\u2014and there is an emerging crisis of food and drinking water. Reports from different districts paint a bleak picture of government assistance with delays in providing relief, inadequate relief or no relief at all.\nAccording to a bulletin from the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, of the 109 water measuring points in different rivers, water is flowing above the danger level at 16 points, while water levels at another 50 points are increasing. Given that these changes in water level are being monitored and updated, there really are no excuses for the authorities for not having relief mobilisation and distribution measures in place. The provision of shelter, even for the short term, could also have been done, in the same way such efforts are organised during cyclone warnings.\nHowever, there is a deeper issue that must be highlighted here. Despite the fact that global climate change is having serious negative impacts on Bangladesh, we cannot shy away from our own responsibilities in causing environmental destruction and failing to stop river erosion\u2014both of which have contributed to the current state of affairs. On Thursday, this daily told the story of Jalalpur village in Sirajganj's Shahjadpur upazila, where 500 homesteads, a school and three mosques were lost to the Jamuna River in monsoon, and the remaining 100 to 120 houses are now at risk of being devoured as well. The day before, we reported on Chilmaripara village in Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila, the entirety of which has been swallowed up by the Teesta.\nThere are countless other stories such as these. Data suggests that every year, some 55,000 people are made homeless by river erosion, and experts have long been stressing the importance of a national river management strategy to deal with associated risks. The government cannot drag their feet on this any longer. They must formulate long-term strategies and projects for river bank protection, and work with experts and NGOs to ensure that these projects are implemented where they are most needed\u2014in the most efficient and transparent manner. Additionally, given the magnitude of these climate disasters in Bangladesh, the authorities should set up a permanent fund to rehabilitate the victims of river erosion and flooding, rather than putting together last-minute, haphazard relief programmes once these events have already occurred.\n",

Law enforcers came up with this information recently after arresting five people in two separate incidents along with three elephant ivories in Chattogram. They also discovered that the tusks were being smuggled from Banshkhali and the CHT after the smugglers poached the elephants in deep jungle.\nIn another report published on the same day, four individuals from Ramu upazila of Cox's Bazar electrocuted an Asian elephant and mutilated it in an attempt to cover up the killing. In recent years, according to the International Union of Conservations of Nature (IUCN), 12 elephants were killed after being shot by poachers, while in the last 20 years, at least 120 of these endangered elephants have been killed\u2014mostly through electrocution and shooting.\nSince 1986, the IUCN has labelled the Asian elephants as \"endangered\" as their population has declined by at least 50 percent over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60-75 years. In an attempt to circumvent the law and continue to kill elephants and sell their tusks, poachers have been using the pretext of human-elephant conflict. Reportedly, some of the smugglers apprehended by the police were on the verge of selling the elephant tusks for Tk 35,000. Law enforcers are now running investigations to unearth more information about the black market where poachers are selling elephant tusks after killing the animal.\nDespite having laws in place to prevent the killing of these endangered animals and to punish poachers, it is disappointing that the authorities have been unable to stop a decline in the elephant population. The Asian elephant is the only living species of the genus Elephas, and we must do our utmost to protect them.\nUnfortunately, the results show we have so far failed in that. That has to change. We cannot allow these animals to go extinct. The authorities must redouble their efforts to prevent poachers from taking advantage of human-elephant conflict to murder these animals. In that regard, the Forest Department and law enforcement agencies must work together. If needed, stricter measures should be put in place to prevent poaching and reduce human-elephant conflict. Finally, the authorities should do more to protect elephant habitats and also conduct more research on proper conservation of these endangered animals.\n",
