Deep into the campaign calendar, though, the disconnect between the concerns of the electorate and campaign rhetoric \u2014 especially that of BJP lynchpin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 remains, unfortunately, intact. While job creation, inflation and development have been emphasised by voters as primary issues, Mr. Modi refuses to be driven by the idea of contesting mainly on his government\u2019s record over 10 years of rule and focusing on measures to ameliorate the main concerns. Instead, he seeks to do what he has always revelled in \u2014 attacking the Opposition with truths, half-truths, and non sequiturs. Mr. Modi\u2019s recourse to this is also helped by the shrill noise of television and social media being a useful tool to distract from concerns with the rhetoric that he has used, be it hate speech against Muslims or dog whistles to rev up support from Hindutva adherents. Other parties, including the Congress and its public face, Rahul Gandhi, are also \u2014 even if not to the same extent \u2014 guilty of raking up identity issues such as those related to caste politics. But Mr. Modi and some of his colleagues have taken vituperation as a campaigning device to new levels. In his rally in Jaunpur, he accused the Opposition in Uttar Pradesh, the SP and the Congress, of silence when their southern allies used \u201cabsurd and abusive language\u201d for the people of U.P. and \u201csanatana dharma\u201d.Some of the northern parties in the INDIA bloc have publicly disagreed with DMK leader Udhayanidhi Stalin\u2019s comments on \u201csanatana dharma\u201d while emphasising their stances on social justice and taking on the issue of caste hierarchy. There is more that unites the politics of federalism and social justice espoused by these parties than what divides them \u2014 questions related to linguistic nationalism such as the need for English as a link language \u2014 but that is to be expected from coalitions made up of different political parties. Mr. Modi should focus on the differences in emphasis on how to tackle socio-economic issues between the BJP and the INDIA bloc. But, instead, his use of half-truths as a weapon to rile the Hindi heartland against southern parties is problematic, at a time when there is greater north-south economic integration, with working class citizens from the north migrating to the south for employment. Recently, the BJP inducted Manish Kashyap, a YouTube content creator who had been jailed in Tamil Nadu for spreading false news about Bihari migrants being attacked in the State. Such actions could foment divisive politics that does not help the Indian nation as a whole.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\ndevelopment\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nmedia\n\n/\n\nhate crimes\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nSamajwadi Party\n\n/\n\nRashtriya Janata Dal\n\n/\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam\n\n/\n\nreligion and belief\n\n/\n\nmigration\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nBihar",

        "full_article": "By signing a 10-year agreement with Iran to develop and operate the Chabahar port, India has taken its infrastructure and trade partnership with the Islamic Republic to the next level despite tensions in West Asia. India will invest $120 million and offer a credit facility of $250 million to further develop the terminal it operates in Chabahar\u2019s Shahid Beheshti port and related projects. However, after the deal was signed, the U.S. State Department said entities considering business deals with Iran \u201cneed to be aware that they are opening themselves up to and the potential risk of sanctions\u201d. In the past, American sanctions on Iran had delayed the project. Conceived in 2003, the project did not take off for years after the U.S. and the UN imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme. India signed a memorandum of understanding in 2015 after Washington eased sanctions on Iran following that year\u2019s nuclear agreement, and in 2016, the contract was executed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Iran visit. The U.S.\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran raised questions on India\u2019s continued cooperation with Tehran. But India managed to win a carve-out from U.S. sanctions that allowed it to operate the port through ad hoc measures.The Chabahar port is critical for India\u2019s connectivity plans. First, it offers an alternative route to Afghanistan and Central Asia by bypassing Pakistan, allowing better trade with Central Asia. And, Chabahar is expected to be connected to the International North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC), bringing India closer to Europe through Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. An alternative to the Suez route, a fully operational NSTC would reduce the time and money spent on intercontinental trade. The port, roughly 200 km from Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar, where China is developing a port as part of its BRI, would also help India expand its geopolitical influence in Central Asia. But the U.S. seems to have taken a narrow view of the project over its hostility with Iran. America\u2019s interests in the region have also changed. In 2018, when U.S. forces were backing the Islamic Republic government in Afghanistan, it gave a sanctions waiver to India as Kabul also stood to benefit from the port project. Today, U.S. troops are out of Afghanistan, the Taliban has replaced the Islamic Republic, and the U.S.\u2019s focus is on containing Iran. India, in the past, had taken U-turns in its Iran engagement depending on the policy changes in Washington DC. It should not do that any more. It should stay invested in Chabahar and seek to improve its trade and connectivity projects with Central Asia, which is essential for India\u2019s continued rise.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nIran\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\neconomic sanction\n\n/\n\nnuclear policy\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nAfghanistan\n\n/\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nBelt and Road Initiative",

The Supreme Court in Canberra, Australia, recently sentenced former Australian army lawyer David McBride for revealing information about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan. This comes seven years after Australian public broadcaster ABC published a series of articles based on information provided by McBride. That information was separately confirmed by an Australian govt inquiry. However, it was McBride the whistleblower who was prosecuted.\nFrom false claims to national security\u00a0| Whistleblowing has a chequered history. During the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln\u2019s govt enacted the False Claims Act (FCA) to incentivise reporting corruption in military supplies.\n\nInterestingly, FCA remains on US statute books in an amended form and has been used over the years in cases related to fraud in military contracts and corruption in the pharma industry. But things get murky when it comes to matters of national security and wrongdoings in militaries. State interests and discipline are privileged over those seeking to spotlight internal wrongs.\nRisky business\u00a0| Perhaps the most high voltage case of whistle blowing related to war crimes this century was the highlighting of atrocities committed by US soldiers in Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison. The horrific torture was exposed by Sergeant Joseph Darby. Once identified as the whistleblower, he and his family faced harassment and even death threats. Similarly, US\u2019s NSA contractor Edward Snowden had to flee to Russia for exposing illegal mass surveillance programmes.\nIndia\u2019s paper tiger\u00a0| India passed a Whistle Blowers Protection Act in 2014. Ironically, it hasn\u2019t been notified to date. In any case, the Act has multiple exemptions \u2013 it doesn\u2019t cover armed forces and is not applicable to the private sector. Nor does it provide financial incentives for whistle blowing like the American FCA. Civil society groups have argued that attacks against RTI activists and whistleblowers have increased in the absence of a legal framework. True, state secrets need to be protected for national security. But this can\u2019t be a blanket cover to hide corruption and criminal wrongs.

        "full_article": "For the ordinary citizens, navigating Bangladesh's largely inefficient, opaque, and outdated bureaucratic system can be supremely challenging. The many obstacles and complexities that lie in the way of getting services can leave one not just exhausted, but also bereft of hope. The lack of accountability has also meant that while service-seekers suffered, and redress was delayed or denied, corrupt and often inefficient officials were rewarded.\nAgainst this backdrop, it is hardly surprising to know from a report by this daily that at least 16 commissions and committees have recommended reforms to create an efficient, merit-based civil administration since independence, but those have largely been ignored. It is not difficult to understand the reluctance of the bureaucratic and political leaderships.\nFor civil servants, especially those in high-ranking positions, reforms that promote efficiency, meritocracy, and accountability represent a threat to their influence, benefits, and promotional prospects. Political leaders also do not want to embrace change as it is easier to maintain control over a weak or pliable bureaucracy. The result is that Bangladesh's civil service is still run under the structure recommended by the Enam Commission in 1982, which today is unsuitable to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving socio-economic landscape.\nOur report highlights several bids to bring changes which have been met with disappointment\u2014except, of course, when it benefitted bureaucrats, such as salary increases or the option of \"in situ\" promotions, or posed no real threat to the status quo. It goes without saying that this stagnation of key administrative reforms has had alarming consequences for the country.\nThe Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), for example, identified \"corruption and unskilled bureaucracy\" as the two greatest challenges to national progress in four reports between 2013 and 2021. A recent report by the US administration has identified corruption in Bangladesh as a major deterrent for foreign investors. The banking sector has all but collapsed due to the lack of effective governance. We can cite many such instances where the lack of transparency, accountability, and inefficiency has had disastrous impacts on various sectors.\nThis has to change. We cannot continue to be held back by the preference for short-term personal and political interests. What we need is a bold commitment to administrative reforms that can transform the civil service into one that best serves today's Bangladesh and its ambitions. The higher authorities must demonstrate the courage required to bring such reforms, and the formation of an independent reform commission\u2014as proposed but rejected in recent years\u2014is a critical first step.\n\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "We are surprised to see the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) claim success in their fight against dengue last year, despite 2023 seeing record numbers of dengue-related cases and deaths. The number of dengue patients in Dhaka, he reportedly said, \"halved\" last year compared to 2019 because of \"proper\" mosquito control measures\u2014even though data from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) suggests the opposite. According to the DGHS, 1,01,354 people were diagnosed with dengue in the country in 2019. Among them, 51,762 patients were from Dhaka. Four years later, in 2023, a record 3,21,179 patients were diagnosed with the disease in the country, while the number in Dhaka was 1,10,008.\nThat means, the number of Dhaka's dengue patients in 2023 were actually double that of 2019. Why then would the mayor make such a claim? In so doing, he has neither furnished any data collected by the DSCC nor referred to any other credible source of information. To his credit, however, he did mention that the task of controlling dengue becomes difficult if misleading information is given. But that is exactly what he himself seems to be doing, and the timing couldn't be more unfortunate.\nLocal experts as well as international bodies like the World Health Organization have warned that like 2023, this year too could see huge numbers of dengue patients unless the authorities take timely and appropriate measures. It is, therefore, essential that the relevant authorities take drastic measures to prevent a repeat of 2023.\nThe importance of such measures, with the monsoon season not far away, cannot be emphasised enough. Already, a number of people have died of dengue, including three in the 24 hours until Wednesday morning, taking this year's death toll to 32, according to the DGHS. Incidentally, all three were from the DSCC areas. Therefore, we urge our mayor to shun premature celebrations and start taking meaningful steps to make sure that his organisation does not fail in its dengue prevention efforts this year, like it did last year.\n",

        "full_article": "Comb through the news after SSC results are published, and you may find amid the pictures of celebrations the reports of students who have died by suicide for not achieving their desired results. This tragic phenomenon, though shocking each time, is unfortunately not new.\nLast year saw the much discussed report by the Aachol Foundation, which stated that 513 students had died by suicide in 2023. Out of them, 227 students were school students, meaning that this extremely young demographic accounted for approximately 44 percent of all student suicides.\nThis warrants our attention, not just in the predictable times for these suicides to occur, such as with SSC results, but in general considering how shockingly high the number is. In addition, there is still a heavy stigma attached to suicides, making discussions a difficult matter. Bangladesh's own unique kaleidoscope of problematic beliefs regarding suicide involves superstition, religion, education, class positions, lack of support, fear of shunning, and stereotypes about mental illness. Moreover, mental health services and hospitals to assist people who are struggling or have made an attempt are dismal. All these not only prevent one from reaching out for help, but also delays their recognition of their own suffering.\nWhat we seem to be failing to understand repeatedly is just how vulnerable young people are. In a culture that is so hierarchical, speaking up poses more challenges than it may in other countries of the world. Respect towards parents is heavily emphasised. While this typically includes paying heed to the parent's words and wishes, it may also mean that making parents uncomfortable with what they may be unfamiliar with evokes sharp reactions. For older generations, this realm of unfamiliarity often involves struggles with mental health, sometimes in association with exams.\nOverreactions from parents are a running theme in South Asian social media, one which often portrays the parents as becoming extremely angry at criticism and reacting in such a manner as to make their children silent. While these are played for comedic effect and the situation is not always serious, high expectations along with anger at not performing as expected makes students disinclined from talking freely with parents and other adults. One particularly stressful account mentioned by a student choosing to go anonymous goes like this: following her failure to obtain enough A+ in her JSC exams, her parents refused to speak to her for three months. All this was worsened with the onset of the Covid pandemic, which made matters more difficult. She shared that the pressure became so immense that she might have done \"something harsh\" had she missed GPA 5 in her SSC results, following which it seemed that her mother embraced her after ages. Now, with the HSC exams, she is experiencing a similar kind of pressure once again.\nSuch accounts can often be heard of parents withdrawing from their children, giving the silent treatment for extended periods of time, and dismissing the students' mental health concerns, such as an unhealthy amount of stress or fixation when it comes to exams.\nFurthermore, as a recent article discussed, corporal punishment continues to be a severe issue in Bangladesh. A study jointly conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and Unicef titled Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019 found that for children aged from 1 to 14 years, 89 percent suffered corporal punishment. The extremely detrimental effects of such punishments seem to be unknown to many parents even today. Considering this, we can see why for SSC candidates, the stress of board exams may be an especially sensitive time as it may reopen wounds from negative experiences of the past.\nExacerbating the situation is our culture's repeated failure to understand how perceptive young people can be. Young students are frequently aware of the sacrifices made by their parents. The effects of inflation, increasing competition in public universities, and eventually the difficulties of getting a stable, decently paying job are not lost on them. They also know that should they not gain admission to public universities, private university tuition can be exorbitant, and the thought of burdening their parents weighs heavily on them. At the age of 15-17, this stage of life may seem monumental.\nUnintentionally, we often engage in behaviour that adds pressure. For instance, there is a deep-rooted societal insensitivity to the way we talk about students and their grades. Whether it be grade inflation or auto pass, the manner in which we speak about these often has a tone which implies that students who are taking exams have it easy. This may have a compounding effect on the stress experienced by students who do not perform well. Moreover, the many reasons for why a student may have poor performances is often not explored, further humiliating the students who may in fact just require tailored attention and time.\nLooking at the Aachol Foundation study, it may seem as if more intricate trends exist between certain conditions and student suicides. However, the lack of follow-ups along with the scant amount of details in existing reports on them makes it a complicated task to draw conclusions. It is abysmal that to this day, despite so many repeated incidents of student suicides, we remain lacking in many sectors, and a national suicide prevention strategy is still not in place.\nWe need to recognise that the time of public exam results is an especially sensitive time. The case of Sarbajit Ghosh Ridoy, who took his own life after hearing his results that later turned out to be incorrect, should be seen as a stark reminder of how needless student suicides are.\nTo the young who may be experiencing a difficult situation for the first time in their lives, it may seem insurmountable, and the lack of experience can prevent them from seeing the possibilities that may come their way in the future. In a state of desperation, death may seem like the sole path left. Students, especially ones who are this young, may lack the capacity to understand that obstacles no matter how massive they seem, can be overcome. That almost half of the students who died by suicide last year were school students should alarm us, and it might be time for us to recognise that this may in fact be a public health emergency.\nAliza Rahman\u00a0is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Recognising mishaps workers meet with on way to and from their workplaces as occupational accidents has long been an unmet demand. Finally, the issue has been resolved recently by the government under its employment injury scheme so much so that such a victim will now be entitled to compensation. Notably, at its 8th meeting last Monday, the Governing Board of the 'Employment Injury Scheme (EIS) Pilot' approved the inclusion of the commuting accidents in the scheme'. The inclusion in the occupational or industrial accident category makes such victims eligible for compensation from 1st July this year (2024). In this connection, ILO technical experts extended their support, and commendably so, they shed light on the key technical and financial aspects of the issue and the conditions for accepting commuting accidents as workplace ones. At the same time, they opted for maintaining separate records as the 'commuting accidents' happen outside the workplace.Evidently, through 'inclusion', the scheme now covers two out of three recommended vulnerabilities under the ILO. The third one is occupational disease, which, thankfully, as reported, is in the process of being covered by the EIS Pilot scheme. As the case may be, occupational hazards including occupational diseases are issues that have failed to get the attention they deserve from employers. The decision to cover commuting accidents by EIS Pilot may also have paved the way for including other occupational hazards in the scheme of things. In that case, inclusion of commuting accidents in the EIS Pilot brings the present measure so undertaken by the government closer to ILO requirements, as outlined in the Employment Injury Benefit Convention No. 121 (C-121).Reassuringly, the decision got unanimous support from employers' and workers' bodies as well as government agencies who are members of EIS Pilot Governance Board. However, while supporting the 'inclusion', as fundamental rights of workers for social protection and the benefits to be provided to the commuting accident injury victims, the employers' bodies also wanted to be assured that their (employers') competitiveness was not affected. But seeing that the 'inclusion' is going to protect both the industries and workers as the government's labour and employment secretary was quoted to have told the EIS Pilot governance meeting to that effect, the concern raised by employers is hardly substantiated. In fact, what is often lost sight of in an atmosphere of occasional face-offs between employees and employers over workers' pays and benefits, is that both parties are integral part of the industry. Giving the workers their due only helps improve industry's health. At this point, it would be worthwhile to recall that the employment injury scheme on a pilot scale began in 2022 and the ILO and GTZ (a German development agency) played the leading part in the launching of the initiative. It was a tripartite arrangement between the government and the owners and workers of the Readymade Garment (RMG) industries. Since June 2022, the EIS Pilot has been giving compensations to injured workers and dependants of workers succumbing to work-related accidents in the RMG sector. According to the EIS website, since the scheme's inception, over Tk1.6 million has been provided to the families of workers who died in commuting accidents. Additionally, more than Tk1.0 million has been paid out to those rendered permanently disabled in such accidents. It is eminently commendable to have made such efforts under the EIS Pilot initiative. It is time the government also widened its efforts further to bring all victims of transport accidents under a still broader compensation scheme.",

        "full_article": "With a full-blown civil war going on in neighbouring Myanmar, the Rohingya refugee repatriation issue is now uncertain. The humanitarian disaster involving nearly a million refugees uprooted from that country and forced to flee to Bangladesh had grabbed international headlines a few years ago. Today, the Rohingya issue has been eclipsed by newer conflicts like the one happening in Europe (Russo-Ukrainian war) and the disaster in the Gaza strip. International opinion and attention have moved on, as has the humanitarian aid. This issue has resurfaced because Bangladesh, once again, has been left to pick up the pieces of housing and feeding this very large displaced population mostly on its own.According to the UNICEF Bangladesh Humanitarian Situation Report No. 67 (January 1 to March 31, 2024), things are not so good. As high as 978,000 Rohingya continue to live in 33 camps in Cox's Bazar District and Bhasan Char in Noakhali district. Over half of them (52 per cent) are children. Some 5,000 Rohingya (3,500 children) were displaced in a fire in one of the camps. While this UN body provides a number of shelters and education services, the funding remains poor. This is reflected in the report, which states: \"Supplies valued at $1.26m and funds $72.4m (48 per cent of 2024 HAC requirements) are available for emergency response, leaving a gap of $77.9m to respond to life-saving emergency needs of girls, boys, and women in Bangladesh.Recent media reports state that some 30,000 babies are born in the Rohingya camps every year, which poses new challenges both for the government and the paltry aid / financial commitments trickling down from donors / development partners as the demography of the forcibly removed population continues to rise and more services are needed to cater to needs in areas of maternal health and needs of newborns. Indeed, it is estimated that \"nearly 200,000 children have joined the Rohingya camps within the last six years.\"The financial situation was bad last year when aid agencies were forced to cut back on monthly rations for refugees from US$12 to $8.0 per person. This year too, the United Nations (UN) launched a Joint Response Plan (JRP) on March 13, 2024 where ironically, the government turned out to be the largest donor. This follows a pattern set over the years. Back in 2022, Bangladesh spent nearly $2.0 billion on the Rohingya refugees from its own funds. The money needed each year goes not only to sustain them but also the host communities. Bangladesh took a lot of political flak internationally when it built up the Bhasan Char Island facility, but that same international community remains big on talk but small on financial commitment. Left to its own devices, Bangladesh is being forced to take \"unpopular\" decisions internationally, but which make sense to it domestically.Let's look at some facts on the ground. According to media reports, some \"117 distinct partners-ten UN agencies, fifty-eight Bangladeshi NGOs, thirty-five international NGOs, and fourteen other national and international organisations-are running 195 projects. Yet, according to the UNICEF appeal (March, 2024), the funding gap stands at $77.9 million out of a total ask of $150.3 million! This persistent funding gap has forced the government to seek a billion-dollar package from the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank. Some confusion had arisen when initial reports appeared in media that the WB was giving it as a loan, but the bank clarified its position later (54.5 per cent loan and the rest grant). The fact of the matter remains that the traditional donor agencies that have till now supported the refugee population stranded on Bangladesh territory are not really interested in continued support.This is reflected in the recent joint statement issued by Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the US on May 14, 2024. These governments agreed that 2023 was a bad year for the Rohingya when the financial gap was $301 million which resulted in all sorts of curtailment in food rations leading to food insecurity \"and increasing vulnerability to exploitation\". The present state of insufficient funding will mean that \"over 150,000 won't be able to access essential services, including food, safe drinking water, shelter, protection, and healthcare. In addition, in lieu of Liquid Petroleum Gas, nearly 100,000 households will likely resort to collecting firewood, leading to potentially 14,000 tons of firewood being extracted monthly in the region, leading to deforestation and negative environmental impacts.\" After the visit to the Rohingya camps the representatives of governments of following nations have announced their contributions to IOM's Appeal under the 2024 Join Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, which include, US - $7.6 million; Norway - NOK6.5 million; Japan already committed $2.6 million. Sweden and Switzerland have expressed \"political support\" which is nice, but financial support would have been better.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation last week announced that a number of roads and streets would be renamed after eminent literary exponents, journalists and artistes besides the name of freedom fighters. He argued that the personalities would be honoured by doing so, and citizens would be proud of them. The intention of the city corporation is good, no doubt. Naming roads and streets after eminent personalities is a healthy culture. However, many inhabitants in Dhaka are unaware of the individuals whose names are tagged with roads and streets. Although they regularly walk through the streets or drive on the roads, the names spark little interest among many. How many people living around Bayley Road know it is named after Sir Stuart Colvin Bayley, a British civil servant and Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal from 1887 to 1890? In 2005, the road was renamed as Natok Soroni in Bangla meaning' theatre road.' Nevertheless, it is still known as Bayley Road.One and a half decades ago, the city corporation renamed 67 roads in the capital city after freedom fighters and language movement heroes, thanks to the initiative the undivided city corporation took. Unfortunately, people still use old names and do not even bother to learn about new ones. The conditions of the plaques inscribed with the names and brief introductions of the individuals are piteous in many places. When someone turns to enter the street stretching the Segunbagicha neighbourhood from Shahid Nazrul Islam Road, they will find the half-broken tablet inscribing the name and identity of Dr Qazi Motahar Hussain. The street was named after the eminent thinker, statistician and chess master. Though this kind of negligence is disappointing, no one should be taken aback by it. Ignorance of history or disrespect to heritage is common in this part of the world. Again, it is also not entirely a matter of an indifferent attitude to heritage or history. Sometimes, inadequate attention to citizens' necessities and concerns by the authorities frustrates people. Without keeping the walkways and street sides free from illegal encroachment by makeshift vendors, moves to rename the roads and streets matter little to residents and commuters. Months after months, they have to suffer due to the absence of barrier-free walkways and safe streets to move smoothly. One city corporation mayor announced renaming the roads and streets in the presence of councillors of different wards. To many, this sounds humorous, as many of these councillors backed the illegal encroachments in their locality, ignoring the residents' troubles. In many areas, residents are fed up with uncontrolled mosquitoes, as the local councillors are not active enough to address the issue. The list may be long, and the city corporation cannot solve all the problems as many other agencies are involved. It also does not mean there is no need to rename the roads and streets after eminent personalities. It is also a universally accepted way of publicly honouring those persons' achievements. It sometimes helps make young people curious about the lives and works of those people. Some argue that street names are a 'physical marker' of history. The names assist people in figuring out where they are and talk about where they have been and where they are heading -- literally and allegorically. So, let the city corporation go ahead with its plan and let the inhabitants participate in this effort. At the same time, the city corporation should be more active in ensuring the optimal use of the roads and streets by keeping them free from illegal encroachment. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Thousands of garment industry workers in this country, most of whom are employed in export-oriented factories, are apprehensive whether their due salaries and festival bonus would be paid before Eid. These workers contribute significantly to earning foreign currency. The garment industry is a pioneer in hiring both technical and non-technical personnel for its operations, with most employees working as operators.In Bangladesh, there are two main religious festivals. On these occasions, garment workers are compelled to launch street movements to get their salaries and bonuses cleared. This is very unfortunate. For celebration of Eid, employees also need extra money. Therefore, it is essential to clear all dues before Eid.\nMd.
