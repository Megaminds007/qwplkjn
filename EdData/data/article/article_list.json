More specifically, it jumped to 5.3 percent in 2020\u2014the first year of the pandemic\u2014from 4.22 percent in 2019. A World Bank report published in 2019 revealed that 32 percent of public university graduates and 44 percent of private university graduates were without jobs in the country.\nA survey by the Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies (BIDS), conducted between February and June this year, found that 66 percent of the graduates of National University are unemployed. Those (21 percent) who could manage a job have an average salary of Tk 30,000. Seven percent are still pursuing post-graduation, and only three percent have become entrepreneurs.\nAnother survey jointly conducted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and Oxfam in Bangladesh found that 61.57 percent of working people had lost their jobs in March and April last year due to Covid-related shutdown. Even though 15 percent of them returned to their work in a month, the majority of them remained unemployed for a long time. The poor and marginalised people faced, and still face, an even higher risk of loss of livelihood.\nThe pandemic has had a long-term negative impact on women's employment in Bangladesh. A survey conducted by Brac Institute for Governance and Development (BIGD) revealed that one-third of the young working women in the country were out of jobs as of January 2021, when economic activities resumed in Bangladesh.\nSeveral reports have shown that, due to Covid-19, income generation among the working class has fallen remarkably, and the country now has 24.5 million new poor.\nOver the past two decades, our working-age population has increased significantly\u2014from 58 percent to 68 percent. About 30 percent of the population is between 15 and 30 years. If the government trains and employs them appropriately, they can open up new economic opportunities. However, if we cannot utilise them, they will become a burden on the economy, especially when our country is already facing a crisis due to the pandemic.\nOn the one hand, millions of young university graduates are waiting to enter the job market. On the other hand, numerous people are losing their jobs and daily incomes. Our government jobs are limited, and the private sector is not large enough to provide employment opportunities to such a large number of people. How should we, then, address this pivotal issue?\nA functional approach to expand the job market, foster economic growth and eradicate unemployment would be to attract foreign and domestic investments in various sectors, which is only possible if we create a business-friendly environment. If the government takes necessary initiatives to upgrade the country's position in global business indicators like the Ease of Doing Business (EDB) and the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), it will boost investor confidence. Once the investors have confidence in our system, they will create new jobs.\nIn the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 2020 ranking, Bangladesh ranked 168th among 190 countries. Likewise, in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 2019, Bangladesh was positioned at 105th among 141 countries.\nWhereas foreign investors have invested billions of dollars in countries like Vietnam, India, and Indonesia, we have struggled to retain reinvestments from the already existing companies. Investors often complain that the bureaucracy in Bangladesh is too convoluted and creates hurdles in business operations. The policies and terms for obtaining approval papers, utility connections, property handling and other relevant business operations create delays and hidden costs that are avoidable.\nBesides the bureaucratic hassle, corruption and poor infrastructure, and the lack of skilled labour are some other issues that create an investor-averse environment. As our universities and academics are not closely connected to industries, which is how it is in the developed countries, university curricula offer a set of skills that are often irrelevant to modern workplaces.\nMoreover, the increasing use of technology and artificial intelligence is a new threat to job security. A company that previously hired hundreds of people can now run its business successfully using advanced software operated by only a few. Consequently, ensuring employment for a mass population is getting challenging day by day.\nWhile the economy has been hit hard by Covid-19, job opportunities have decreased, and the number of unemployed youths has increased, entrepreneurship can be the panacea for all economic ills.\nTherefore, we should redesign our education system to empower our youth and create entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial skills\u2014like taking responsibility, owning a task, management, planning and strategising, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking, financial knowledge, and developing emotional intelligence\u2014should be taught at all levels of higher education, regardless of what the academic programmes are. Simultaneously, foreign policies should focus more on attracting foreign investors. Overall, we must revisit our business policies and improve the ease of doing business in Bangladesh to attract both foreign and local investments.\n\u00a0\nMd Kawsar Uddin is an assistant professor of English at the International University of Business Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT).\n",

        "full_article": "On the sandy desert of Dubai and in the barren stretches of Abu Dhabi, it is ektur jonno difficult to connect bat with ball, to avoid wides and mokkhom good-length deliveries, and to hold on to a multiple loppa catches with both hands or to stop a boundary with your palm or your booted foot if you happen to speak in Bangla. That has been the explicit dark lesson from the T20 World Cup, except for the occasional sparkles flashing out of the galleries due to the glittery attires under the Middle-Eastern sun.\nCricket is a wonderful game. Here, the spirit of sports is supreme. Losing or winning doesn't matter; to the losing team, that is. See, I wrote \"losing\" ahead of \"winning\" because participation is so very important. That is why after losing five matches in a row, Bangladesh will play straight into the final round of the next T20 World Cup. We lost, but cricket is the winner. I cannot blame the optimists for saying that our team has indeed improved since the last assembly of world greats, for which we had to struggle through the precarious qualifiers.\nBut the notorious cynic has delivered a deadly googly\u2014that during the current T20 World Cup, stronger performing teams had a meeting atop Burj Khalifa, a venue chosen to surreptitiously avoid the media. There, it was reportedly decided that they were under pressure to create world records\u2014at a personal level, and also from their respective governments\u2014to divert the focus away from rising prices of fuel, rising sea levels, and the rising political mercury. Who better to strike a record than Bangladesh?\nThat is the revenge we must seek. Show the world that we are no longer the sitting ducks of 2021. A different year, a different venue, and we are all hoping for a different team. Let us perform in all six sectors: batting, bowling, fielding, scoring runs, avoiding wides and loppas, and catching the dollies.\nUnfairness abound as well. And, honestly, I am not pointing fingers at the fixed matches played by the others. Chhih! Our watertight integrity is that we do not play any fixed matches. No, never! That is because our results are already fixed. There is a sense of proshanti in that most often foregone conclusion. But for the grumbling and the criticising patriots raising hell, we could have ensured that cricket remained for another hundred years a gentleman's game, where the outcome of a contest is like grades in Play Group. Our motto is: Don't worry, just play.\nAs for the injustice, I am referring to our natural inability. We hit, they catch. They hit, we can't always catch. The sun, remember! But in some cases, it is because they are simply taller than most of us. International matches should be held height- or weight-wise. Let us learn something from wrestling and boxing. Now, the smart alec among you will mention Sachin and Miandad. I knew it! But we are here focusing only on normal human beings. Concentrate!\nTo calm the waters after the Gulf storm, the government should henceforth ban pre-match expert opinion on television. They should be okay at home, because the wife and the husband never listen when the other is talking. Experts also must voluntarily avoid offering any preview on cricket performance, because their predictions make them look amateurish after every match. They could talk about venues and records, evaluate matches already played, but they should never delve into the future. That's dangerous! That acumen requires study and research, and an analytical mind. Intelligence helps.\nThe incomprehensible disorientation of our cricketers at this world tournament reminded me of events unfolding at a studio while taking a passport photo. The very cautious cameraman asks you to lift your chin a wee bit, move your face a little to the right, not so much, up your shoulders, then bring your eyes down samanno, smile, not so much, perrrfect\u2026 and click goes his DSLR camera. And you have an unrecognisable portrait. Our cricketers seem to be abiding by the advice of every coach, on and off the field, resulting in distorted batting posture, grotesque bowling action and hilarious catching. Physios should recommend cotton in the earhole\u2014both of them.\nPassport pictures do not always tell the truth. However, a recent press conference testified that mirrors speaketh the truth. Mushfiqur Rahim, not going exactly through the best of patches, was livid after the match against Sri Lanka on October 24, perhaps because he had just knocked 57 off 37 balls after quite some time.\nCriticised for unexpected and repeated disappointing performances, Mushfiqur advised the critics (read avid fans) of his Bangladesh team to look at their faces in the mirror. His next statement was pathetic from a cricketer, who has been showered with much love, genuine admiration and handsome honorarium by these same followers: \"They do not play for Bangladesh; we do.\" Actually, it would perhaps not make much of a difference if we played. There is no score lower than zero, or a punishment higher than six.\nHaving been advised by a celebrity with such a massive contribution to our cricket, we all have had a good look into the mirror. Besides our old moles befriending new dark spots, mistaken dimples in the vicinity of fresh wrinkles, this was a great opportunity to see who we are: flawed but not arrogant, imperfect but not ungrateful, sinful but seeking forgiveness. We have faced the truth, Mr Mushfiqur Rahim. Will you too face your demons? In the mirror, that is.\nWe need not argue any further. I have found a solution to our problem of losing five times. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) should bid for the next World Cup. It's a lot of hard work, planning and PR, marketing and manoeuvring. But most importantly, we should prepare the slowest of dead pitches, select 10 spinners with left-right mix in the starting XI, and a bowler-wicket-keeper without pads. Till then, please leave the Tigers in the jungle alone. They cannot speak for themselves.\n\u00a0\nDr Nizamuddin Ahmed is an architect and a professor, a Commonwealth scholar and a fellow, Woodbadger scout leader, Baden-Powell fellow, and a Major Donor Rotarian.\n",

        "full_article": "At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts and pundits spun visions of how the crisis would reshape the global economy. Many heralded the opportunity to transform our financial systems, supply chains, and ways of working. The overall message was that the post-pandemic future would be greener, healthier, and more just.\nNow, almost two years after the pandemic started, excitement about creating an economic \"new normal\" has mostly dissipated. Apart from occasional lockdowns and mask-wearing, the world has largely returned to business as usual. The fight against the pandemic repeatedly has been described as a \"war,\" but there have been no radical changes akin to a wartime mobilisation. On the contrary, the global pandemic response has operated under pre-pandemic economic norms. Despite urgent appeals for a \"people's vaccine\" and repeated calls for vaccine equity, the rules of the market dominated vaccine distribution, and the pharmaceutical industry has marched on, unreformed.\nLikewise, policymakers continue to act as if\u2014to paraphrase Greta Thunberg\u2014the world is not on fire. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a \"code red for humanity.\" Yet, the countries' current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the framework established by the 2015 Paris climate agreement are inadequate to achieve the Paris accord's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to preindustrial levels.\nThe ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland is the most immediate policy lever available. But the international climate regime needs to go beyond voluntary commitments to reduce emissions and make good on the rich countries' promise to provide financial assistance to the world's poorest and most vulnerable parts.\nI am not an economist. I am a physician who specialises in the new field of \"planetary health,\" which focuses on the links between human and planetary well-being. Its core premise is straightforward: protecting and improving our health requires tackling the underlying causes of human disease and ecosystem damage simultaneously.\nThe economy we have today is destroying our well-being. It unleashed human ingenuity, created financial wealth, and lifted billions of people from poverty. But it also damaged ecosystems and exacerbated social inequality. During the first year of the Covid-19 crisis, more than 114 million jobs were lost, while the world's wealthiest became USD 5 trillion richer than they had been before the pandemic began. And by accelerating climate change and biodiversity loss, our current economy imperils future generations' ability to survive and thrive. As a planetary health physician, I believe that the treatment for this disease is economic\u2014not medical.\nDuring this pandemic, we have witnessed a dramatic surge in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)\u2014face masks and shields, gloves, and gowns that look like astronaut suits. But to truly recover, we also need a different kind of PPE\u2014a people- and planet-centred economy. Because climate change and other forms of ecological damage increase the likelihood of future pandemics, this PPE would not just liberate us from the current crisis. The goal established by the World Health Organization's Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response\u2014to make Covid-19 the last pandemic of its kind\u2014depends on it.\nA people- and planet-centred economy is one that advances the well-being of the entire Earth. It is an economy that has deep respect for the planet's boundaries, such as the temperature limit enshrined in the Paris Agreement. And it ensures that the basic daily needs of all people are met\u2014for example, through universal healthcare systems and redistributive social policies. The metrics of success for this PPE are not gross domestic product or per capita income, but the ability of children to grow up to reach their full potential or the restoration of species threatened with extinction.\nAn example of this PPE has already been proposed by English economist Kate Raworth. Unlike the current economic model, with its limitless supply and demand curves, Raworth's \"Doughnut Economy\" visualises a narrow \"safe and just space for humanity\" that neither overshoots the planet's boundaries nor falls short in meeting society's basic needs.\nEarly in the pandemic, the city of Amsterdam committed to adopting the doughnut as its post-pandemic economic model. Since then, the city has implemented projects and policies ranging from the circular use of materials in building construction to reforms in the local fashion industry. The next challenge is to apply this model in low- and middle-income countries to ensure that they fulfil their societies' needs without breaching planetary limits.\nWe have entered the \"decisive decade.\" Only nine years remain before we reach the deadlines set by the Paris Agreement and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We must use this critical period to design a true people- and planet-centred economy. The growing planetary health community has an important role to play in creating an alternative that will help us overcome the pandemic, and ultimately meet the goals we have set for ourselves as a civilisation.\n\u00a0\nRenzo Guinto, chief planetary health scientist at the Sunway Centre for Planetary Health in Malaysia, is inaugural director of the Planetary and Global Health Programme at the St Luke's Medical Center College of Medicine in the Philippines.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2021\nwww.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "Starting from unannounced road blocks forcing commuters into hours of traffic congestion, to making important arterial roads off limits for visiting foreign guests, to cutting off gas and power for maintenance work without prior information, to unreasonable diversion of traffic for megaprojects, to frequent government price hikes of essentials\u2014all are done without an iota of consideration for public convenience, leave alone rights. Much of the frustrations of ordinary people could be handled better only if public rights and the government's obligation to citizens were at all on the radar of our bureaucrats and planners.\nIt is true that governments often need to take unpopular decisions. Among them, raising prices of essentials is the most troubling both for the government and the citizens. For the former, it leads to an immediate decrease in popularity and general unrest, and for the latter, an increased economic burden, making life more difficult to bear.\nA good example of that is the government's decision to raise fuel prices on November 3. On that day, the government raised the prices of diesel and kerosene by 23 percent, from Tk 65 to Tk 80\u2014two items that directly impact the economy and the lives of the most disadvantaged segment of society. The total consumption of diesel is four million tonnes, 70 percent of which is used by the transport sector and 20 percent by the farmers. Kerosene's total demand is 100,000 tonnes, mainly used for cooking, lighting and aviation fuel.\nTwo reasons were given for the rise: One, too great a price difference between India and ourselves will lead to fuel smuggling. How will this be stopped with diesel price being Rs 101.56 as of November 1, which is equivalent to Tk 124.41 per litre, while our diesel will now cost Tk 80? Price differential of Tk 44.41 per litre (more than 50 percent) will remain, which is sufficiently a big margin for smuggling to continue. So, this argument does not hold water.\nThe second reason was straightforward: the rise in international prices. In the July-September period, the average price of oil shot up by 71 percent to USD 73 per barrel. Then in October, it hit USD 83.7. So, we must raise our prices\u2014was the government's logic. The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) was losing Tk 20 crore a day. This bleeding had to stop, and raising the price by 23 percent would be the minimum that they could live with.\nThe energy ministry's logic is that domestic prices will have to reflect international prices, and since diesel and kerosene prices have gone up, so must the prices at the consumer end. We would have found this argument acceptable if domestic prices were actually adjusted with the fluctuating international oil prices, meaning our prices not only go up, but also reverses when the international prices dip. But it seldom does\u2014and when it does, there is only a marginal adjustment.\nImmediately after the Covid-19 pandemic struck the world and the global economy slumped, oil prices came down to USD 27 per barrel. From 2015 to 2021, the BPC made a profit of Tk 43,138 crore. Where did this \"profit\" come from? From the public, who were forced to pay a much higher price for diesel and kerosene than they should have had to, as the international prices were quite low. By what right did the energy ministry extract additional payment from ordinary citizens? It is, in our view, equivalent to a form of extortion by the government under a false pretence.\nIf we accept BPC's claim that it is losing Tk 20 crore a day, then the yearly loss roughly comes to Tk 7,300 crore\u2014far less money than what PK Halder robbed from our banks. This could have easily been offset from BPC's accumulated profit from the last six years. Even today, in the midst of our pandemic recovery, the government will earn a near equivalent amount from VAT and duties on fuel, which it can use to pay the BPC, thereby obviating the need for energy price hike. But the energy ministry chose to \"extract\" the money from the consumers, who are mostly lower middle-class, if not downright poor, and risking gravely damaging our economic recovery.\nWhich brings us to the question of timing. Why now? Just when we are recovering from Covid, just when our exporters are beginning to put their feet on the ground, when our domestic manufacturers are steadily putting their houses in order, when our labourers are beginning to find jobs, entrepreneurs are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel, just when our farmers\u2014who kept us well-fed during the height of the pandemic\u2014are finding a way out of their depressed situation, to suddenly impose a price hike that will hurt us the most appears more like a sabotage of our recovery than a policy to ensure our growth.\nNobody benefits from this, except the BPC and its parent ministry. It appears that people's\u2014if I may dare say, the government's\u2014interest has been set aside to serve that of a corporation.\nThe price hike hit at the very root of the transport sector\u2014which acts as the pivot in maintaining market stability\u2014forcing the owners of these vehicles to raise fares. But they also took advantage of the situation to demand a hike in fares far higher than was necessary. Though the government said it was 28 percent, the market reality was 50 percent. For the transport owners, it was a golden opportunity to hold the public hostage and force the government's hand, under the threat of strike, to concede to their proposals. The bus and truck owners claimed that the last fare hike was in 2015, which for launch owners was in 2013. Hence, all their pending demands had to be fulfilled now.\nFinally comes the issue of the method in which the government implemented the fuel price rise.\nThere is a practice of holding a hearing in which stakeholders' voices are given a play. Whether they are ever taken into consideration, we have very little evidence of. But the ritual is held and, if nothing else, the media covers it so that the people come to know, at least, what are the issues at stake.\nThis time around, even this ritual was not held, bypassing the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) which usually hosts these hearings. Why? So far we have had no answer. As a result, the declaration of the price hike took everybody\u2014save those who were responsible for formulating it\u2014by total surprise. The first people to react were the transport owners, whose vehicles stayed off the road and demanded new passenger tariffs to be fixed before they resumed their services. After three days' strike and the resultant public sufferings, the government increased bus fares by 28 percent and launch fares by 43 percent. The BPC's interest as well as the bus, truck and launch owners' interest were served.\nGuess whose interest has not been served? You are right, the interest of the people\u2014the daily commuters. They have no union, no lobby group, no rich benefactor. Our public representatives are supposed to represent them. But the reality is that most of them have their own respective economic axes to grind. Where is the time to think of the public? Our parliament has much better and more important things to do. People thought they had votes that they could cast every five years and bring their wishes to the fore. Since that does not count\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014anymore, they have no option but to accept whatever is made to come their way.\nLet's do some common-sense reasoning. The bureaucrats of the energy ministry and that of the BPC knew full well what the impact of raising fuel prices would be on the economy, and how ordinary people would suffer. They also knew very well that transport owners of all types would make all sorts of exaggerated demands and, through a sudden strike, force the government to accept their demands. Knowing all this, shouldn't they have had some sort of a dialogue with the relevant stakeholders first? The fare hike could have easily been calculated based on the 23 percent hike of diesel and kerosene prices, agreed upon, signed and sealed and then made public, saying that from such and such date, fuel prices will be raised by the government and all those sectors affected by it will be allowed a rise of fares as detailed. This would have saved the public so much trouble and hardship.\nInstead, a chaos followed in which commuters suffered immeasurably. The decision to raise fuel prices was taken on November 3. It came to the press on November 4. No high-level meeting was held till the following Sunday\u2014due to Friday and Saturday being weekend holidays\u2014after three days of harassment, physical suffering and precious loss of time for the poor and the ordinary. When meetings did take place, they only formalised the owners' demands, as if the fuel price rise was actually an excuse for the government to sanction price rises for the bus and launch owners.\nIt is our view that such things happen because of a fundamental disrespect for anybody who is not a part of either the officialdom or the ruling party of the day.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The dire condition of the Dayarampur Government Primary School at Dayarampur village, under Haripur union of Pabna's Chatmohar upazila, is worrisome and it represents the state of many other schools across Bangladesh. The school has been in operation since 1991, with the current headcount of students being 154. It was only nationalised in 2017, but has seen no development since then. Due to being situated in the middle of Chalanbeel, it is already inaccessible, except by boat, for a few months every year. During other times, the students must reach the mere 40-feet-long tin-shed establishment on muddy paths. The school often teaches students of multiple grades in one room, and also has no toilet available for use.\nIt was only in September that schools finally reopened for physical classes across the country, after being closed for a year and a half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An analysis by Unicef in August found that over 40 million Bangladeshi students from pre-primary to higher education levels had been adversely affected by this prolonged closure. While children from urban and semi-urban areas were still able to somewhat access education through digital learning materials and online classes during this time, it was the children in remote areas who fell victim to severe learning loss, child labour, and/or child marriage.\nThe authorities' lack of care for schools such as the Dayarampur Government Primary School represent a bigger picture of how the education sector is not prioritised, time and again. A glaring example of this is that, despite the impact the pandemic has had on this sector, of the total proposed national budget for 2021-22 fiscal year, only 11.9 percent was allocated to education. This is even lower than the 12.3 percent in the revised budget for 2020-21 fiscal year.\nIf the government is paying no heed to the development of schools in remote areas, how are students supposed to feel encouraged to study there? Given the recent surge in unemployment and increase in poverty, parents in poorer districts are already demotivated to send their children back to school. If schools themselves are also kept inaccessible, there is a high possibility that the country will see even greater numbers of dropouts.\nWe hope that the plan to allot Tk 3 lakh this fiscal year for administering urgent repair work of the Dayarampur school will be seen through. But we must also urge the government to not neglect schools in remote areas\u2014and the education sector as a whole\u2014now that they need authoritative support the most. The effects of such continued neglect may not seem urgent now, but will reverberate throughout the next few decades.\n",

        "full_article": "A number of women's rights groups as well as legal experts have disagreed with the recommendation of a Dhaka court to the police to not accept any rape case if a complainant goes to the police station 72 hours after the incident. We believe that this would further risk victimising the victims. For many women, it takes months\u2014even years\u2014to come to the conclusion that they want to fight such a case. In many cases, it may not even be logical to expect a victim to overcome her trauma within 72 hours. Then how can we expect them to make the decision to fight the case and, having made up their mind, make a complaint to the police, all within a 72-hour timeframe?\nGiven how unfriendly our police and justice system are toward victims of rape\u2014as evident in numerous past cases\u2014making the decision to fight such a case is even more difficult for women. On top of that, such preconditions might discourage victims from seeking legal help altogether. That is clearly not something that we would want.\nRape is one of the most serious crimes on the books. And women who are victims to it suffer from serious mental and physical trauma. That trauma can easily take a long time to heal. The social stigma that is often associated with rape means that any complainant has to muster up a huge amount of courage before stepping up and lodging an FIR and then fight the case\u2014which often requires them to once again live through that trauma. Because of all these reasons, the justice system should be shaped in a way that encourages rape victims to pursue justice, not shy away from it. And the same applies when it comes to the attitude of law enforcement agencies towards any victim. Thus, the recommendation could well impact both and tip the balance of power against the victims.\nAs some activists have pointed out, what happens if a woman is raped and then forcefully held by the perpetrator for 72 hours? Will she never get the chance to seek justice?\nAs such, we humbly state, with all due respect to the judge, that the court's recommendations will not only not serve justice, but they will have the very opposite effects. With less than three percent of rape cases ending in convictions in Bangladesh, we request the courts to address the loopholes in the legal system and make it more friendly towards rape victims who, because of various social, cultural, economic and other reasons, have an extremely tough time pursuing and getting the justice they deserve.\n",
