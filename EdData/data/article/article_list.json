        "full_article": "The 23rd meeting of the \u201cSpecial Representatives\u201d (SRs) of India and China \u2014 National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister and Senior Politburo member Wang Yi \u2014 was a milestone in the restoration of ties since October this year. Although the meeting of SRs is a stand-alone process, meant to look at the broader boundary dispute and resolve differences over the 3,500 kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC), it had been paused since the military standoff in 2020. There were a few firsts too: the two men meeting in their capacities as SRs since 2019, although they have held talks in the interim; such a high-level visit to China and also Mr. Doval travelling to Beijing since 2020. This indicates that the decision to hold the SR talks, as mandated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping during talks in Kazan in October, is a signal that with only LAC disengagement completed, New Delhi is willing to move ahead on other mechanisms for talks with Beijing, without waiting for the next processes of de-escalation and de-induction. The two sides have agreed to restart the Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra from India, border trade in Sikkim, and data sharing for trans-boundary rivers. Other suspended ties, including direct flights, business and student visa liberalisation, and journalist exchanges, are also understood to be under discussion. On the boundary question, the Doval-Wang talks yielded what the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs termed as \u201csix consensuses\u201d, and the Ministry of External Affairs referred to as \u201cpositive directions\u201d in its release. These involve continuing to implement the LAC de-escalation process; revert to the SR process on resolving the boundary issue according to the Eleven-articles set out in a 2005 agreement; strengthen Confidence Building Measures at the border and cross-border exchanges; enhance coordination of the SR process, and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs to follow up agreements and to hold the next Doval-Wang talks in 2025 in India.The optics and the messaging of the SR meeting indicate a certain momentum in re-engagement after four years of serious military tensions, and the suspension of regular contact, although bilateral trade continued to thrive. The meeting comes just ahead of 2025, that marks 75 years of diplomatic relations, and a likely visit to China by Mr. Modi as it hosts the next SCO summit. While restoring the links is important, it is necessary to strike a note of caution so that the situation caused by the amassing of troops and LAC transgressions by the PLA in 2020 is not repeated. The government must also ensure more transparency in its conversations with Beijing over the future steps in normalising ties, the dismantling of buffer zones, restoration of status quo ante to 2020, and mechanisms for future deterrence against aggression at the India-China boundary.

        "full_article": "The Mumbai boat tragedy is a wake-up call for improving marine safety. A busy port, a naval dockyard, the Mazagon dockyard, fishing boats, and a popular tourist destination \u2014 the Gateway of India, a launching pad for tourist boat rides \u2014 are all located in the same area. Merchant ships and naval vessels jostle for space with tourist and fishing boats, creating a congested and potentially hazardous environment. Sea trials of a new craft involve testing it under the most stringent operating conditions to determine whether machinery and hull are safe and seaworthy. Typically, sea trials for merchant ships are conducted in open waters. However, the naval speed boat that collided with Neelkamal is typically housed inside a naval ship and launched only for operations. This means it must be tested for maximum speed and manoeuvrability in shallow waters, possibly ruling out open-sea testing. During sea trials, machinery and controls are often subjected to strenuous conditions, increasing the likelihood of failure. On Wednesday, such a failure likely occurred, leading to the collision. Neelkamal is an old-fashioned V-shaped wooden boat prone to capsizing if it takes on water, though it will not sink. When the accident occurred, pilot boats from the port rescued around 100 passengers, most of whom were wearing life jackets, which are a proven defence against drowning. Unfortunately, those who could not hold on to the capsized boat or were not wearing life jackets did not survive.An inquiry will determine whether the boat was carrying more passengers than its capacity and if there were enough readily accessible life jackets. It is necessary to establish guidelines for life jackets that can be donned quickly and easily, even by panic-stricken individuals, without being prohibitively expensive. Tragedies such as the 2009 Thekkady boat disaster have raised significant awareness in Kerala about the importance of life jackets. However, this incident serves as a broader reminder that sea or water transport is fundamentally different from road and rail travel. The sea \u2014 and even deep freshwater bodies \u2014 remains an inhospitable domain for humans. Without assistance, drowning or hypothermia is likely. In Scandinavian countries, where the sea is an integral part of daily life, survival skills for the water are taught to everyone. It may be time for India to incorporate survival-at-sea training into schools and workplaces, alongside first aid and other life-saving measures, to foster greater awareness and preparedness.

        "full_article": "Lesson\u2019s the same, from stranded space stations to jammed hospital computers: tech needs better safety systems\nImagine an eight-day office trip turning into more than an eight-month one. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happened to Sunita Williams. Together with Butch Wilmore she had flown up to the International Space Station for a short trip, only to see it turn longer and longer because of tech issues. For those who freak out simply on finding themselves in a rice field thanks to a freethinking navigation app, the idea of being stranded like Williams is totally nightmarish. But from sending down Diwali greetings to casting her vote to now dressing up in a Santa hat, she seems to be holding up well. Space is her happy place, her husband says. Good for her. But, often, glitches in the tech matrix, land us in unhappy places.\nRemember the Blue Screen of Death from earlier this year? It left such a mess everywhere. Folks missed their work deadlines and got stuck with late fees on their payments due, and counted themselves lucky. Others had harrowing hours at airports and hospitals. And it wasn\u2019t even mala fide, just a routine Windows upgrade hitting a snag. A \u2018fix\u2019 was swiftly applied. But not swiftly enough to avert existential hand-wringing. How vulnerable does its dependence on machines make humanity? Do smart phones, smart watches, smart glasses, smart cars, smart locks, smart fans\u2026leave us stupidly exposed?\nWe could all be Trishankus, he who found himself in limbo, neither of the sky nor earth. We have come so far on the tech trail, that no matter the dangers, walking back to some pastoral or luddite haven is not an option anymore. Forget the big jobs, we don\u2019t even want to write without auto-correct and sing without auto-tune anymore. That leaves only one option. To make the safety systems more robust, from Nasa to Microsoft to OpenAI to Paytm to AIIMS\u2026\n\n",

        "full_article": "The current thaw in India-China ties doesn\u2019t reduce the possibility Beijing can turn hostile again\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe winter thaw in India-China relations was extended via the six-point \u2018consensus\u2019 hammered out in Beijing. This includes resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage to Tibet, cross-border river cooperation and trade at Nathu La pass. All positives. But not enough to address the fundamental concern India has vis-\u00e0-vis China. A discernible pattern has emerged in New Delhi\u2019s dealing with CCP bosses over the past decade.\u00a0\nChinese push and pull | Recall that Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to India in 2014 coincided with a PLA intrusion in LAC\u2019s Chumar sector. While Xi was talking to Modi, Indian soldiers were locked in an intense standoff against Chinese troops. Many commentators then gave Xi a pass on account of him being in the early stages of exerting control over the Chinese state machinery. But then the 2017 Doklam standoff happened, with India\u2019s strategic-security interests in the Siliguri Corridor being challenged. This, again, was followed by a thaw when Modi and Xi had their informal summits in Wuhan (2018) and Mamallapuram (2019). Yet we got Galwan.\nThe border question | It\u2019s clear from this pattern that the border dispute remains a fundamental issue in India-China ties. Despite several rounds of talks, Beijing clearly has no serious intention of resolving it. Its rhetoric that \u201cIndia-China disputes must be resolved properly\u201d is nothing but a tactic to divorce the border issue from the overall bilateral relationship. Even now Beijing wants to address \u201ceasy issues\u201d first before moving on to contentious ones. The emphasis on maintaining the \u201coverall relationship\u201d is meant to compartmentalise the border problem to New Delhi\u2019s disadvantage.\u00a0\nStrategic rivals | Beijing wants to keep the border issue open to use it as and when politically convenient. For Xi\u2019s centralisation agenda within China and the Covid pandemic, Galwan was a welcome diversion. Now, as China gears up for a renewed trade war with Trump 2.0, it wants to ensure relations with India remain stable. But this doesn\u2019t mean PLA salami slicing along LAC will definitely stop. As highlighted by Pentagon, China hasn\u2019t scaled down its huge military presence along LAC since Galwan.\u00a0\nTread cautiously | Therefore, New Delhi needs to be extremely cautious here. India and China are not on the same page on multiple issues \u2013 from Indo-Pacific to Indian Ocean Region to Africa. Xi\u2019s ultra-nationalist turn means he will do anything to remain in power. And he has shown ties, and agreements, with India can be acceptable casualties.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A surprise Yuletide visitor has brought us a wonderful Christmas present\nLast week Bunny and I received a surprise visit from a bearer of gifts who, in our minds, had long become a myth. No, it wasn\u2019t Santa Claus. It was someone even more legendary: a postman.\u00a0\nWe couldn\u2019t remember the last time we\u2019d been visited by, or even seen, a real postman, a species distinct from the ubiquitous couriers.\u00a0\nAlong with gramophones, black-and-white TVs, and other relics, postmen have disappeared from our lives as though they\u2019d never existed, having been vanished by a wave of the magical wand of digital technology, of laptops, and emails, and smartphones.\nThe postman brought us a Christmas card from friends in London, Roopa and Dan. Like postmen, greetings cards, Christmas or any other, have been dematerialised, banished by the same digitised wizardry as postmen, being replaced by computer-generated graphics and emojis.\u00a0\nWhen Bunny and I lived in Calcutta, every Yuletide season we\u2019d hang up the Christmas and New Year cards we\u2019d get from distant friends and relations, who in turn would get the cards we\u2019d send out in an unbreakable tradition.\u00a0\nWe\u2019d decide which charitable cause card we\u2019d get \u2013 CRY, or HelpAge, or the World Wildlife Fund \u2013 and draw up a list of all those we\u2019d send them to.\u00a0\nThen there were the postage stamps to be got, from the Park Street post office. We knew the postal rates for the cards to be delivered within the country, but the postage for the ones meant for foreign shores had to be ascertained from the post office.\nThe envelopes for the cards being sent abroad would carefully have to be marked CARD ONLY and BY AIR MAIL, to which PAR AVION would be added if we wanted to sound French, to obviate the possibility of their being shipped off by sea to arrive at their destination in the middle of next summer.\u00a0\nThe postman\u2019s visit vividly brought all this back to us. The card wasn\u2019t the only thing the postman gave us. He also gave us the gift of memory of times long past. Maybe, after all, he was Santa Claus in disguise.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is quite disturbing that the problems that plagued the administration under the ousted Awami League government continue to persist despite promises of change following the mass uprising. According to a report by this daily, since the interim government took charge in August, the number of officials in the upper echelons of public administration has ballooned to over three times the number of approved posts. As a result, there are now 467 officers against the 150 additional secretary posts, 861 officers against 250 joint secretary posts, and 1,599 officers against 450 deputy secretary posts. The persistence of supernumerary promotions\u2014a legacy of the Awami regime\u2014has made the administration even more top-heavy and imbalanced. While most of the new promotions may have been intended to address grievances from the AL era, it has ended up creating fresh challenges.\nOne doesn't need reminding of the consequences of such indiscriminate and unnecessary promotions without vacancies. Besides disrupting the natural hierarchy in the administration, this practice causes various logistical challenges, inefficiencies, and even inter-departmental discord, thanks to feelings of resentment by other officers. It also means increased burden on the tax-paying citizens. Meritocracy is the biggest casualty in such a situation, which is unacceptable. Currently, the public administration consists of 26 cadres, among which officers from the administration, foreign affairs, and police cadres get supernumerary promotions, with the administration cadre receiving the majority. In contrast, officials from other cadres are promoted only when positions are vacant.\n\nThe persistence of supernumerary promotions\u2014a legacy of the Awami regime\u2014has made the administration even more top-heavy and imbalanced. While most of the new promotions may have been intended to address grievances from the AL era, it has ended up creating fresh challenges.\nThe question is, why is the government allowing this deeply problematic culture instead of rectifying longstanding issues within the administration? Recovering from the fallout of supernumerary promotions may take years as promotions, once given, cannot be taken back. While addressing past grievances over deprived benefits and promotions for political reasons is important, it must not be at the expense of meritocracy and accountability. Our report cites some cases where officers, once punished for corruption, have been promoted after August 5. The committee formed to address grievances among administration cadre officers deemed to have been deprived in the past has also recommended compensations, including retrospective promotions, for 764 of them. Surely not all grievances are justified, or deserving of selective intervention, especially if it involves providing unethical benefits or forgetting past transgressions.\nCompounding this issue is the controversy surrounding the recommendations of the Public Administration Reform Commission. The commission's recent proposals\u2014including introducing exams for promotions to deputy secretary and joint secretary positions, and ensuring a 50:50 ratio between administration and non-administration cadres for deputy secretary promotions\u2014have sparked outrage among some cadre associations. While these measures aim to promote fairness and competence, resistance from entrenched interests threatens to derail the reform drive.\nThis calls for decisive but carefully-thought-out interventions from the authorities, including the reform commission which must prioritise the interests of citizens while formulating policies. The higher authorities also must resist the pressure to appease any interest group, and undertake comprehensive reforms in public recruitment and promotion processes to restore public trust in the civil service.\n",

But considering the overall situation, including the economy, lack of investment, law and order, and people's eagerness to see an elected government and parliament installed as early as possible, we think Prof Yunus and his interim government should opt for the first of the two options he has suggested.\nAnd this is why.\nThe main aim is to have both reforms and an election. Reforms, because we just cannot go back to the past practice of holding an election then allowing the winning party to do whatever it wishes, especially if it has a two-thirds majority. We must amend the constitution to restore checks and balances among the executive, legislative and judiciary, curtail the unilateral power of the prime minister, make the judiciary functionally independent, make the various statutory bodies like the National Human Rights Commission, Information Commission and Election Commission independent, make the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, etc autonomous, and ensure freedom of speech and of the media, among other things. A fundamental reform would be to make the parliament functional and enable it to hold the executive genuinely accountable.\nHowever, as important and crucial as the reforms are, one cannot postpone the elections much further. We need to move away from a makeshift arrangement of an interim government to a more stable one of an elected government, fully backed by the constitution that will give the new government all the legality, legitimacy and prestige of any democratic government in the world. An election is necessary to restore the world's faith in Bangladesh that we can wade through whatever challenges a situation may provide and still continue in the path of democracy. This is the most important thing to prove to the world.\nBoth can be achieved within the next 12 months.\nAll the main six reform committees, the most important ones as stated by the chief adviser himself, are scheduled to submit their reports by the end of 2024 or maximum by January next year. The chief adviser's suggestion about the formation of a consensus commission is, in our view, a brilliant innovation that will help us move towards a stable future. The consensus commission will engage with all the political parties to reach consensus on which recommendations are to be implemented by the interim government\u2014through ordinance\u2014and which are to be left for the elected government. Achieving a consensus among all parties will be a major political goal, which has not been achieved since the all-party charter during the fall of the Ershad government in 1990. Since the chief adviser himself will chair the consensus commission, we feel confident that a positive outcome will certainly emerge.\nComing back to the timeline, if the commission starts its work following the submission of reports by December-January, the interim government will have nearly 10 months to move towards the election.\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin said on Tuesday that the Election Commission has been preparing for the election from the day of their taking office, and it is ready to comply with the dates suggested by the chief adviser. He also said he would be able to complete updating of the voter list within the next two months. If the Election Commission goes for the more elaborate process of updating the voter list by doing a door-to-door verification process, it still should not take more than six or seven months, which will take us at best to July or August next year.\nSo, both in terms of the completion of the reform processes and in terms of preparation for the election, the coming 12 months appear sufficient from all counts to go for the polls. Also, the fact that the winter season has traditionally been preferred for holding the general elections because of the reduced prospect of natural disruptions like rain, floods, cyclones, etc must not be overlooked.\nThe actors in the political field today are Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamaat-e-Islami, and numerous smaller political parties. The new entry, which is likely to be a significant player, is the political party of the student groups that played a decisive role in toppling the old regime. They have declared their intention of forming a political party within a very short time, with its own student wing.\nBNP is the party waiting at the doorstep of assuming power. Therefore, its eagerness to push for the earliest timetable for the election is predictable. The speech by Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, on December 18, urging his party members to focus on \"reforms and not revenge\" deserves commendation. He further said, \"If you want to respond to the injustice, oppression and suppression done to you, you should not imitate what they [Awami League] have done. If we do so, there will be no difference between them and us.\" This is a highly refreshing and welcome position, and a very powerful and farsighted one.\nEven before the submission of the constitutional commission's recommendations, Tarique has said he and his party will recommend two terms for the prime minister, to be fixed by the constitution. As the person who may hold that position, if voted so, he was in fact putting restrictions on his own possible future tenure\u2014a most appreciable and hitherto unprecedented gesture. He also expressed his support for a bicameral legislature for the future. Both these suggestions have far-reaching political consequences for us, and clearly shows that the acting chief of today's BNP is thinking ahead.\nThe party's 31-point programme, which was prepared some time ago, lays out clearly what the BNP proposes to do once in power. However, we are used to our political parties promising the moon before the election and then forgetting everything once in power. But given the July-August uprising, we hope things will be different this time.\nJamaat has extended a conditional support to the chief adviser's polls plan, with the secretary general saying, \"Despite our initial reluctance regarding the delay, we will remain patient as long as the chief adviser honours his commitment to hold elections\u2026 we are ready to cooperate with him.\" This clearly shows that Jamaat is not in any hurry. The reason is obvious: the more time it gets, the more will Jamaat, as the second biggest party right now, be organised when the election comes.\nIt is our view that smaller parties will acquiesce to the chief adviser's mid-2026 timeline as they may not expect too much from the election and are better off now in terms of being treated on an equal footing with all others.\nAmong the most interesting political developments that are likely is the new party planned by the students. It will be interesting to see them emerge as a political force, get voters' support by joining the election, and participate in the governance process, being elected MPs. The new party may bring about a refreshing change in our political scene with new and bold ideas aimed at removing discriminations from our society. However, they would prefer more time to be able to organise themselves better, and hence are opposed to an early election.\nWhatever the differing stances of various political parties may be, people in general would, we think, prefer to exercise their franchise to elect their government, something they have been deprived from for the last 15 years.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Historically, revolutions often begin with an unified call for justice, equality, and change. These movements are driven by collective frustration against oppression and systemic inequities. Bangladesh's ongoing journey of reform reflects such transformative aspirations. What started as a student-led mass uprising with the noble aim of dismantling injustice now finds itself at a critical juncture. The nation must decide whether to safeguard the ideals that sparked this movement or allow them to be overshadowed by factionalism and opportunism.\nAt its heart, the uprising was a response to deep-seated inequalities. The initial days were marked by hope\u2014a belief that unity could bring about meaningful change. Students, intellectuals, and reformers stood together, inspired by a vision of a better Bangladesh. However, history teaches us that revolutions are inherently fragile. The French Revolution, for example, began with cries for liberty and equality, but quickly descended into chaos due to internal divisions and opportunism.\nToday, similar challenges threaten Bangladesh's revolution. What was once a united front has fractured. Different groups, each driven by distinct agendas, are vying for influence. This fragmentation undermines the original purpose of the movement. The parallels to George Orwell's Animal Farm, where noble ideals gave way to self-serving leadership, are hard to ignore.\nOpportunistic elements have emerged, exploiting the July uprising's momentum for personal gain. These actors are adept at manipulating narratives, turning public grievances into tools for their benefit. Their actions, whether through financial exploitation or spreading discord, jeopardise the very foundation of hope the revolution was built upon.\nCompounding this issue is the re-emergence of malign forces. These actors, reminiscent of Charles Dickens's corrupt aristocrats, have sensed an opportunity in the government's vulnerabilities. By exploiting public dissatisfaction, they aim to reclaim lost power. This growing boldness is evident in the surge of criminal activities across the country. Incidents like the murder of an elderly woman in her own home or crimes in supposedly secure neighbourhoods reveal a troubling erosion of public safety\u2014a cornerstone of the uprising's promise.\nLaw enforcement agencies find themselves ill-equipped to address this rising chaos. Political interference, resource constraints, and low morale have left them struggling to maintain order. While the military's involvement has provided temporary relief, relying on armed forces to handle civilian law enforcement is neither sustainable nor ideal. The government must act decisively to empower the police and restore their credibility.\nThe path forward demands courage\u2014not just from the government but from the very people who initiated this revolution. As Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean reminds us in Les Mis\u00e9rables, transformative change requires the integrity and resolve of good individuals. Students, intellectuals, and reformers must rise above divisions and work collectively to reclaim the movement's narrative.\nThe government, for its part, must prioritise restoring law and order. Bold investments in law enforcement, coupled with measures to ensure political neutrality in policing, are essential. Transparency in governance can help rebuild the trust that has been eroded. Regular updates on progress and clear communication with citizens will reinforce the government's commitment to the uprising's ideals.\nCommunity involvement is another critical component. Local initiatives such as neighbourhood watch programmes and public awareness campaigns can foster a sense of collective responsibility. Addressing the socioeconomic roots of crime\u2014poverty, unemployment, and systemic inequities\u2014must also be central to the government's long-term strategy.\nThe military's role, while currently necessary, should remain temporary. Strengthening civilian institutions to manage law and order is vital for sustainable governance. A gradual transition away from military involvement will ensure that democratic processes remain intact and public trust in civilian leadership is restored.\nUltimately, the success of this revolution will not be measured by the fervour of its beginnings but by its ability to bring about lasting change. If Bangladesh can navigate this critical period with wisdom and resolve, it has the potential to emerge as a beacon of resilience and reform. The sacrifices of its revolutionaries must not be in vain.\nAs William Faulkner once wrote, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" The challenges facing Bangladesh today carry echoes of past struggles, but they also hold the promise of a brighter future. The July uprising's ideals\u2014justice, equity, and unity\u2014must be upheld at all costs. Failure to act decisively risks turning this moment of potential into a cautionary tale for future generations.\nThe road ahead is fraught with challenges, but it also offers a unique opportunity for transformation. Bangladesh stands at a crossroads. The decisions made now will shape its legacy for years to come. This is a moment not just for reflection but for action. Time is of the essence, and the responsibility to act rests on every citizen committed to the dream of a better Bangladesh.\nMd Kawsar Uddin\u00a0is associate professor in the Department of English and Modern Languages at the International University of Business Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT).\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
