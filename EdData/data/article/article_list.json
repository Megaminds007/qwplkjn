Mr. Modi presented the aesthetics of the new building as a representation of India\u2019s myriad diversity, its rich cultural heritage and its soaring aspirations. A multi-religious prayer was a part of the ceremony, but there was no mistaking that Hindu ritualism overshadowed all else. By weaving an artful tale around a Sengol, a sceptre gifted to the first Prime Minister of India by a Shaivite sect of Tamil Nadu, the current dispensation has sought to reimagine the founding principles of India\u2019s republican sovereignty. A Sengol symbolised divine right and is now installed in the Assembly of people\u2019s representatives. The symbolism strengthens Tamil Nadu\u2019s connection to the political centre of India, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to make political gains from it. It is also notable that the day of the inauguration was also the birth anniversary of V.D. Savarkar, the founding father of Hindutva. A quest to transition Indian republicanism to a new iteration was apparent in the style and substance of the ceremony.The new building also turns the spotlight, tangentially, on an approaching challenge of representation that will be upon India within the next decade. A nationwide delimitation will reallocate representation as per the current population, leading to a significant, relative reduction of the voice of linguistic minorities of the southern States in Parliament. The size of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha will likely expand in order to avoid an absolute reduction of representation of States that have stabilised their populations. But that may not be enough to assuage the feeling of disenfranchisement that is already palpable among many regions due to the geographical fragmentation of Indian politics. The BJP wins its parliamentary majority from its strongholds while many States remain outside its sphere of influence. On 38% of popular votes, the BJP has 55% of Lok Sabha seats currently. This imbalance will be aggravated after the delimitation. The BJP\u2019s outreach to regions and communities outside of its current catchment areas is to be welcomed. But the Centre and the BJP will have to show more seriousness, sensitivity and maturity to deal with the regional imbalances of India. For this, they will need to take recourse to more than just symbolism.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nParliament proceedings\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/ \n\nreligion and belief\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nLok Sabha\n\n/\n\nRajya Sabha",

This system is to be made and installed by the French corporation, Atos \u2014 an information technology service and consulting company. The Narendra Modi government signed a deal in December 2018 with France to procure high-performance computers worth \u20b94,500 crore by 2025. These HPC systems will run at two institutions, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, that currently host two of India\u2019s most powerful such machines, Mihir and Pratyush. Like their predecessors, the Atos machines will be used primarily to run sophisticated weather models that, for some years now, are being used to prepare a range of forecasts, from long-term monsoon to fortnightly as well as daily weather changes. Extremely powerful machines are needed for this purpose as accurate forecasts are premised on being able to simulate the state of the atmosphere and oceans. \u2018Supercomputers\u2019 is a buzzword and term that is in constant flux. Supercomputers of two decades ago are today\u2019s student laptops and gaming consoles.\rWhile many challenging research questions, apart from weather modelling, are extremely dependent on computing \u2014 protein biology, aerospace-modelling applications, and now AI-linked applications \u2014 the possession of HPCs is also used as a medallion by countries wanting to signify their technological prowess. The Top500 project has for over two decades maintained a list of the top 500 most powerful HPC machines and this is updated twice a year, with countries prominently advertising the presence of their systems if they make it to the list. Currently, a machine housed at Pune\u2019s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) is the only Indian machine in the top 100 with a top speed of 13 petaflops. Floating point operations per second (FLOPS) are an indicator of computer processing abilities and 1 petaflop is a 1,000 trillion flops. The to-be installed French machines are expected to be 18 petaflops and India already has a handful of machines at multiple research institutions in the petaflop range. The possession of powerful supercomputers is certainly a reassurance that Indian scientists, wanting to solve intractable problems, can always tap these behemoths, but whether the use of these machines has translated into significant breakthroughs in fundamental science or engineering commercial products is another matter. Much like India has improved its short-term weather forecasts and made cyclone forecasts more accurate on the back of such machines, there should be greater accounting of their worth in other fields, rather than be content with epithets of speed and power.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nweather science\n\n/\n\nIT/computer sciences\n\n/\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\naerospace\n\n/\n\nFrance\n\n/\n\nPune\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi",

        "full_article": "What happens when a spin doctor of the Prime Minister hijacks the marketing strategy of a third-generation jeweller to score a political point? Answer: A sceptre controversy. When Vummidi Bangaru Chetty jewellers put out a video on a sceptre (sengol) they had presented to Jawaharlal Nehru on the eve of his \u2018tryst with destiny speech\u2019 on August 14, 1947, the BJP saw a double-edged sword. It would\u2019ve been a brilliant coup, but for some fact-checkers doing their job. Now it looks like one edge of the sword is drawing blood from the hand that holds it.\nAccording to Union home minister Amit Shah, Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, handed over a sceptre, brought from Tamil Nadu by a mutt chief, to Jawaharlal Nehru as a symbol of transfer of power. He said C Rajagopalachari was the brain behind the ritual. Years later, the sceptre was found in an Allahabad museum, labelled as Nehru\u2019s walking stick.\n\nMany people including Rajagopalachari\u2019s grandson and biographer Rajmohan Gandhi said they were not aware of Rajaji\u2019s role in the \u2018sengol\u2019 story.\nAnd nobody including Amit Shah could produce any evidence to support the claim that Mountbatten gave it to Nehru to signify transfer of power. And not many remembered that Nehru was against the \u2018divine right\u2019 (where the king is believed to be selected by a god or goddess, and not by the people) theory which went against the letter and spirit of democracy. Yet the ruling party went ahead with its plan. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the \u2018sengol\u2019 from the Thiruvavaduthurai pontiffs in an alleged re-enactment of the 1947 ritual and installed it on Sunday near the speaker\u2019s chair in the new Parliament house. For good measure, there were prayers by representatives of several religions.\nSymbolism isn\u2019t a bad thing, but distortion of history is. We don\u2019t know if the BJP story is true, only that there is not enough evidence to support it. Whether the BJP manages to \u2018gather\u2019 enough evidence to buttress its story or not, the sceptre is likely to return to the political discourse next year, especially in Tamil Nadu, during the general election campaign. Here\u2019s how the BJP would try to use it as a double-edged sword to be used against the Congress and the DMK.\nAlready BJP leaders are taking credit for \u201csalvaging\u201d the sceptre which the Congress had \u201cdiscarded\u201d as a walking stick and reinstalled it to its old glory as a symbol of power. The more strategic narrative would be that it was the BJP that celebrated a Chola custom (it\u2019s another matter that \u2018sengol\u2019 had been an integral part of coronations of all kinds of kings in the region) as a central part of the inauguration of the new temple of democracy. That the pontiffs who handed over the sceptre to Modi represent non-Brahmin mutts is pertinent. The subtext is that Tamil Nadu was steeped in Hindu customs and rituals much before the Dravidian branding.\nThat last part isn\u2019t wrong. The Cholas \u2013 and other dynasties that ruled the region \u2013 had built some of the biggest and most beautiful temples and practised Hindu rituals. But the moot question is if the BJP can claim to be the sole representative of those practices. In Tamil Nadu, many leaders of the AIADMK and the DMK (Palanivel Thiaga Rajan for one) are practitioners of the Hindu religion. Jayalalithaa was arguably the most openly pious Hindu chief minister the state had.\nAnd when it comes to sceptre as a symbol of power, virtually every leader has been presented one on political platforms. One of the most famous pictures of Jayalalithaa after she was appointed as the propaganda secretary of the AIADMK was that of her handing over a sceptre to MGR. She got one later when she became chief minister. Despite C N Annadurai having been a critic of the 1947 sceptre ceremony, M Karunanidhi and M K Stalin had received sceptres at victory rallies. Holding a \u2018sengol\u2019 is one thing, being a king is quite another.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A grand ceremony and sharp political rhetoric greeted the new Parliament. If the splendour and hi-tech amenities reflected new ambitions, the war of tweets and statements pointed to a bitter political divide that can act as a drag on that ambition. So, as our MPs get ready to work from a swanky new office, they and, even more, their party leaders must ask what use is India\u2019s new House for India if it can\u2019t house thoughtful, civil debates and pass well-scrutinised laws that make things better for citizens. Which is to say it would be tragic were the ways of the old Parliament carry over to the new one.\n\nIt isn\u2019t much of a Parliament when the din of hoots and heckles and raised fists, chairs and mikes are what make news. Debates that belong to Parliament play out on social media. Speeches suitable for election rallies are made in the House. The 15th Lok Sabha set a record as the least productive in terms of hours it met. BJP, then in opposition, believed obstruction of Parliament was a democratic form of protest. The 17th Lok Sabha is often criticised for hasty law-making without enough debate, due diligence or discussion.\nIf Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are Parliament\u2019s heart and mind, parliamentary committees are its nerve-centre, deliberating year-round, scrutinising bills. Yet too often, bills are not sent to committees. In this Lok Sabha, barely 13% of bills were sent to committees till monsoon session 2022. This number was 27% in the 16th Lok Sabha. The 15th Lok Sabha sent 71% of its bills to committees. A country as vast, stratified and complex as this, an economy that will be the third largest in the world within the lifetime of many MPs must be governed by laws that have had the benefit of many close and diverse looks. The new Parliament must resuscitate the tradition of parliamentary committees being prime players in law-making.\nThe onus lies on parties, those who attended the ceremony and those who didn\u2019t, to make the new Parliament new in a meaningful way. But, as per the well-understood precepts of parliamentary democracy, the biggest onus lies with the governing party. BJP and especially BJP\u2019s leadership must therefore make the first moves on reviving India\u2019s old parliamentary culture, in which debate and decorum coexisted happily. The party has accused the opposition of dishonouring the new Parliament. BJP must show it knows how to truly honour the splendid new addition to India\u2019s governance architecture.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We welcome the government decision to put over 74,000 outdated buses, trucks and other commercial vehicles under crushers. The decision was apparently revealed through a circular issued by the Road Transport and Highways Division (RHD) earlier this month. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), there are at least 36,123 buses and minibuses that are past their 20-year economic life, while 38,123 trucks, lorries and tankers are past their 25-year life. Ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles is vital to improve road safety and reduce pollution \u2013 both of which we need to work on desperately given the high number of accidents occurring every year and our record levels of air pollution caused, among other factors, by black smoke emanating from old vehicles.\nDoing away with unfit vehicles is thus a step in the right direction. However, as typical of any government initiative in Bangladesh, this too risks becoming a victim of poor planning and lax enforcement. Reportedly, although the government set the economic lifespan of commercial vehicles, a guideline on scrapping them has yet to be finalised. Additionally, the gazette on economic lifespan hasn't been published either. The authorities say they would start dumping old vehicles once the gazette is published. But BRTA officials still don't know where to dump those, or for how long those should be kept in their custody.\nThe authorities will also have to hire contractors to scrap the outdated vehicles. According to the draft Motor Vehicle Scrapping Guideline-2023, the government will be outsourcing the job to enlisted private firms that will carry out the task under BRTA supervision. Officials, however, said the draft guideline and the RHD circular contained some discrepancies regarding the way private vendors would be hired. This only adds to the concerns given the government's poor history in hiring contractors. Also, there's no clarity on who will eventually foot the bills.\nWhat all these inconsistencies and uncertainties show is that the decision, delayed as it is in a country long known for unsafe roads, has not been planned or coordinated properly. It can only mean further delays in execution, and further trouble when the scrapping begins. We urge the authorities to address these issues before getting started with the project, so that it doesn't get stuck halfway through or end up being a total waste of money and energy.\n",

        "full_article": "Future historians may well mark the second half of March 2023 as the moment when the era of artificial intelligence truly began. In the space of just two weeks, the world witnessed the launch of GPT-4, Bard, Claude, Midjourney V5, Security Copilot, and many other AI tools that have surpassed almost everyone's expectations. These new AI models' apparent sophistication has beaten most experts' predictions by a decade.\nFor centuries, breakthrough innovations \u2013 from the invention of the printing press and the steam engine to the rise of air travel and the internet \u2013 have propelled economic development, expanded access to information, and vastly improved healthcare and other essential services. But such transformative developments have also had negative implications, and the rapid deployment of AI tools will be no different.\nAI can perform tasks that individuals are loath to do. It can also deliver education and healthcare to millions of people who are neglected under the existing frameworks. And it can greatly enhance research and development, potentially ushering in a new golden age of innovation. But it can also supercharge the production and dissemination of fake news, displace human labour on a large scale, and create dangerous, disruptive tools that are potentially inimical to our very existence.\nSpecifically, many believe that the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 an AI that can teach itself to perform any cognitive task that humans can do \u2013 will pose an existential threat to humanity. A carelessly designed AGI (or one governed by unknown \"black box\" processes) could carry out its tasks in ways that compromise fundamental elements of our humanity. After that, what it means to be human could come to be mediated by AGI.\nClearly, AI and other emerging technologies call for better governance, especially at the global level. But diplomats and international policymakers have historically treated technology as a \"sectoral\" matter best left to energy, finance or defence ministries \u2013 a myopic perspective that is reminiscent of how, until recently, climate governance was viewed as the exclusive preserve of scientific and technical experts. Now, with climate debates commanding the centre stage, climate governance is seen as a superordinate domain that comprises many others, including foreign policy. Accordingly, today's governance architecture aims to reflect the global nature of the issue, with all its nuances and complexities.\nAs discussions at the G7's recent summit in Hiroshima suggest, technological governance will require a similar approach. After all, AI and other emerging technologies will dramatically change the sources, distribution, and projection of power around the world. They will allow for novel offensive and defensive capabilities, and create entirely new domains for collision, contest, and conflict \u2013 including in cyberspace and outer space. And they will determine what we consume, inevitably concentrating the returns from economic growth in some regions, industries, and firms, while depriving others of similar opportunities and capabilities.\nImportantly, technologies such as AI will have a substantial impact on fundamental rights and freedoms, our relationships, the issues we care about, and even our most dearly held beliefs. With its feedback loops and reliance on our own data, AI models will exacerbate existing biases and strain many countries' already tenuous social contracts.\nThat means our response must include numerous international accords. For example, ideally we would forge new agreements (at the level of the United Nations) to limit the use of certain technologies on the battlefield. A treaty banning lethal autonomous weapons outright would be a good start; agreements to regulate cyberspace \u2013 especially offensive actions conducted by autonomous bots \u2013 will also be necessary.\nNew trade regulations are also imperative. Unfettered exports of certain technologies can give governments powerful tools to suppress dissent and radically augment their military capabilities. Moreover, we still need to do a much better job of ensuring a level playing field in the digital economy, including through appropriate taxation of such activities.\nAs G7 leaders already seem to recognise, with the stability of open societies possibly at stake, it is in democratic countries' interest to develop a common approach to AI regulation. Governments are now acquiring unprecedented abilities to manufacture consent and manipulate opinion. When combined with massive surveillance systems, the analytical power of advanced AI tools can create technological leviathans: all-knowing states and corporations with the power to shape citizen behaviour and repress it, if necessary, within and across borders. It is important not only to support Unesco's efforts to create a global framework for AI ethics, but also to push for a global Charter of Digital Rights.\nThe thematic focus of tech diplomacy implies the need for new strategies of engagement with emerging powers. For example, how Western economies approach their partnerships with the world's largest democracy, India, could make or break the success of such diplomacy. India's economy will probably be the world's third largest (after the United States and China) by 2028. Its growth has been extraordinary, much of it reflecting prowess in information technology and the digital economy. More to the point, India's views on emerging technologies matter immensely. How it regulates and supports advances in AI will determine how billions of people use it.\nEngaging with India is a priority for both the US and the European Union, as evidenced by the recent US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) and the EU-India Trade and Technology Council, which met in Brussels this month. But ensuring that these efforts succeed will require a reasonable accommodation of cultural and economic contexts and interests. Appreciating such nuances will help us achieve a prosperous and secure digital future. The alternative is an AI-generated free for all.\nManuel Mu\u00f1iz\u00a0is provost of IE University and dean of the IE School of Politics, Economics and Global Affairs.\n\nSamir Saran\u00a0is president of the Observer Research Foundation.\n",

        "full_article": "Henry Kissinger, a controversial but most influential geopolitical strategist in American history, turned 100 on May 27. Over the last few days, many articles have labelled him as \"crooked,\" \"war criminal\" or plain \"evil.\" Some also agree that despite all these, he remains an influential thinker in geopolitics who has deeply shaped US foreign policy. American policymakers still consult him on world affairs, such as the Ukraine war or the conflict with China. But Kissinger's legacy has indeed been bloody.\nA brilliant political theorist with a PhD from Harvard, Kissinger rose to prominence in 1969-76 when, as the national security adviser, he led the US-Soviet Cold War negotiations. In 1971, he secretly travelled to Beijing to establish diplomatic relations with China that culminated in a visit by President Richard Nixon the following year. Kissinger was already seasoned in \"realpolitik,\" or power politics, based on practical and material factors, rather than theoretical or ethical objectives.\nPeople in Asia know Kissinger for his infamous roles in Bangladesh (1971, killing millions), Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia (where he prolonged the war and initiated carpet bombing that killed 150,000), and Indonesia (actively involved in Suharto's killing spree and attack on East Timor, killing at least 100,000). But his notoriety in Latin America is perhaps unparalleled.\nIt was Kissinger's plan for General Augusto Pinochet to overthrow (and kill) Chile's democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973 with extensive support from the CIA. The Nixon administration was actually willing to work with Allende. But Kissinger, in typical Machiavellian style, convinced the president to end him instead. After the coup, Pinochet continued his murderous repression with full American support, which Kissinger ensured.\nWith an assassin-like apathy, Kissinger repeated the same in 1976 after an Argentine coup overthrew President Isabel Per\u00f3n, where the military rulers carried out atrocities on an even greater scale. In the so-called \"Operation Condor\" that followed, left-wingers were killed throughout Latin America, which some in the State Department pointed out, but Kissinger muffled all such voices. This was a repetition of the events in Bangladesh where Archer Blood was ostracised by the administration for sending reports of Pakistan's genocidal activities in Dhaka.\nEach of these incidents is enough to raise charges of war crimes. Maverick journalist Christopher Hitchens made a strong case for it in\u00a0The Trial of Henry Kissinger\u00a0(2001). The book is an indisputable testament of how Kissinger's ambitions and ruthlessness directly resulted in widespread murders and indiscriminate slaughter in Indochina, Bangladesh, Chile, and East Timor. The Vietnam War (including conflicts in Laos and Cambodia) perhaps received the greatest publicity in the world press partly because of the huge public protests in many countries of the world, including the US. Kissinger knew well that it was an unwinnable war, but he still continued it, causing many deaths that could have been avoided. Later, he made sure before interviews that the book would not be mentioned and has always avoided questions about the Vietnam War.\nHowever, Oriana Fallaci, the most feared political interviewer in the world, pinned him down on Vietnam, forcing him to acknowledge that it was indeed a useless war. Later, Kissinger admitted it was the most disastrous decision for him to agree to the interview in which he likened his foreign missions with Hollywood's lone cowboy image. He later tried to retract it, but failed, because Fallaci had recorded the entire conversation.\nKissinger, a cold-blooded Machiavellian and prophet of realpolitik, has no qualms about doing unpleasant things with unpleasant people. That explains how he could order carpet bombing in Cambodia, destruction of the economy in Chile (\"make the economy scream\"), or stopping grain shipment to Bangladesh (which he termed a \"basket case\" and wanted it to remain so). Born in Germany, Kissinger had direct exposure to Hitler's anti-Jew persecution. His family fled to London and then to New York in 1938 when he was 15. His biographer Walter Isaacson believes that his experiences during Nazi rules have influenced his character as an adult. Is it because of this that he often employed a ruthless policy towards other (weaker) nations?\nDuring the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arabs in 1973, he allowed the Israeli army to advance before initiating any diplomatic efforts to stop the war. Later, the US replenished Israel's defence equipment with arms worth $2 billion when Golda Meir asked for $850 million only. Kissinger left his marks in every continent, almost in every country, with similar effects, such as large-scale civilian deaths, economic devastation, and perpetual shifting of the balance of power favouring an ally.\nIronically, Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for achieving peace in Indochina, jointly with Vietnam's General Le Duc Tho. The general turned it down because he didn't agree that peace was achieved, but Kissinger accepted it with \"humility.\" The award remains among the most disputed in Nobel Prize history.\nTo many in the world, the name Kissinger is synonymous with duplicity.\nDr Sayeed Ahmed\u00a0is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.\n",

The decision was apparently revealed through a circular issued by the Road Transport and Highways Division (RHD) earlier this month. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), there are at least 36,123 buses and minibuses that are past their 20-year economic life, while 38,123 trucks, lorries and tankers are past their 25-year life. Ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles is vital to improve road safety and reduce pollution \u2013 both of which we need to work on desperately given the high number of accidents occurring every year and our record levels of air pollution caused, among other factors, by black smoke emanating from old vehicles.\nDoing away with unfit vehicles is thus a step in the right direction. However, as typical of any government initiative in Bangladesh, this too risks becoming a victim of poor planning and lax enforcement. Reportedly, although the government set the economic lifespan of commercial vehicles, a guideline on scrapping them has yet to be finalised. Additionally, the gazette on economic lifespan hasn't been published either. The authorities say they would start dumping old vehicles once the gazette is published. But BRTA officials still don't know where to dump those, or for how long those should be kept in their custody.\nThe authorities will also have to hire contractors to scrap the outdated vehicles. According to the draft Motor Vehicle Scrapping Guideline-2023, the government will be outsourcing the job to enlisted private firms that will carry out the task under BRTA supervision. Officials, however, said the draft guideline and the RHD circular contained some discrepancies regarding the way private vendors would be hired. This only adds to the concerns given the government's poor history in hiring contractors. Also, there's no clarity on who will eventually foot the bills.\nWhat all these inconsistencies and uncertainties show is that the decision, delayed as it is in a country long known for unsafe roads, has not been planned or coordinated properly. It can only mean further delays in execution, and further trouble when the scrapping begins. We urge the authorities to address these issues before getting started with the project, so that it doesn't get stuck halfway through or end up being a total waste of money and energy.\n",

        "full_article": "During the 12th Foreign Office Consultation (FOC) between Dhaka and Beijing, China reiterated its commitment to early repatriation of Rohingyas to the Rakhine state. While China's intervention and the \"pilot repatriation plan\" have shone a ray of hope on the six-year crisis, we must not forget that this is the third initiative taken at China's behest. The previous two yielded no results, due to Myanmar backtracking on its promises and failing to take accountability. A proper timeline is yet to be established in the pilot plan, which raises questions about Myanmar's sincerity on the matter. China has repeatedly championed the bilateral route in the international community, arguing against sanctions to discipline the Myanmar military. For repatriation to be a sustained process, it has to be agreed upon by all stakeholders in the international fora. Otherwise, it runs the risk of becoming a one-off repatriation, with China playing to the world gallery.\nTwo recent attempts of repatriation in May failed as no Rohingya volunteered to return to Myanmar, arguing that they lack guarantee of citizenship and security as their villages have been turned into displacement camps. Five refugees who went on the \"go-and-see visit\" on May 5, in coordination with Bangladesh and Myanmar's junta, expressed their fear of history repeating itself. About 600,000 Rohingyas in Rakhine state remain confined to squalid camps, according to the Human Rights Watch. Given the violence the Rohingyas have suffered in the Rakhine state, for which they fled to Bangladesh in the first place, safe and voluntary repatriation would only be possible if Myanmar's military government puts a stop to the systematic persecution of the community.\nThe US and others have warned that Myanmar is not yet conducive to the Rohingya's safety but has not prioritised the urgent need for repatriation from Bangladesh's end. The UN Security Council passed the first ever resolution last year to address \"military violence\" in Myanmar. However, as we have seen over the course of the current protracted crisis, international actors have failed to create the critical pressure on Myanmar needed to render repatriation a possibility. The financial burden to support Rohingyas in Bangladesh, while the nation battles with economic turmoil, has become a critical issue. For Bangladesh's sake, we back efforts for early repatriation, but for this plan to follow through, the international community must step foot on the pedal and come together to ensure that Myanmar creates a state that is conducive to the safe repatriation of the Rohingya.\n",

        "full_article": "Inflation has caused the worst headache for both the public and policymakers. It is both the cause and effect of macroeconomic mismanagement. In its budget-review discourse, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) has broadly identified why economy is not making a turnaround and inflation continues to hemorrhage it. At a time when global energy prices are on the decline, policymakers here are still sticking to profit-making by the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) in the name of subsidy adjustment. The CPD is categorical that subsidy adjustment cannot be based on a single instrument; rather there is need for an all-round reform. With such arcane policy instruments, macroeconomic stability, on the one hand, cannot be brought about and, on the other, socio-economic inequality reduced. In fact, the policymakers have made a wrong choice of its main instrument, energy that is, for compliance of IMF condition. The state corporation, as the CPD points out, has made a net profit of Tk 364.74 billion after paying tax in the seven years from the financial year 2016 to 2021. Only in the FY2022, did it incur a loss of Tk27.08 billion. But by this time the prices of both fuel oil and gas have globally come down significantly. The price of crude oil has come down to $77 from $90 a barrel. Notably, the government raised the prices of energy when those were at their highest in international market. Logic demands, the price should be reviewed downward and this can have beneficial impacts on almost every area of the economy. The BPC has made enough profit, now in the interest of spurring productivity and taming inflation, it can dispense with its monopolistic profit. If the margin of profit of Tk5.0 for a litre of diesel is foregone, it can trigger a positive domino effect for economic productivity which is key to augmenting export and arresting inflation. However, the government's excessive borrowing from banks, particularly the Bangladesh Bank is fuelling inflation by supplying money to the market. The result is disastrous for an economy as productivity falls and the majority people's purchasing power erodes. If the government's borrowed money helped create employment and wealth, it would have made sense. But that surely is not the case. Financing mega projects and sheer waste of money on such projects as captive power plants which now sit idle are contributing to the woes. There is no alternative to getting the priority right when it comes to government expenditure in time of financial crisis. However, behind inflation business syndicates out to make the most of the disruption of international supply channels on account of Ukraine war are the main actors. When a kilogram of ginger from Myanmar, the import cost of which ---inclusive of duty--- stands at Tk 58 but sold in market at Tk 280, the complicity, intrigue, avarice and ethical aberration cross all limits. The CPD has suggested foreign-funded budgetary support. Well, before this it is necessary to ensure that fund received from multilateral financial institutions will see proper use, particularly in the priority areas of production and employment. If the business sharks are left any leeway of making a mockery of the market, no other efforts can ensure rational distribution of wealth and containment of inflation.",

        "full_article": "The ongoing price hike of all types of essential products including kitchen goods has hurt all segments of society. They range from the rich, the middle class, lower middle class to the people belonging to the lower social strata. Ironically, it is the lower-middle class which appears to be the worst victims. In fact, there was no distinctive 'middle class' in the sub-continent in the post-WW II era. It began to emerge after the British colonial power had left the Indian sub-continent. Following the creation of India and Pakistan, the political and economic power in the large area went to the politicians and businesses in the two countries. The independent Bangladesh has inherited its economy from that of undivided Pakistan. Essentially an agrarian state with few signs of industries and their future development, Bangladesh had to wait for some time for the emergence of its own middle class. Its Pakistan-style middle class didn't see any radical change in their lot.However, it didn't take long for the emergence of the Bengalee urban middle class in Bangladesh with their distinctive features. In spite of their being influenced by the non-Bengalee industry owners in the undivided Pakistan, these 'higher middle class' people didn't have to take much time to eventually emerge as the first-generation industrialists in Bangladesh. In a typical socio-economic twist, these industrialists were able to carve out a place normally reserved for the super-rich class.The pure urban middle class followed the industrialists; whereas the lower-middle class proved to be the offshoot of the middle-income people. There is a general tendency to amalgamate the two under a common category --- Middle Class. The middle class people are educated, economically solvent in most cases and are status-conscious. In the present economic scenario, they are, visibly, the worst victims. They cringe at the idea of queuing up at the government-run OMS outlets alongside the lower-income people. The latter have long thrown away all pretensions of drawing social disapproval. The grim fact is a large percentage of the urban middle class has long begun falling socially and economically. Most of them being office employees and mid-rank businesses, their earnings are tolerably sufficient. But it became hard on their part to accept their plight during and after the corona pandemic. The fallout of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the inflationary pressure in particular, aggravated their overall economic status. Being unable to cope with the pressure of bad times, exacerbated by an uncontrollably heated market, lower-middle class families have been seen collecting furtively the OMS products. The subsidised goods chiefly comprise rice, edible oil, pulses, sugar etc. For the other kitchen items like canned food products, baby food and fruits, they are made to turn to traditional commercial outlets. In the process, the middle class, especially its lower segments, discovers themselves to be severely bruised. Being a special social class with a history of being part of the social evolution in the country, this segment should not have been made to bear with its present ordeal. Thanks to its being an educated social layer, aware of the pros and cons of contemporary realities, the middle class has always been seen coming out of adverse times --- unscathed by unpalatable realities. The post-World War-II realities followed a single course. It comprised the paying of a heavy cost for the allied force's 6-year involvement in the war. The war made the people of the colonial India look to a sub-continent free of the British rulers. The middle-class politicians had been spearheading this campaign for years. The victory of the Allied Power comprising Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union expedited the campaign for the freedom of India. Compared to this unambiguous reality, the recent pandemic times presented a complicated and fraught period before the middle class.Despite their normal skill of steering clear of adverse times, the middle class has this time discovered itself stuck in an unprecedented economic quagmire. Never before had it thought that it would have to pass through a prolonged two-nation war with global fallout in the 21st century. The middle classes in few developing countries could escape the inflationary pressure triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. Their counterparts in Bangladesh had never thought of going through the miseries of the punishing price hike of essentials this long. What's worse, despite their denial, the middle and lower-middle class people were eventually drawn into a socio-economic whirlpool. The general people, especially those in the urban areas, have long been feeling either bewildered or dazed. The relatively better placed people, in spite of their being in the fixed-income bracket, have tried to remain poker-faced. But they cannot maintain their stoic posture any more. With few signs of a radically positive change in the direction of the economy, the country's once privileged class continues to find itself in a state of disarray.Apparently unaffected, sections of the currently vulnerable Bangladesh middle class people have already started showing their newly developed weaknesses. Those cover almost all segments of life --- ranging from price hike of essentials including food items to the rising cost of living in general. The urban low-income people can make do with their adversity-plagued life, even for an indefinite period. The middle class can't. They suffer in silence.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Reports have it that in 24 hours till Sunday (May 28) morning, 67 dengue patients were hospitalised across the country. What is of concern here is that, of those dengue patients, the overwhelming number of the cases (58) were from the capital city, while the rest 9 were from all over the country. In this connection, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS)in its Sunday bulletin added that till that day some 209 dengue patients were undergoing treatment in different hospitals of the country and 180 of them were in the hospitals of Dhaka. So, it is again the capital city where the reported dengue patients are concentrated. A good number of reports, articles including leaders on the escalation in the number of dengue patients have meanwhile been carried by both the print and the electronic media. But considering that dengue took epidemic proportions last year (2022) when more than 62 thousand dengue patients were hospitalized in the country with the highest number of deaths (281) from the disease in the country's history, there is hardly any room for complacency. The media should play its role by hammering the awareness into the public's consciousness about the serious hazard that dengue and its vector, the Aedes mosquito, pose to public health. Evidently, the measures so far being adopted to kill the larvae and disinfect the breeding places of the mosquito are not enough.Obviously, with increasing temperature and humidity and the shifting seasonal patterns attributable to global warming, the breeding of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries the dengue virus, is no longer concentrated in a particular season, the rainy season to be exact. In fact, the mosquito can breed whenever there is rain or flooding leading to waterlogging. In that case, the preparedness against dengue infection should be all the year round. Even so, the frequency of dengue cases is observed mostly in the second half of the year.Alongside raising community awareness and measures to destroy the breeding grounds of the vector mosquito, the public should also have the basic knowledge about the disease.The symptoms of dengue have similarities with other ailments that cause fever, nausea, body aches, pain in the eye and a rash. In most cases, the symptoms persist for two to 7 days. But in five per cent cases, the dengue can be severe causing shock, internal bleeding and even death. Most vulnerable to this type of dengue are infants and pregnant women. People who have the previous history of getting the disease are at most risk of contracting the severe form of dengue. There are four types of dengue viruses known as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. These are called serotypes as they interact differently with the antibodies in the human blood serum. Each of these viruses can infect a person. Someone infected by DEN-1, for instance, may have long-term immunity against infection by the same serotype in the future. But that is no guarantee against other serotypes such as DEN-2, 3 or 4. If a person is sequentially infected by dengue, she or he runs the risk of contracting the severe form of the disease. So, early detection of the severe type of dengue and proper management can markedly reduce the chance of fatality.However, most dengue cases are of milder type and pose no threat to life. But if there are symptoms of nose bleeding, vomiting, sudden drop in blood pressure (shock), etc., then immediate hospitalization will be required.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Bangladesh's climatic conditions are becoming more favourable for transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases like malaria and chikungunya.That is exactly the reason why there should be all-the-year-round preparedness against dengue hazard.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
