        "full_article": "In 2020, a key question that the pandemic posed was whether nations would act in solidarity and prioritise equity for the larger good over narrow self-interest. The experience in 2021 was that rich countries overwhelmingly chose self-interest \u2014 with several deciding to first inoculate their populations multiple times over rather than ensure poorer nations have at least a first round. It was amid this turmoil that India and South Africa had proposed at the WTO that all patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and diagnostics be temporarily suspended to ensure smooth manufacture and distribution. While not surprising, given the history of wrangling over IP rights at the WTO, much of Europe and the U.S. were against any such reprieve, arguing that patent rights ensured better product quality and how many countries lacked the know-how and facilities; over 100 countries, including the U.S., support such a waiver now. The EU appears to be signalling truce, proposing that intellectual property rights held by international pharma companies on COVID-19 vaccines be relaxed for up to five years. This reprieve will however not apply to COVID-drugs and diagnostic devices. The waiver also allows pharma companies in developing countries to make and, further down, export vaccines without explicit permission from the patent holders, says a version of the negotiating text. While on the surface it signals equity, the proposal does not go far. Along with western European nations and the U.S., several Indian companies are now makers of COVID-19 vaccines that feed domestic needs and are available for export. They have achieved this through technology licensing arrangements with the U.S. and elsewhere. International facilities such as COVAX are now dealing with a problem of surplus vaccines and India too has begun expanding the drive to vaccinate younger populations. Therefore, vaccines, really, are not the challenge they were two years ago. A waiver of IP rights means little unless companies also share their \u2018trade secrets\u2019, and nothing in the current agreement hints at whether such sharing will be facilitated. Several countries, including India, already have \u2018compulsory licensing\u2019 arrangements wherein the government can revoke existing patents to enable drug manufacturing. Newer vaccine and drug manufacturing platforms have risen, bringing in their own complexities, and drug manufacturing companies have opted to enter into international collaborations rather than use forums such as the WTO to fight inequity. The Indian government must be more vocal about facilitating access to drugs and diagnostics and continue to champion the cause of developing countries. It must also strongly oppose moves to hinder the flow of ingredients necessary to manufacture them.",

        "full_article": "The UN Security Council\u2019s decision to authorise a new mandate for the organisation in Afghanistan is the most emphatic step taken by the world body in tackling the myriad problems the country has been facing ever since the Taliban takeover. According to the UNSC resolution, which was adopted by a vote of 14-0, with Russia abstaining, the UN mission in Afghanistan is authorised to promote gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls, human rights and an inclusive and representative government. There is no direct reference to the Taliban, but it urges the mission to work in \u201cclose consultation with all relevant political actors and stakeholders....\u201d The Taliban have called for international help but shown no signs of sharing power or respecting the basic rights of Afghans. In the 1990s, the Taliban had barred girls and women from education and work and taken a hostile approach towards ethnic and religious minorities. The Sunni fundamentalist group formed a men-only, Pashtun-dominated government that only reluctantly allowed girls to go to elementary schools; older girls are still denied education. And barring some sectors such as health care and education, Afghanistan\u2019s vast number of working women are not allowed to go to their workplaces.But the Taliban\u2019s fundamentalism and their lack of legitimacy should not prevent the international community from working to ameliorate the suffering of the Afghan people. The country is going through one of its worst humanitarian crises. Before the Taliban takeover, two-thirds of the Afghan government\u2019s expenditure came through donations. As no country has recognised the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, these donations have dried up since August. The U.S.\u2019s decision to freeze $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank has deepened the crisis. Even government employees have not been paid their salaries for months. Only 2% of Afghanistan\u2019s 38 million people have enough food, according to the World Food Programme. Its economy is expected to contract by 30% this year and nearly every Afghan citizen could be living in poverty by mid-2022, according to the UN. The international community is reluctant to step in over fears that the Taliban would use the aid to consolidate their power and resist further demands for reforms. But the international community cannot just look away when Afghans face mass starvation. With the fresh mandate, which got the support of almost all the major powers, the UN mission should start engaging the Taliban. This does not mean that the member countries should offer quick recognition to the Taliban regime. They should offer humanitarian assistance to the Afghans in consultations with the Mullahs, while at the same time putting pressure on them to accept at least short-term reforms and take measures to respect basic human rights.",

        "full_article": "On April 4, 1972, Bangladesh and the US formally initiated their diplomatic ties after the latter recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign nation. Since then, bilateral relations between the two countries have come a long way, and improved to a great extent. US ambassadors to Bangladesh have traditionally played a crucial role in giving this bonding a solid footing. The same role is now expected of Peter D. Haas, who has replaced Earl R. Miller as the new US ambassador to Bangladesh. \u00a0\nIn this article, we will underline several expectations from the ambassador regardless of the outcome of today's Partnership Dialogue in Dhaka, the first of a series of bilateral meetings set to determine the next course of relationship between Bangladesh and the US. It should be noted that in February, amid diplomatic and media uproar about the US sanctions on Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), Secretary of State Antony Blinken invited Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen to Washington to celebrate the golden jubilee of their diplomatic relations. As we await further developments in this regard, here are some expectations from a citizen's point of view, which the new US envoy will hopefully help bring to fruition to take our bilateral ties to a new height.\nFor the US, Bangladesh is one of its major partners in South Asia with extensive bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, climate change, counterterrorism, and so on. After Afghanistan and Pakistan, Bangladesh is the third-largest beneficiary of the US aid in the region. The two-way trade between the two countries reached USD 9 billion in 2019. The US is the single-largest export destination for our ready-made garments (RMG), accounting for 83 percent of Bangladesh's total exports. In 2019, the US was the top source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bangladesh. During the Covid-19 crisis, the US has contributed over USD 8 billion in assistance to Bangladesh, including USD 73 million in support of Bangladesh's Covid response. Also, Bangladesh has received about 61 million doses of vaccines, making it the highest recipient of US vaccine donations worldwide.\nThese figures are a testimony to the depth of bilateral bonding between the two countries. Although the recent sanction on Rab has surprised Bangladesh, their bilateral ties overall remain intact and functional as before. We expect that Ambassador Haas will take proactive steps to create a middle ground for both countries that will lead to a resolution of the sanction. Also, we hope that the ambassador, in concert with the rest of the free world, will push the effort to ensure the repatriation of stranded Rohingyas in Bangladesh back to their homeland.\u00a0\nSince the Burmese military-orchestrated genocide through a bloody \"clearance operation\" in 2017, Bangladesh has been generously hosting more than 1.2 million Rohingyas. These refugees have put huge socioeconomic pressure on an already overpopulated country of approximately 166 million. It is inconceivable that Bangladesh can continue hosting this huge number of refugees for long with its limited land and financial capability. The new US envoy can work to convince the Biden administration to find a sustainable and dignified solution that will work for both the host and Rohingya communities.\nAccording to the Centre for Policy Dialogue, around USD 7 billion would be required to host and support the Rohingyas in Bangladesh for the first five years without repatriation. Although the international community extended their support to Bangladesh, the humanitarian assistance fund for the Rohingyas has been drying up dramatically in recent years. It is impossible for a developing country like Bangladesh to bear this huge financial burden on its own. Here, Ambassador Haas can convince the US to play the role of a catalyst to ensure regular financial flow, especially on behalf of the Western world.\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh is scheduled to graduate from the Least Developed Country (LDC) group in 2026. This will limit Bangladesh's access to many LDC-specific preferential treatments and facilities, e.g. loss of duty-free and quota-free market access (DFQF), which will have a negative impact on our exports, especially of RMG, to European and North American markets. Ambassador Haas may help Bangladesh in convincing the US government to ensure continuation of DFQF, even after graduation, to confront its post-graduation challenges.\nWe are living in an interconnected world in which what happens to one country may very well impact another. It is especially true for countries like the US and China. In recent years, China has exhibited extensive strategic interest in Bangladesh and invested heavily in the country's physical infrastructure. As the US envisions playing a greater role in the Indo-Pacific region, Bangladesh's location in this could embolden the US to check China's strategic advances. Despite that, Washington continues to see Dhaka from the prism of New Delhi. In the US's South Asia policy calculation, Bangladesh rarely exists. It is expected that the new ambassador will fathom the profound geopolitical deconstruction that is underway in the region, and pursue Washington to recognise the strategic significance of Bangladesh.\nBangladesh also expects that the new ambassador will work to transform the existing bilateral relations into a strategic partnership in which Bangladesh will be considered on its own merit. Apart from economic benefits, a strategic partnership with Bangladesh can help the US to gain its strategic objectives in South Asia that go well beyond India. And the realisation of all of these aspirations will depend to a large extent on the cordial efforts of Peter D. Haas.\nHussain Shazzad is a foreign policy analyst.\n",

        "full_article": "As ritualistic as it may be, we must keep talking about the murder of Sohagi Jahan Tonu, even though there is nothing new to say\u2014or precisely because of that. We must talk about it because her murder is one in the long list of unsolved killings that have occurred over the last decade or so. It is this \"unsolved\" aspect that has become such a crucial part of our reality as we try our best to stay alive by seeing no evil, saying no evil and hearing no evil.\nIn six years, the story of Tonu's ghastly death has remained the same, eliciting the same conclusion. A 19-year-old studying history at Cumilla Victoria College, a theatre activist, interested in poetry and music, who tutored students to help out with her family's expenses suddenly gets her life cut short by unknown individuals who attack her inside the Cumilla cantonment, beat her up, rape her and kill her. Her father finds her lifeless body behind a bush and files a murder case. An autopsy is carried out that establishes nothing despite all the signs of severe injury. Protests break out all over the country, demanding the killers be brought to book. A second autopsy is conducted, which turns out inconclusive. Finally, a DNA analysis reveals that three men had raped Tonu before killing her. You would think that such compelling evidence would lead to the arrest of the individuals whose DNA matched the samples and their subsequent conviction. Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000 (under which this case would be applicable) murder after rape may award a death sentence to the accused. But this time, although the police have the DNA of the murderers, they continue to remain traceless. The police have said that they did not find any matches for the DNA samples. No individuals have been accused and, after six years of investigating, the police have come up with nothing.\nShocking, right? Not really. Alongside our outstanding successes in development and economic growth, we have also excelled in firmly establishing a culture of impunity of certain sections of society linked to power. It is not easy to say whether wealth comes before power or the other way around. It is a circular system that allows individuals to get away with any crime under the sun and make sure that uncomfortable questions are either not asked or are silenced.\nThe Taqi murder case and the Sagor-Runi killings exemplify this better than any others. Tanwir Muhammad Taqi was a 17-year-old A level student who went missing on March 6, 2013 on his way to the library from home. Two days later, his body was found in the Shitalakkhya River. A day earlier, his A level results revealed he had the highest score in Physics\u2014297 out of 300. There is always heart-breaking irony to these stories.\nBut unlike Tonu's case, where no one could be accused and no clear motive could be established, Taqi's father, Rafiur Rabbi, a well-known cultural activist in Narayanganj, was quite sure who his son's murderers were. He filed a case at the police station accusing seven men, including a prominent MP, by name and around 10 other unnamed persons. A year after, a draft of the investigation was leaked and it revealed that the investigating officers found evidence that the nephew of a powerful MP of the district and 10 of his associates were involved in the murder.\nAccording to the investigating report by Rab, Taqi had been targeted because of a personal vendetta against his father. Rafiur says that although the investigation was completed in a year, the Rab officials have not submitted the probe report to the court till date, and this March marked Taqi's eighth death anniversary.\nIn 2013, law enforcers arrested a few individuals in connection with the murder. Two of them confessed that the MP's nephew had indeed led the killing, only to retract their statements later. It does not take much deduction to guess why they backtracked and why they were set free on bail. Again, it is the fear of the powerful and mighty that comes in the way of justice for an innocent teenager. This fear is so great that even law enforcers who have found incriminating evidence cannot submit their charge sheet. To make sure that this fear is kept intact, local media have been gagged while others have been attacked by goons.\nThe culture of impunity can only thrive in the culture of fear. Which is why in the famous Sagor-Runi case the shroud of mystery weighs heavier than ever. Instead of justice being served, members of the victims' families have been harassed and intimidated in a bid to make them give up seeking justice. The investigating officer in the case has failed to submit the probe report in court 85 times. Mahir Sarowar Megh, the couple's only son who was just five-years-old and present in the apartment when his parents were so brutally slaughtered, is now 15 and continues to wait for some kind of closure for the indescribable loss and trauma he has endured. The same goes for Taqi's inconsolable mother and his father, who has led countless demonstrations to demand justice.\nThen there is Tonu's father whose health has severely deteriorated after her death, her distraught mother, her other loved ones\u2014when will they have closure?\nAs a nation born out of democratic values, can we not ask how long justice for these innocent souls will continue to be gobbled up by those connected to power?\n\u00a0\nAasha Mehreen Amin\u00a0is senior deputy editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "In response to the country's expanding needs, a modern, environmentally-friendly seaport is being created in South Bengal. Payra Port's operations began on November 19, 2013, with the prime minister unveiling the foundation stone. When the infrastructural work was confirmed, the seaport officially began its journey on August 13, 2016.\nThe construction of a container terminal, bulk terminal, multipurpose terminal, passenger terminal, water treatment facility, power plant, modern city, airport, and economic zone are among the 19 component works currently ongoing. All of these development efforts are underway, with the goal of transforming Payra into a world-class modern port by 2023 and a thriving economic hub by 2035.\nSince its inception, the port has been conducting certain operational enterprises, including a restricted range of import-export activities. A revenue of Tk 354 crore has been generated from the operation of 169 foreign merchant ships. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed with Jan de Null, a Belgian dredging business, for capital and maintenance dredging on the port's main channel.\nThis is the country's first project agreement involving the Bangladesh Infrastructure Development Fund. In terms of nature and geography, a wide shipping-friendly area within five kilometres of the Rabnabad Channel's port in Kalapara upazila of Patuakhali is a viable area for the seaport. Furthermore, there is a large amount of undeveloped area available for port development and extension.\nThe Payra Seaport Project will be generating a variety of jobs in the EPZ, SEZ, ship-building and repair industries. The establishment of new industrial zones would provide employment to people in neighbouring districts such as Barishal, Patuakhali and Bhola, which are next to the port.\nThere are over a hundred ship-building factories in Bangladesh and the industry itself is fast-paced. Bangladesh's market share in the global ship-building sector, on the other hand, is around USD 400 billion. If this sector develops around the Payra Port, we believe Bangladesh will soon be the world's second-largest exporter.\nBecause transportation and supply of commodities is easier and cheaper than by road, this port will be able to make a substantial contribution to the supply of cement clinker and food grains in Khulna and Madaripur through Barishal.\nThrough cooperative partnerships between Bangladesh, Myanmar, India, and China, an economic corridor is being created in the interest of South Asia's general economic development. Because it is a port developed near the sea, other countries will be interested in using the transit services. Payra Port has the potential to become one of the most important ports as a Silk Road transit hub, due to its geographic location.\nBy connecting the Padma Bridge, the government plans to build a four-lane road from Barishal to Kuakata beach via Patuakhali. As a result, the country's internal communication will be enhanced through the Payra Port. It will thereafter be connected by rail to Dhaka and other areas. Currently, there are two shipping routes from Payra Port to other areas of the country.\nFor the purpose of establishing air communication, an airport will be built under the supervision of the Ministry of Aviation and Tourism. As a result, the Payra Port will become a hub for economic development of all kinds.\nOne of the project's goals is to keep the water level at 6.3 metres. By removing roughly 9.75 million cubic metres of silt from the 75-kilometre-long channel and 100-125 metres from the Rabnabad (inner and outer) channel, the channel will be kept at a depth of 7.3 metres. The channel's depth will be extended to 10.5 metres once the capital and maintenance dredging is completed. This will facilitate the transit of large ships and assist the port in establishing economic corridors in the country's south-western region. The port will be able to accept large commercial boats with a capacity of 3,000 TEU or 40,000 BWT of cargo once the dredging is completed in 2023.\nThe country's foreign trade will develop and new economic horizons will open up if the port is properly realised through these operations. New industries will be established in the area surrounding the port, infrastructure will be created, and trade and commerce will flourish. This will create a large number of jobs for the underprivileged in the country's south, and the port's activities will benefit the rest of the country, too.\nIt is expected that the development of this port will substantially stimulate the economy, resulting in a 2 percent GDP increase. As a result, the country will make progress towards constructing the \"golden Bengal\" of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's dreams, and this port will play a key part in achieving a wealthy and prosperous Bangladesh free of hunger and poverty by 2041.\n\u00a0\nKhalid Mahmud Chowdhury\u00a0is the state minister of shipping for Bangladesh.\n\u00a0\n",

In grateful remembrance of his contribution to\u00a0steering the nation from autocracy to democracy during the turbulent days of 1990-1991, The Daily Star is reprinting an editorial written in his honour on October 11, 1991, after he resigned from the presidency on October 9, 1991, handing over power to the newly-formed government.\nIt was perhaps his finest hour. As Justice Shahabuddin bade farewell to the country's highest office, he had the rare satisfaction of any Chief Executive to be carrying along with him the grateful appreciation of the nation for a job well done. He took charge of the State's affairs when the edifice of power lay in ruins. Today he leaves behind a sovereign parliament, a popularly elected leadership, a unanimously adopted form of government and, most importantly, a Constitution that has been shorn of its undemocratic features. Any one of the above could suffice to be a lifetime's achievement for a statesman or a politician.\nThe 306 days Presidency of Justice Shahabuddin was low on profile and high on performance. Ribbon cutting here and pontificating there were neither his style nor a part of his agenda. His single-minded attention to the task for which he was called upon to assume the office of the President was all that he cared for and all that he did. We must remember that he was not an actor in any of the events that propelled him on to the centre-stage. However, he was a superb manager of the consequences of those events\u2014starting from organising and running the interim government, to steering the nation's transition to a democratic system, to the final step of electing his own replacement.\nIn a remarkable display of courage, leadership, clarity of vision, impartiality, unwavering faith in democratic norms and unfaltering commitment to national interest, the former Acting President gave us, what was till then an impossible dream\u2014a free, fair and peaceful election. Through the skilful management of that one single event, he: a) restored our faith in elections, which through repeated riggings and shameless manipulations was reduced to nothing; b) made the parliament what it was meant to be, the supreme representative body and the highest legislature, and not a gathering place for goons and lackeys; c) gave dignity and honour to the representatives of the people; d) sent sky high the prestige of our system of government, a prestige which is of immense importance for a country in desperate search for positive image. On a more practical plane, Justice Shahabuddin showed us that however archaic and corruption-ridden our administrative system is, it still can be made to deliver if the leadership is honest and determined. It was the same administration, the same police and the same official bodies that Ershad used to cheat the people of their votes which the venerable Judge used to do the exact opposite.\nThis journal pays tribute to Justice Shahabuddin\u2014and in so doing echoes the sentiment of the nation\u2014for his contribution in strengthening the foundation of democracy in the country. It was his expert and meticulous handling of volatile political issues, timely initiatives and courageous moves that have helped us in attaining in nine months what we had mostly lost, and in some cases, ourselves destroyed in the last 16 years.\nWe have had leaders of many kinds; charismatic, visionary, intellectual and, of course, corrupt. But never one as unassuming, low-key, committed and so thoroughly devoid of any inclination to cling to power. Justice Shahabuddin, through his single-minded dedication to serve the nation has given us a new confidence and pride. As he left office of the President, he stood tall. And for his accomplishments, the nation stood taller.\n",

As a result, Dhaka's traffic has returned to its nightmarish worst. What is most shocking in this regard is how completely unprepared the authorities were for the reopening of educational institutions, and how apathetic they remain to the most distressing issue concerning the capital city's residents.\nDhaka's horrendous traffic is nothing new. Given that it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and lacks the road space required for the current volume of traffic to move smoothly, traffic congestion has remained a perennial problem for the city residents. On top of that, a large percentage of the roads that we do have are either always undergoing repair work or are in desperate need of repair because they were poorly constructed in the first place. Then there is the fact that Dhaka has one of the worst public transport systems in the world.\nHowever, given the day-to-day suffering this causes people, as well as the economic and social costs, why is it that we have just given up and learnt to live with it? Why haven't the authorities come up with a comprehensive and effective plan to improve Dhaka's traffic? How long will we remain satisfied with their empty promises?\nThe two years of empty streets that the pandemic forced upon us provided the perfect opportunity to the authorities to improve our roads. Yet, we barely saw them being bothered to do so. Is it because most of our government high-ups\u2014the VIPS\u2014can shut down entire roads and travel quickly without facing such congestion\u2014while causing inconvenience to others\u2014that they have remained so apathetic to this problem that ordinary people are forced to endure day in, day out?\u00a0\nThere are, of course, other factors that exasperate our traffic problems, such as people ignoring traffic rules (which are barely enforced), traffic police looking the other way for rule violations (in exchange for bribes), etc. But many of them also have administrative roots. All these problems could be solved if the authorities were sincere in their pursuit to address them.\nWith Dhaka becoming more and more \"unliveable\" by the minute, there is no excuse for the failure of the authorities to address the city's traffic problems\u2014and even less so, for their apathy towards how badly it is affecting the quality of people's lives.\n",

What sounds further inconceivable is that there was electricity in the administrative and academic buildings of the university, but the following halls had to run without this essential service from March 16 till March 19: Nawab Faizunnesa Chowdhurani, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Shaheed Dhirendranath halls. Reportedly, students formed a human chain in front of the Vice Chancellor's residence recently demanding immediate restoration of this essential utility connection\u2014until electricity was temporarily restored after three days.\u00a0\nAs a result of the blackout, there was no water in the washrooms, and the students had to go without a bath in this humid weather. And, most importantly, they could not study at night in the darkness, due to which they could not prepare for exams and submit their assignments. Who will take the responsibility for what the students had to endure?\u00a0\nWith coronavirus cases going down in recent months, the government has taken the decision to allow all educational institutions to open and resume academic sessions. As a result, university students now look forward to uninterrupted academic sessions after the loss of over two years because of Covid-19 pandemic. They are gearing up to complete the courses within the stipulated time so that the loss of two years can be compensated by obtaining the graduation certificate and entering the job market. At such a critical time, keeping the students of four halls of Cumilla University without electricity for days is even more unacceptable.\u00a0\nThe ineptness of the university authorities becomes frustratingly tangible when students tell us that the engineering department of the university could not find out for three days the cause of the power outage. And during this time, we saw another classic case of passing the buck, instead of the authorities taking responsibility and acting promptly to restore the electricity.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Our simple questions are: why did it take the authorities three days to restore power temporarily by pulling an alternative line from somewhere else? Why couldn't this have been done earlier? Aren't students the lifeblood of a university? In any case, we are pleased that power has temporarily been restored at the dormitories. However, it needs to be investigated why it took the authorities so long to act, despite the sufferings of the students.\n",
