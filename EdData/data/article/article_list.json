The decision comes at a critical juncture with a study in The Lancet published this month showing that India accounts for the highest number of cervical cancer cases in Asia, followed by China. More than 58% of all cases of cervical cancer and deaths globally were estimated in Asia with India accounting for 21% of cases and 23% of deaths, followed by China (18% and 17%). Cervical cancer is a preventable and treatable cancer. It is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) and there are vaccines which protect against carcinogenic HPV. With more than 6,00,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide in 2020, the World Health Organization laid down several guidelines that countries need to follow to eliminate it as a public health problem. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the WHO has specified that countries must reach and maintain an incidence rate of fewer than 4 new cases of cervical cancer per 1,00,000 women a year. To achieve that goal, it is necessary that 90% of girls will have to be fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15.To that end, the government\u2019s intent to introduce the HPV vaccine in the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) is a welcome move. India\u2019s immunisation network, as was evident during COVID-19, has worked well, and diseases such as polio and maternal and neonatal tetanus have been eliminated. The UIP is one of the largest public health programmes targeting over 2 crore newborns and 2 crore pregnant women annually, and offers free vaccines for at least 12 diseases. To battle cervical cancer, India is expected to roll out the indigenously developed Cervavac vaccine by mid-2023. It has received the Drugs Controller General of India\u2019s approval and has been cleared by the National Technical Advisory Group for Immunisation for use in the UIP programme. The vaccination will be provided primarily through schools, but importantly the government has clarified that girls who do not go to school will be reached through community outreach and mobile teams. This is a vital step because studies show that there is a link between cervical cancer incidence and human development index values, with progressively lower rates observed as HDI rises. Together with vaccination, screening programmes must be conducted to detect early signs of the disease to allow time for treatment.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncancer\n\n/\n\nvaccines",

The latest crisis broke out after the December 14 general election produced a hung assembly with the ruling Fiji First party of Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama winning 26 seats in the 55-member Parliament, three short of majority. The People\u2019s Alliance of former Prime Minister and current opposition leader Sitiveni Rabuka came second with 21 seats. Mr. Bainimarama, who came to power through a coup in 2006 and later refashioned himself as a democratic leader under a new Constitution that was introduced in 2013, has faced criticism of suppressing dissent and cracking down on the opposition. The election was marred by allegations of fraud. But after the results were announced, three opposition parties came together to unseat Mr. Bainimarama and form a coalition government. The People\u2019s Alliance and its coalition partner, the National Federation Party (which won five seats), have 26 MPs\u2019 support. This left the third opposition bloc, the Social Democratic Liberal Party which won three seats, in a kingmaker\u2019s role. The party decided on Tuesday in a close internal vote to support Mr. Rabuka, tilting the balance in favour of the People\u2019s Alliance.Mr. Rabuka, who first came to power through a coup in 1987 and then faced elections, is an experienced politician who built the opposition unity based on their common enmity towards Mr. Bainimarama\u2019s rule. Mr. Bainimarama has emerged on the world stage as a major advocate of actions against climate change. His government also saw Fiji deepening its relationship with China, whose footprint in the South Pacific is rapidly expanding. The Fiji First still remains a strong party, but the opposition deal sealed its fate. The Prime Minister has not conceded yet. After the opposition announced the coalition agreement, the government called in the military. Authorities say there were incidents of ethnic violence (between indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians). Fiji has a history of ethnic clashes, but the opposition say there is no law-and-order problem and that Mr. Bainimarama is trying to cling on to power. Any attempt to sabotage the election results will destabilise the country internally, disrupt its ethnic balance and complicate its foreign policy agenda. Mr. Bainimarama should accept the results, respectfully leave the office and set a strong precedent of peaceful transition of power for the country\u2019s political class.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFiji",

Incovacc has the potential to give a push to the flagging precaution dose programme because it doesn\u2019t require intramuscular injection and has therefore a better chance of piercing through the vaccine hesitancy that kept building up as the Covid threat receded. But BB has to accelerate its production capabilities and arrive at a rational pricing.\nIndia\u2019s vaccination programme has largely been a success. Which is partly why the Omicron surge in January this year didn\u2019t wreak much damage. But vaccination momentum was lost subsequently. Nearly 6 crore adults missed their second dose. Around 1.2 crore 15-17-year-olds and 3 crore 12-14-year-olds are unvaccinated, and 7 crore senior citizens haven\u2019t yet got booster doses. There\u2019s no clarity on how long hybrid immunity from vaccination and natural infection lasts. Because of this, governments must focus on those who haven\u2019t completed their full course of vaccination. GoI must also prepare for a situation where there\u2019s a sudden rush to get vaccinated.\nSupply chains have become rusty during the long period of low vaccine offtake. On CoWin, there are very few hospitals administering precaution doses. The other heterologous booster, Corbevax, is hardly available on CoWin. Private hospitals could have shifted away from CoWin to walk-in vaccination mode. SII\u2019s application for authorising its Covovax as a heterologous booster is pending. India\u2019s mRNA vaccine Gemocavac has languished after emergency use authorisation in June. The mRNA technology must be encouraged, owing to the promise it holds out for cancer treatments. Centre must again start publicising unused doses lying with states for clarity on vaccine availability. Governments must do more to encourage vaccination and bolster vaccine supply.\n\n",

Even now, it can still take long struggles for a woman student pursuing higher studies to persuade her family to permit her to travel a distance or join a hostel. The university too can continue policing her in loco parentis, giving her curfews that jar in contrast to the freedoms enjoyed by male students. The absurd justification offered by a Kozhikode government medical college when some women students challenged their 9.30pm curfew in court, underlines how obdurate double standards continue to hinder women from realising their full potential, even at the very institutions that have the responsibility of creating equal opportunities for them.\nThe college authorities said that \u201cabsolute freedom on attaining the age of 18 may not be appropriate and good for the society\u201d as \u201cmaturation of prefrontal cortex is fully accomplished at the age of 25 years\u201d. By this very un-medical logic even as women get their MBBS and MD degrees and start saving the lives of others, all without equal access to libraries or laboratories, their own will remain bitterly restricted. This is painfully close to Victorian notions of \u2018hysterical women\u2019 and blaming women themselves for crimes against them. Universities should be investing in ensuring a safer environment instead. Your mandate is to empower women students, not infantilise and undermine them.\n\n",

        "full_article": "I was an anxious young boy of 13 when I first faced the River Padma. It was in April of the momentous year of 1971 when a murderous campaign turned asunder the land.\nKnown as East Pakistan for an interim period, the land historically was Vangala, Bangala, Banga. Like many others that treacherous month, my father fled Dhaka city taking us to the banks of the Padma so that we may cross to the other side for safety. It was perhaps like crossing the river Styx in Greek mythology, but in a reverse order: from the world of death to a safer life.\nThe river appeared incomprehensible and infinite, generating a primal terror in me.\nHere was a river that was larger than life, larger than anything I had encountered before. Flowing gloriously and indifferently, the river presented a mythic scale against which I felt terribly puny. And terrified. That sense of terror on facing something sublime was magnified by the other terror, something more insidious and menacing, the onslaught of the Pakistan army that forced my family to arrive at the banks of the river, to seek a safe haven on the other side.\nBetween the two sides flowed the waters of the mighty river that has received many names and appellations. Ganges. Ganga. Padmavati. Padma. Padda. Boro Ganga. Kirtinasha. Mahasindhu. Oceanic. Beautiful. Treacherous. Nagini. Tempestuous. Unfathomable. Shorbonasha.\nPoets and song writers have lyricised its waves, and writers and navigators have tried to plumb its oscillating depth.\nFrom where we stood on the banks that April in 1971, the other side was a tantalising line on the horizon. Another tantalising line now crosses over the river \u2013 a 6.15 km long human installation by the name of Padma Bridge. An incredible engineering operation, surpassing political, economic, and obstructionist challenges, the bridge presents the audacity of a new Bangladesh.\nOn a sunny day in October this year, I crossed the bridge with a group of friends. Gliding over the new construction that snakes over the river, I imagined two streams of flow \u2013 the aquatic and the bridge traffic \u2013 that crisscross without touching each other. A bridge and a river form a mystifying bond that the German philosopher Martin Heidegger saw as the junction of the fourfold, in which \"earth, sky, mortals and divinities\" come together to reveal a special place for human dwelling.\nCrossing the Padma is close to a transcendental experience that invokes the intersection of geological time with human history. In the millions of ferrying of boats, barges, and\u00a0bajras, perhaps the Charyapada poet Bhusukapada's crossing of the Padma is the most significant. In one of his poems, Bhusukapada describes his crossing as akin to becoming a \"Bangalee.\" The Charyapadas were written between the 8th and 12th centuries as part of Buddhist esoteric practices, but they also reveal the social life of eastern Bengal. In the song-poem, Bhusukupada arrives from the other side of the Padma in a\u00a0bajra, and while ravaging the land, becomes a Bangalee instead. This he does, he admits, by crossing the Padma and marrying a \"chandal,\" a local woman. A momentous story of crossing and becoming.\nThere are other memorable accounts of crossing the river. In the 11th century, the Pala king Rampal would cross the Padma from western Bengal with his mighty navy fleet to fight the Kaibartas, the fishermen community, who had overthrown the Palas and taken over the land of Varendra in arguably the first peasant revolt in India. The Kaibartas were eventually defeated. In the 16th century, the Mughal minister Abul Faz'l came down the river from northern India, and crossed over to the quieter Ichhamoti river to travel to Dhaka. He is the one to speculate that the name Banga-al is derived from the \"al,\" the small dykes made by farmers in this land. If this is a fact then the name of the land is forever attached to an agricultural ethos.\nJames Rennell, the famed British cartographer who made the first comprehensive topographical map of Bengal, sailed from Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1764, again on a\u00a0bajra, to find a navigational path to Dhaka. The colonial intention was of course directed by an exploitative need to know and plot every square inch of the land even if it was all liquid terrain. Rennell first travels south through various rivers and channels, almost to the Sundarbans, and finally moves up to reach the Padma. He calls the river \"Boro Ganga.\" He records the flow and the banks to create the first accurate cartographic representation of the mighty river. His map of the Kushtia-Pabna reach of the river describes the first geographic attempt to understand the char dynamic. He also crosses the Padma from the south to enter the quieter river Ichhamoti in order to reach Dhaka.\nSailing on the same waters, the poet Rabindranath Tagore would apply a different lens to gauge the river. Going back and forth between two zamindari estates on two sides of the Padma, the poet would traverse the rivers and canals and pen his finest thoughts on nature and landscape in many songs and letters.\nSome one hundred years later after Rennell, the British introduced a new technology that changed the landscape forever \u2013 the railway. Swinging like serpentine tentacles across the land, the railway line was the progenitor of bridges across the river. To link Assam and northern Bengal with Calcutta, the colonial administration created a railway network that was served by ferries for river crossings. Historian Tariq Ali describes the endeavour as part of the \"colonial conquest of Bengal.\" The Eastern Bengal Railway connected Calcutta and Dhaka through a combination of rail and river link; trains from Calcutta reached Goalundo from where passengers would take the famous steamer service to reach Dhaka. Completed in 1915, and completing the colonial rail project, the Hardinge Bridge was the first bridge crossing over the Padma.\nCrossing the Padma is an invitation to an immersion in the geographical and political history of the land. We come to know a few things: that the Padma is the Ganges, and Padma is not. When the Ganges bifurcates at a point a few miles west of the political boundary of Bangladesh, it creates two streams of distinctive ecological as well as cultural regimes \u2013 the Hooghly-Bhagirothy that claims the name and aura of the Ganga, and the Padma that inherits the bulk of the Gangetic flow (Amartya Sen, in his memoirs, describes the rivers as two charismas). In carrying the waters of the Ganges, the Padma becomes the last leg of the mighty and mythologically-charged Ganges. In the Padma, the Ganges is reincarnated into a \"new grandeur,\" and that is perhaps why the name evokes the lotus flower.\nUnlike other rivers in the land, the Padma draws us to the ancient reservoir of our existence, for it is the very theatre of the creation of land and life. The Ganges in becoming the Padma, and joined by the Jamuna, unleashes a dynamic that also creates the largest delta in the world. Certainly, the river not only defined Bengal, its life and landscape, it literally gifted the land that we call Bengal and now Bangladesh. For the Padma is not simply a flow of water, it is a monumental cascade of silt and sediment. Each year the Ganges-Padma brings 400 cubic billion tons of silt to the delta. An English geographer estimated that it is equivalent to 350 pyramids the size of Giza. Writers have described this great churning that sustains lives in both Bengals as the Padma Process or the Padma Dynamic.\nGeographers now describe how the Gangetic-Padmatic flow does not simply end at the coastal rim, at what is better known as the Meghna estuary. The slow flow of the sediment continues under water in the Bay of Bengal, and almost to the Equatorial Line in the Indian Ocean, creating an underwater liquid land \u2013 known as the \"subaqueous delta\" \u2013 that is bigger than the size of the two Bengals combined. Known as the Bengal Fan to geographers, it is an alluvial theatre of cosmic proportions.\nSome 60 years later, coinciding with 50 years of the nationhood of Bangladesh, I am faced with the Padma again. This time, the anxiousness has turned into anticipation \u2013 the release of an enchanting book,\u00a0The Great Padma: The Epic River that Made the Bengal Delta\u00a0(ORO Editions, 2023). The work of writers, historians, geographers, anthropologists, architects, and photographers were assembled to reveal the ecological and human horizon of the glorious river that touched: The hilsa. The Goalundo Chicken Curry. The steamer. Bhatiali. Kuber the Padda Nodir Majhi. The Padma Bridge. Receiving the printed book in my hand, I felt I was on the banks of the river, as I was that first time, with the same sense of awe and wonderment.\nKazi Khaleed Ashraf\u00a0is an architect and architectural historian, and editor of the forthcoming book \"The Great Padma: The Epic River that Made the Bengal Delta.\"\n\n",

        "full_article": "After 51 years of independence, one could say the success story of Bangladesh's economic development has been spectacular. Over these years, the size of our economy has expanded manyfold; from a GDP of around USD 8.7 billion in 1971, we have grown to become a USD-416.3-billion economy now, along with achievements in a wide range of socioeconomic indicators.\nUpon independence, we inherited a war-torn agrarian economy with poor infrastructure and an array of challenges in human development. The country's journey has, however, been quite impressive as it has reached a per capita GDP of USD 2,734 and a steady growth rate of more than six percent per annum at least for a decade before Covid struck.\nThe country has also undergone a structural transformation in terms of its GDP components: the agriculture sector's contribution has reduced to only 13 percent, with a gradual increase in the shares of the industry (35 percent) and service (52 percent) sectors. Over time, Bangladesh has also been able to reduce its head-count poverty rate to 24.3 percent in 2016-17 from as high as 50.1 percent even in the mid-90s.\nThough it is difficult to single out the key drivers of our economic performance, there are certain factors that have especially helped to shape up the economy and contributed towards its development.\nIn this context, the contribution of agriculture to the economy should be acknowledged with due importance. During the 70s and particularly the 80s, innovations of different crop varieties by our scientists and the successful implementation of such innovations made the country self-sufficient in food. Making sustainable progress in food production while coping with the challenges of regular flooding has certainly helped to combat hunger, poverty and malnutrition. Another key contributor to the stable and consistently high economic growth is related to the export sector, particularly the ready-made garment (RMG) sector.\nToday, Bangladesh is the second largest exporter of RMG products in the world; RMG has acted as a prime factor in generating manufacturing sector employment, especially for women.\nThe development narrative of Bangladesh would be incomplete if we did not take into account the contribution of the overseas migrant workers. On the one hand, from a macro point of view, foreign remittances have served as a key source of foreign currency, while on the other hand, remittances sent by the migrants have contributed to the economic well-being of the rural households.\nOur rural economy has also been shaped by the expansion of small and medium enterprises, which particularly in recent years has contributed significantly towards generating small-scale self-employment.\nBangladesh's economic journey has also been accelerated by the expansion of small-scale lending programmes, which have helped the rural households to gain access to the formal credit market, and thereby to engage in income-generating activities.\nThere are significant achievements in other areas of human development, too, such as education and healthcare. For example, the countrywide immunisation programme of children against a number of deadly diseases, which gained momentum particularly in the 80s, has arguably averted millions of child deaths and can be considered as a cornerstone of human development in the country. Several other noteworthy achievements in the social sector, which have significantly contributed to development efforts, are the low-cost treatments in combating diseases like diarrhoea and the expansion of the nationwide family planning programme.\nThere have also been impressive successes in ensuring education for girl children, enhanced especially by the secondary school stipend programme, which is said to have increased school attendance of girl students, delayed child marriage, and helped reduce fertility rate.\nIn addition to social development, there have been certain impressive infrastructural achievements, too, like the Jamuna Bridge, Padma Bridge, etc, which have contributed to the growth momentum of Bangladesh. These massive infrastructures have helped to redistribute the benefits of economic development to regions that are lagging behind, and contributed to bridging the east-west and north-south economic divides in the country.\nThere is no denying that there have been several drivers that have helped our economy to achieve a consistently high growth with impressive progress in poverty reduction as well as in a number of key indicators of health and education.\nDespite such achievements, there remains questions regarding the quality of growth, with as high as 24.3 percent of population being unable to meet the basic necessities and as high as 27.8 percent of income being owned by the richest five percent of the country (according to the HIES 2016). Besides, there is an argument that the pace of employment generation has fallen behind the pace of economic growth, with the falling employment-elasticity of growth over the years. The impressive growth performance over the years is therefore argued to be overshadowed to some extent by the challenges in poverty reduction, employment generation, and inequality reduction.\nThe recent challenges of high inflation along with the depletion of foreign exchange reserves contested the hypothesis of stable macroeconomic performance of the country. Challenges also remain in the context of a number of institutional aspects, e.g. high non-performing loans (NPLs) and irregularities in the financial sector, inefficient public expenditure, and, more importantly, the low capacity of revenue generation to cover development expenses.\nDespite such challenges, Bangladesh's achievements over the years are definitely quite commendable, but in order to attain the future targets of high-income status and to attain the SDGs, much greater efforts are needed towards inclusive growth.\n\u00a0\nDr Sayema Haque Bidisha\u00a0is professor at the Department of Economics in Dhaka University, and research director at the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem).\n\n",

        "full_article": "There is a misperception, although not common and not quite voiced, that there is no law for the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Those who think so may wonder how, then, the judges are appointed in the highest court established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and how they take the oath to protect and preserve the constitution and the law of the land without fear, favour, or hatred.\nWe have only one way to find the answer to this question: looking into the constitution.\nArticle 95 of our constitution lays down the provisions for the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court. It occurs in Chapter One under Part VI, The Judiciary. Article 95 reads:\n(1) The Chief Justice shall be appointed by the President, and the other Judges shall be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice;\n(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge unless he is a citizen of Bangladesh, and \u2013\n(a) has, for not less than ten years, been an advocate of the Supreme Court; or\n(b) has, for not less than ten years, held judicial office in the territory of Bangladesh; or\n(c) has such qualifications as may be prescribed by law for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court.\n(Sub-Article 3 is not relevant.)\nIn order to appoint any citizen only from the third category, a piece of law prescribing their qualification has to be made (which may be as an \"act\" of parliament or an \"ordinance\" promulgated by the president, subject to the conditions laid down in Article 93 of the constitution).\nFor the other two categories, the law has been laid down in Clauses (a) and (b) of Article 95 (2). Here, it is the constitutional law, as opposed to the statutory law, that will apply. No further law by way of an act or an ordinance is required for these two categories.\nTo make this picture clearer, we may read Article 118 (1) alongside Article 95 (2) and then compare the provisions of these two articles.\nAccording to Article 118 (1) says, \"There shall be an Election Commission for Bangladesh consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and not more than four Election Commissioners, and the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (if any) shall, subject to the provision of any law made in that behalf, be made by the President.\"\nThus, an act of parliament is required to be made for the appointment of judges only as per Clause (c) of Article 95 (2), as it is required to be made for appointment of the election commissioners, as per Article 118 (1). Accordingly, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Other Election Commissioners' Appointment Act, 2022 was made by the parliament on January 29, 2022, for the appointment of election commissioners, as required by Article 118 (1) of the constitution. But no such law has yet been made as required by Clause (c) of Article 95 (2).\nHowever, for the appointment of any judge in the Supreme Court, other than the chief justice of Bangladesh, consultation with the chief justice is mandatory even if a citizen is otherwise found to be qualified under Article 95 (2).\nIt may also be mentioned that, as per Article 95 (1), the chief justice shall be appointed by the president. Then again, Article 48 (3) stipulates, \"In exercise of all his functions, save only that of appointing the Prime Minister pursuant to clause (3) of article 56 and the Chief Justice pursuant to clause (1) of article 95, the President shall act in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.\"\nIt may not be out of place to mention here that the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority to interpret the constitution and the law of the country.\nTherefore, to ensure proper and uniform understanding, constitutional issues should be raised before and be decided by the Supreme Court, which is the proper forum to address and decide such issues anyway.\n\u00a0\nJustice Md Rezaul Hasan\u00a0is a sitting judge at the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\n",

        "full_article": "While sexual harassment is a regular phenomenon for the increasing number of working women in Bangladesh, it appears workplace harassment and abuse are still not taken seriously by those in charge. The 2009 High Court directive in this regard \u2013 to form sexual harassment complaint committees in all workplaces and educational institutions \u2013 also remains largely unimplemented. Against this backdrop, it is only natural that working women do not feel confident or emboldened enough to report abuse that they face in their workplaces. Even if a woman wants to file a complaint, she cannot do so in the absence of a proper mechanism in her organisation.\nA new study by the non-profit Karmojibi Nari has found that 83 percent of female workers do not lodge any complaint on sexual harassment they face at their factories in the Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ). Female workers also often do not report on payment delays or issues relating to maternity leave, fearing that they may lose their jobs if they seek remedy. According to the study, around 90 percent of the women workers are unaware of the existence of any safety committees, anti-harassment committees or workers welfare associations in DEPZ. Many also believe that such bodies might be working on behalf of the factory owners.\nBesides this study, there have been other surveys and studies in the recent past that also revealed a similar picture. For instance, a 2018 study on female garment workers found that 67 percent of the victims of abuse in factories did not seek any assistance from the complaint committees because they didn't have faith in them. The latest findings by Karmojibi Nari expose the DEPZ authorities' failure to address the grievances of female workers, as well as their own inability to create awareness among workers in general on these issues. From the situation in DEPZ, we can easily guess the condition of female workers in other EPZs of the country.\nThe question is: how can we ensure safe workplaces for our female workers inside factories? First, the authorities of the export processing zones must acknowledge incidences of harassment inside factories \u2013 such crimes should never be put under the carpet in any circumstances. Then comes the question of responsibility for providing remedy to the victims, which can only be done if there are effective complaint committees. The onus is definitely on the EPZ authorities to form these committees, make female workers aware of their existence, and assure them that their grievances would be addressed without them having to worry about their jobs.\nEqually importantly, the same labour laws should be applied to all workers of the country. Having a separate law for the EPZs \u2013 which does not allow forming trade unions \u2013 is only denying workers, particularly women, their right to raise voices about the harassment and abuse they face on a regular basis.\n",

        "full_article": "The government's coordination committee for fiscal, monetary and currency-exchange affairs headed by the finance minister is learnt to have sketched out a budget for the next fiscal year (FY2023-24). Given that the government, to ride out the ongoing economic crisis, has gone for spending cuts in different sectors during the current fiscal, the proposed outlay for the next budget at Tk 7.46 trillion is clearly on the higher side. Add to that the targets of achieving a GDP growth at 7.5 per cent and arresting the rise of inflation at 6.0 per cent. Clearly, the challenges before the government would be gargantuan. Obviously, these also include the volatility in the international energy market, constantly appreciating US dollar against taka and the reduced inflow of remittance. Of particular note here is the issue of inflation. It may be recalled that since July this year, the rate of inflation has been high as it ranged between 7.48 and 9.52 per cent. Under the circumstances, will a contractionary monetary policy, as suggested at the coordination committee meeting, be enough to arrest the rising trend of inflation? In that event, what about providing financial support to the low-income and vulnerable section of the population to overcome the inflationary shock and mobilising the required fund for the purpose?To mobilise resources to meet the budgetary targets, these are important issues that need to be taken into due consideration. Most importantly, the suggested budget outlay, which will be 10 per cent higher than the current one (FY 2022-23) at Tk6.78 trillion, implies financing considerable budgetary deficit. In this context, the issues of estimated higher subsidy requirements of over Tk1.0 trillion and increased expenditures due to the projected Annual Development Programme (ADP) worth Taka 3.0 trillion will come under closer scrutiny. So, the challenge will be to keep the budgetary deficit even below the usual practice of 5.0 to 5.6 per cent of GDP.It is common knowledge that the budgetary deficits have to do with structural and economic factors including the prevailing high rate of inflation, balance of payment deficit and higher government expenditures. As usual, it is going to be met through government borrowing from banks as well as from the public by issuing government securities. But these run the risk of increasing domestic interest rates and crowding out of the private sector, which has already been markedly squeezed due to the existing economic conditions. The reduced economic growth in that case would come into conflict with the targeted GDP growth in the budget for the next fiscal. Increased public borrowing, on the other hand, would increase internal debts necessitating an increase in debt-servicing costs.There might be some underlying assumptions that the current recessionary trend in the global economy might ease to some extent next year thereby reducing inflationary pressure on the country's economy. But it is quite uncertain if the Ukraine war, the major driver of the instability in the global energy and food market, is going to end anytime soon. In that case, there is hardly any reason to believe that issues like shortage of foreign exchange reserve, reduced import and export, etc, -the leading causes of current economic crisis-are going to be resolved by next year. So, with an eye to the local and international developments, alongside meeting its budgetary challenges for the next fiscal, the government would be well-advised to focus more on maintaining the country's macroeconomic stability.",

        "full_article": "The nation, with the residents of the capital city in the forefront, has been waiting with bated breath for the launch of the nation's first metro rail line (MRT-6) that was supposed to be inaugurated on Victory Day (December 16, 2022). V-Day came and went, but no metro rail. The official launch date has been pushed back to December 28. It is hardly surprising that people were euphoric. In a city where residents spend up to five hours a day just to get from their homes to the workplace and back, the hype that has surrounded the MRT project over the years has also raised people's expectations. Just think, a one to 2-hour journey is cut down to 20 minutes, who wouldn't be excited? For years together, city dwellers had gotten used to the miserable traffic situation and a large number of Dhaka residents were mentally prepared to be one of the first commuters on their beloved MRT, even though only a partial route of the 6th line was due to be launched on December 16.So, why was not MRT launched on Victory Day? According to a report published in this paper on December 21, it appears that there has been a problem with safety clearance. Any mega-project of this magnitude must be signed off by some authority before its formal launch. Unfortunately, that little detail appears to have not been looked into properly as all bodies involved in the project were racing to meet the deadline. Reportedly, a committee had been set up to look into the whole approval process. It had made a recommendation to the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) \"to conduct a third-party audit for ensuring safety and security\" of the MRT 6 line, which is now scheduled to be inaugurated on December 28.That said, if one goes into the documentation of the project, Section 15 of the Metro Rail Act 2015 to be precise, one can see that DMTCL is the body that is responsible for dealing with all technical matters and getting approval from the Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) - which is the regulator for this new mass transport system. As reported, the \"technical issues include infrastructure facilities, rolling-stock establishment, operation and maintenance and safety management.\" It is all there in black and white. Hence, this lapse is DMTCL's. Going by what experts in the field say, the issue of safety certification has been incorporated into the Act to ensure the requisite inspection and evaluation of all relevant information about the MRT project.Safety must be the number one priority for a project such as this. Tens of thousands of people commuting on these trains are concerned. The routes are largely overhead, so safety is of paramount importance. There is no room for any lapse whatsoever, and that's why the clause is there in the Act.A probe by this newspaper into the matter shows that DMTCL had actually sent specifications of MRT6 to the regulator DTCA for clearance, but apparently, the latter could not comply as it lacked the experience to do so. Again, on the eve of launching the much-awaited service, the public is informed that the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges has formed a multi-stakeholder body including officials and academia to look into this whole issue.Why must such matters smack of incompetence and unprofessionalism? One would think that the people and agencies responsible for this very important mega-project would bother to read what the Act says and act accordingly. But no, that would be hoping for too much. Now the ball is in the committee's court and its members have visited all the infrastructure of the MRT and then gone back to holding meetings with the multiple contractors involved in the construction. A report has been submitted to the regulator with several recommendations, including one that would have a third party do an audit of the entire system. Wasn't that mentioned under Section 15 of the Act? Moving on, the DTCA top boss has gone on record to state that the regulator is not mandated to certify, but rather to audit and oversee the various legal aspects of operations. The DTCA informs that it is DTMCL that must prepare these documents and pass these on to DCTA. But at least DCTA has admitted that it lacks the professional capacity and necessary manpower to carry this out.Recapping what has been stated till now, there are two agencies involved with this process. The DCTA (the regulator) and the DTMCL (on the operational side) and there is, apparently, little coordination between the two. There is a general lack of prioritisation for safety. Otherwise, none of this could have happened. As time has already been wasted, one can only hope at corners will not be cut to expedite the audit work (at the cost of safety). The metro rail reportedly will operate on a limited scale on the Uttara-Agargaon segment initially. Before the start of the full operation, the authorities concerned, hopefully, would resolve the safety issues through effective coordination among themselves. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The season of festivity has arrived. Usually, during the winter, various family and social festivals take place in the country. December and January are considered the peak season of these festivals. A wedding ceremony is probably the biggest social occasion, followed by picnics, reunions and other events. Although a wedding ceremony takes place almost round the year, its frequency goes up in winter due to the advantage of weather conditions. There is no rainfall and no sweating from the hot summer. Schools remain closed or New Year's classes start tentatively. Relatives and friends from abroad also come to visit their near and dear ones. All these enhance a favourable ambience for social or family gatherings.A wedding ceremony provides an excellent opportunity to reunite near and far-off family members and friends and welcome new relatives. People arrange ceremonies according to their social and financial ability. That's why some wedding ceremonies become a matter of extensive opulence of wealth and resources while some ceremonial events are modest. The harsh fact is that wedding ceremonies today also reflect the socioeconomic disparity in the country. Gifts are an essential part of the wedding reception, which has positive and negative social dimensions. It symbolises blessings and best wishes to a newly married couple. These gifts are also given to the couple so the start to their new life can become easier. For example, a home appliance as a gift is a common practice. At the same time, it is a burden on many as no one wants to attend a wedding party without a good gift. Moreover, those who attend the ceremonies usually bring gifts according to their financial ability and socio-economic status. So, only some can give a costly gift as expected by their hosts. In fact, many people now consider the accumulated value of gifts as a return on investment in the wedding reception. After the end of the event, they calculate the spending on the reception against the estimated value of gifts received. The small the difference, the happy the hosts are. Similarly, some guests also try to estimate the monetary value of food against their gift and transport costs.No matter how weird this sounds, it is a fast-growing social trend. Some hosts also expect cash or cash equivalent gift cheques or vouchers instead of various things. Book is no longer preferred as a wedding gift. The table set to receive and entry gift clearly shows that guests with tiny gifts are not welcome. This is also an indirect insult to the low-income relatives and friends who are invited. In some cases, the hosts invite them indifferently, giving a message that they are not welcome at the event mainly due to their inability to bring expensive gifts. Thus the culture of wedding gifts has become an unpleasant social phenomenon in this country. It is also rare that invitation cards are scribed with 'no gift, blessings only.'\n[email\u00a0protected]",

But unfortunately, many children in Bangladesh are deprived of these basic rights. Around 13 per cent children in the country are reportedly involved in child labour. They are denied schooling and access to other rights. Some of them get involved even in criminal activities and drug abuse. Thousands of children in Dhaka city live at railway stations, bus terminals, outside the stadiums and other places. Losing their ties with families, these children are deprived of a proper childhood. They are known as street children who are denied all kinds of rights. According to some estimate, currently the country has at least 1.5 million street children. And the number is increasing every year. They are involved in risky unskilled physical labour such as rickshaw pulling, daily labour, transport operation, and agricultural activities, among others. Children with no access to education have to enter the labour market and are often forced to perform dangerous or exploitative work. In such a reality, the authorities concerned should increase the budget for child development, build a supportive environment for children and prioritise children's rights. \nMohammad Al-Amin, [email\u00a0protected]",
