        "full_article": "With four deaths so far, the coal mining tragedy in Assam\u2019s Dima Hasao district has revived a long-standing debate on the hazardous nature of rat-hole coal mining in India. As opposed to modern coal mining, which is mechanised, the \u2018rat-hole\u2019 points to the crude and antiquated technique of employing people, and even children, to burrow into the ground to scoop out the underground coal. Depending on the depths that they plumb, the odds are high that their pickaxes will often unleash a torrent of water from a hidden aquifer that can suddenly inundate the excavated tunnel \u2014 as it is suspected to have happened at Dima Hasao. Because such accidents have recurred over the decades, along with the attendant health and environmental hazards, this mode of mining was banned by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014. The use of proper geological surveys and appropriate machinery would have made the mine economically unviable. The Assam Chief Minister has stated that the mine appeared to be \u201cprime facie... illegal\u201d and one abandoned by the State\u2019s Mines and Minerals Department. If that is the case, it reflects poorly on the State administration that such mines can be exploited by unscrupulous elements with such ease, despite the ban. Surely, this is only a fraction of the unregulated mining that actually goes on.The Supreme Court of India, in 2019, had asked whether it was possible for such mining to continue without the \u201cconnivance\u201d of officials, when it was examining the rescue of 15 miners trapped in a rat-hole mine in the East Jaintia Hills in December 2018. A report submitted by a monitoring committee set up by the NGT observed that despite the ban, the demand for coal to power cement manufacturing and thermal power plants in the northeast had sustained and supported rat-hole coal mining. On the other hand, when convenient, State authorities have sought out and even felicitated rat-hole miners, some from Assam, as in 2023, when they were called in as a last resort after advanced machinery and the expertise of professional geologists and earth scientists had failed to rescue 41 construction workers trapped in the large, over-ground Silkiyara tunnel in Uttarkashi. The Dima Hasao operation too, like others, will end and the net success or failure of saving those trapped will induce a familiar amnesia that will be broken only by the next accident. Until decisive action to puncture the economics of rat-hole mining is taken, India is only burrowing the way to another tragedy.

        "full_article": "Despite the hundreds of thousands who throng the Tirumala temple in Tirupati every year for the Vaikunta Ekadasi celebrations, stampedes at the world-renowned hill temple have been rare. However, the tragic incident on January 8, 2025 underscores the need to rethink crowd management strategies at religious pilgrimage sites. As an editorial in this daily on December 27, 2024, noted, India has the highest number of religious stampedes globally. According to National Crime Records Bureau data, between 1996 and 2022, over 3,000 lives were lost in stampedes at religious events nationwide. This statistic starkly highlights the need for systemic changes in the way large-scale gatherings are organised and managed. The Tirupati stampede, which resulted in six devotees passing away and injuries to over 40 others, was despite the extensive arrangements by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) and the Andhra Pradesh government. Elaborate crowd control mechanisms, such as a well-dispersed token distribution strategy and the deployment of over 3,000 police personnel and other staff and volunteers were in place for the 10-day Vaikunta Dwara Darshan. Nonetheless, what appears to be miscommunication at one of the centres in the city to handle a surge in devotees at a token distribution centre, seems to have triggered chaos and panic. The probe that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced would shed more light on where the lapse occurred. The tragedy unfolded just weeks after another stampede-like situation in Hyderabad. While the TTD has been making commendable efforts over the years to streamline operations \u2014 online booking systems and additional security personnel during peak periods \u2014 the scale and the spontaneity of human behaviour at such events demand innovative solutions.One such idea could involve prioritising pilgrims who have never visited Tirupati over repeat visitors, thereby ensuring a more equitable darshan. VIP darshans too need a rethink. A robust database and a roster system could help regulate devotee flow and ensure fairness. Additionally, there is a need to consider the ecological impact on the Tirumala Hills, which are a part of the Seshachalam Biosphere Reserve. Growing anthropogenic pressures stemming from deforestation, urbanisation, and massive footfalls pose a significant threat to its biodiversity. Balancing the human need to connect with the divine with the imperative to preserve nature requires innovative and sustainable approaches. These could include capping the number of pilgrims every day, promoting virtual darshan experiences, and enforcing stricter conservation policies. A collaborative effort between religious and government authorities, environmental experts, and the public is essential to create a framework that prioritises safety, accessibility, and ecological preservation.

        "full_article": "Now that BMI\u2019s rightly discredited, we need better measures for obesity, a major problem in urban India\u00a0\nHumans may be tall, short, broad, slim, and all are normal, but Adolphe Quetelet didn\u2019t like the variability. The statistician in him \u2013 he was also an astronomer but not a physician \u2013 ached to neatly quantify the \u2018normal man\u2019, so in 1832 he created an index, dividing a person\u2019s weight by the square of their height. In 1972, this index got the name \u2018body mass index\u2019 or BMI and for the past half century it\u2019s been the touchstone of health. You are overweight if your BMI is over 25, obese if it\u2019s over 30. For example, height 5\u2019, weight 70kg is considered obese.\nBMI\u2019s simplicity is its beauty and also its drawback. When Mike Tyson fought Evander Holyfield in 1996, he weighed 100kg on a 5\u201910\u201d frame: BMI 31.9, an absurd case for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. On the other hand, you have a 5\u201910\u201d office worker weighing 72kg \u2013 healthy BMI of 22.7 \u2013 who suffers a heart attack. Turns out that sitting for too long atrophied their muscles and piled weight around the middle, which is a major risk factor for diabetes, heart trouble and also cancer. That\u2019s why a Lancet panel has called for defining obesity in better terms, such as the waist-to-hip ratio.\u00a0\nEarly last year, the world\u2019s obese population \u2013 not merely overweight \u2013 was estimated at over 1bn, and data shows obesity is no longer a rich-world problem. The island nation of Tonga has the highest share of obese people, thanks to a steady supply of cheap mutton flaps from New Zealand. Egypt\u2019s economic woes have resulted in an obesity pandemic as people are eating less rice, vegetables and legumes, and more meat and sugar-heavy foods to feel fuller. Obesity is not so prevalent across India, but that\u2019s mainly down to lower rates in villages. One study found that 70% of India\u2019s urban population was already overweight or obese, and rising consumption of ultra-processed foods could make the problem worse. A better measure of obesity \u2013 one that distinguishes between fat and muscle, abdominal fat and other types, and takes into account differences of race and sex \u2013 would be welcome.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Setbacks shouldn\u2019t deter GOI from continuing to invest in UAVs on priority. Also, cut private players more slack\u00a0\nIn a setback for the armed forces\u2019 ongoing plans for induction of military drones, a medium-altitude long endurance (MALE) drone called Drishti-10, assembled in India by Adani Defence and Aerospace under licence from Israel, crashed in the pre-acceptance trial. Both army and navy had ordered the satcom-enabled drone, which costs around \u20b9120cr. But such setbacks are not out of the ordinary. The armed forces need at least 150 new MALE drones, aside from high-altitude long endurance (HALE) drones like American Predators \u2013 New Delhi has already inked a \u20b932,350cr contract for 31 of these.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no denying that drones have assumed military salience in the last few years, especially after their effective deployment in the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict and the Ukraine war. The latter, in particular, has taken drone warfare to a whole new level. In 2024, domestically produced Ukrainian drones accounted for 96% of all UAVs used by Ukrainian troops. This included over 1.5mn FPV drones that are no more than seven inches in size.\u00a0\nThe point is innovation is the name of the game in drone warfare. Hence, what is needed for India is to create a robust drone manufacturing ecosystem comprising both private and public players. Towards this end, GOI has done well to include all categories of drones \u2013 barring strategic ones \u2013 in the negative list for imports. But that\u2019s step one. Given that investment in R&D is vital here, GOI\u2019s policy of selecting the lowest bidder needs to be reviewed. For, private players can best innovate when they have more financial elbowroom, which in turn can bring down prices. Each Ukrainian FPV drone costs around $500 or less.\u00a0\nThird, as the induction of an array of drones into the armed forces picks up pace, there is a need to create a specialist corps to operate the drones or specialist drone subunits. This will not only streamline integration and operation of drones, but will also see drone warfare emerge as a key pillar of defence strategy. The bottom line: no matter the setbacks, GOI and armed forces must keep investing in drone supply chains, R&D and procurement. Twenty-first century warfare demands this.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is heartening to see the authorities respond positively to the demands of the protesting Jagannath University (JnU) students. The decision to involve Bangladesh Army in constructing the university's second campus in Keraniganj, while not an ideal one, meets a key demand of the students who, since Sunday, have staged a hunger strike, held sit-ins in front of the Secretariat Building, and enforced a campus shutdown. The army's expected involvement in constructing steel-based buildings at Bani Bhaban and Habibur Rahman Hall for temporary accommodation also meets another demand. While these steps only partially address JnU's long-standing infrastructural challenges, they should provide sufficient incentive for the students to lift their shutdown for now and return to class.\nHowever, the students' call for written assurances is also reasonable, given the chronic nature of these issues as well as instances of\u00a0unfulfilled promises\u00a0not long ago. For many years, JnU\u2014now in its 20th year, having been upgraded from college status in 2005\u2014has had to cope with inadequate facilities and spaces that are, frankly, unbecoming of a public university. Over 17,000 students are currently enrolled across 38 departments and two institutions. Despite this, there is only one residential hall for female students and none for male students. Eleven halls of the erstwhile Jagannath College in Old Dhaka remain occupied to this day, despite years of protests and legal efforts. The university also has no playground, and no common room for male students. The absence of adequate residential facilities means that many students must undertake gruelling commutes daily, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted.\nThese are just some of the problems plaguing JnU and its students. It is unfortunate that the decision to set up a second, more spacious campus in 2016 has taken so long to gain traction, which only shows how badly the ousted Awami League government handled the infrastructural and accommodation challenges of this institution, with corruption, mismanagement, and inefficiency all playing a role in this crisis. The lack of sound academic planning, necessary for the transformation of a college-turned-university, also contributed to this. Going forward, it is imperative that the authorities proactively address all these issues\u2014not just the ones raised by students\u2014so that this institution can fulfil its potential.\nWe, therefore, urge the authorities to undertake a comprehensive review of the present state of JnU and formulate an action plan prioritising the establishment of necessary facilities and amenities as well as the reclamation of old, occupied halls. For now, they must properly engage with the protesting students to ensure that academic activities are resumed without delay.\n",

        "full_article": "As we approach the January 20 inauguration of Donald Trump for his second term as the US president, Bangladeshis are reflecting on the US presidential election's outcome and examining the changes in the diaspora's politics. In the run-up to the election, a growing number of Bangladeshis reported dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party. Now that the election has concluded, it appears that murmurs of a rightward shift towards Donald Trump in the diaspora were rooted in reality.\u00a0\nMany areas with large Bangladeshi populations saw a jump in the popularity of Donald Trump and a decrease in votes for the Democratic Party compared to support for previous liberal presidential candidates. In Michigan's Hamtramck, a majority-Muslim town where Bangladeshis make up the largest portion of the population, net support for Trump saw a shift of 29 percentage points, even though Kamala Harris carried the majority of votes. Reasons for the shift are numerous, encompassing the varied issues Bangladeshis expressed concern about in the weeks leading up to the election, including the economy and the Gaza war.\u00a0\nASM Kamal Rahman, a Democrat and Bangladeshi-American community activist in Hamtramck, broke with his party and voted for Trump because of taxes and economic issues. He told Voice of America, \"I think everybody that lives here, they look at the issues that affect them here: the economy, the education system affecting the families.\" Mohammad Alauddin, a Bangladeshi immigrant in Hamtramck who voted for Trump in this election, after having previously voted for Biden, considered the Democratic response to the Gaza war to be the impetus for his decision.\nThese common concerns also played a role in New York City, where the Democratic margins have significantly fallen compared to previous years. Nearly half of Bangladeshi-Americans live in New York, a majority of whom live in the NY-14 district, which is represented by noted progressive politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Though Harris won the NY-14 district, the 2024 election saw a 22-point shift in the margins between Democrats and Republicans compared to 2020, while Ocasio-Cortez saw only a six-point reduction in her net margin.\u00a0\nThese reports signal a sharp shift in the Bangladeshi demographic's voting, as they have traditionally prioritised liberal politics, with 91 percent voting for Joe Biden in 2020, according to the National Asian American Survey. It remains to be seen if this increased support for Trump among Bangladeshi-Americans will translate into benefits. While democracy is often discussed in terms of individuals and groups voting for their own interests, it is unclear if Trump's presidency will benefit, rather than negatively impact, Bangladeshis.\u00a0\nTrump, known for his erratic rhetoric towards immigrants, has promised mass deportations, which could prove threatening to the safety of the predominantly Muslim Bangladeshi-American population, or at the very least, will cause disruptions in their communities as the promised mass deportation begins \"on Day 1.\"\u00a0\nFurthermore, the impact of his economic policies on Bangladeshi-Americans is not yet clear. Trump has promised to make housing more affordable, help the middle-class group, and decrease prices, but it is uncertain whether this can be achieved. One of his key economic policies is the raising of tariffs, which could affect global trade dynamics and Bangladesh-US trade.\u00a0\nFurther complicating his potential Bangladesh policy, Trump has a warm personal relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in a Diwali message on November 1 on the social media platform X, he condemned what he referred to as \"the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,\" alluding to an untrue narrative of Hindu persecution. This could lead to a negative impact on Bangladesh-US relations at a crucial juncture in Bangladeshi politics.\u00a0\nDue to these dynamics, when Donald Trump takes office on January 20, Bangladeshis will have to reckon with what the Trump presidency will mean in the United States and at home.\u00a0\nSophia Ahmed is a Bangladesh-American student journalist living in New York.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the authors' own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Considering the evolving landscape of personal injury law, it is imperative to consider the introduction of comprehensive injury law in Bangladesh, particularly when juxtaposed with established frameworks such as the Canadian legal system. The Canadian approach\u2014epitomised by the Insurance Act, the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS), and the Automobile Accident Benefits Service (AABS)\u2014provides a robust model for ensuring equitable compensation for injured parties. The Insurance Act (RSC 1970, c 1-21) serves as the cornerstone of Canada's insurance regulatory framework, mandating insurers to adhere to principles of fairness and accessibility in their operations.\nSection 10 of the Act delineates the obligations of insurers to provide comprehensive coverage, ensuring that victims of automobile accidents receive timely and appropriate compensation. This is complemented by the SABS, which establishes a no-fault compensation scheme aimed at expediting benefits to injured individuals, thereby minimising litigation and fostering a more efficient resolution process.\nThe AABS further enhances this framework by providing a streamlined mechanism for disputes related to accident benefits. Under Section 2 of the AABS, injured parties are afforded access to a range of benefits, including medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and income replacement, reflecting a commitment to support recovery and reintegration into society. This structured approach not only aids victims but also alleviates the burden on the judicial system, allowing courts to focus on more complex matters. In stark contrast, the current legal environment in Bangladesh remains largely unregulated with respect to personal injury law. The absence of a formalised framework for addressing injury claims results in significant challenges for victims seeking redress. The lack of statutory guidelines hampers timely access to benefits, often leaving injured individuals to navigate a labyrinthine process devoid of clarity or support.\nIntroducing a comprehensive injury law regime in Bangladesh could harness the principles established in Canadian legislation. By instituting a no-fault insurance system akin to the SABS, the Bangladeshi legal framework could ensure that victims receive immediate support without the protracted delays associated with litigation. Furthermore, adopting mechanisms for dispute resolution, as seen in the AABS, could enhance accessibility and efficiency, ultimately fostering a more equitable legal landscape. The imperative for reform is underscored by the increasing prevalence of road traffic accidents in Bangladesh, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Establishing a robust injury law framework would not only provide essential protections for these individuals but also promote social justice and economic stability by facilitating recovery and reducing the financial strain on families.\nBangladesh, with its rapidly expanding transportation networks and population growth, faces a rising number of road traffic accidents and workplace injuries. Yet, the country lacks a comprehensive legal framework for addressing personal injury claims, especially those resulting from road traffic accidents, industrial work, and other public incidents. The absence of such laws leaves victims in vulnerable positions, with limited recourse for compensation and rehabilitation. While the country does have some provisions under civil law, these are often insufficient in addressing the scale of issues faced by accident victims. Medical expenses, long-term rehabilitation, and lost income due to injury are frequently borne by the victims themselves, without sufficient support from the government or insurers. This creates a significant gap in the social safety net, which ultimately hinders Bangladesh's progress in building a robust, equitable society.\nImplementing a personal injury law framework modelled after Canada's SABS and Insurance Act could bring numerous benefits to Bangladesh, from enhancing public health and safety to strengthening the economy.\nHere are some of the key advantages:\n\nBetter protection for accident victims\nOne of the primary benefits of the SABS system is its ability to provide immediate financial and medical support to accident victims. In a country like Bangladesh, where road traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year, having a well-structured system for compensating victims can significantly reduce the financial burden on individuals and their families. Implementing similar provisions could ensure that injured parties receive timely medical treatment, rehabilitation, and lost income compensation, regardless of fault.\nThis would be particularly beneficial in Bangladesh, where the healthcare system often struggles with limited resources. Injury law modelled after the SABS could help alleviate some of the pressure on the state-funded healthcare system by providing insurance-based coverage for accident victims.\nReduced financial burden on the state\nIn the absence of a well-structured injury law, the financial burden of treating and compensating accident victims often falls on the state. In Bangladesh, government hospitals and social welfare programmes bear a significant portion of these costs. However, introducing a mandatory injury law could shift much of this burden to private insurers, alleviating pressure on public resources and ensuring a more sustainable model for handling personal injury claims.\nIn Canada, the implementation of SABS and the Insurance Act has significantly reduced the reliance on public funds for accident-related injuries. By requiring all drivers to have mandatory insurance coverage, the system ensures that the financial needs of victims are met without overtaxing public resources.\nPromoting road safety and workplace protections\nThe existence of a comprehensive injury law framework can also serve as a deterrent against reckless driving and unsafe working conditions. In Canada, the knowledge that drivers are required by law to carry insurance, and that accident victims will be compensated, has led to heightened awareness about road safety. Similarly, workplace injury laws encourage employers to take proactive steps to protect their workers.\nBy implementing similar laws in Bangladesh, the government could help reduce accident rates while also encouraging safer work environments. For instance, with the introduction of no-fault insurance for motor vehicle accidents, drivers may be more inclined to follow traffic laws, knowing that their actions will have direct financial consequences for others.\nBoosting economic productivity\nThe economic impact of implementing personal injury laws could also be significant. By providing compensation for lost wages due to injury, injured workers can return to their lives and responsibilities faster, thus minimising productivity losses. Furthermore, the introduction of a no-fault insurance system could lead to a reduction in lengthy litigation, which currently plagues the country's legal system. With faster claims processing and clear guidelines for insurance companies, businesses can focus on economic activities rather than dealing with costly legal disputes.\nImproved legal transparency and access\nThe clear guidelines set out in Canada's Insurance Act provide a transparent framework that individuals can easily navigate when filing injury claims. This transparency can help reduce the occurrence of fraud, streamline the claims' process, and ensure that victims receive their entitled benefits. By adopting a similar legal framework, Bangladesh could create a more accessible system for people who are injured, reducing the frustration and confusion that many experience when seeking justice in the current system.\nDespite the clear benefits, implementing a similar system in Bangladesh would not come without challenges. One major hurdle would be creating the necessary infrastructure for such a system. The insurance industry in Bangladesh is still developing, and widespread compliance with mandatory insurance laws would require substantial government oversight, as well as public awareness campaigns to ensure that citizens understand their rights and responsibilities.\nIn summary, the introduction of a comprehensive injury law system in Bangladesh, informed by the successful tenets of Canadian legislation, is not merely beneficial but necessary. It presents an opportunity to safeguard the rights of injured parties, promote equitable access to justice, and enhance the overall integrity of the legal system. As Bangladesh continues to develop, the integration of these principles will be crucial in building a resilient society capable of responding to the needs of its most vulnerable citizens.\nShekh Eshtiak Ahmed is litigation legal assistant at Joseph Sidiropoulos LPC, Toronto, Canada.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.
