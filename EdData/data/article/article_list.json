While there are numerous issues related to the integrity of elections that the Election Commission of India (ECI) needs to come clean on, the risk of electronic tampering with EVMs is not among them. The Congress is barking up the wrong tree \u2014 that too selectively and only when it loses. Some of its party leaders have publicly expressed the view that there is no evidence that suggests the risk of manipulation, remotely or through preprogramming. At least two Opposition leaders, NC leader and J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, and Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee, have distanced themselves from the allegations. To assume that EVMs are so elaborately and precisely manipulated that the BJP wins in some States and loses in some others in a detailed conspiracy, defies logic. After all, the BJP ended up short of a majority in the 2024 general election. Moreover, all these results, particularly those of Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand are well explained by the social and political dynamics at play.By repeatedly raising the spectre of EVM manipulation, the real and serious questions of election integrity are being overlooked. Among them, the possibility of old style, manual capture of EVMs in booths dominated by one party and where polling agents of opponents are absent. This is pertinent against the backdrop of questions about a massive turnout recorded in many places in the closing hours of polling. This trend has not yet been satisfactorily explained by the ECI. Large-scale additions and deletions of voter names are now a pattern, and the ECI seems to be brazening it out. In Delhi, where elections are now due, allegations of the selective removal of Muslim voters have surfaced. In the Uttar Pradesh by-elections, partisan police actions that restrained voters expected to vote against the BJP have been controversial. The scheduling of elections is another serious question that the ECI has been less than transparent about. For a country that is preparing to conduct all elections in one go, it scheduled the three recent Assembly elections in two batches, and the BJP is the one party that gained the benefits. As is evident, some of these issues are local, some related to the vast capacity gap between the BJP and the Opposition while some others are squarely in the court of the ECI. The Opposition needs to focus on the real questions of election integrity, and an EVM scare should not act as a distraction.\r Published - December 19, 2024 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Election Commission of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Haryana Assembly Elections 2024\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Indian National Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        voting\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        national elections\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        regional elections\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        election\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Jammu and Kashmir\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        All India Trinamool Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bharatiya Janata Party\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Jharkhand Assembly Elections 2024\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Delhi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        minority group",

        "full_article": "German politics has been in turmoil ever since Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost his parliamentary majority last month, when the pro-market Free Democratic Party exited his three-way coalition. Mr. Scholz initially tried to cling on to power, heading a minority government, but amid criticism and concerns that delaying an inevitable snap election could further damage the chances of Mr. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, the Chancellor called for a vote of confidence on Monday. The outcome was known beforehand \u2014 his government collapsed the same day, pushing the country into early elections. The Scholz government, which was formed after the 2021 federal elections in which the Social Democrats won most seats, remained fractious from day one. While the Social Democrats and the Greens supported more public spending, the Free Democrats pushed for austerity. The government lacked coordination and what made the intra-coalition fighting worse was the financial crisis. Germany, once the engine of the European economy, has been in recession for two years. With no consensus within the coalition on how to tackle the financial crisis, the government\u2019s popularity plunged. In November, Mr. Scholz sacked his Finance Minister, Christian Lindner (Free Democrats), sealing the government\u2019s fate. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will now call for elections, most likely in February 2025, seven months earlier than planned.When Angela Merkel was in power, her conservative coalition managed to offer political stability, economic growth and a fine balancing between great powers. Even during the Russia-Ukraine tensions over the 2014 Crimean annexation, Ms. Merkel and the French leadership engaged with the Russians, which resulted in the two Minsk agreements. But two months after Mr. Scholz became Chancellor, Russia invaded Ukraine. Germany could do little to prevent the war, but it joined the West in imposing sanctions on Russia, which hit the European economies as well. The Nord Stream pipeline, built to bring Russian gas to Germany, was blown up, allegedly by the Ukrainians. The war worsened the West\u2019s energy crisis, in turn impacting the cost of living crisis. It then snowballed into a larger economic meltdown, triggering political instability. Germany is not the only country battling economic woes and political instability. In neighbouring France, a government collapsed in three months, and President Emmanuel Macron has appointed a new Prime Minister, who also lacks a majority in Parliament. Elsewhere in the continent, far-right parties with neo-Nazi views are resurgent. Mr. Scholz is likely to lead the Social Democrats in the elections but the conservative Christian Democrats are the frontrunners. A trial by fire awaits whoever wins.\r Published - December 19, 2024 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Germany\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        political parties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Russia-Ukraine Crisis\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economic sanction\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        natural gas\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        France\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        election",

        "full_article": "In 2024 one school shooter is female, 322 weren\u2019t. What\u2019s stark in US is no less true elsewhere\nMonday\u2019s school shooting at Madison, Wisconsin was US\u2019s 323rd this year. That\u2019s indicative of how these tragedies have become \u2018normalised\u2019 in that country. Scanners, security personnel, active shooter drills are becoming as customary as textbooks. Caught between cries for gun safety and against \u2018villainising a tool\u2019, essentially US responds to one shooting by waiting for the next one. Still, this shooting does stand out. The shooter is a female student. That\u2019s rare. Social media has also thrown up a manifesto allegedly written by her, where she describes fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, teachers, police as \u2018a f***ing scourge upon the earth\u2019. And in tandem, the manosphere has gone off on how \u2018anti-male\u2019 activism is destroying young people and society.\nThis is a dangerous deflection. Whatever set of factors drove a troubled teenager to kill others and herself, whoever she may have experienced or identified as the villains in her life story, if all of this has to be seen through a gendered lens, let that lens be fair and honest.\nOne data set shows that only 4% of school shooters in the past 25 years have been female, another that 98% of perpetrators of mass shootings from 1966 to 2019 were male, and the list is long in this vein. A particularly savage statistic is that every time an American under 25 gets pregnant, her odds of death by homicide more than double, with her husband or boyfriend commonly being the killer. Men are more violent, women are more the victims of violence. This is hardly limited to US alone. That females constitute just 4.3% of the prison population in India is indicative of a yawning gender gap in not just crime, but also violence.\nFrom these incontestable facts, it\u2019s important to move in the correct direction. Surely this cannot be absolving men and villainising women. Nor, obviously, would we want tomorrow\u2019s society to have women being as homicidal as men today. A peaceable future depends crucially on how we treat our children\u2019s wounds. Politicising these means perpetuating and perhaps even escalating the rage-loop.\n\n",

Plus those whose opus has skimmed off a creamy layer prize. At BLF, it was the\u00a0 notoriously taciturn Upamanyu Chatterjee, whom I managed to draw into good-humoured duel. He drew first blood by telling a delighted audience that\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t read the JCB prize winner (where grass-smoking, jerking-off,\u00a0 urban-exile Agastya Sen has, 36 years and eight books later, turned into Lorenzo Senesi, a reflective Benedictine monk in existential search). It became win-win for him because in proving that I had, he got me to marvel at his detailed descriptions and quote samples of his droll wit: Luca \u2018drove with the insouciance of a local cat with several lives to throw away\u2019. Or his clever referencing of \u2018America\u2019s darling\u2019 actress in landlady Mary and her cat Pickford.\u00a0\nIn book-signing queues, our prose pros can be out-snaked by those with other fame-claims: screen and sports stars, gurus of body/mind/soul/work-life balance, climate change and now Demon/Deity AI.

        "full_article": "Govt should issue clear guidance for small investors dabbling in cryptocurrencies\nWarren Buffett and Bill Gates don\u2019t get crypto, but it seems 2cr Indians do. Data shows it\u2019s been a good year for these currencies in India despite the 30% tax on earnings. Not just metros, obscure places like Barbaka in Assam and Botad in Gujarat have surfed the waves. Assuming only one person per family is brave enough to play with such highly volatile \u201cassets\u201d \u2013 flagship Bitcoin touched $47,000 in Jan, $71,000 in June, $54,000 in Sep and is over $1L now \u2013 it\u2019s likely everybody knows somebody with a crypto stake. But that may not be a reason to cheer.\nA report by crypto app CoinSwitch says a large chunk of investments this year did not go to top-tier cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead, they were pumped into meme and gaming coins and layer-2 tokens. Meme coins are based on internet memes and jokes and not considered investment worthy. Dogecoin, darling of Elon Musk, is exhibit A. In its first seven years, its value didn\u2019t cross 1 cent. With Musk\u2019s endorsement it shot up to about 70 cents in May 2021 and is at 40 cents now. But it languished below 20 cents for three intervening years. What changed? Trump won, and he\u2019s pro-crypto this time, and Musk\u2019s been acting like his right hand. Where would Dogecoin be without Musk?\nLikewise, a meme coin called Elongate owed its very brief and meteoric rise \u2013 6,000% \u2013 in summer 2021 to YouTuber Logan Paul\u2019s endorsement. Kim Kardashian did it for another meme coin called EMax on Instagram and was fined $1.3mn (11cr).\nWord travels fast on social media. If desperate young investors hear this or that meme coin is their key to riches, they will borrow to buy it. RBI has repeatedly called for banning crypto but markets regulator Sebi wants to regulate like US, not ban it. GOI must make up its mind and issue clear guidance to small investors who could lose real money.\n\n",

Trump\u2019s Assistant AG-designate Harmeet Dhillon moved things along with her tweet \u2018Pnjab\u2019. In his shows, the headline-making singer-lyricist-actor has taken on TV anchors and authorities on govt\u2019s blind moralistic diktats.\nIt started with a complaint against Dosanjh\u2019s songs\u2019 \u201cimpact on children\u201d that resulted in Telangana govt issuing him directions ahead of his Hyderabad event to avoid numbers on alcohol, drugs and violence. Chandigarh\u2019s child rights body ahead of the Chandigarh concert played school-teacher, advising him against performing songs \u201cpromoting alcohol\u201d. Dosanjh complied, tweaked bits, but also made his point onstage, comparing treatment he\u2019s received to the diet of violence/alcohol depicted in movies \u2013 \u201cyou trouble artistes and singers because they\u2019re soft targets.\u201d He has a point. Stopping Dosanjh singing certain numbers on stage will not even be a blip on Punjab\u2019s triple trouble of alcohol-drugs-violence that\u2019s flourished for decades to benefit the criminal nexus of peddler-police-politician. But authorities opt to view such issues through a lens of morality.\nThe Indian state loves dispensing virtue lessons. Govts, municipalities, certainly panchayats, draw from every regressive norm of extra-judicial and extra-constitutional outfits (every state has its own version) to impose a misplaced morality on the public; actions simply beyond state\u2019s constitutional remit. It\u2019s a loooooong list. Crackdowns on Valentine\u2019s Day, which didn\u2019t stop people falling in love outside social norms. Dress codes in colleges. Teenagers\u2019 sex lives. Banning adult sites. Banning Maharashtra\u2019s dance bars. Banning women in pubs. Restricting nightlife. Mindless censorship of films, books, art. What people won\u2019t eat. No eggs in midday meals. Surveillance of online \u2018behaviour\u2019. Prohibition. Yet, no \u2018morality inspired\u2019 policy has ever served its \u2018cause\u2019, misguided as it is. Point is the state doesn\u2019t let up \u2013 it believes it can issue such diktats. Of course, there are always exceptions \u2013 300 passes for a Judges Lounge in Dosanjh\u2019s Chandigarh concert was quite the VIP treatment. Worth noting also is all directives/rules are imposed on the public \u2013 nary a word on ethics and probity of public office.\nThis is neither in defence of any song or singer, nor endorsing children\u2019s unfettered access to adult material/content. Issue is that in 75 years, govts are still mai-baap mode, basking as a bad parent \u2013 not listening but repeatedly barking \u2018Don\u2019t\u2019. Dosanjh dedicated his Chandigarh concert to Gukesh. Authorities, go figure.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Since taking over in early August, the interim government has taken a few positive steps to recognise the contributions of migrant workers and address their grievances. However, these isolated attempts fall far short of the comprehensive reforms needed across the labour migration process. As a result, feelings of neglect persist among the workers. This is why news of the record $24.24 billion in remittance earned up to November 2024 feels less like a triumph for migrants and more like a reminder of how the state continues to view them: as mere economic tools to boost its foreign reserves.\nOn the occasion of the International Migrants Day,\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0talked to a number of migrant workers who expressed frustration over the lack of measures to ensure their welfare. One worker said, \"They (Bangladesh authorities) don't care about how we live, our health issues, or whether we are safe. Their only concern is how much money we send.\" Even the embassies, he added, \"do not respect us; they treat us like slaves.\" Such sentiments are rooted in years of systemic corruption, irregularities and mismanagement suffered by migrants. Reports of fraudulent recruitment practices and exorbitant migration costs remain alarmingly common. Once abroad, workers also face abuse, contract violations, and poor living conditions, with little recourse or support from the authorities.\nThe interim government has a chance to change this narrative and ensure that our workers receive the support they deserve. There are many issues that need to be fixed, from recruitment to reintegration. While the need for increasing remittances\u2014through upskilling workers and deterring the reliance on informal channels such as hundi\u2014is understandable, it is secondary to tackling the exploitative practices that plague the life cycle of migrant workers, directly affecting their wellbeing. The time has come to shift the focus from what migrants can do for the country to what the country can do for them. The formation of a commission to undertake this task, as recommended by experts, is an essential first step in that direction.\nOne area that needs urgent attention is the costs of migration. It is unacceptable that Bangladesh remains one of the costliest countries for migration, with aspiring workers often paying up to six times the government-stipulated costs due to corrupt practices and intermediaries. Moreover, they are also harassed while getting a passport, completing medical check-ups, etc. Clearly, stricter oversight of recruitment practices is crucial. The plight of workers stranded or mistreated abroad is another pressing concern. From Malaysia to the Gulf states, thousands face exploitative conditions, delayed salaries, and even threats of deportation. The government must enforce stricter monitoring of our recruitment agencies and embassies, and negotiate better protections with destination countries. Additionally, it must ensure proper reintegration for returning migrants who often struggle to rebuild their lives after years abroad.\nThere is a lot that needs to change, and for that, all relevant departments and agencies must undergo a cultural and operational overhaul. The interim government, and any administration that follows, must understand that we cannot honour the contributions of our migrant workers without a full recognition of their rights and dignity.\n",

        "full_article": "Since Covid, everyday economic anxiety leading to a pessimistic mood has been a reality in Bangladesh. After the July-August uprising, there was a somewhat euphoric mood upswing, but it was short-lived because the economic lives of the majority have not been improving. This calls for urgent and direct action.\nThe negative economic outlook and the positive political expectations together produce a prognosis for the future, in which a virtuous cycle of political hope can create the conditions, ambitions, and appetite for public-private investment in urgent and direct actions. This can steer the nation towards greater stability and patience for critical reform that will leave a lasting framework to build a people-centric democracy for Bangladesh.\nI want to reflect on this economic and political dynamic that emerged from the latest BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) national pulse survey conducted with 4,158 adult women and men. It is a longitudinal survey that BIGD has been conducting in partnership with The Asia Foundation (TAF) since 2019. The survey is also part of BIGD's Rapid Research Response\u00a0(RRR 2024) initiative, the initial phase of which is taking place between August '24 and February '25. To that effect, two opinion surveys have been conducted so far over the phone\u2014one in August and the other in October.\u00a0\nThe urgency is clear: People are tired of coping on their own since Covid. They have exhausted their capacity of resilience where they had to rely primarily on individual, family, and informal support since state support has been too little too late. Therefore, there is a need for large-scale social protection programmes that can enhance the productive capacity of the poor and the vulnerable to break out of the trap of poverty and distress. These social protection programmes are different from the ones we currently have which target protecting consumption against shocks or provide annuities conditional on intersectional vulnerabilities such as poverty and old age. While we need to improve and expand the existing programmes, we also need a new class of poverty trap-busting productive social protection programme.\nThe latest survey finds that the economic mood in the country took a reverse swing: 60 percent people responded positively to the question on the overall economic direction of the country in the August 2024 survey which dropped to 43 percent in the October survey. The overall mood went from a positive majority to a negative one. The economic mood in previous surveys was also mostly negative\u2014the positive economic outlook response was only 25 percent in 2022.\nOur data shows economic pressures and polycrisis have been growing especially since Covid. Food price inflation remains unabated. Real wages have been stagnant and unemployment and precarious employment have been on the rise. Almost half of the non-poor are vulnerable to falling into poverty as per the latest World Bank Bangladesh analysis. The White Paper Bangladesh 2024 reports based on the 2022 HIES simulation that an additional 20 million non-poor are at risk of joining the ranks of the poor if they fail to work for just two days a month.\nThe political upswing in mood however is on balance positive. The positive response to the political direction was 71 percent in the August 2024 survey, which declined to 56 percent in October. However, it is still positive. The persistence of the predominantly positive response to the political future of the country is in sharp contrast to what we find in earlier surveys. In 2022, only 39 percent responded positively to this question which reflects a negative political outlook mood on balance.\nThe reason for the positive political mood is obvious: the expectation of free and fair elections on the horizon. In Bangladesh, democracy has primarily been about electoral choice. That is what gives people hope. The lack of electoral choice had created a sense of despair, hopelessness, and being taken for granted. That is on the mend. Such political positivity can lead to mechanisms for consequential and deliberative democratic practices and culture.\nHowever, not all is well. Our analysis of optimism, when we combine the economic and political direction of the country, implies a downward trend. This is important because people, for the most part, don't think of the future as compartmentalised but form a general opinion based on multiple factors. In the August 2024 survey, we found that 68 percent were positive in both directions, which declined to 37 percent in the October 2024 survey. Conversely, combined pessimism is growing\u2014in August 2024, 13 percent of the respondents were doubly pessimistic, which now stands at double that figure.\nWe have a narrow window of opportunity. We need to do some real work to balance the political and the economic aspirations, both in terms of immediate macro matters and the everyday lives of the poor and the vulnerable. The dynamics are shifty and can go either way; we can try and stave off the increasing time pressure by taking urgent and direct steps to make a meaningful impact which will sustain the political optimism and allow the time needed for critical economic reforms.\nOne such impactful reform would be in the realm of social protection. The ultra-poor graduation programme that BRAC developed in 2002 which helped the poor break out of the poverty trap and increase their chances of sustained graduation out of poverty can be considered as a model. If we can design and launch a nationwide programme of productive social protection quickly and effectively, we may be able to take advantage of the narrow window I speak of. In turn, we can also innovate mechanisms of social accountability and partnership, as government-led programmes must, which can be replicated across other domains of public service delivery.\u00a0\nIf the focus is only on indirect approaches to tackling the microeconomic pain of the majority with macroeconomic adjustments and reform, however important they are, we risk further deepening of distress among the bottom half. If our vulnerable citizens fail to feel real relief and respite in their everyday economic lives quickly, the enduring political optimism may turn awry, creating increasing time pressure and narrowing opportunities for meaningful reforms. That would be a brutal betrayal of the courage and sacrifice of the many young people who gave their lives to create this chance to rebuild a different Bangladesh.\nLet's not squander this chance away.\nImran Matin is a development economist.

        "full_article": "In his victory speech following the US presidential election last month, President-elect Donald Trump began by thanking his supporters and highlighting the unwavering support of his family, especially his youngest son, Barron Trump. Barron, who stood by his father's side during the speech, was acknowledged as a source of strength throughout the campaign, particularly his silent role in shaping the podcast strategy for the Trump campaign during the election. Barron masterminded the well-crafted campaign's digital presence, utilising podcasts as a key platform to engage with tech-savvy voters, with his calm presence offering a softening contrast to the fiery rhetoric of the election. This draws an interesting parallel to developments in Bangladesh, and both offer a glimpse into a future where youth-driven values can guide the direction of politics and trade.\nThe argument that those belonging to Generation Z, or Gen Z, is too immature to take on higher roles, overtaking more experienced generations, overlooks the fact that maturity and leadership are not solely defined by age or years of experience, but by fresh perspectives and the ability to address current challenges. Rather than criticising Gen Z for stepping into leading roles, it is more productive to guide them through the complexities of the future. By fostering intergenerational collaboration, older generations can equip Gen Z with the tools they need to lead effectively in an ever-evolving global landscape, navigating the nuances of decision-making, diplomacy, and long-term strategy. For instance, Gen Z in Bangladesh must grasp the complexities of global trade, including the influence of major powers like the US, China, Russia and the EU, each with its own economic priorities and strategies.\nGen Z should keep in mind that the US cannot afford to overlook a partner like Bangladesh given the country's pivotal position in South Asia's economic landscape. Bangladesh's geopolitical location along the Bay of Bengal places it at the crossroads of vital maritime routes and in close proximity to other major players, including India and China. Supporting Bangladesh's economic stability aligns with the US Indo-Pacific Strategy, offering a counterbalance to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and reducing excessive reliance on Beijing in an increasingly contested region. By understanding these complexities, Gen Z leaders can advocate for policies that not only drive growth locally, but also position Bangladesh as a bridge between aforesaid larger powers. Likewise, they must actively participate in international forums, harnessing its geopolitical influence to negotiate better trade terms, attract foreign green investments, and secure support on critical climate issues, especially given Bangladesh's vulnerability.\nFor the US, missing out on Bangladesh as a partner would mean yielding influence in South Asia to China and Russia, potentially limiting its own access to the rapidly growing South Asian market and diminishing regional strategic foothold. Conversely, by leveraging the Indo-Pacific Strategy and EU Global Gateway together with the potential BRICS and ASEAN alignment, Bangladesh can pursue a more autonomous development path that safeguards its economic interests and strategic flexibility. This multi-aligned approach empowers Bangladesh to tap into a variety of global resources, strengthening its economy while asserting its role as a key player in the geopolitical and economic order of Asia.\nGen Z should recognise that Bangladesh's growing maturity opens new opportunities for deeper US engagement given a renewed Trump presidency. No longer just a partner for development assistance or low-cost manufacturing, Bangladesh is increasingly a sophisticated strategic ally ready to foster a forward-looking relationship based on mutual economic growth and matured strategic alignment. Expanding trade and investment in emerging sectors, supporting the diversification of Bangladesh's economy, and increasing trade preferences could not only secure US interests in Asia, but also ensure that Bangladesh remains resilient in a region of growing strategic significance.\nBangladesh's growing role as a soft power leader within the Muslim world is a significant asset that enhances its strategic appeal to the US, especially amid shifting global alliances. As the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, Bangladesh is well-positioned to influence and engage with other Muslim-majority nations with a rich history of promoting religious tolerance and social stability. This moderate stance of the country offers a model that can resonate in regions susceptible to extremism, making it a potentially valuable partner for the US in promoting win-win stability across the Muslim world. For the US, which has often struggled to engage with Muslim-majority countries in ways that align with both security interests and values, Bangladesh's leadership in the Muslim world offers a resourceful bridge.\nA second Trump administration would have an opportunity to engage with Bangladesh as it aims to establish more accountable governance free from the undue influence of neighbouring powers. Bangladesh is currently navigating complex challenges, including political reforms, economic stabilisation, and curbing external pressures. Recent steps taken by the interim government to introduce reforms in various crucial sectors signal a desire for a more transparent and autonomous leadership, making it an ideal time for the US to support Bangladesh's ambitions for a stable and sovereign future. Furthermore, by addressing the root causes of regional crises, such as border tensions, refugee pressures and political interference, Trump could advance a cooperative framework that supports Bangladesh's national sovereignty. Moreover, the Yunus effect for Bangladesh stands as a powerful equation linking the US and Bangladesh through shared values of economic development, entrepreneurship, and social responsibility.\nThe role of a well-informed Gen Z in shaping Bangladesh-US trade relations through a growing demand for stability, sovereignty, and sustainability will only strengthen them, positioning them as a key catalyst for transformative change in future global trade dynamics.\nDr Iftekhar Ul Karim\u00a0is assistant professor at BRAC Business School, BRAC University.
