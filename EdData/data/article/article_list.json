Ponmudy, leading to his losing his position in the Tamil Nadu Cabinet, is a rare instance of a serving Minister being found guilty of corruption when his own party is in power. Any verdict that punishes tainted public servants and dislodges them from office should be seen as salutary. In Ponmudy\u2019s case, one will have to await the outcome of his expected appeal in the Supreme Court, which will have to decide whether to uphold his acquittal by the trial court or its reversal by the Madras High Court. As of now, he and his wife have been given a sentence, suspended for 30 days, of three years in prison and a fine of \u20b950 lakh, for holding unexplained assets of \u20b91.72 crore. The case dates back to his stint in the DMK ministry from 2006-2011, and the investigation and prosecution were conducted under an All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam regime. Ponmudy is also under scrutiny by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing the money-laundering aspect of an accusation that he gave illegal licences to his son and relatives for red sand mining. He is the second Minister to lose his portfolio after V. Senthil Balaji, who is in jail in another money-laundering case.A key aspect of his appeal would be whether the court was right in reversing the trial judge\u2019s finding that Ponmudy and his wife P. Visalakshi should be treated as assessees independent of each other and that vigilance investigators erred in clubbing their incomes to demonstrate that their combined income and expenditure did not account for about 65% of the assets standing in their names. Justice G. Jayachandran has questioned the claim that Ms. Visalakshi had independent sources of business and agricultural income and criticised the trial judge for accepting belatedly filed tax returns containing \u201cbloated income\u201d. The judge\u2019s view that a mere income claim cannot be accepted without actual sales and profit figures for businesses run by her appears reasonable. He has upheld the prosecution\u2019s expert witnesses who assessed her agricultural income, based on cultivable land holdings, at a far lower level than the income she had claimed in her returns. For the ruling DMK, the conviction of one of its deputy general secretaries at a time when it is facing a barrage of corruption charges, is an undoubted political setback. The party will be hoping that Ponmudy gets relief from the Supreme Court in the form of a suspension of conviction to overcome his disqualification. However, a stay on conviction is quite rare in corruption cases. Involvement of senior leaders in corruption charges is certain to affect the public confidence in the DMK government.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\ncorruption & bribery\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)",

This year the Akademi has picked nine books of poems, six novels, five short stories, three essays and one literary study in Dogri, Gujarati, Kashmiri, Manipuri, Odia, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Assamese, Bodo, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Santali and others. It is a prize to be welcomed just for the sheer linguistic diversity it acknowledges in a country where there is a change in dialect every few square kilometres, and no dearth of marginalised communities or languages facing extinction. The possibilities are immense: in a country where not everyone has the ability to whip up a PR frenzy, a Sahitya Akademi award is encouragement to keep pursuing the craft; writers can expect to see a rise in sales and be taught in schools and universities; and readers can hope to discover some hidden gems. Writers also have the opportunity to be translated into other regional languages, and into English too. Neelum Saran Gour, who has won this year for her English novel, Requiem in Raga Janki, which had also bagged The Hindu Fiction Prize in 2018, can look forward to her story being translated into other Indian languages.However, it is a pity that the Sahitya Akademi awards, first conferred in 1955, do not have top-of-the-mind recall such as the Booker Prize or the Pulitzer. The National Academy of Letters was established in 1954 and its stated goal was to be \u201cthe central institution for literary dialogue, publication and promotion in the country and the only institution that undertakes literary activities in 24 Indian languages, including English\u201d. To that end, the Sahitya Akademi does hold lectures, readings, discussions, exchange programmes, and workshops, including all communities, but it is so woefully promoted that few get to know of the programmes. Though the Sahitya Akademi award is the pinnacle, there are other awards such as the Bal Sahitya award, the Yuva Puraskar and the Bhasha Samman or translation prize. But not enough is being done to promote its activities. The Akademi\u2019s website is not updated and is bristling with grammatical errors; its social media presence is abysmal. It has brought out thousands of books, but the fact is that the publications, though affordable, are hard to come by. At a time when children particularly are glued to screens and losing their reading habits, the Sahitya Akademi with its extensive network should do more to spread the word about India\u2019s rich literary tradition.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\naward and prize\n\n/\n\nbooks and literature\n\n/\n\npoetry\n\n/\n\nessays\n\n/\n\nGujarat\n\n/\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\nOrissa\n\n/\n\nPunjab\n\n/\n\nRajasthan\n\n/\n\nSanskrit\n\n/\n\nAssam\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\nTelugu\n\n/\n\nMalayalam\n\n/\n\nKannada\n\n/\n\nschool\n\n/\n\nuniversity\n\n/\n\nfiction\n\n/\n\nmedia\n\n/\n\nIndia",

Problems arise and the relationship ends. Can the man be accused of rape?\n\nOld law\u00a0| Section 375 of the now erstwhile Indian Penal Code defined rape as sexual acts by a man with a woman without her consent, and under Section 90 of the Code, consent given under a misconception of fact is not considered valid. Therefore, at a simplistic level, if the woman was under the impression that the relationship would culminate in marriage, it would be possible to bring a rape charge, and indeed, that has happened on several occasions.\nSocial realities\u00a0| Before delving into the injustice of it, it would be useful to keep in mind that while there are liberal pockets in the country where it is common to engage in sex before marriage, for a vast majority, the two are still linked, though that link may be weakening. In the desire to prevent rape laws being used vindictively, we ought not to lose sight of the fact that for many vulnerable young women, their \u201cconsent\u201d as it were, is predicated solely on the promise of marriage, and all the security and safety that it offers.\nRead full opinion on TOI+\n\n",

        "full_article": "Imagine our bodies are orchestras. Our brain is the conductor. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the string section, connected through all our senses and other inputs that keep our bodies humming. Periphery: How Your Nervous System Predicts And Protects Against Disease by Moses V Chaoshows that this periphery is actually front and centre in the body\u2019s functioning.\nPNS is an elaborate set of networks outside the brain and spinal cord. It detects smell, touch, sound, and sends information about the environment to the rest of the body.\nThe gut-brain axis depends on this spider web of sensory neurons that run up and down the digestive tract. It monitors the environment incessantly. The gut has a mind of its own, a \u2018brain in the bowel\u2019. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves extend to the skin and all our organs, with a continuous crosstalk across systems.\nPNS detects a sensation, say of heat, and transmits messages to the central nervous system which says, \u2018pull that hand away\u2019. The endocrine system kicks in, producing cortisol, raising glucose levels and stimulating the gut and heart, producing the fight or flight response of stress.Brain diseases also start in the gut and periphery, the book suggests. Microbiota genes allow bacteria to produce neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and so on, used by the gut as signals. There are an untold number of interactions between gut microbes and immune cells; the immune system is indeed the \u2018seventh sense\u2019.\nWhen inflammation alters bacterial composition in the gut, diseases like Parkinson\u2019s often follow. Parkinson\u2019s is seen as a brain disorder that later affects the peripheral system, but its giveaway signs like constipation and sleeping difficulties start a decade prior to symptoms like tremors and stiffness.\nOther conditions like familial dysautonomia \u2013 the inability to regulate tears, sweat and blood pressure \u2013 and syncope, or fainting, are also linked to malfunctions in the autonomic, motor and sensory neurons. The periphery, specially related to the sense of touch, can explain problems of autism.\nMicrobiota in the gut-immune system can directly influence pain-sensing neurons too. Glia \u2013 the non-nerve cells of the brain and nervous system that touch and support neurons \u2013 play an important role in brain disease too.\nThe good news is that the peripheral nervous system can repair and regenerate. The ability to change and respond to the environment is called plasticity, and like the brain, the periphery is also capable of remodelling. Skin, taste buds and the olfactory apparatus undergo a great deal of turnover through a lifetime. Novel experiences and sensory associations can strengthen connections in the nervous system, through neurotrophins. Another way to affect plasticity is through physical exercise. Dance, for instance, is not just for the body and senses, it improves cognition, memory and social interactions.\nThe periphery holds the answers in reversing age-related declines in plasticity, the book claims. Along with genetics and the environment, sensory neurons can increase or decrease lifespan, and this should be the focus of ageing-related research. Longevity has been a basic mystery in the life sciences \u2013 why and how do neurons retain longevity? This is the gap in knowledge, the question that neurobiology needs to crack. Like the discovery of DNA structure unified the field of genetics, this understanding will establish why the peripheral nerve network is vital to our thriving.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) service that was introduced in 2013 intended to give commuters respite in terms of both safe travel and a convenient, time saving means of transportation. The service that involved a cost of Tk 6.5 billion was unveiled back in 2009. It has had its hiccups over implementation but there is no denying that there exists massive demand for modern commuter services such as this one in the rapidly urbanising landscape in and around major cities such as the capital city Dhaka. Millions of people are literally forced to stay within the city limits at great cost to personal expenditure and downgraded living conditions -- all in a vain attempt to be able to reach the workplace on time. One of the primary reasons why a service such as DEMU had been envisaged was to emulate the experiences of major urban centers in Asia where millions of people commute to the capital city for work, and then leave the city for the suburbs they call home.Sadly, this particular service has been left to rot intentionally. Bangladesh Railway (BR) has actually reduced commuter trains over the period despite the overwhelming demand for more train services than less. It would appear that public needs and demand are not a priority issue in the overall gamut of things BR considers important. Today, BR operates 88 low-capacity commuter trains in eastern and western zones. Of these, 52 out of 78 trains in the western zones provide dedicated commuter services connecting urban centers. It seems ironic that the railway authorities would pull the plug on six routes including Chattogram University, Chattogram-Kaliakoir and Dhaka-Naraynganj route at a time when BR has been active in acquiring several hundred new coaches over the past decade. None of these new carriages have been allocated to DEMU, which is designated as \"second-class rail category\" by BR. What exactly does that mean?All around the world, railway has been deemed as an affordable and convenient means to move large numbers of people and cargo. One needs to look no further than Kolkata in West Bengal to see how commuter trains facilitate the movement of hundreds of thousands of people who come to the city to work and then leave it to go home beyond the main city center. Such a service has allowed that city to be able to prosper as public utility services were able to handle the demands of rapid urbanisation better. The idea being to allow the non-urban populace to continue enjoying a more affordable life by living in suburbs (or beyond for that matter) and only come to the city for employment, not as a permanent abode.These lessons have not been learnt by BR and that would probably explain why sufficient number of coaches have not been added over a decade, rather continue to degrade and its services curtailed. For instance, there is no dedicated seating space for women who continue to face both discrimination and harassment on a daily basis. Experts are of the opinion that the railway sector is completely missing the urban development focus in Bangladesh, even though its importance is growing rapidly in most developing countries. Questions have been raised by BR about the quality of carriages that were supplied under the DEMU programme, but that hardly absolves the service of not taking corrective action against carriage suppliers as vast amounts of public money was involved in the project. Nor does it absolve BR of abysmal quality of service it is providing to commuters who need and demand its expansion and not contraction.",

        "full_article": "The country's foreign exchange reserve has become a matter of grave concern for the last two years due to its rapid depletion. The rise in the cost of imports, coupled with a lower inflow of foreign earnings as well as growing pressure to repay external debt, pushed the prices of foreign exchanges and ultimately started to exhaust the foreign currency reserve. The gross outstanding amount of foreign exchange reserves was $46.39 billion at the end of the fiscal year 2020-21 (FY21), which came down to $41.82 billion at the end of FY22. It further declined to $31.20 billion at the end of FY23. At the end of the fifth month (or November) of the current fiscal year (FY24), it dropped to $24.90 billion. However, these figures are somewhat deceptive and do not explain the situation adequately. The net amount of foreign exchange reserves provides a more accurate picture. To inflate the figure of foreign exchange reserve, Bangladesh Bank so far avoided the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-guided calculation method. The method, designed in the IMF's sixth version of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), is followed by most countries and is recognised as the international standard for calculating the foreign exchange reserve.The intervention from the IMF finally compelled the central bank to calculate the foreign exchange reserve position following the BPM6, besides the gross estimate. The international financial institution imposed reform conditions as the country sought IMF assistance to support the BoP. Calculating the forex reserve as per BPM6 and releasing the figure is one of the conditions. The central bank also agreed to follow the BPM6 besides its practice of gross reserve calculation. There was, however, some reluctance to release the data as it would unveil the discrepancies between inflated and actual reserve. Finally, the central bank has started to release the data of net forex reserve from June last. It showed that net reserve stood at $24.75 billion at the end of last fiscal year, which reached $19.30 billion at the end of November last. Thus, the reserve calculated following the BPM6 is lower by around $6 billion on average than the gross reserve. The BPM6 was introduced in 2009. Bangladesh Bank also claimed that it had followed the guidelines for calculating the country's overall Balance of Payments (BoP) since 2013. It was made clear by he central bank's latest annual statistical report regarding BoP, titled 'Bangladesh Balance Of Payments: 2022-23'. It also mentioned: \"Data on international reserves comprise of monetary gold, SDR, reserve position in the Fund and foreign exchange which are collected from the internal records of the Bangladesh Bank and IMF. Transactions of gold, SDR and foreign exchange of Bangladesh Bank, transactions in the reserve position in the IMF are reflected in the reserve assets.\"Thus, international reserves (or reserve assets in the balance of payments) are those external assets readily available to and controlled by a country's monetary authorities. According to IMF, international reserves usually comprise foreign currencies, other assets denominated in foreign currencies, gold reserves, special drawing rights (SDRs) and IMF reserve positions. These reserves may be used to finance international payment imbalances, directly or indirectly regulate the magnitude of such imbalances via intervention in foreign exchange markets to affect the exchange rate of the country's currency. A narrower definition for international reserves only includes foreign currency deposits and bonds. These assets held by the country's monetary authorities are usually denominated in different reserve currencies. Currently, around 60 per cent of the global foreign exchange reserve is US Dollar, followed by Euro (20 per cent), Japanese yen (5.40 per cent), British pound (4.80 per cent), and Chinese renminbi (2.45 per cent).To be precise, foreign exchange reserve is a component of the BoP, a memorandum item. If the central bank started to follow the BPM6 in FY13, how could it have skipped the IMF-designed method of calculating the forex reserve? Statistics available with Bangladesh Bank showed that the outstanding amount of foreign exchange reserve jumped by around 48 per cent to $15.31 billion in FY13 from $10.36 billion in FY12. It was the biggest jump in forex reserve during the last one and a half decades. In other words, when there is a manipulation in calculating the reserve to inflate its figure artificially, it has put the authenticity of the overall BoP under question. By ignoring the latest method on forex reserve calculation, the central bank generated the reserve's misguiding figure. That's why the government remained indifferent when the reserve started to deplete, claiming that there was nothing to worry although the reality is different. In its latest assessment of Bangladesh's economy, the IMF said: \"Bangladesh continues to face challenges amidst persistent external pressures. Continued global monetary tightening and elevated global commodity prices, coupled with existing vulnerabilities, have kept the Taka and FX reserves under pressure and increased the cost of living.\" [ IMF Country Report No. 23/409]. The report was published in the second week of this month, immediately before the release of $689 million in the second tranche of the $4.7 billion loan package of the fund allocated for Bangladesh. The loan is helpful to ease some pressure on the exchange rate as well as the forex reserve.So far, policymakers have used some import-restrictive measures to ease the pressure on foreign exchange reserves, which also paid off to some extent. For instance, overall import payments were reduced by around 20 per cent in the first four months of the current fiscal year. As earnings from exports increased by 3.61 per cent in the same period, the merchandise trade deficit with the rest of the world decreased to $3.80 billion in July-October of the current year from $9.62 billion in the same period of last year. Nevertheless, curbing imports is a temporary step to offset the depletion of international reserves. The country has no alternative but to gradually enhance the foreign exchange reserve to back up future international repayment obligations. Obviously, it will take some time as there is no quick fix.  [email\u00a0protected]",

When it became an independent country after a nine-month long battle, hope was high that economic equality in society, which was one of the prime objectives of our grand liberation war, would be ensured. People from all walks of life had expected that men who would govern the country would help create an honest, sincere and patriotic political class. Serving the people rising above self-interest will be the mission and vision of the members of this class. Alas, after 52 years, people see an altogether different picture when they go through the wealth statements submitted by the candidates of the upcoming parliamentary polls.According to the relevant rules, all candidates have to submit an affidavit on their wealth along with their respective nomination papers.Many of these affidavits have become the talk of the town in the last couple of days as those project how the size of personal wealth of some of the country's lawmakers as well as ministers has grown abnormally.Over the last decade or so, high food prices made the life of commoners miserable. But the person who steered the food ministry during that time had prospered in terms of their personal wealth.According to the wealth statement presented in the affidavit, the wealth of a state minister rose by a whopping 98 times in the last 15 years and the growth rate is 40 per cent per year.A young state minister who first contested for the parliamentary election in 2008, had submitted a wealth statement declaring a bank balance of TK 20,000 only. In his latest affidavit he has shown a bank balance of TK 47 million.These affidavits also show that the wealth of a full minister rose by 11 per cent and that the wealth of a globe-trotting state minister swelled to TK 890 million from 20 million that he had shown in his earlier affidavit.It reminds many of the famous quote by Mahatma Gandhi who said, there are enough resources to meet human need but not enough to meet human greed. Making money is essential for livelihood but the question is how much, and through what means?When wealth of a sitting minister rises disproportionately it raises various questions in the minds of the people. Not long ago, politicians in our society were revered for honesty in terms of their financial dealings. Politicians like Gandhi, Neheru, Malians Abul Kalam Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Bangabandhu were highly dedicated to their pro-people political ideology and they had never been interested in acquiring wealth. Even many of them could not do justice to their family members by failing to provide them with sufficient resources to lead a comfortable life. Because they entered politics to sacrifice their lives for the well being of their party as well as for their people. To them, politics was a full-time job. Amassing wealth through political clout was seen as an immoral act in society.Moreover, in many democracies, conflict of interests are consciously avoided while appointing ministers or even parliamentary committee members.Involvement of business people in politics is not a new phenomenon in the present-day world. But it is expected that a person involved in shipping business should not be included even in the parliamentary committees related to shipping business to avoid conflict of interests.Unfortunately, in our democracy breaches of such norms are evident.People expect that whoever forms the government after the upcoming election, should select the cabinet members with people of clean track record.[email\u00a0protected]",
