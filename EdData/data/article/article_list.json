Ahead of the mela, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and their cabinet colleagues had touted the special arrangements made for the mela, including a surveillance system equipped with artificial intelligence to track crowds, water filters to keep the rivers clean, a makeshift town replete with hospitals and special-purpose trains and buses. But they have not sufficed. There have been numerous reports of people being frustrated at the venue and during journeys to and from there. The mela\u2019s under-management, simmering just below the surface, was transformed to outright mismanagement by the deaths of people in a crowd crush on January 29, 2025. The confused response by the Indian Railways to another crush at the New Delhi railway station, on February 15, 2025, indicated the Centre\u2019s unwillingness to countenance the disaster, on the back of an expense of \u20b97,500 crore for the mela and its various hi-tech preparations. Such preparations, however, cannot make up for changes that need to be made over time, such as redeveloping a local railway station.Officials were reluctant to confirm that people had died even as local hospitals were confirming deaths. In one particularly unfair statement, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) blamed \u201cunnecessary\u201d rush at the New Delhi railway station for the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. The consensus among fire safety experts worldwide is that such events occur when there is external cause for a group to panic, whether lacking the money to buy another ticket should they miss a train or suffering injuries due to unsafe pedestrian conditions. A preliminary probe revealed that the Railways had sold 2,600 additional tickets, and an announcement at the station of the arrival of a different train rendered this confused mass of passengers to attempt to reach the wrong platform. The Railways has now said that special trains for the mela will depart from one fixed platform at the station. Such interventions that are already well known to experts \u2014 including clear, multilingual communications, restricted ticketing, and proactive crowd control \u2014 could have mitigated the tragedy. Many less prominent gathering places still lack attention vis-\u00e0-vis public safety. Both the Centre and States should eliminate these risks, post-haste, if the Centre\u2019s plans to increase footfall at places of worship are not to lead to more catastrophe. While encouraging spiritual tourism, the hype around hosting 45 crore people at the Maha Kumbh Mela, absurdly impossible as it sounds, should be toned down so as not to feed a political frenzy. The governments must be careful that the cost of fulfilling political aspirations is not paid for in terms of human lives.

        "full_article": "In a cricket calendar packed with international fixtures and domestic T20 leagues, the ICC Champions Trophy has managed to endure. The ODI and T20 World Cups, along with the ICC World Test Championship, remain the marquee global events, and the Champions Trophy once seemed expendable. However, the desire for an ICC-branded tournament almost every year, coupled with its commercial appeal, has ensured its survival. Now, the ninth edition kicks off in Karachi on Wednesday (February 19, 2025), with host Pakistan facing New Zealand. The tournament, however, was nearly derailed by the ever-present political tensions between India and Pakistan. India initially refused to tour Pakistan, jeopardising the event, but a compromise was reached: India\u2019s matches will be played in Dubai. Rohit Sharma\u2019s men will play all their Group A fixtures in the UAE, and if they reach the final, the title clash will also be held there. Once again, a global cricket tournament has been tainted by geopolitical disputes, an issue that will persist until India\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s leaderships arrive at a broader consensus, including on sports. India begins its campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday.After a disappointing 1-3 Test series loss in Australia, India is seeking redemption in the Champions Trophy through the ODI format. A recent 3-0 home sweep against England provided momentum, but the real challenge awaits India under the West Asian skies. Rohit, under scrutiny for his form, found some respite with a century against England, but he and his team will need to deliver more to get to the end stage of the tournament. Beating Pakistan, technically the tournament host, at a neutral venue, will add some drama to the political intrigue. The absence of injured pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will be felt, though Mohammed Shami\u2019s return offers some relief. Adding to the emotional weight of this tournament is the possibility that it could be the final ICC event for Rohit, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja. Having won the ICC T20 World Cup last year, India is determined to reclaim the Champions Trophy, last won in 2013. Beyond India-Pakistan intrigue, Australia remains a strong contender, despite missing its pace-bowling trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood. Meanwhile, the absence of West Indies and Sri Lanka from the tournament is another indicator of the shifting balance in international cricket.\r Published - February 18, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        cricket\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pakistan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        ICC Test Championship\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        ICC World Cup\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Twenty20 World Cup\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        champions-trophy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        New Zealand\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        United Arab Emirates\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bangladesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Australia\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Sri Lanka",

        "full_article": "By Andrea Revell\nWhy is there so much darkness in the world? This is a question we all ponder at some time in our lives, particularly when we are going through difficulties or challenges.\nThe Taoist concept of paradoxical unity can be helpful. To Taoists, everything is on a yin-yang continuum; light and dark, good and bad.\nWe can only understand something to be light because we have the dark, the two poles define each other \u2013 there is a paradoxical unity because they are really just two sides of the same coin.\nThe goal of life to Taoists is to get to a place where we transcend dualistic judgments and see the unity.\nThe yin-yang symbol encompasses natural harmony and is wonderful for many reasons. First, the dividing line is flowing, to symbolise the fact that opposites are continually waxing and waning in the natural harmony and rhythm of life.\nThis is why rigidly attempting to adhere to one or other of the poles doesn\u2019t work; the Tao is all about finding the balance between the two. Second, the seed of the yang is contained within the yin, and vice versa.\n\nThis is how they transform each other, because in the darkness just a flash of light will be illuminating, and similarly a pinprick of darkness will be enough to dim the light.\nIn the case of suffering and happiness, the seed of happiness is in suffering; because happiness comes when you have learnt something amazing from challenges. Similarly, the seed of suffering is in happiness, because we only have to think of losing our happiness to feel suffering.\nYou can do this thought process with all continuums. The victim/oppressor continuum is a classic and is why victims of abuse often become the abusers and vice versa. To break out of that pattern one has to see it as a continuum of disempowerment/ empowerment.\nThe seed of empowerment is there in the disempowering situation; if you can find your inner strength just when everything in life seems to be against you \u2013 when you are a \u2018victim\u2019 \u2013 then you are no longer the one and have empowered yourself. And when you are feeling empowered, you only have to see yourself as disempowered for a second to slip back into victimhood.\nThis is why Nelson Mandela was never a victim. While in prison, he empowered himself through compassion for his persecutors because he knew it was they who were the ones who were truly suffering, not him. He had transcended the duality of victim/oppressor, and they hadn\u2019t, and he knew they would continue to suffer until they broke out of it.\nThe beauty of the story is that in the end, Mandela\u2019s tormentors were so taken aback by his loving heart that they refused to torture him any longer.\nHis prison guard Christi Brand became his lifelong friend. So yes, it\u2019s our choice whether we suffer, whether we see ourselves as victims or mighty oaks. Which one do you choose?\n\n",

        "full_article": "In world\u2019s most populous country, managing people should be an everyday priority\nThe negligence that triggered the stampede at New Delhi railway station \u2013 from pile-up to switching of platforms \u2013 remained stark over 48 hours later. Yet, platform crushes are just one cog in the wheel of mismanagement. Two points here. As with most of everything, it starts with policy. And two, stampede-like situations are a terrifying everyday phenomenon. We\u2019re the world\u2019s most populous country. This makes \u2018crowd management\u2019 not a \u2018special task\u2019, but a constant that needs to be incorporated in every design \u2013 especially in commuting.\nParallel tracks | First, policy. We\u2019ve been witnessing absolute mayhem on trains around festivals. Dynamic pricing, where fares shoot up with demand, becomes a major pain point for masses ahead of group travel \u2013 home for Chhath or Diwali and now pilgrimage to Kumbh.\nUP govt has been advertising the millions expected in Prayagraj. Railways could surely have kept in abeyance dynamic pricing for this 45-day period. Price-sensitive travellers have no option but to travel by general coaches. Even when numbers of general coaches are increased, they run beyond capacity because there\u2019s no knowing how many general tickets were sold \u2013 unreserved tickets are sold by destination, not train number. It\u2019s like a pack of cards set up to collapse.\nLosing track | It\u2019s amazing there\u2019s still no mechanism to monitor and control the sale of general tickets. It is how 2,600 tickets were sold in a span of 2 hours. Railways brass is presumably none the wiser. A contributing factor is also that railways had reportedly done away with trains with only general coaches \u2013 because they\u2019re inefficient.

        "full_article": "We are concerned about the increase in robberies and muggings on the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway over the last six months or so. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0citing frequent travellers of this route, there have been more than 100 incidents of robberies and muggings at different spots of the 462-kilometre highway during this period.\nAccounts from victims, police officers, and bus and private car drivers suggest that such criminal activities have noticeably gone up, even though the number of robbery cases filed with police stations along the route may not reflect it.\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0found only 19 related cases filed with three police stations in Narayanganj, one of the districts connecting this important highway. Per these cases, the frequency of mugging and robbery is high in at least 17 spots of the district. Cumilla and Chattogram also have several highly mugging-prone spots. However, victims often don't want to file cases because police cannot generally recover stolen valuables. Instead, many end up being harassed and having to go through trial-related hassles. In most cases, however, police only file a general diary.\nIn recent times, expatriate Bangladeshis have been frequently targeted by muggers and robbers, who often commit the crime when vehicles slow down or get stuck in one place for too long because of traffic, which is a regular phenomenon in the Narayanganj section of the highway. According to police, people don't want to file cases of highway robberies as they tend to move to a safer place quickly afterwards. Even when they do report and police arrest the perpetrators, the latter manage to get bail and resume their criminal activities.\nOur highways are already notorious for the high number of road crashes that occur there. Added to that is the menace of robbery and mugging, not to mention rampant extortion. These crimes don't just affect individuals; cargo vehicles have also come under attack. We, therefore, urge the authorities to take effective measures to make our highways safe. Increasing patrols, raising awareness, and addressing the reasons behind long gridlocks on the highways are some of the measures that can be employed. On the legal front, making reporting of highway crimes easy and ensuring that perpetrators cannot go scot-free after arrests will also help reduce the incidence of mugging and robbery. Transport associations should also cooperate with the authorities to prevent highway criminal gangs. Passengers should be able to travel without the fear of losing their lives and possessions.\n",

        "full_article": "The words \"unpredictable\" and \"rivalry\" come up when fans describe the English Premier League (EPL). These are two essential components that make the EPL the biggest and most watched football league in the world. When you combine these two with football, you get emotions\u2014raw, uncharted, unregulated, and limitless outpourings of emotion. Some positive, some negative, but that is what the beautiful game exudes. When you take that away, what you are left with is a product that does not move you or you no longer resonate with. The emotions of sports are what make it unique.\nThink about some of the most iconic moments in sports\u2014Andr\u00e9s Iniesta's tribute to Dani Jarque after scoring the winning goal in the FIFA World Cup 2010, Lionel Messi cupping his ears to the Dutch bench in 2022, Cristiano's tears of joy in Euro 2016 or tears of agony in 2008, LeBron's collapse after delivering Cleveland's first title in 52 years, Djokovic ripping his shirt off in celebration after battling Nadal for six hours, or Nadal and Federer's hands intertwined as the latter bid farewell to his sport. What common elements do all these great moments have? Emotions\u2014both good and bad, the unseen burden borne by these athletes, something none of us can truly imagine without walking in their shoes. This is what constructs sports\u2014the passion, the sentiment, and the loose, animalistic side that athletes must possess to become champions. But somehow, in 2025, we have reached a point where we simply cannot allow players to exist in a space of emotion. We expect our athletes to be robots, to bottle up all their feelings and carry on without any reaction.\nSince 2023, the Premier League has been policing emotions, using \"dissent\" as the catchword. Kick a ball in frustration, you will immediately be punished. React loudly, and there's a yellow card. If you scream a profanity, you will see the darker shade coming out of the back pocket of the referee. It is understandable to remind players that surrounding a referee after a foul and demanding a card to be shown or withdrawn can sometimes cross the line from emotion to intimidation. But somehow, we have arrived at a point where rationality and subjective evaluation of a reaction have left the building. Any player, no matter how minimal their reaction, will be punished. Managers on the touchline are continuously penalised for reacting. If they leave their box, they risk being told to leave the field altogether. There is just too much policing going on. Whether it's match officials or Gary Neville giving his two cents on how Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es celebrating in Haaland's face is disrespectful, or Iliman Ndiaye being booked for his seagull celebration, we are now well past rational regulation. Overt regulations kill the joy, and in turn they take away the excitement of sports.\nEarlier last week, the Premier League announced that they would now be monitoring player celebrations to see whether they are damaging the reputation of the game or inflaming opposition fans or players. Tony Scholes\u2014the Premier League's chief, believes that once celebrations cross the line and turn to mockery or criticism, they should be punished. But who judges that? The referees who are already under condemnation for blatant bias?\u00a0 Or the Premier League itself, which many claim punishes some more than others? In an ideal world, situations would be dealt with subjectively, but subjectivity in football simply opens the door for favouritism, and this has been laid out in front of us over the past three years.\nHowever, perhaps the real question we should be asking is, what triggered this whole conversation in the first place?\nFrom the sound of it, you would think that this discussion began because a player made an offensive or derogatory celebration mocking a special characteristic of a person or team. But, no. It was Myles Lewis-Skelly, the 18-year-old Arsenal player, copying Erling Haaland's meditation celebration after scoring his first goal for the senior team.\nFor years, players in the Premier League have brought out celebrations mocking their opposition. In recent years, Jamie Vardy's bird celebration against Crystal Palace was compiled into the Premier League's own \"best celebration\" video, Neal Maupay mimicked James Maddison's darts celebration, Andros Townsend did the \"siu\" against Manchester United, Suarez dived in front of David Moyes. There is an abundance of examples. Yet, what seems to be the last straw is an 18-year-old player copying the celebration of Haaland\u2014who just a few months back asked Myles, \"who the f\u2014are you?\" when the latter stepped in to stop a commotion between Haaland and Gabriel.\nThe critics, such as Jamie Carragher and Graham Souness, argue that it's too early for Myles to start mimicking more experienced players. \u00a0Because, yes, Neal Maupay is definitely more experienced than James Maddison, and Andros Townsend is miles ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, right? This is an absurd comment and in many ways highlights the stark differences of how young black players are treated compared to white players, even if they are English. Phil Foden actually does a \"gun\" celebration that many find offensive and that sends the wrong message. Yet, he has never been subjected to any criticism, let alone criticism of this magnitude. Is it the club Myles plays for? Is it his confidence that they don't want to see in a youngster? Whatever it is, you really have to question the underlying theme of racism that black players are subjected to more often than their white counterparts. The constant and harsher criticism has taken out too many stars; do not let Myles be another victim.\nBring back the 2000s; fans do not want to see robots. They want to see a human being giving their all and then reacting to their shortcomings or their unexpected triumphs. They want managers to show passion on the touchline\u2014Wenger and Mourinho did not sell papers or draw eyes to their duels by sitting peacefully on the bench and shaking their hands at the end of the match. No, it's the tie tugging, the heated words, the press conference jabs, that made fans pile in through the gates or pay 25 quid a month to watch these two go at each other. Rivalries thrive on emotions, which showcase the individuality of each player. Personalities are what make them unique and draw fans into the game. Don't stop them now\u2014the Premier League needs these moments to continue being the greatest league in the world.\nRaiyan Binte Rafiq is a sports columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global challenge threatening both human and animal health, with its impacts reverberating across ecosystems and economies. But nowhere is this issue more acute than in low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, where widespread misuse of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming exacerbates AMR risks. Addressing this crisis demands innovative approaches rooted in sustainability and equity. Circular economy, a model focused on resource efficiency, waste reduction, and systemic integration, offers a promising path forward in this regard. When paired with the One Health framework\u2014a multidisciplinary approach that unites human, animal, and environmental health\u2014circular economy principles can transform the livestock sector, fostering resilience against AMR.\nAMR arises when microorganisms develop resistance to antibiotics, rendering treatments ineffective. In Bangladesh, unregulated use of antibiotics in animal farming is a key driver. Antibiotics are often used prophylactically, compensating for unsanitary living conditions and poor farm management practices. The consequences extend beyond farm boundaries, threatening public health, food security, and economic stability.\nIn 2024, I proposed a framework that underscores the critical role of sustainable practices in tackling AMR in the animal health sector. The framework identifies how systemic changes, including better access to veterinary care, improved farm management, and reduced reliance on antibiotics, can disrupt the pathways that drive AMR.\nIntegrating the circular economy model into animal health systems offers a proactive strategy to mitigate AMR. This approach prioritises resource optimisation, minimises waste, and promotes sustainable farming practices. For instance, circular economy principles can guide the development of antimicrobial resistance mitigation toolkits (ARMTs), focusing on preventive health management and judicious antibiotic use.\nBuilding on my proposed framework, ARMTs are designed with farmers in mind. By incorporating advanced technologies, precision agriculture, and community feedback, these toolkits can significantly reduce antibiotic dependency while enhancing farm productivity. Moreover, circular economy encourages recycling of agricultural waste into bio-based products, further reducing environmental contamination, a critical factor in AMR management.\nThe One Health approach complements circular economy by addressing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. In tackling zoonotic diseases, which often serve as conduits for AMR, One Health advocates for upstream surveillance and early interventions. This holistic perspective ensures that solutions consider all facets of health and sustainability, reinforcing the structural integrity of farming systems.\nApplying One Health principles alongside circular economy practices can empower local communities. Through education and capacity-building initiatives, farmers and rural practitioners can adopt safer, more sustainable practices. Equally important is the role of policy advocacy, ensuring that these practices are institutionalised for long-term impact.\nTransitioning to circular economy and One Health systems offers significant economic advantages. Reduced reliance on antibiotics can lower costs, improve animal health, and enhance productivity. These changes directly benefit rural economies, where livestock farming is a critical livelihood source.\nFurthermore, this transition supports gender equity. Women, who often play key roles in small-scale farming, stand to benefit from training and empowerment initiatives. By involving women in decision-making processes, we can foster inclusive growth and amplify the societal impact of these interventions.\u00a0\nAMR is a crisis demanding global cooperation and local action. Bangladesh's experiences provide valuable lessons for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Integrating circular economy and One Health principles into animal health systems offers a replicable model for sustainable development.\nTo succeed, collaboration among stakeholders is essential. As I argued in my proposed framework, partnerships between universities, policymakers, industry, and farming communities can drive sustainable transformations. In doing so, we can create resilient farming systems that protect not only animal and human health, but also the planet's ecological balance.\nAs we look to the future, the message is clear: the fight against AMR requires bold, innovative strategies. By embracing circular economy and One Health, we can turn the tide, ensuring healthier lives for generations to come.\nDr Krishnendu Saha is associate professor of circular economy at Birmingham City University, UK.\u00a0\nThis article is derived from the author's article published in Business Strategy and the Environment, a prestigious journal on sustainable business.\u00a0\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.
