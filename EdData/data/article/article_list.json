The severe economic crisis, which set off indefinite protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, (now former) Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, has pitchforked Mr. Wickremesinghe to an office that he had no chance of occupying until last week. Given the turmoil, Sri Lanka needed a government that would work towards stability and economic recovery. With Mahinda Rajapaksa resigning in the face of determined protests, and the Opposition leader unwilling to work under President Gotabaya, a rare opportunity opened up for Mr. Wickremesinghe. The former premier\u2019s political prospects had almost ended with the 2020 parliamentary election, when his United National Party won no seats, and he himself made it as its lone member in Parliament on the principle of representation in proportion to the total votes it had received across the nation. Much of the UNP\u2019s support base has also gone with Sajith Premadasa, his erstwhile party colleague, who now runs the main Opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). Mr. Wickremesinghe finds himself in an extraordinary situation, as he is dependent on lawmakers of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party of the Rajapaksas that is the target of public anger. The SJB has offered conditional support to measures aimed at economic recovery.Mr. Wickremesinghe brushed aside a question on whether he had the moral authority to hold his office, contending that his situation was no different from that of Winston Churchill becoming PM with just four members supporting him to stave off a crisis. There are many questions on the political morality of his assuming office; there is some justification for popular resentment against him for easing the pressure on the President to resign. However, the need to have a viable arrangement to tackle the economic crisis is quite urgent. He has spoken about putting together an international consortium to ensure financial assistance for the shortage-stricken country. His only strength now is the goodwill of the international community, which solidly backed his efforts to bring about peace and development in Sri Lanka in 2001-02, when he negotiated a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE and held direct talks. There is talk of speeding up political reforms, even to the point of abolishing the executive presidency through a fast-tracked constitutional amendment. Yet, such speculation about far-reaching changes does not inspire confidence, as many such opportunities in the past had been squandered. Mr. Wickremesinghe has the additional burden of proving to his detractors that he is working for political stability and economic recovery and not for reviving the political fortunes of the Rajapaksas.",

India has always had iconic athletes with their fabulous milestones, but when it comes to team success in global events, the examples dwindle. To that limited cupboard displaying Olympic gold winning hockey squads featuring Dhyan Chand, the triumphant 1975 World Cup hockey team, the victorious 1983 cricket World Cup outfit led by Kapil Dev and the 2011 champion unit under M.S. Dhoni, Indian badminton added its golden chapter when the men\u2019s team won the Thomas Cup at Bangkok on Sunday. This was a feather touch that would be felt all through India\u2019s sporting history. Besides winning its maiden title, India also stunned fancied opponents Malaysia and Denmark, and defeated 14-time champion Indonesia in the summit clash. Previously, Indian badminton had offered sporadic joy starting from Prakash Padukone\u2019s magnificent All England victory in 1980. P. Gopichand emulated Padukone in 2001 and just as another drought loomed, first Saina Nehwal and then P.V. Sindhu proved that they could do far better than their male counterparts, winning titles and medals. Finally, the men joined the winning bandwagon with their blend of aesthetics, control and athleticism on the courts.Be it 20-year-old Lakshya Sen, the seasoned Kidambi Srikanth, the combative H.S. Prannoy and the doubles team of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, India had men who believed that winning the title was in the realm of possibility. In the final, both Lakshya and the doubles duo lost the opening games, and yet they dug deep to hoodwink the Indonesians. Once a 2-0 lead was secured, history beckoned and with remarkable fluency, former world number one Srikanth got past Jonatan Christie at 21-15, 23-21 as India clinched a team triumph for the ages. It was not easy, Lakshya had a stomach bug, and he and others had to cope with the constant pressure of expectations at every hurdle. The coaching staff deserve credit and so do the inspiring footprints left by Padukone and Gopichand, through their achievements and their inputs to their successors. When the Indians infused magic into the feathery shuttlecock, they also gifted an enduring memory to a country forever yearning for collective wins. In the past, Indian tennis had its moments in the Davis Cup but team achievements were often linked to cricketers and hockey stars of a distant era. Srikanth and company have ensured that Dhyan Chand, Kapil and Dhoni\u2019s units will not remain lonely at the top. This surreal win could truly alter the badminton landscape across India.",

        "full_article": "Sri Lanka is in the throes of an unprecedented economic crisis. Faced with a shortage of foreign exchange and defaulting on its foreign debt repayment, the country is unable to pay for its food, fuel, medicine, and other basic necessities. Notwithstanding the austerities that would be entailed, a bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been accepted as the only way out of the dire economic situation.\nOpposition political parties and citizens across the country blame the Rajapaksa government's widespread corruption and mismanagement for the crisis, and demand that the president and the parliament resign.\nThe prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, did so on May 9. However, the protesters at Galle Face Green and elsewhere have not been able to put forward an alternative leadership or a viable road map for the future. The country remains mired in confusion, chaos and a highly volatile political impasse.\nTo understand the complexity of the current crisis, and to prevent us from falling back into the same paralysing debt cycle, it is necessary to move beyond domestic politics and the relentless news cycles of corporate media, and explore some of the commonly overlooked yet basic global economic and geopolitical dimensions.\nThe transfer of financial and resource wealth from poor countries in the global South to the rich countries in the North is not a new phenomenon. It has been an enduring feature over centuries of both classical and neocolonialism.\nAt the beginning of 1989, developing nations owed foreign creditors USD 1.3 trillion\u2014that is, \"just over half their combined gross national products and two thirds more than their export earnings.\"\nRecently, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 crisis have worsened the high debt burdens of developing countries. These countries were already struggling to pay accumulated debts stemming from the expansion of capital flows from the high-income countries to lower income countries after the 2008 global financial crisis. Financial liberalisation was fostered by powerful global interests, including the IMF, when interest rates dropped in the richer countries.\nThis facilitated borrowing by developing countries from private international capital markets through international sovereign bonds (ISBs), which come with high interest rates and short maturation periods.\nFinancial liberalisation facilitated by the IMF and the developed countries working with the domestic elites of poor countries have created a \"hierarchical and asymmetrical international financial architecture.\" As a December 2021 report published by the Bretton Woods Project points out, this unequal framework creates \"macroeconomic imbalances, financial fragility, and exchange rate instability that can trigger debt and/or currency crises and curb the economic policy autonomy of affected countries to pursue domestic goals.\"\nThe international NGO Jubilee Debt Campaign\u2014also known as Debt Justice\u2014has pointed out that 54 countries are now experiencing a debt crisis. According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka owes USD 15 billion in bonds, mostly dollar-denominated, out of a total of USD 45-50 billion in long-term debt. The country needs USD 7-8.6 billion to service its debt load in 2022, whereas it had just USD 1.6 billion in reserves at the end of March 2022. The downgrading of Sri Lanka by rating agencies such as Moody's added to the difficulty of further borrowing to pay off the debt.\nThe devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee by 32 percent since the beginning of the year has made it the \"world's worst performing currency,\" exacerbating the plight of the Sri Lankan people.\nThe multilateral Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank owns 13 percent and nine percent of Sri Lanka's foreign debt, respectively. Currently, China is Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender, owning about 10 percent of its total foreign debt, followed by Japan which also owns 10 percent. Approximately half of Sri Lanka's total foreign debt (55 percent, according to some estimates) is market borrowings through US- and EU-based ISBs. Asset managers BlackRock, Inc and Ashmore Group Plc, along with Fidelity, T Rowe Price and TIAA are among Sri Lanka's main ISB creditors. However, the information on the ownership of ISBs\u2014including one worth USD 1 billion that is maturing on July 25, 2022\u2014is not publicly revealed.\nSri Lanka is in negotiations with the IMF to restructure and repay its massive debt. IMF structural adjustment will include the familiar privatisation, cutbacks of social safety nets and alignment of local economic policy with the US and western interests, to further detriment of local working people's standard of living and inevitably leading to more wealth disparity and repeated debt crises.\nEconomic crises create opportunities for external powers to expand economic exploitation and geopolitical control. In Sri Lanka's context, this means India, the US and China.\nSri Lanka's big neighbour India has extended a USD 1 billion credit line to provide essential food and medicine. The Sri Lankan government has stated that there are no conditions attached to the Indian loans. However, Sri Lankan analysts believe that agreements have been made giving Indian companies exclusive access to investments on the island.\nSri Lanka is strategically located in the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Over 80 percent of the global seaborne oil trade is estimated to pass through the choke points of the Indian Ocean. Although bizarrely overlooked by the global media, a cold war is already in place between China and the Quadrilateral Alliance (US, Japan, Australia and India) over the control of Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean.\nSri Lanka is part of China's USD-1-trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which includes the island's Hambantota Port and Port City. The US, on the other hand, signed an open-ended Acquisition and Cross Services Agreement (ACSA) with Sri Lanka on August 4, 2017, facilitating military logistic support. The US is also seeking to sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which would effectively turn Sri Lanka into a US military base. While the proposed US Millennium Challenge Corporation compact has not been signed due to local protests, the pact's objective\u2014US control over the land, transportation and communication infrastructure in Sri Lanka\u2014continues unabated.\nIn this context of Sri Lanka as a tense theatre of geopolitical rivalry, its debt crisis cannot be understood simply as an economic crisis. Could it, in fact, be a \"staged default\" designed to push Sri Lanka into an IMF bailout, which would complete the island's subservience to the US-dominated economic and political agenda?\nThe young \"Gota Go Home!\" protesters who demand President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation seem to be unaware of the global dynamics of the Sri Lankan crisis. Perhaps local and foreign interests guiding the protests may want to keep it that way. They are certainly not encouraging the protesters to join global calls for much-needed debt cancellation, debt swaps and regulation of capital market borrowing to prevent debt crises occurring in the first place.\nHowever, at least a few Sri Lankan professionals concerned about the implications of an IMF bailout have put forward alternative short and long-term solutions. They recognise that while exploitative colonial and neocolonial policies have turned Sri Lanka into a poor and desperate country, the island is rich with abundant natural resources and human capital. If the land and ocean and the graphite, ilmenite and other mineral resources are sustainably used, Sri Lanka can be economically self-sufficient and prosperous. There is also much to be learned from Sri Lanka's precolonial history in this regard, not least its hydraulic civilisation.\nThe Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has revealed that there are enough fuel and natural gas deposits in the Mannar Basin to meet the entire country's needs for 60 years. If the abundant sustainable solar and wind power are also utilised, Sri Lanka can become not only energy self-sufficient, but an exporter of energy as well.\nBioregionalism, economic democracy, and food and energy sovereignty are the only route to a sustainable future for Sri Lanka and other debt-trapped countries, and indeed the world at large. To overcome the dominant forces seeking to monopolise control over the natural environment and humanity, people\u2014especially the young\u2014need to awaken and work in partnership with each other to fight the destructive greed that ensnares and threatens to destroy us.\nCopyright: Inter Press Service\n",

        "full_article": "\"If we knew what it is we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?\" said Albert Einstein. Indeed, research gives us a glimpse of what the future might hold through the study of the information available in the present. Throughout history, countries have developed and advanced through innovation brought forth by research work. Sadly in Bangladesh, the significance of research is yet to be fully realised.\nResearch is a crucial criterion for determining how well a university is doing, among many others. All top-ranked universities worldwide have a large portion of their fundings allocated for research work. If we look at the top universities on the QS World University Rankings 2022, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the best university in the world, had an expenditure of around USD 762 million. The second top university, Oxford, had a USD 820 million budget as well. If we go further back, we will see a connection between research expenditures and university rankings. While university research funding in wealthy countries should not be compared with that in a country like Bangladesh, there is no ignoring the extent of negligence among the universities in the country, both public and private, in terms of research activities and expenditure.\nCompared to the research activities in other countries, Bangladesh is at the bottom of the pond. According to reports from 2006, the number of annual research paper publications in the country was around 400. Although the number has increased since then, it is still not up to the global standard. According to a report by the University Grant Commission (UGC), the total spending for research in 2020 by 38 public universities was Tk 72.91 crore, with Dhaka University at the top, spending Tk 6.61 crore. Even without government funding, private universities came out ahead on research budgets. Brac University spent Tk 55.23 crore on research in the same year, and North South University spent Tk 6.17 crore. Sadly, the average spending on research in all universities in Bangladesh is around one percent of their allocated budget. Chittagong University announced a budget of Tk 360.79 crore for 2021-22 with a 1.52 percent allocation for research. There are hardly any students who consider doing their PhD in Bangladesh.\nIn the QS World Ranking, there are several criteria to determine the university rankings. One of them is citation per faculty. Citation per faculty is \"the total number of citations received by all papers produced by an institution over five years by the number of faculty members at that institution.\" MIT scored 100 in this category. Comparing our universities with an institution of this magnitude is like comparing apples and oranges. However, compared with the universities in the Indian subcontinent, where the countries are on a similar economic level, Bangladeshi universities still fall short. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology's (Buet) score of 7.8 in citation per faculty looks pale compared to the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay's (IITB) score of 55.5. Even the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in Islamabad, Pakistan has a slightly higher score of 9.1.\nBangladesh is currently a lower-middle-income country, waiting to become a developing country by 2026. However, countries like China and India are spending more and more on research as they are becoming more affluent. Without innovation, a country can never truly develop. As a soon-to-be developing country, are we doing enough for research? Should Bangladeshi universities worry about research? The answer is, yes! Why? Because, there is empirical evidence that research spending is positively correlated with economic development.\nBrain drain is a term used to characterise the transfer of talented people from a country to others. This is similar to the \"rich getting richer\" argument, but from a human resource perspective. Gifted students from Bangladesh seldom consider a university in their own country when pursuing a PhD. Instead, they move abroad, and most of them get accustomed to their life there and stay back, becoming valuable human resources for their host countries. The lack of research activities plays the primary role here as PhD is a research-based degree. If we want to avoid this unfavourable brain drain phenomenon, if we want our talents to contribute to our country's development, we must give them the incentive to do so.\nThere is hope as well, North South University recently qualified to apply for a Times Higher Education (THE) ranking\u2014the first private university in Bangladesh to do so. There is a high threshold of research output that is needed to be met to be eligible for THE ranking. Things are moving towards a better future; we can only hope that this progress is taking place at all higher educational institutions. Only then can we deliver quality education and an environment for learning.\n\u00a0\nQuazi Tafsirul Islam\u00a0is a researcher and management consultant, and a senior lecturer of strategy and human resources at North South University (NSU). \u00a0\u00a0KASM Iftekharul Haque\u00a0is a research assistant (RA) at the School of Business and Economics of NSU.\n",

        "full_article": "Earlier this month, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a remark that assumes significance given the rueful undertone that her statement conveyed. This was a follow-up of her statement last month. She is reported to have said, \"Some people are always trying to regroup and oust the government.\" That despite all the developments that have taken place in the last decade under her watch. She also alluded to the effort of some political parties to seek help from foreigners, \"hoping that someone abroad will hold their hands and put them on the throne.\" She had reportedly said in end April that a group of political parties had joined hands with the BNP-Jamaat alliance to try to oust her government. And she wondered what the fault of the Awami League government was, and why they wanted to oust it. Here is my tuppenny worth of opinion.\nLet's pose a counterquestion: Why, indeed, would anyone try to \"oust\" a political party that is well ensconced in power, and has so much to show on the economic front? In this regard, we would like to believe that the parties that the prime minister named and the people she mentioned in her remarks are well established and recognised political parties and people with long political credentials. Hence, the term \"oust\" that denotes a more sinister intention than a legal political process of replacing a party in power through elections does not apply here. \"Unseat,\" perhaps, may be more appropriate here. We are totally opposed to supra-political means of changing government and would like to believe that all legal political parties\u2014which all opposition parties are\u2014also subscribe to this principled view. Anything contrary must be curbed ruthlessly. The last such intervention was that by Gen Moin in the political process in 2008. The Awami League continues to enjoy the fruits of that intervention. Some of the above-mentioned changes were welcomed with the comment of the Awami League leader that \"we are not unhappy,\" and in 2008, the party assured that all the ordinances of the caretaker government would be validated if the party was elected to office, nay \"power.\" And indeed, most of those were.\nThe economic story is astounding, but who will answer for the thousands of crores of taka that has been siphoned off from the country? Despite the not-so-sound condition of the banking sector, more and more private banks were allowed to open\u2014an example of crony capitalism. And most of those who deliberately violated banking rules are yet to be brought to justice.\nThe less said about shrinking political space to the opposition, the better. Thus, when the ruling party taunts the main opposition party for the lack of its presence on the streets or losing political relevance, they know one of the main reasons why. Even a gathering of politicians within the walls of a house is considered clandestine and, in some cases, forced to break up.\nThe politicisation of the administration, particularly the police, has set a very bad precedence. For example, did the Rab chief not exceed his remit when he warned against protesting the scrapping of Article 370 in India in Bangladesh (New Age, August 10, 2019)? Some of the recent comments of senior police officials sound like those of party cadres. The regression of law and order is exposed by the way law enforcers have acted on a selective basis in many instances.\nAs for \"hoping that someone abroad will hold their hands and put them on the throne,\" running to the foreigners has been the cheap stock-in-trade of all our political parties. But the only direct involvement in our elections that one can recall was when Indian Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh personally tried to prevail on Ershad to join the 2014 parliamentary polls when all the other opposition parties had boycotted it (Dhaka Tribune, July 1, 2014). Without an opposition, the election would have been far more questionable than it was.\nThen there is the issue of the rule of law, which has severely eroded the ruling party's image. There is nothing wrong with the law, but everything with the order. When law is applied selectively, it becomes the rule of men. When a convicted person belonging to the ruling party can go abroad for treatment without any impediment, while another has to wait for government benediction, it betrays the attitude of the administration towards the rule of law, and does nothing to enhance the government's image. There are examples where law has been applied depending on who the alleged accused was.\nLast, but not the least, let's restate that it is the constant effort of the opposition in any country to unseat the party in power through elections by exposing the failures of the incumbent and offering better alternatives to the public. And anti-government utterances and criticisms are absolutely the established norm in a free political system. This cannot be painted as anti-state activities, which has been done during the tenure of the current regime. Criticism of anyone remotely associated with the high-ups of the party in power has invited the wrath of the administration, as was the case with writer Mushtaq and cartoonist Kishore. The former died in custody in February 2021, and Kishore's case lingers. The Digital Security Act, and the proposed Data Protection Act\u2014which is seen as being legislated with next year's parliamentary elections in mind\u2014have curbed and will curb the freedom of expression even more. The worst sufferer has been the media, whose self-censorship has reached to a weird level, and criticism of political personalities has come to be regarded as lese-majesty.\nHave the people really swallowed the ruling party's mantra of Development before Democracy? That is what the Awami League should ask itself.\n\u00a0\nBrig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan, ndc, psc (retd) is a former associate editor of\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Two years ago, garment order books were empty as Covid broke out and shut down the main global markets for Bangladesh. Two years on, those order books are full. Our ready-made garment (RMG) industry has come full circle, following what we will surely look back upon one day as one of the most extraordinary periods in our history.\nNobody knows how the next few months or years will pan out. There are talks of global inflation leading to higher interest rates, which will be required to put the brakes on rising prices. Higher interest rates often slow down the economy. Others think inflationary pressures might ease off on their own once the global supply chains begin to move properly and the bottlenecks clear up in major logistics hubs, such as China.\nThe picture of uncertainty prevails, but we must be grateful that, amid these volatile times, business is good. But what now? I think we have an opportunity that we should not allow to go to waste. Bangladesh must strike while the iron is hot and capitalise on healthy order books by making investments and changes that will serve us well in years to come.\nSomebody asked me just recently about how I think the next 12-18 months would go. That is anyone's guess. That said, our business has been fairly robust since late last year, and I don't see why this would change anytime soon. The reason I say this with a fair degree of confidence is China, the world's largest textile market, which has adopted a \"zero Covid\" strategy, closing down whole cities due to a small number of infections.\nThese issues have major implications for Bangladesh. Our own government has taken a light-touch approach to the pandemic, balancing the need for public health safety with the necessity of having a healthy economy. China continues down its path of zero Covid, which shows no sign of being discontinued.\nThe upshot of all this is that China is becoming a serious sourcing risk for all retailers, including those in fashion. When people ask how I see the near-future unfolding, it is difficult not to see a further decoupling between China and fashion brands and retailers, and more business for its closest rivals, such as Bangladesh.\nSo it is high time now for our garment suppliers to take steps and turn this short-term opportunity into a long-term business strategy. The sun won't shine forever on our industry, and there are steps we can take to capitalise on the healthy revenue streams we are experiencing right now. We must not waste this opportunity.\nInvestment in key, business-critical areas is a must-do for our industry in the next 12-18 months.\nThe first of these areas is technological upgrading in our factories. Productivity rates remain low in our industry compared to that of our rivals. Better operational management, better layout, more modern machinery\u2014all these can enable us to improve productivity and bottom lines. They can also ensure that we continue to meet customer requirements and be more flexible to changes in orders.\nAnother factor is training manpower. Good people make a successful business. Attracting decent talent is a huge challenge at any time, particularly when order books are full to the brim. Now is the time to invest in people and their training, and to forge stronger links with our colleges and universities.\nThe third point is, of course, sustainability. One thing I have witnessed this past year is that our customers are doubling down on their demand for sustainability now more than ever. We are seeing big fashion retailers rationalising their supply bases, getting rid of suppliers that cannot meet their criteria for sustainable production. Some of our factories risk being left behind in the new landscape if they don't invest in, for instance, energy and water-saving technologies.\nThe final area I believe we need to focus on is promotion and marketing. I see so much interest in Bangladeshi products right now, there is such a huge groundswell of goodwill towards our industry. Fashion brands saw during the pandemic that we can be relied upon as a trusted sourcing partner, and I now believe we are reaping the rewards of that.\nLet's not waste this goodwill, and let's all focus on the same key factors: quality, consistency and sustainability. Some people believe a shift of production from China to Bangladesh might be temporary. It's up to us to make sure this is a permanent shift, and for that, we need to invest.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

But what about those who survive, but barely? How does the state plan to take care\u2014 physically and mentally\u2014of those who have gone through the ordeal of a road crash? Are our hospitals, public or private, equipped well enough to treat these survivors properly? Evidently not. As a report by this daily has outlined, the number of patients paralysed in road accidents has increased at an alarming rate, putting hospitals under immense stress to provide quality treatment.\nIn 2018, the High Court delivered a judgment, making it mandatory for hospitals to provide emergency medical services (EMS) to road crash survivors, irrespective of their financial ability or the medico-legal nature of the case. Three years later, what steps have been taken to ensure its implementation?\nNow, as per the latest report, experts have opined that both public and private hospitals must expand their capacity greatly in order to accommodate the treatment of patients who have been paralysed by road accidents. There must also be upskilling of surgeons so that the patients' quality of life can be improved as much as possible post-accident. But given the increasing number of road crash survivors in Bangladesh, the lack of treatment resources available to them is seriously alarming. During the recent Eid holidays alone, the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (NITOR) recorded at least 600 motorbike accidents. Statistically, five to six percent of bike accident survivors suffer from spinal injuries, which our hospitals are currently not equipped to deal with.\nAs crucial as it is to implement traffic rules properly and reduce the number of road crashes, it is equally important for the government to ensure proper treatment for road accident survivors. This includes emergency services as, in many cases, the treatment provided during the first hour of an accident is crucial. Additionally, given the pressure that the more affordable public hospitals already have to deal with year-round, private hospitals must also scale up their capacity and skills to treat road crash survivors effectively. Survivors of road accidents are actually victims of the country's unruly traffic system\u2014the health sector must not also turn its back on them.\n",

        "full_article": "The idea of a political candidate with clean image is perhaps overrated. After all, as experience shows, there is no guarantee that once elected and exposed to all the temptations of power, they will stick to their clean image of yore. Yet the idea of clean image is often tied with the winnability of a candidate, and political parties, including the ruling one, use it to signal that they've the best interests of people in mind. But the disclosure of the questionable background of Awami League's mayoral candidate for the Cumilla City Corporation polls raises doubts about whether this is really the case. According to a report by The Daily Star, the candidate, Arfanul Haque Rifat, happens to be number one on a government list of patrons of drug dealers and smugglers in the district.\nWe fail to comprehend why or how such a candidate could be picked. Did he bypass pre-nomination scrutiny? Did party higher-ups even consider a background check? Reportedly, his nomination was finalised in a meeting presided over by the AL President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself.\nThere is no reason to doubt the veracity of the list in question. It was prepared by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with the assistance of a government intelligence agency, as part of a country-wide drive to identify drug traders and smugglers, their patrons and law enforcers involved with them. The PMO, in 2018, even sent the home ministry a letter along with the list of Chattogram Division urging it to take action following scrutiny.\nRifat, a former senior vice-president of the Jubo League unit of Cumilla, was reportedly backed by the incumbent MP from Cumilla-6 constituency. With such powerful backers, and in an environment where political expediency outweighs fair play, it is perhaps no surprise that he passed the test. There would be no stopping him in the absence of powerful opponents\u2014with the BNP not participating in the election\u2014or proper action by the Election Commission, which has a duty to ensure only candidates with no criminal records contest in the polls. But if such candidates are allowed to contest, or elected, it will no doubt be a bitter pill to swallow for the EC, and a defeat for the people.\nThe Cumilla polls will be the first to be organised by the new EC, so all eyes will be on how it conducts all electoral activities including the screening of candidates and its action against campaign-related irregularities. We hope the EC will do everything needed to ensure a fair election. Equally importantly, the ruling party must do its part to build confidence in the electoral process, starting by not fielding questionable candidates, which will only taint the election.\n",
