The rule by decree, the suspension of civil liberties and free speech, the arbitrariness of government actions, and the indiscriminate arrests of dissenters and Opposition figures using draconian preventive detention laws, among other measures, continue to haunt Indians who experienced it in all its vicious forms. The traumatic episode is a reminder of the responsibility of democratic institutions in always safeguarding the freedoms and rights of citizens. When freshly elected and returning Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla read out a resolution, on Wednesday, \u201ccondemning the imposition of Emergency\u201d and termed it as an attack on the Constitution, one could have considered this as a note of caution about the perils of suspending civil liberties, and as a pledge that this would never be allowed to happen again. But seen in the light of Mr. Birla\u2019s actions, when, as Speaker in the 17th Lok Sabha, he indiscriminately used his powers to suspend several Opposition MPs, and the executive\u2019s use of draconian laws to stifle dissent from civil society, the polity and the media, the resolution seems not much more than lip service against the Emergency. It seems more a political ploy to target the Congress party. Indeed, the ruling BJP in the recent past resorted to similar excesses without even the fig leaf of a declaration of Emergency.If the government of the day is truly committed to undo the damages of the Emergency and not repeat its grave errors, it would have not taken recourse to the same measures in the recent past, seen in the attack on the free press, the use of enforcement and investigative agencies to selectively target Opposition representatives, and draconian preventive detention laws to keep political prisoners, activists and journalists in jail without trial, including by the foisting of charges against them. The BJP\u2019s authoritarian actions are one reason why its electoral representation in the 18th Lok Sabha has been trimmed to below the majority mark. The 2024 general election verdict might not have been a decisive rejection of the ruling party \u2014 as it was in 1977 \u2014 but it is no less significant as it empowers those in responsible positions in Indian democratic institutions to resist authoritarianism. A more thoroughgoing Opposition in Parliament that questions ruling party high-handedness; a vigilant judiciary that ensures justice to the many unjustly held dissidents; and a civil society that pushes for the withdrawal of draconian preventive detention laws and a ruling party that coheres with these \u2014 only such substantive steps will enable India to decisively move on from the dark period of the Emergency.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\narrest\n\n/\n\npolitical development\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nParliament proceedings\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)",

        "full_article": "With the defection of MLA M. Sanjay Kumar, who represents the Jagtial constituency in Telangana, from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) to the ruling Congress, the strength of the principal Opposition has come down from 39 to 33 in the State Assembly. True, such defections have plagued India, and several States, including Telangana, since its inception in 2014, have seen mass defections. Despite winning 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, Telangana\u2019s first Chief Minister, the BRS\u2019s K. Chandrashekhar Rao, effected a series of defections across the political opposition, until he was able to garner a brute majority of 90 MLAs and the dissolution of the State unit of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) by the end of his first term in office in 2018. Such defections, much like the current case, violated the 10th Schedule of India\u2019s 1985 Anti Defection Law, which was amended in 2003 to provide an exception to disqualifications if the defectors formed two-thirds of a party and merged with another party. This rule and the absolute power vested with the Speaker of the Assembly and the Chair of the Council to decide on members\u2019 disqualifications, without setting any time limit to do so, have often rendered the law ineffective. The Telangana Assembly Speaker is the ruling party\u2019s Vikarabad MLA, Gaddam Prasad Kumar. While he must serve in the interest of fostering principled democratic practices, seldom have Speakers, in the States or at the Centre, risen above their party\u2019s diktats.Mr. Kumar\u2019s defection has particularly caused some disquiet in the Congress, as it has slighted T. Jeevan Reddy, the candidate who lost the Jagtial Assembly seat. Mr. Reddy now serves as a Congress MLC. The Telangana Chief Minister, A. Revanth Reddy, has been accused of attempting defections in the past, the most infamous being his attempt in 2015 \u2014 when he was a TDP member \u2014 to bribe a nominated member of the House, Elvis Stephenson, to vote in favour of the TDP. These defections go against the spirit of participatory democracy, where the existence of a strong Opposition enhances governance and acts as a check on unilateral decisions taken by the ruling government. The experience of the past 10 years, both in New Delhi and in Hyderabad, has made apparent the dangers of parties with brute majorities. With a stronger Opposition at the Centre in 2024, perhaps it is time to seek more amendments to the anti-defection law. Prescribing a timeline for Speakers and Chairpersons to decide on disqualifications might not be enough; the power must be vested with an independent Election Commission.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nTelangana\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nTelugu Desam Party\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\npolitical development\n\n/\n\nElection Commission of India",

        "full_article": "After the October 7 Hamas attacks and Israel's genocide in Gaza that followed, much of the world is reckoning with the consequences of persisting imperialism. The nature of the interweaved global politics of modern times has become evident not just through the sales of consumer goods, but also the sale of arms. In this regard, the crisis in Sudan is in many ways similar, with horrific news repeatedly coming out about the state in which the civilians have been living.\nStarting in April 2023, well over a year has passed since the eruption of the crisis that is now termed a civil war. The chilling lines from a UNHCR report that the war has turned \"homes into cemeteries\" provide a glimpse at the terror that now encompasses the lives of those locked by the fight between the Sudanese government forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). According to a UN report, only 16 percent of the target have been met for humanitarian aid allocated for Sudan.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, 10 million people have been displaced in Sudan, a matter only exacerbated by the fact that 2.83 million people were already displaced by \"previous conflicts.\" Of the 48 million people in Sudan, more than a quarter have had to flee, with two million crossing borders in fear of their lives. Many Sudanese civilians have fled to Chad, Uganda, Ethiopia and South Sudan\u2014the exodus may place pressure on these nations and cause another cycle of violence. The overall death toll remains unclear, with some estimates of 150,000 according to Tom Perriello, the US special envoy for Sudan. As per the British Red Cross, 25 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance as of April 2024. By some estimates, the current situation in Sudan could surpass the horrific famines in Ethiopia 40 years ago, which was said to have taken the lives of approximately one million people. At present, it is estimated that 18 million people in Sudan are \"acutely hungry\" and among children, 3.6 million are \"acutely malnourished\"\u2014excluding severe injuries, both physical and psychological, that will be carried by the affected population for years, if not decades, to come.\nSudan's history is one that is rife with issues, from its independence from British and Egyptian rule in 1956 to the 22-year conflict in 1983-2005 to the present day, with famine and ethnic cleansing being recurring events over many years. The hope that had come in 2019 with the ousting of Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan for 30 years, was quickly extinguished in 2021, when the already fragile state of democracy in Sudan was ruptured by a coup organised jointly by army General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti.\nHowever, the current conflict occurred when the relationship between the two military leaders festered. Burhan, the commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Hemedti, the leader of the RSF, were once allies. While Hemedti believed that the dismantling and then reintegration of the RSF into the army would require 10 years, the SAF commander believed it could be done in two. The ensuing crisis that emerged from this conflict has had devastating consequences and a grueling genocide, one which the world has not been ready to tackle, and one which has received far less coverage than the genocide in Gaza.\nA line from a 2004 article in\u00a0Mother Jones\u00a0about the Sudanese civil war stated, \"If it has learnt from Rwanda, the West should act to stop mass killings in Sudan.\"Almost two decades later, the dismal fact of the matter is that the situation has not changed. As Europe lurches to the far-right, with the stoking of Islamophobia and anti-immigration sentiments as one of its most potent tools, we must remember that the sales of weapons from the West has for decades propped up authoritarian regimes in parts of the world called the Global South.\nAnother recent article in\u00a0Le Monde\u00a0claims that \"some states are actively fuelling the conflict by providing arms and ammunition.\" From the Russian Wagner group to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), arms have reportedly been supplied to perpetuate the conflict in Sudan, and these groups have reportedly profited from the horrific situation\u2014just as it has been in other conflicts, particularly genocides, throughout modern history.\nTo look away from Sudan, at this time, is tantamount to complicity. Innocent people losing lives and many barely surviving in a conflict created not by nature but by humans should make us pause, because it lays bare one of the cemented beliefs about the 21st century\u2014that war is a matter of the past. In truth, wars, genocides, and the military industrial complex are well and alive. As is frequently seen with conflicts today, it is rarely one country or the forces within the borders of a single nation involved in widespread systemic violence of the kind that is happening in Sudan.\nThe consequences of such decisions place, as usual, the lives of the innocent in grave danger. Sudan as of now has the largest internally displaced population in the world because of both the current conflict and the others that preceded it. The world has had the chance to bear witness to such atrocities through platforms that are not yet regulated the way traditional media has been\u2014through personal phones and social media accounts broadcasting information and current events at a fraction of the cost it takes for traditional newsrooms to show the world what is occurring. It is what allowed young journalists in Gaza to show what was happening on the ground even as the most powerful countries in the world worked to side with Israel.\nYet, many today feel powerless: the nature of modern world politics, as facilitated by civilian and military technology, prolongs wars that could have perhaps been snuffed out had external influences not existed in the pernicious ways that it does. To counter the immense powerful network that works against the innocent, it is imperative that at the very least we pay attention to conflicts such as the one in Sudan.\nAliza Rahman\u00a0is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Md Bilal Hussain, 73, learnt weaving from his father. Born in a family of weavers, he believes weaving is in his blood, inherited from his ancestors. His last employer confirms that Bilal is the best weaver he ever had. He is excellent at weaving silk sarees and salwar kameez.\nBilal worked for 57 years\u201442 with his last employer and 15 years with another. At retirement, he earned Tk 6,200 a month on average, being paid Tk 1,400 for each piece of clothing he made. Bilal retired in November 2023. His failing eyesight and aching body compelled him to stop although he did not want to. His low earnings never permitted him to save anything. He is not getting any retirement benefits as his employment was informal. Devoid of benefits, he is now at the mercy of his sons for the rest of his life and believes the Almighty will provide for him.\nFerdous Munsi, the owner (malik) of the small saree-making cottage enterprise where Bilal worked, explained the business. He spends Tk 2,000 on raw materials, mostly imported, for each saree and pays workers like Bilal Tk 1,400 to make the saree. This then retails at Tk 4,000. His gross profit does not even cover the rent of the space and the holding cost of inventory for the off season. He is critically aware of the low wages his workers are getting, but can do nothing about it.\nThis is the reality in the informal sector. The Bangladesh Labour Force Survey 2022 shows that close to six crore (60 million) people, 84.9 percent of total working population in Bangladesh, are in informal employment. It is noteworthy that out of the total employed women in Bangladesh, 96.6 percent are in informal employment. Similarly, 92.7 percent of youth aged 15-27 years are employed informally. Informal employment can be both in formally registered businesses and in the unregistered ones.\nEconomists opine that some level of informality is expected in a growing economy like Bangladesh, where an effective business governance system and procedures are yet to be established. There are several reasons for the widespread informality in the country. Studies have suggested that the ineffectiveness of public services like registration, licensing and tax processing of businesses are among the main reasons. On the other hand, lack of clear incentives to formalise, limited understanding of the process of formalisation, and limited employment opportunities are other impediments.\nThe consequences of the high informality are severe: low tax to GDP ratio, widening inequality, stagnant industrial competitiveness in sectors other than ready-made garment (RMG) and low labour productivity, and low product and service quality. Informality also hinders the potential of the industrial sector to participate and benefit from growing international value chains and export market opportunities. These are extremely critical as Bangladesh prepares to graduate from LDC status and enters the global market on the basis of competitiveness and productivity.\nWhile the prioritisation of formalisation in the Industrial Policy 2023 is a welcome step, there is a dearth of studies on the potential positive impact of formalisation and Bangladesh's capacity to formalise to inform policymaking. Furthering the formalisation agenda is imperative for the country if it is to achieve the ambition of economic diversification and modernisation of the private sector to become competitive globally. The implementation of the policy requires an integrated effort from the whole of the government, the private sector, and workers' organisations. The success of ongoing labour sector and social protection reforms are also key to addressing informality.\nThe informal sector, which comprises cottage, micro-, small and medium enterprises, not only operates closest to local communities, but plays a crucial role in creating local jobs, especially for women and youth in Bangladesh. As we commemorate the Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day today, we recognise that it is a vital sector at the heart of our societies with tremendous potential to accelerate decent job creation and achievement of the SDG goals.\nTo fully harness its potential, a transition to formalisation is necessary to ensure that the millions of workers in the sector do not end up like Bilal\u2014destitute after a fully productive working life.\nGunjan Dallakoti\u00a0is small and medium enterprise development specialist at the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "\"Alright, I concede. I sacrifice you to the country. Go, enrol in the war.\" These were the words of Jahanara Imam, known as \"Shaheed Janani,\" to her eldest son Shafi Imam Rumi when the 20-year-old sought permission to join Bangladesh's Liberation War of 1971. To what extent will a mother go to protect her son and ensure his purpose in life and in death?\nFrom the heart-wrenching sacrifice of her son during the Liberation War to her relentless pursuit of justice for the thousands of Bengali mothers who also lost their children, Imam's struggle and determination were unwavering. Her fight didn't end with the war; it continued with a revolution aimed at ensuring that the most despicable traitors in Bengali history, the war criminals, faced appropriate punishment. Her unwavering commitment transformed personal tragedy into a national movement for justice and accountability.\nFrom the mother of a freedom fighter, Imam's determination and lifelong battle as a mother, woman, and proud citizen of the country echo her name in every step of history that followed March 1971.\n\"Last night, all of us stayed up, again. Sounds of gunfire, columns of fire, smoke swirling upwards. In the morning, the sound of gunfire paused for a while\u2026 When at eight-thirty, they made a radio-announcement regarding the lifting of the curfew, Rumi and I set out in the car\u2026 When we reached the vegetable sellers' area of New Market, Rumi hit the brakes with 'Oh God!' The entire market was gutted by fire. Parts of it are still smouldering. I screamed, 'Look, there are charred human bodies too\u2026' Rumi said, 'Amma, don't look,' and turned right on Mirpur Road, sped away\u2026\"\nThis is what Jahanara Imam recounted of the first blow of the Liberation War that continued for nine months in 1971. To this day, her memoir \"Ekattorer Dinguli\" stands as a vital historico-literary document of the Liberation War, offering firsthand accounts of the violence and the struggle for freedom.\nDisguising it as a personal household journal, Jahanara Imam meticulously wrote \"Ekattorer Dinguli,\" which metamorphosed into one of the most accurate, genuine, and sincere chronicles of the war. Widely recognised as the \"Shaheed Janani,\" she fact-checked her entries using 80 audio tapes of interviews with Rumi's surviving comrades and other participants, particularly focusing on guerilla operations.\nImam interspersed her journal with irrelevant details, giving it the appearance of a bored housewife's musings. As crucial as it was to her, longing for her son, Rumi, her one true love, for whom she waited every day of the war, she also wrote in code, substituting \"six sarees\" for \"six rifles,\" and used pseudonyms to protect soldiers' identities. She painted geometric patterns and used pens with different coloured inks to make the journal seem trivial and so that she could recall them exactly after the formidable war.\nBeginning on March 1, 1971, and ending on December 17, 1971, the day after the Pakistani Army's surrender, Imam's daily entries intertwine domestic life with the political turmoil of the time, with her older son, Rumi, at the heart of the narrative.\nReviewing the English translation of \"Ekattorer Dinguli,\" Philip Hensher writes in The Guardian, \"Just as the Holocaust needed a Diary of Anne Frank that brought the numbing total of deaths down to an individual, human case, so the Bangladeshi massacres are brought down to the feelings of a mother for her son\" (March 1, 2013).\nImam endured immense personal losses during the freedom struggle: the arrest and subsequent disappearance of her eldest son, the interrogation and torture of her younger son Saif Imam Jami, and husband, and the death of her husband Shariful Imam just three days before the war ended.\nImam continued her relentless pursuit of justice in the 1990s by organising the Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee, which aimed to bring war criminals and collaborators of the 1971 genocide to justice. As the convener of this body, she faced severe repercussions; in 1992, the BNP government charged her with sedition. The following year, while addressing the public with the committee's updated findings, she was assaulted by the police.\nThrough her relentless activism and unyielding spirit, Jahanara Imam remains a beacon of courage and resilience in the face of immense adversity. Imam rose from becoming only Rumi's mother, to the mother of the war-stricken country, a leader who inspired love, respect and took authority of what should be done.

        "full_article": "Speaking on the country's education system, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has termed it multi-dimensional and creative. With particular emphasis on science and technology, the system is, she claims, geared to maintaining global standard. So long, the new curricula of education up to class 12 were branded as skill-based rather than theory-based. Earlier the structured and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) set for examinations were passed as creative education. The policymakers made the tall claim that notes and guide books would be redundant on introduction of this type of questions. What was amiss, though, is the standard of text books, class teaching and quality of teachers from the reckoning. True, there is no reason to mix up MCQs with multi-dimensional education system. The format of questions, much as excellent it may be, is no alternative to the system of education under which students' learning progresses. With the introduction of newer subjects, education may become multi-dimensional but this is no guarantee for making education creative. There is also no reason to think that creativity is limited to science and technology; rather it can flourish as an abstract idea or form in literature and art. In a country where too much experiment has been made with school and college education up to class 12, the existence of different streams of education such as Bangla medium following national curriculum with an English version as well, two types of madrasah education---Qawmi and Aliya and English medium following international curricula is anachronistic. All these are multi-dimensional but hardly conducive to bringing about a unitary standard. The prime minister certainly made a reference to an array of specialised area of education where students' talents and preference can make the most of the subjects they pursue. Whether the teaching standard and infrastructural facilities are going to be world class is, however, a completely different matter. Teaching profession itself calls for a thorough review. Now that the system of education has undergone a transformation with practical tasks forming a large portion of education, teachers had to be inventive who could think out of the box. The present set of teachers, the majority of whom unfortunately even had unenviable academic records, is sure to find it a tough call to be equal to the expectation. Also the orientation or training for three to five days falls far short of requirement. Even the more fundamental question concerns their low salaries and other facilities. They are forced to get involved with private tuition and coaching. Without developing the infrastructure of schools and colleges and raising teachers' financial benefits, it is impossible to reap the benefits of a well-devised education system. The endemic inequality between and among educational institutions, families of students is yawning. Without addressing those, even the introduction of the new curricula runs the risk of falling flat. There are reports that parents cannot manage the money required for school assignments or projects their wards are supposed to deliver. For some parents though, money is never an issue. Had there been a special fund allocated for students of the disadvantaged social segments, this problem could be overcome. But to get over the lack of quality of teachers and deficiency of school infrastructure, several times more investment was required before introduction of the practical and skill-based education system.",

        "full_article": "A recent statement of Bangladesh Police Service Association (BPSA) advising journalists on how to report in a way that doesn't tarnish the police department's image is as bizarre as it is disturbing. The episode was triggered by media reports on the accumulation of huge wealth by two former top-notch police officials, one a retired Inspector General of Police (IGP), Benazir Ahmed, and the other, former DMP commissioner, Asaduzzaman Mia. If not for journalists' fearless approach to uphold the principles of journalism, their obscene assets might still be under the carpet. Benazir Ahmed was regarded as one of the most influential top-notch police officers in the history of Bangladesh; a much-lauded and eloquent preacher against corruption and a crusader against wrongdoing. Benazir received the 'Integrity Award' for 2021-2022 from the government for his \"ethics, integrity and honesty\". The 'top man of integrity', however, was exposed following his retirement. The amount of his reported ill-gotten wealth is simply beyond belief.When the news of the scandal first broke in late April, Benazir audaciously taunted the reporters in a video message that he would give all his property to them if they could prove the accusation. But in a proof that public opinion still carries weight in Bangladesh's democracy, even though it is flawed to a certain extent, the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) was allowed to open an investigation into Benazir's murky world. The ACC went below the iceberg tip the media had initially reported and discovered that many of his family members had also incredibly benefited from his ill-gotten wealth.So far, the anti-corruption watchdog found 12 flats in Dhaka's posh areas registered under the names of Benazir Ahmed and his family members, along with 697 bighas of land across various districts, shares in 19 companies, and family savings certificates worth Tk 3 million. Additionally, 33 bank accounts and three beneficiary owner (BO) accounts have been identified. The court has ordered the confiscation of all these properties. Benazir skipped the ACC interrogation for the second time in a row on June 23. Reportedly, he and his family have fled the country.Following the Benazir revelations, former DMP commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia came into the spotlight, once again, for all the wrong reasons. Although Asaduzzaman Mia and his family members' alleged accumulation of wealth is less extensive than that of Benazir's, nevertheless it is unusual by any standard. Whether they acquired this wealth legally or illegally should be determined through proper investigation. The reports about the accumulated assets of former top brasses of police are enough to drive the readers out of their wits. In response to allegations of accumulation of assets of such mammoth scale, how can Bangladesh Police Service Association (BPSA) recommend that media be more careful in publishing any report about the police force? Instead of performing an in-house clean-up, the association had the audacity to describe the reports as a \"smear campaign\" by the media. It claimed that the reports published by print, electronic, and social media outlets are \"partial, motivated, exaggerated, and misleading.\" If that wasn't enough, an investigation was reportedly launched to find out who was leaking sensitive information to the media. Subsequently, an additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) was allegedly put under suspension last Monday for leaking personal information about former DMP commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia. In the face of the ever-growing allegations of corruption against former and current members of the police force, the BPSA should warn its members of the consequences of any wrongdoing, call for a departmental investigation and punish those responsible for corruption and other irregularities in a bid to restore public trust. Their pitiful attempt didn't go unanswered. The Editors' Council termed the BPSA statement as \"indecent, illogical and irresponsible\" attitude towards independent media and impartial journalism. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) strongly condemned the same statement, calling it a direct threat to press freedom and an attempt to suppress the media's voice. It went on to say that the statement by the police officers' association potentially indicates a systematic effort to shield those accused within the force. And last, but not least, the Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) termed it a moral support for the corrupt. Understandably, the ill-conceived statement found no support outside the BPSA.Corruption scandals, however, are not exclusive only to the police; now, Matiur Rahman, a senior officer of the National Board of Revenue (NBR), is at the centre of controversy. He came under scrutiny when his teenage son Ifat boasted on social media about purchasing a goat for an astonishing Tk1.2 million for Eid-ul-Azha. The extravagant purchase sparked widespread speculation as to how he could afford it. The disgruntled Matiur initially retorted saying that Ifat was not his son. Media reports later, however, revealed that Ifat was indeed his son and shed light on his unchecked accumulation of wealth. Reportedly, he also fled the country before the High Court could impose a travel ban.At any rate, these incidents provide concrete proof of the common allegation that widespread corruptions take place in various departments of the government. Social media is also abuzz with discussions about who is actually leading the corruption marathon - government employees or politicians. The people get a glimpse of an astounding rise in politicians' wealth during elections when candidates are bound to disclose their wealth statements. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Tuesday that some people amass so much wealth that they have to flee from the country. She rightly termed the propensity to amass wealth as 'an addiction'. But mere acknowledgement of the problem or sacking and punishing one or two officials is not enough. The government needs to probe much deeper and act decisively to stem the rot.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Farakka Barrage on the mighty river Ganges was commissioned on April 21, 1975 on a trial basis.And with its commissioning, a large section of people of Bangladesh became mistrustful of India, which had strongly supported the independence war of Bangladesh and made huge sacrifices.The main reason for mistrust is the adverse effect of Farakka Barrage on the economy of Bangladesh that is largely dependent on agriculture for its sustenance. But the irony is that after 20 years of its commissioning, people for whom the barrage was constructed, are now raising voice against it. Located in West Bengal, India, the Farakka Barrage is roughly 16.5km away from the Bangladesh border. The purpose of the barrage was to ensure navigability of the Kolkata Port by flushing out silt by discharging water at the rate of 1800 cubic meter per second from the Hooghly River. After commissioning the project, Indian experts said that it was observed that the diverted water flow from the Farakka Barrage was not enough for the purpose.Eventually, it was found that the water diverted from the barrage is less than 10 per cent of the water of the Ganges river available at Farakka.Against this backdrop, the chief minister of the West Bengal, Mamara Banarjee has publicly questioned the necessity of the Farakka Barrage. A couple of days ago, she wrote a letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wherein she had drawn a vivid picture of the negative impact of the Farakka Barrage on the people and their livelihoods in West Bengal.\"In fact, the genesis of construction of Farakka Barrage project is the disconnection of Bhagirathi from the Ganges. As part of this project, a feeder canal has been constructed to provide at least 40000 cusec for proper functioning of the Kolkata port. It is very pertinent to mention that the flow of silt into Hooghly has also reduced over the years after the barrage was constructed\" the West Bengal chief minister wrote in her letter.\"This has accentuated erosion by the rivers and the areas both in the upstream and downstream of the barrage have faced serious loss of life and property including public infrastructure such as schools, hospitals; health centres, power lines in the past. Lakhs of people have been displaced from their habitation rendering them homeless and also leading to their loss of livelihood. The reduced silt load in Hooghly has impeded the nourishment of Sundarban delta\" she explained.People of Bangladesh believe that Farakka Barrage, built across the Ganges is the key reason for drying up of many rivers in their country, including the Padma near Rajshahi. Experts said the barrage is not a problem for Bangladesh alone, it also poses a problem for the people who live in its vicinity in India. In fact, Farrakka project is a vivid example of how development projects have been undertaken without thinking about the lives of people living near the river. The rivers of Bangladesh are dying. The sweet water content inside the rivers has diminished, and there has been a steady rise in salinity. Built to revive the Kolkata port, it is now blamed for reducing water flow, increasing salinity and drying up the waters around the Sundarbans.Mamata Banerjee raised the issue in reference to the recent Hasina-Modi meeting, which decided to renew the Ganges Water Sharing treaty, which is to expire in 2026. She made it clear that without her consent the proposed renewal would not be acceptable. And it is more or less clear that she may not accept a deal without a solution of the crisis triggered by the Farakka Barrage.Under the prevailing circumstances, questions are being raised by many whether decommissioning of the Farakka Barrage could be a solution to the problem. One will have to wait and see what transpires finally.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Unfit vehicles have become the bane of city dwellers. These vehicles roam the roads across every region of the country, including the capital, Dhaka. It is estimated that there are more than five lakh unfit vehicles plying in the country. Every year, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) takes various steps to take these vehicles off the road, but in vain. Common passengers continue to suffer due to these unfit vehicles on the road. Buses, in particular, are a major problem.Some buses are so rickety that they are unfit to carry passengers, yet people are forced to travel in them. Most passengers travelling by bus in Dhaka face great difficulty during extreme heat. Women, children, and the elderly suffer the most in these public transports. Many buses have broken roofs, allowing sunlight to enter and significantly increase the heat inside. Many public transports lack fans, or if they have them, they are usually broken.Various studies have shown that excessive speed and the reckless attitude of drivers are among the main causes of road accidents in the country. Some unfit vehicles use CNG, and many of these gas cylinders have exceeded their expiration date. As a result, these cylinders often explode, injuring many passengers.Constant surveillance, licence checks, certification and seal systems, public awareness campaigns, and the use of technology are needed to curb the dominance of these unfit vehicles. Through these measures, the number of unfit vehicles and the accident rate can be significantly reduced. The relevant agencies of the government must take strict action to solve this problem.Asif Islam Student Jahangirnagar University ",
