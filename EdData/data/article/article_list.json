Given that the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s primary mandate is to steer retail inflation towards a 4% target, and that core price gains have stayed stuck above or almost at 6% for 20 months, the rate setting panel voted by a 4-2 majority to continue tightening policy. Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasised the significance of the MPC\u2019s unwavering focus on inflation when he noted that medium-term growth prospects would be best strengthened by \u2018keeping inflation expectations anchored and breaking the persistence of core inflation\u2019. That inflation remains the key risk to the growth outlook, notwithstanding the easing in the headline print for retail price gains over November and December, was stressed by the MPC. The panel pointed to the deflation in vegetable prices in end 2022 and cautioned that this trend could likely dissipate as summer approaches and prices harden. Commodity prices are also expected to see upward pressure globally, given the lifting of most COVID-related restrictions, particularly in China. Specifically, the recent uptrend in Brent futures and the intensifying Ukraine conflict forebodes the possibility that oil costs may well upset the RBI\u2019s assumption of an average price of $95 per barrel for India\u2019s crude basket.The MPC\u2019s decision to raise rates by a marginally smaller 25 basis points (bps) this time following its December decision to temper the tightening to 35 bps after three straight half percentage point increases, shows it is cognisant of the growth-retarding challenges that rising credit costs could pose to the ongoing post-pandemic recovery. Still, the fact that the Indian economy has proved more resilient, underpinned by a rebound in domestic demand especially for contact-intensive services and discretionary spending, has provided a degree of comfort to monetary policymakers. This was manifest in their upgrades to the GDP growth forecasts for the first two quarters of the coming fiscal year. While the RBI raised its growth outlook for Q1 FY24 to 7.8%, a sizeable 70 bps up from its projection in December, it lifted its Q2 projection by 30 bps to 6.2%. Mr. Das\u2019s unequivocal assertion that monetary policy must be \u201ctailored to ensuring a durable disinflation\u201d rightly echoes a recent blogpost by three IMF economists who warned that central banks need to stay resolute as any \u2018premature loosening\u2019 of policy risks a sharp resurgence in price gains that could leave countries susceptible to further shocks. Ultimately, price stability is and must remain the bedrock for a durable economic recovery.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\noil and gas - upstream activities\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

Much of the 72-minute speech was on the domestic agenda, particularly his economic optimism. The speech saw self-appreciation, ideas and rhetoric \u2014 he took pride in his economic policies, emphasising the low unemployment rate and easing inflation, repeated the calls for taxing the super rich and bringing down prices of essential drugs, promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare and declared that democracies have become stronger and autocracies weaker. While there was no major policy shift, the 80-year-old President repeated the phrase \u201cfinish the job\u201d, indicating that he needed more time to build on what he has already done \u2014 seen as a pitch for his re-election campaign. Mr. Biden also referred to Russia and China as key foreign policy challenges \u2014 the Ukraine invasion as \u201ca test for America\u201d, and that America \u201cwill act to protect our country\u201d if its sovereignty is threatened, an indirect reference to the balloon incident.If Mr. Biden used the speech to defend his legacy and lay his vision, it also laid bare his administration\u2019s critical challenges. To be sure, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since 1969 \u2014 to 3.4% in January 2023 \u2014 and inflation continued to ease in the month. Still, most Americans (58% as in a recent survey), burdened by high energy prices and slow growth in wages, remain unhappy with his handling of the economy. The President may have plans for re-election, but only 37% Democrats back him. Mr. Biden will also face growing resistance to his policies from Congress in a Republican-controlled House. On foreign policy, the U.S. has so far stood resolutely behind Ukraine, but, as the war grinds on, there are rising questions about a possible endgame. A bigger challenge for Mr. Biden is how to handle ties with China at a time when the two superpowers compete for global influence. The balloon incident suggests that it is not an easy task. Half of Mr. Biden\u2019s first term is over. As the election season is heating up, time is running short and his task is cut out \u2014 he has to act more decisively on the economic front if he wants to build a fair order of competition and opportunities, work towards ending the war in Ukraine without compromising on America\u2019s standing in Europe, and put in place stronger guardrails in U.S.-China relations to check an escalation in tensions and deterioration in ties.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

        "full_article": "Upon resuming this week, the budget session of Parliament has sort of emulated a pacy action film, complete with the lead players sporting eye-catching costumes. Both the government and opposition aisles have been packed when either side has been in high rhetorical flow. What the opposition lacks in numbers it has tried to make up in decibels and togetherness, especially in sloganeering for a JPC probe into the Adani group. Treasury benches for their part talked past these cries, putting out long lists of \u201cachievements\u201d. Unsurprisingly, when one sifts through all this TRP-friendly play, no real insight is to be found.\nEven otherwise, a Rs 45 trillion Union Budget for a year with challenging global winds, has seen scarce discussion about how it will address the country\u2019s various urgent needs. As usual PM Modi offered an aggressive defence of his government both in response to the motion of thanks on the President\u2019s address and opposition charges. More unusually, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi served up matching aggression. His intervention showed the Bharat Jodo Yatra effect. Yet despite being focussed on the Adani issue, his attack was high on allegations and low on specifics. That looseness helped the government dismiss the attack as politicking. Indeed, and as our columnist today points out, both BJP and Congress leaders have shown, in and outside Parliament, that 30-plus years after reform, blind business bashing is still a favourite political ploy.\nThis takes us to how the overall paucity of informative interventions in Parliament is less accident and more design. Speeches are almost in campaign style. With nine state elections lined up this year, and Lok Sabha elections next year, parliamentarians are in primetime TV mode. This is also a reminder that mathematical analysis of the legislature\u2019s productivity, say by the number of sittings or hours of discussion, can be misleading. If the government is stingy with information, and opposition is ineffective at getting the information out of it, no amount of spectacle is any compensation.\nThere are other questions. No doubt, there is symbolic value to expunging portions of speeches from parliamentary records, and those expunged have the right to protest. But in the age of live telecasts and social media, the \u2018ban\u2019 will only gain those speeches new audiences everyday. The question is, what is Parliament serving up to its audience? Less and less informed and informative debate.\n\n",

It said that Hyderabad will be the common capital of the successor states, Telangana and Andhra, for a decade. Subsequently, there will be a new capital for Andhra. Post-bifurcation, the Andhra government moved fast. In April 2015, it passed an order notifying Amaravati as capital. A new capital city was to be built. However, almost eight years later there\u2019s uncertainty surrounding Amaravati\u2019s status. Will it continue to be the capital or just one of three? The confusion embodies the state\u2019s broken politics.\nYSR Congress Party\u2019s success in the 2019 assembly elections changed things. In 2020, the assembly approved a bill that allowed for a transition from one capital to three seats of governance. Amaravati would be the legislative capital, Visakhapatnam the executive capital and Kurnool the judicial capital. This led to protests from some farmers and the matter reached the high court of Andhra. Meanwhile, in 2021 the YSR government repealed its own law on creating three seats of governance. The next year, the HC decided the Andhra government should stick to its original Amaravati plan. The state government took the matter to the apex court.\nThe confusion over the capital represents wasted opportunities in the state and has had a negative impact on the investment climate. Dysfunctional politics, not unique to Andhra, has led to disputes and judicial intervention. The Supreme Court, which stayed the HC verdict, will resume hearing the case later this month while Visakhapatnam will soon host an investor\u2019s summit. CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has already declared it will be the capital \u201cin the days to come\u201d. Hopefully, SC will help end the confusion and Andhra can finally put the matter to rest.\n\n",

As of writing this editorial, death toll has passed\u00a020,000 as predicted \u2013 with at least 17,134 people confirmed dead in Turkey, and 3,277 dead in Syria. As rescue rescue efforts enter fourth night, the death toll is certain to rise further. Officials and locals believe that many people are still under the rubble, waiting to be rescued. However, the Turkish government's response has been criticised by many because of its severe \"shortcomings\", which the Turkish president has also admitted.\nUnder the circumstances, Turkey and Syria (in both government-held and rebel-held areas) need international support to accelerate their response. The World Health Organization chief also warned that time was running out for the thousands still feared trapped and injured. According to a survivor in the rebel-held town of Jindayris, Syria, \"there are around 400-500 people trapped under each collapsed building, with only 10 people trying to pull them out. And there is no machinery.\" This reveals the sorry state of rescue operations in Syria.\nWe understand that it is extremely difficult for any nation to deal with a disaster of such a massive scale. Which is why the world must extend its full support to not only help rescue the quake-hit people in the affected areas, but also provide the survivors with food, shelter, medicine and other necessities. Our government has already sent a rescue team with necessary training to Turkey. While other countries have also extended their support, there still remains some difficulties in sending such teams in war-torn Syria. But we think during such a tragedy, our goal should be to save lives, and all other considerations should make way for that.\nThe tragedy in Turkey and Syria has also reminded us of our own weak earthquake preparedness. Bangladesh being situated in an earthquake-prone zone, we are at risk of being hit anytime. And if an earthquake of a similar scale does hit us, the level of devastation would be unprecedented \u2013 experts believe that up to 300,000 people may die if a 7-magnitude earthquake strikes Dhaka. Dhaka and other major cities including Chattogram have many buildings that were not constructed following the building code. Have we taken the necessary preparation to avert the danger that it entails? It is time we took lessons from the Turkish-Syrian experience.\nFinally, we extend our heartfelt sympathies to the victims and survivors of the quake-hit people in the region, and hope that the world will stand by them at this most critical time.\n",

        "full_article": "The underlying issue is of \"entitlement.\" Be it due to money, feudal legacy or political power (the last being far more effective than others), some people feel entitled to do anything \u2013 insult, humiliate and publicly abuse others, as if the more vulgarity on display, the more it is a testimony of their power. Nothing depicts the vulgarity of this discrimination more dramatically and painfully than the way we treat the children of the poor.\nA municipal mayor in Narayanganj's Araihazar upazila, on February 6, allegedly tortured, beat, tied hands of, and paraded three kids (aged 7, 9, and 11) along a two-kilometre route, for \u2013 what the mayor claimed \u2013 \"trying to steal\" some rusted parts of some old machines from an abandoned factory.\nThe machines were lying in the open before being shifted to another site. Two of the kids were playing and picked up some pieces, maybe to play with them. The mayor saw this from a distance, which triggered his violent rage and the consequent beating and torturing. Then he summoned the third child from his home and continued torturing them together. It was not a sudden and uncontrolled outburst that subsided soon after. No, it was his way of showing his power, his anger, and it continued for more than two hours while the kids were paraded through the local bazaar. During the period, the children's parents and families begged and pleaded with him and sought his forgiveness, which came after these kids were publicly humiliated with the final act of having their heads nearly shaved so that, for weeks, they would be mocked, continuously verbally abused and stand out to be pointed at as thieves.\nFirst, it is an issue of class and stature. We are quite certain that the mayor would not have dared harm a trio of 7-, 9- and 11-year-olds if they belonged to the people of the same stature, wealth or political power.\nSecond, it is also that of power. He felt certain that these kids' parents and families would not dare go to the police \u2013 who are likely to be under his influence anyway \u2013 and did not have any powerful \"connections\" that would hold him to account.\nThat left the media. We commend the local journalists for rising to the occasion and reporting this violence against the three children who are, we repeat, aged 7, 9, and 11.\nThe physical and psychological impacts of what the mayor did to these kids cannot be fully fathomed now or even in the near future. The beating, the torture, the hand-tying, and the parading through the locality are likely to leave a lifelong scar on their psyche, far deeper and long-lasting than the beatings they got. The humiliation in front of their parents, families and playmates may leave such a deep sense of shame that they may never ever have a healthy sense of self-respect. Such traumas are known to permanently damage a child's sense of dignity. Obviously, the mayor in question is far removed from the world of respect and dignity to understand, far less appreciate, what we are talking about.\nI wonder by whom or how this mayor will be held accountable. Because of the publicity, he is now hiding, waiting for it to blow over and the media to lose interest.\nIs there any structure or mechanism that will generate an inquiry, collect evidence from the locals and hold the mayor accountable? Is there any authority to whom the concerned parents could go to seek justice? As I realised that there are none, I shuddered at the thought of how the poor and the powerless live with a constant sense of servility, as victims of the arbitrary exercise of power, legal harassment by the police and the physical threat of violence by local hooligans. The scene becomes nightmarish if we think of the women and children.\nTheoretically, laws are to protect the powerless. But our legal system is so complex, layered, cumbersome, and expensive that the poor would rather submit than contest.\nAs for politics coming to the aid of the downtrodden, the masses are only good for votes once every five years. For the rest of the time, money and muscle speak far louder than the voices of voters.\nWe have run many reports of powerful individuals beating up kids and torturing them on grounds of suspicion of theft. Sadly, there is a bias against the poor that leads to a general acceptance of violence against them. The logic, however perverted, generally is that when something is missing \u2013 money or something else \u2013 and if there is a child around, and if that child happens to come from a poor family, then he must be a thief. Beat and torture him, and he will confess, however tenuous its basis may be. Can there be any doubt that the child will \"confess\"? What else can he or she do?\nThree incidents in the last few days tell us how easily and almost casually we torture, physically punish and psychologically devastate children.\nIn Chattogram, three police officials were withdrawn \u2013 what a punishment? \u2013 from their post for torturing two children on suspicion of theft. The police officials tied them to a tree and beat them severely for hours. In Jashore, an irate cook threw boiling oil on a 10-year-old child as he dashed against him while coming out of the restaurant. In Feni, police recovered madrasa students who were kept in chains and beaten as part of discipline for any misconduct.\nAccording to a survey conducted by Unicef in 2019, nine in 10 children are subjected to violent discipline or aggression regularly from their caregivers, including parents and teachers. It concludes, \"No matter what form of violence a child is exposed to, the experience may lead to serious and lifelong consequences\u2026 Evidence also suggests that toxic stress associated with violence in early childhood can permanently impair brain development and damage other parts of the nervous system.\"\nThen there is the finding, in 2022, of the Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) that 56 percent of street children in the country are addicted to different kinds of drugs, and 21 percent of them are used as carriers. Of them, 14 percent said that they had been using drugs since they were 10 years old. The DNC study further found that 64 percent children of those surveyed did not know how to take care of themselves, and using their vulnerability drug traffickers sell drugs to them and use them as carriers. There is no reliable count of street children in Dhaka or the country. But researchers feel that it would be above a million. Take 56 percent of a million street children, and we get an idea of the scope of the problem.\nIn addition, there are countless cases of child abduction, imprisonment without legal recourse and sexual exploitation that occur in our society. I have not even referred to the gender-based abuse that a girl child is subjected to, including by extended families. The fundamental injustice and discrimination that is involved in child marriage is better left unsaid.\nA lot of lip service is paid for the rights of our children. As a country, we eagerly sign up to all international documents that enshrine all the best values. We were among the first to sign up to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989 and have, no doubt, proclaimed most loudly all our pious intentions in all international fora that we love to attend.\nThe question is: what have we really done about protecting our children, ensuring a modicum of healthy environment for their growth, and ensuring that they have the minimum of basic rights that they are entitled to as a citizen of a country that never tires of talking about its Liberation War values? Time has come to truthfully answer this question.\nAs we wrote at the outset, the main issue is of entitlement \u2013 the rich and the politically powerful are \"entitled\" and the poor and the powerless are not. This discrimination lies at the core of the divided society that we are producing. It is also the reason for our general neglect of the children of the poor. Unless we can bring about a fundamental change in how we take care of our future generation, the future of the country \u2013 regardless of the myriad graduations we go through \u2013 we will not be assured.\nPlease don't set it aside as a child rights advocacy piece. It is, in fact, aimed at constructing a humane society and us becoming better humans.\n(As this piece went to print, the guardians of one of the children had filed a case against the mayor in question with Araihazar police station.)\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "What's the point of fixing the prices of imported liquified petroleum gas (LPG) if those are inflated at will before it reaches consumers? What's the point of a regulator if it has little to no control over the implementation of its regulation? These questions come to mind when you think how LPG is currently being sold at up to Tk 300 or 20 percent more than the official rate. Earlier this month, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) fixed the price of the 12-kg LPG cylinder \u2013 the most common form of marketed cooking fuels \u2013 at Tk 1,498 for February. It marked an increase of Tk 266 from the previous price, in a blow to ordinary people already overwhelmed by the high cost of living. But a bigger blow still was when even that increased price was further inflated.\nAt a recent meeting, the LPG market was rightly described as \"chaotic\" by the director general of the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection. As revealed by market sources, importers, dealers and retailers were all involved in inflating the price illegally. For example, importers were selling a 12-kg cylinder at around Tk 1,520-1,532\u00a0to dealers/distributors, who were selling it at around Tk 1,550-1,600 to retailers, who in turn were selling it at Tk 1,700-Tk 1,800 to general customers. The rates of inflation vary, of course. If you ask the importers, dealers and retailers, each will blame the previous player in the chain. Each have their unique reasons, which they were not shy of sharing at the BERC meeting.\nThis is not the first time that officially set prices \u2013 not just of LPG but many other consumer products \u2013 have been overlooked with such reckless abandon. Over the years, there have been numerous occasions when poor regulation and oversight allowed illegal practices such as hoarding and artificially inflating prices to take place. Despite extensive coverage of price fluctuations/manipulations in the market, lack of preventive steps and alleged complicity of state officials make it easy for the unscrupulous traders to get away without punishment. The question is, what about the ordinary people? Who will protect their interests?\nIn the LPG market, it is supposed to be the BERC, which not only sets prices but is also responsible for ensuring compliance of its decisions, which it is evidently failing to do. As it stands, the BERC has set a rate that neither the consumers nor those on the supply side are happy about, each for different reasons. The BERC secretary has promised to hold a public hearing within 15 days to a month if all the companies send documents supporting their demand for a more favourable pricing formula/structure. If that means revising the LPG price further upwards, consumers have every reason to worry about.\nWe urge the BERC and other relevant departments and ministries to think of the consumers as well. They must ensure compliance of the officially set prices of products and fuels through proper market oversight, and must punish those who are violating them arbitrarily. Citizens' interests must be put at the centre of policymaking.\n",

However, the Turkish government's response has been criticised by many because of its severe \"shortcomings\", which the Turkish president has also admitted.\nUnder the circumstances, Turkey and Syria (in both government-held and rebel-held areas) need international support to accelerate their response. The World Health Organization chief also warned that time was running out for the thousands still feared trapped and injured. According to a survivor in the rebel-held town of Jindayris, Syria, \"there are around 400-500 people trapped under each collapsed building, with only 10 people trying to pull them out. And there is no machinery.\" This reveals the sorry state of rescue operations in Syria.\nWe understand that it is extremely difficult for any nation to deal with a disaster of such a massive scale. Which is why the world must extend its full support to not only help rescue the quake-hit people in the affected areas, but also provide the survivors with food, shelter, medicine and other necessities. Our government has already sent a rescue team with necessary training to Turkey. While other countries have also extended their support, there still remains some difficulties in sending such teams in war-torn Syria. But we think during such a tragedy, our goal should be to save lives, and all other considerations should make way for that.\nThe tragedy in Turkey and Syria has also reminded us of our own weak earthquake preparedness. Bangladesh being situated in an earthquake-prone zone, we are at risk of being hit anytime. And if an earthquake of a similar scale does hit us, the level of devastation would be unprecedented \u2013 experts believe that up to 300,000 people may die if a 7-magnitude earthquake strikes Dhaka. Dhaka and other major cities including Chattogram have many buildings that were not constructed following the building code. Have we taken the necessary preparation to avert the danger that it entails? It is time we took lessons from the Turkish-Syrian experience.\nFinally, we extend our heartfelt sympathies to the victims and survivors of the quake-hit people in the region, and hope that the world will stand by them at this most critical time.\n",

        "full_article": "What's the point of fixing the prices of imported liquified petroleum gas (LPG) if those are inflated at will before it reaches consumers? What's the point of a regulator if it has little to no control over the implementation of its regulation? These questions come to mind when you think how LPG is currently being sold at up to Tk 300 or 20 percent more than the official rate. Earlier this month, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) fixed the price of the 12-kg LPG cylinder \u2013 the most common form of marketed cooking fuels \u2013 at Tk 1,498 for February. It marked an increase of Tk 266 from the previous price, in a blow to ordinary people already overwhelmed by the high cost of living. But a bigger blow still was when even that increased price was further inflated.\nAt a recent meeting, the LPG market was rightly described as \"chaotic\" by the director general of the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection. As revealed by market sources, importers, dealers and retailers were all involved in inflating the price illegally. For example, importers were selling a 12-kg cylinder at around Tk 1,520-1,532\u00a0to dealers/distributors, who were selling it at around Tk 1,550-1,600 to retailers, who in turn were selling it at Tk 1,700-Tk 1,800 to general customers. The rates of inflation vary, of course. If you ask the importers, dealers and retailers, each will blame the previous player in the chain. Each have their unique reasons, which they were not shy of sharing at the BERC meeting.\nThis is not the first time that officially set prices \u2013 not just of LPG but many other consumer products \u2013 have been overlooked with such reckless abandon. Over the years, there have been numerous occasions when poor regulation and oversight allowed illegal practices such as hoarding and artificially inflating prices to take place. Despite extensive coverage of price fluctuations/manipulations in the market, lack of preventive steps and alleged complicity of state officials make it easy for the unscrupulous traders to get away without punishment. The question is, what about the ordinary people? Who will protect their interests?\nIn the LPG market, it is supposed to be the BERC, which not only sets prices but is also responsible for ensuring compliance of its decisions, which it is evidently failing to do. As it stands, the BERC has set a rate that neither the consumers nor those on the supply side are happy about, each for different reasons. The BERC secretary has promised to hold a public hearing within 15 days to a month if all the companies send documents supporting their demand for a more favourable pricing formula/structure. If that means revising the LPG price further upwards, consumers have every reason to worry about.\nWe urge the BERC and other relevant departments and ministries to think of the consumers as well. They must ensure compliance of the officially set prices of products and fuels through proper market oversight, and must punish those who are violating them arbitrarily. Citizens' interests must be put at the centre of policymaking.\n",

        "full_article": "That Bangladesh, after half a century of its independence, is yet to have a well-equipped refinery to treat imported crude fuel is strangely unusual. Despite the high investment required for setting up a modern plant, the cost differential in importing refined oil vis-\u00e0-vis that of crude oil should have weighed heavily in favour of a refining plant much earlier. Although there has been a project, a long lingering one, to install such a plant in the port city of Chottogram, a recent setback has apparently thrown cold water on the prospect that seemed not in the distant horizon. A news story published this week in this newspaper has attempted to dig into the goings-on of the project and has come up with a picture of sheer negligence for years. It has reported that the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has sought funds worth around US$2.0 billion from the government to build the proposed high capacity oil refinery in Chattogram. Curiously, the request for fund from BPC came after the exit of French firm Technip from the project. It has been gathered that high cost demanded by the French company and failure of negotiation led to its abandoning the project. This clearly implies that the country will continue to bear the exorbitant cost of importing refined fuel for quite a long time yet. According to reports, the volume of petroleum oil imports has increased around threefold over the past five decades to meet the growing consumption in transport, industries and commercial outlets with the expansion of the country's overall economy. The BPC data show, during FY2020-21, Bangladesh's import of refined petroleum stood at 4.15 million tonnes for which the state-run agency had to pay Tk 220.39 billion as import bill. Market-insiders are of the opinion that Bangladesh lost the opportunity to purchase Russian crude oil at a lower price due to the absence of a state-of-the-art refinery. Russian crude is available at around US$60 per barrel, far lower than the international price of Brent crude oil, now hovering around US$90 per barrel. It has been learnt that the country's only refinery - Eastern Refinery Ltd - is reportedly not in a position to treat Russian crude due to mismatch of specifications. This apart, what has transpired is that the project stumbling on the unexpected snag is now in a state of uncertainty. It is not clear what the authorities are up to-whether they are preparing for open tender or have already decided to award the contract to a company of their choice. That the country urgently needs a refinery with state-of-the-art facilities must not be seen as a low national priority. It has been found in an estimate that the proposed plant designed for a yearly capacity of refining 4.5 million tonnes of crude oil would help the country save $220 million a year. Is this not a good enough reason for the relevant authorities to see that the plant is completed under skilled and experienced hands as early as possible?",

        "full_article": "The planet Earth, the only known orbiting satellite of the star Sun serving as home to life, convulses and does so at an interval ranging roughly between 100/120 and 500 years. Such convulsions take the form of volcanic eruption or collision of the Earth's ribs called tectonic plates. While volcanic eruption has its build-up detectable for weeks, months to a year, the geothermal activities of a catastrophic earthquake defy the most sensitive seismic censors science has as yet come up with. On the count of unpredictability, earthquake is the deadliest of all natural calamities.Just imagine if there were an early warning system like that of the storm or cyclone which may move across an area far wider and lengthier than one struck by a quake, maybe, the damage and destruction to immoveable property could not be prevented. But at least lives in vast numbers would not have perished as the world is now a painful witness to the tragic deaths in south-eastern Turkey and north-western Syria with a border in between.That the Arabian and Anatolian tectonic plates may come into clash with each other was known to geologists and seismologists because the plates here are super active. The last quake of catastrophic proportion in this region happened in 1939 when approximately 30,000 people perished. So, this time the underground fault lines there gave in before even 100 years and before it happened, people were enjoying a warm winter. But as soon as the disaster occurred in wee hours on Monday, it brought along with it freezing temperature, snowstorm and rains as if elements also conspired to deepen the tragedy beyond all limits.This tremor is the deadliest since 1939 in this part of the world and its initial 7.8 magnitude has been followed immediately, surprisingly, by an after-shock of almost an equal magnitude recorded at 7.6 on the Richter Scale. Then there were as many as 400 aftershocks which forced the survivors to spend their night in the open. The survivors had to struggle against overwhelming physical tests as well as mental anguish because many of their near and dear ones were trapped underneath the collapsed debris. Also, they had to take whatever care of the injured they could in such an extreme hostile and chaotic condition until help came their way. In several areas of Turkey let alone Syria, though, no logistic support and other helps reached till Wednesday much to the anguish and anger of survivors. In Syrian city Aleppo and other rebel held areas, there already existed a humanitarian crisis because of the repeated bombardments that left many buildings damaged and vulnerable and crowding of refugees there. All this led to a situation unhygienic enough for a breakout of cholera. Thus here is a crisis within a crisis. This double crisis has been further compounded by no attempt by the Syrian government or international aid agencies or any country to rush logistic support such as rescue machinery that include excavators. The worst hit areas in the Syrian part are, moreover, accessible only through a corridor from the Turkish side of the border. This exposes the excessive vulnerability of the people trapped under tons of rubble as long stretches of building blocks have become flattened. Both Syria and Turkey were once the cradles of ancient civilisations but in this modern era, the former in particular is ill at ease to live up to the modern values and principles that forge national solidarity through a universal consensus. World's big players take advantage of this internal weakness and strife in order to extend their sphere of influences and commercial interests. Syria and a host of countries in the Middle East are made to pay for this through their noses. This is why Syria with international sanctions on it has been ignored by the major powers sending rescue teams, machinery and relief materials. Some Arab nations including Iran, Iraq, Arab Emirates have sent some emergency help to Syria, which proves paltry to the need. As the tragedy is unfolding in its myriad forms, we in Bangladesh have certainly been moved by its enormity and, along with our empathy for the victims, forced to reflect on the possibility of enactment of a similar catastrophe here. Some experts are of the opinion that the Dauki fault line along the southern boundary of the Shillong Plateau has been in the process of geo-thermal build-up for nearly 500 years in order to go haywire at anytime now. Then Assam is the eastern most projection of the Indian tectonic plate which thrusts underneath the Eurasian plate creating a subduction zone. Thus Bangladesh sits nearly at the meeting point of three highly active tectonic plates---the Indian plate, the Eurasian plate and the Burmese plate. In a major earth quake, the country's capital may not be quite close to the epicentre but along with urban centres in the east, it still runs the risk of huge damage, destruction leading to enormous loss of lives. Before it happens, the best option is to take the maximum preparation for averting colossal catastrophic consequences. To that end all new buildings must be constructed quake-resistant and the old, dilapidated and vulnerable ones detected for immediate demolition. Fire Service and Civil Defence volunteers trained so far seem to be the result of a good initiative but drills should be regularly held in different areas of this crowded capital and other urban centres particularly in the eastern parts of the country, which are at a greater risk. Common people will thus know about the dos and dont's when a quake strikes. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Not many would contest the contention that it is truly difficult to get reliable data both at macro and micro levels in Bangladesh. The problem has come into focus very often, but there have been no serious efforts to find an effective solution until now. The other day a vernacular business daily published a report on three different data on the country's export income in the last financial year (2021-22), compiled by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), the Bangladesh Bank (BB) and the National Board of Revenue (NBR). The EPB says the income was USD 52 billion, the BB USD 49 billion and the NBR 41 billion. These data are compiled not just for preservation. They have other practical uses in planning, disbursement of incentives and starting actions to stop illegal fund transfers. For instance, if there is a mismatch between the export revenue income and the incentives given to exporters, the central bank needs to locate the sources of incentive leakage. Besides, there could be laundering of funds through under-invoicing. Then again, there is a gap of USD 11 billion in data compiled by the EPB and the NBR, meaning that the latter was deprived of revenue earnings by the exporters concerned. Such dissimilarities in data available with various state institutions are a common event. Take the case of the country's annual rice output and acreage under paddy cultivation. The data compiled by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and the Directorate of Agriculture Extension (DoAE) hardly match, which is seen as a serious problem as far as the government's food procurement planning is concerned. Given the situation with the prices of the main staple in the domestic market in recent times, the claim of achieving self-sufficiency in food production appears to be based on wrong statistics. The state and the private sector together imported over 900,000 metric tonnes of rice during the first seven months of the current financial year despite bumper harvests for three to four consecutive seasons. The food ministry has the plan to import more rice in the coming months. It will not be out of place to mention here the recently published data of the latest population census, carried out by the BBS. This particular census carries immense importance in national as well as local level planning concerning almost all areas. A certain level of error is allowed in this kind of massive data-gathering work. But none knows for sure the extent of the error this time. Yet the latest census data will form the basis of most planning for the next decade. What remains important for the entities engaged in gathering and compiling data on certain sectors is to remain in touch with each other and collate information to avoid major discrepancies. Such coordination would not only help narrow the gap in data quality but also plug revenue leakages and enable better planning at all levels. Quality data are a prerequisite for sound planning, be it at the local level or state level. The need for ensuring the same has been reiterated umpteenth time. Unfortunately, the people at the helm of state affairs, despite being aware of its importance, are not doing enough.\n[email\u00a0protected]l.com",
