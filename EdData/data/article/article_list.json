Apart from the SCO\u2019s new agreements on regional engagement, discussions among the eight members including four Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) focused on inducting Iran as a member, broadening the SCO dialogue partners to West and South Asia, and on trade, tourism and counter-terrorism in the region. However, more focus was on the bilateral meetings on the sidelines, as this was the first such major conference that Russian President Vladimir Putin attended since the Ukraine war, as well as part of the first visit abroad by Chinese President Xi Jinping since the COVID-19 pandemic and Taiwan tensions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attendance was equally meaningful, given that it was the first time he met Mr. Putin since the war, and Mr. Xi since the standoff at the LAC, in 2020. This was also the first time he came face to face with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and speculation was rife that he would hold meetings with India\u2019s adversaries. While the meetings with Mr. Sharif or Mr. Xi did not materialise, western capitals focused on his Putin meeting. Mr. Modi\u2019s opening comment to Mr. Putin, that the \u201cera of war\u201d has ended, has been read as an \u201cadmonition\u201d of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. However, it would be wrong to read Mr. Modi\u2019s engagement with Mr. Putin as any kind of \u201cpublic shaming\u201d, but rather an expression of the concern over the war, something that Mr. Putin said he understands. A day before, Mr. Putin had also said to Mr. Xi that he understood China\u2019s concerns, indicating Russia\u2019s realisation of the need to effect a ceasefire and dialogue.India now comes into prominence as Chair of the SCO, and is making preparations for next year\u2019s SCO summit ahead of the G-20 summit in New Delhi. India needs to ensure the participation of all SCO members including China and Pakistan, despite the tensions, which will entail some diplomatic elbow grease by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in the next few months, beginning this week at the UN General Assembly. India\u2019s pitch to the SCO for connectivity with the Eurasian region hinges on its development of Chabahar port through Iran and traversing U.S. sanctions, while still competing with the China-Pakistan backed transit routes through Gwadar. On terrorism, India will have to ensure the SCO walks the talk on building a new consolidated list of terrorist groups, an area where it is frequently thwarted by China. Meanwhile, New Delhi will also have to balance its ties, keeping western partners in the Quad and other groupings reassured, especially as the polarisation between the U.S.-EU coalition and a Russia-China-led combine continues to grow.",

        "full_article": "The violent border clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan have raised fears of another war in the Caucasus. The countries had fought a disastrous weeks-long war in 2020 over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in which Azerbaijan made gains before Russia forced a ceasefire. Tensions remained with the occasional flare-ups, but Tuesday\u2019s clashes were the deadliest since 2020. Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of provocation, but the fighting, as per initial reports, took place on the Armenian side and Armenia took heavier casualties. It may not be a coincidence that the crisis broke out at a time when Russia, Armenia\u2019s security ally, has been struggling to hold its gains in Ukraine. Armenia is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation, whose NATO-like charter stipulates that an attack against one member could be treated as an attack against all. Armenia had turned to Russia for help, but Moscow\u2019s response was rather cautious \u2014 it called for de-escalation and claimed that it had brokered another ceasefire.The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh goes back to the pre-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union was formed, the Armenian majority enclave became part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic. When the Soviet Union collapsed and Armenia and Azerbaijan became independent republics, the clashes resurfaced. Armenian rebels in Nagorno-Karabakh fought off the Azeri forces and joined Armenia. But Azerbaijan never gave up its claims; nor did the two countries reach any peace agreement over the enclave. Unlike in the 1990s, Azerbaijan now looks economically and politically stronger. In the 2020 conflict, it got military and diplomatic assistance from Turkey while Russia was reluctant to get dragged into the conflict on behalf of Armenia. Now, Russia\u2019s ability to project power in its neighbourhood appears to be further limited on account of Ukraine. On the other side, gas-rich Azerbaijan, which still has the backing of Turkey, is being courted by the EU for increased gas supplies. These regional developments seem to have emboldened Azerbaijan. But its ambition could be costly for everyone. Russia will find it difficult to retain its influence in Central Asia and Caucasus if it continues to ignore Armenia. At the same time, getting dragged into another battlefront would be challenging. A conflict in the Caucasus would further destabilise the global energy markets, hurting all economies, particularly energy-starved Europe. For Turkey, which is trying to balance between Russia and the West over Ukraine, another war in its neighbourhood would further complicate its foreign policy choices. The last thing the world needs now is another war. So, all sides should enforce a lasting ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan and ensure calm in the troubled mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh.",

If the extraordinary story of BJP\u2019s national expansion in the Modi era has any disappointments, they are: one, the inability to dislodge an incumbent regional party outside the Hindi belt; and two, the inability to extend its footprint in the south beyond Karnataka.

That interpretation was seemingly buttressed by India twice voting to allow President Zelensky to address UN bodies. But this is a reductive reading of what Modi said as well as what India stands for and can do.\nFirst, Modi has been asking for cessation of violence from the time Russia invaded Ukraine. Second, he and other GoI figures have always been clear that New Delhi\u2019s approach to particular aspects of this geopolitical crisis will be driven also by national interest. Therefore, while calling for peace and negotiations, India didn\u2019t \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 join the West in its raft of sanctions against Russia. And since European imports of Russian oil and gas were exempted from this sanction, India\u2019s stand was well-vindicated. Therefore and third, when Modi tells Putin that this isn\u2019t the era of war, he\u2019s not changing India\u2019s position but re-emphasising the criticality of peace by pointing to the terrible costs of conflict. That\u2019s why the words that made global headlines should be read with what Modi said about food and fuel shocks the Ukraine conflict has inflicted on developing countries.\nThe larger point is whether India can play an even larger role as a peace advocate \u2013 in the sense that its advocacy will be one of the critical diplomatic factors when a conflict breaks out. There are reasons to believe that India\u2019s ability to wage peace may get considerably stronger. In global realpolitik, economic heft matters. India, already the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, is looking at years of steady, if not spectacular, GDP growth that will, as per current research, make it the world\u2019s fourth largest economy by 2027 and third largest by 2029. To this economic size, add the advantage of India\u2019s excellent record as a non-aggressor. A big country with a big economy that has never harboured war-like tendencies is a powerful peace advocate. And in Modi, whose national mandates in the world\u2019s largest democracy give him global political heft, India has a PM who can effectively leverage the country\u2019s strengths. The peace principle has a long pedigree in India, it\u2019s a part of India\u2019s civilisational ethos and it has Mahatma Gandhi as its 20th century champion. Perhaps, the 21st century will see India\u2019s emergence as an influential peace advocate.\n\n",

In March, a new workflow rule that mandated zero-balance accounts for each project replaced the system where institutes\u2019 central accounts allocated funds. Opening these accounts was time-consuming. Also, advantages of a large pool of money coming into a central account were lost. For example, interest earned from a central corpus helped researchers pay for administrative overheads, which are not always covered by grants. Rules must not tie up researchers in unnecessary procedures that affect productivity. Perhaps, the new system was meant to free researchers from controls of university procedures but pre-change consultation and a phased shift to the new system would have been better.\nThe bigger problem for R&D in India is too little spending. Per capita gross expenditure on R&D (GERD), as shown by Niti Aayog\u2019s latest India Innovation Index report, is just $43 (the total spend is 0.7% of GDP) against $1,800 in US (total spend 3.4% of GDP) and $325 (total spend 2.4% of GDP) in China. Even per capita GERD in emerging economies is far ahead \u2013 Brazil ($173) and South Africa ($105). Clearly, too little has been spent on R&D despite India\u2019s economic transformation over 30-plus years.\nTo begin with, the apex National Research Foundation announced in the 2020 Union budget must start working. It was promised a Rs 50,000 crore outlay and a spending timeline of five years.

        "full_article": "It's been barely a week since we demanded critical scrutiny of financial irregularities unearthed in a number of public offices by one of the government's own oversight institutions, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG). Even yesterday, we published an editorial calling attention to such irregularities in the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). To have to come back to this topic so soon is not just a matter of timing, however. It symbolises the near-ubiquitous presence of corruption in all institutions run under state management. The latest to be caught in the CAG dragnet is Petrobangla.\n\nCan such a huge pile of money simply vanish into thin air? If not the state coffers, whose coffers did it fill? Petrobangla did offer some justifications, none too convincing, and did nothing to rectify this gross anomaly.\nAccording to our report based on CAG findings presented in parliament in June, the state coffer has been robbed of about Tk 4,697 crore because of irregularities in 11 companies under Petrobangla between FY 2014-15 and FY 2016-17 and in two companies of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) \u2013 another corruption A-lister \u2013 in FY 2013-14. This was done through 19 counts of irregularities, which really boggles the mind. These include purchasing goods and services at inflated prices, flouting instructions of the finance ministry and the National Board of Revenue, and disregarding the Gas Sales Rules 2004 and 2014, Bangladesh Gas Act 2010, Public Procurement Act 2006, Public Procurement Rules 2008, etc.\nOf the Tk 4,697 crore thus lost, Petrobangla's failure to deposit with the state exchequer portions of the value-added tax and supplementary duties \u2013 collected from gas distribution companies \u2013 alone cost the Treasury some Tk 4,597.3 crore, of which Tk 4,270 crore in FY 2016-17. The outstanding amount, we're led to believe, remains unpaid to this day. The question is: Where did the money go? Can such a huge pile of money simply vanish into thin air? If not the state coffers, whose coffers did it fill? Petrobangla did offer some justifications about its usage, none too convincing, and did nothing to rectify this gross anomaly.\nClearly, those in charge of this vital cog in the state machinery and the powerful network that holds its reins feel so emboldened that they see no reason to refrain from breaking the law or taking arbitrary decisions. Before Petrobangla, we've had damning CAG reports on the BTCL, the Directorate General of Food, the Directorate General of Health Services, public hospitals and other healthcare facilities, the ministries of agriculture and fisheries and livestock, and of course the BPC \u2013 the last so immersed in corruption that even the chief of the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings expressed his shock to journalists. Their inclusion is by no means selective, nor their mismanagement a total shock, given how frequently the media reports on such corruption across the public sector. It's only a question of who gets to be exposed. Even that may not be enough to hold those responsible for financial irregularities to account.\u00a0\nThis cannot be how the public sector is run. Mismanagement cannot be our default management style. There must be accountability for the actions and decisions of all offices run with public money. We urge the administration to reform its modus operandi and take stern actions based on the CAG revelations.\n",

        "full_article": "We are shocked at the heavy-handed legal response to a Jagannath University (JnU) student, Khadijatul Kubra, who has been languishing in jail for over three weeks after being charged under the Digital Security Act (DSA). Since her arrest on August 27, she has been denied bail a total of three times. Her \"crime\" was hosting a Facebook webinar wherein an expatriate speaker made \"contentious\" remarks. Reportedly, two separate yet curiously identical cases were filed against Khadija in October 2020, when she was only 17 years old. Both cases, however, showed her to be an adult \u2013 one claimed she was 19, the other claiming she was 22.\n\nAs with most DSA lawsuits, the very ground of the cases filed against Khadija is also shaky. One could assume that the police knowingly showed her to be of adult age in 2020, and waited for her to legally attain adulthood before submitting the charge sheet.\nAccording to case documents, Khadija and the accused expatriate were apparently trying to \"cloud\" the existing political situation, engage the general public in anti-government activities, and besmirch the reputation of Bangladesh on the global stage. While the expatriate was sued on similar charges before, we fail to understand how Khadija's pre-scripted questions \u2013 \"What is your opinion on the deterioration in law and order and social degradation?\", \"How important is student politics?\", and \"Do you think BNP is failing to play its role as the opposition?\" \u2013 could warrant the punishment she has been facing. In what world would such punishment be proportional to her \"crime\"?\nAs with most DSA lawsuits, the very ground of the cases filed against Khadija is also shaky. One could assume that the police knowingly showed her to be of adult age in 2020, and waited for her to legally attain adulthood before submitting the charge sheet. This could also have been a way for the police to avoid informing her parents of the charges being filed against her. But why lie about her age? Why go to such lengths to pursue a DSA case? Is it to protect the image of the government? Is that image so flimsy that it can be ruined by a single webinar? We have had similar instances of minors being implicated in DSA cases before, including a 14-year-old boy arrested for \"defaming the PM\", which only shows the moral nullity of this law.\nOur stance regarding this is the same as it always has been: the DSA needs to be abolished. A law that has been mostly used as a tool for muzzling freedom of speech cannot exist in any democracy. Even our post and telecommunications minister, in June, admitted that the DSA had been misused and apologised to the victims. Still, we continue to see law enforcers and ruling party sympathisers using it randomly, causing victims unimaginable sufferings. This needs to stop. As the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also said recently, the government should ensure freedom of expression and peaceful assembly ahead of the 2023 general election, which includes people's right to express their opinion online. This is an inalienable human right, and no law should have anything to do about it.\n",

        "full_article": "There is more fiction than historical truth about the origin of the name 'Goalanda'. According to a legend, it was named after the Portuguese pirate leader Sebastian Gonzalez. Prof Matiur Rahman, in his book History and Heritage of Rajbari District, made the most persuasive argument in this regard. He wrote that Portuguese and English merchants used to visit Rajganj, a prosperous East Bengal trade port, while travelling between Dhaka and Calcutta. On the bank of the Padma River, Rajganj was an inexpensive place to eat and stay at, which earned it the fame of 'Goulash Land', a land of delicious cuisine. Fresh hilsa, rui or katla fish cooked on low heat for a long time, bursting with flavours of coriander, onion and garlic, used to be the most famous dish at the port. The Rajganj port had to be relocated several times due to erosion by the Padma, but it retained its fame. 'Goulash land' gradually became 'Goalandu' or 'Goalanda'.\nPrior to the advent of railways, inland waterways were the chief mode of transport in Bengal.\u00a0 In 1829, river steamer services in the Bengal delta started on the initiative of James Johnston, a former British Navy officer. In the beginning, there were very few steamers, and they used to travel great distances. Therefore, ticket prices were very high and their availability was unpredictable. They were mainly issued for East India Company officers and transportation of goods from Kolkata to various locations in then Bengal.\nThe India General Steam Navigation (IGSN), beginning its operation in 1844, popularised shipping in the Bengal Delta. They signed a contract with the government and started running two steamers between Kolkata and Assam in 1860. The steamers used to depart every six weeks. In 1862, The Rivers Steam Navigation (RSN) entered the shipping business. These two companies maintained a monopoly in the waterways of East Bengal for a considerable period of time.\nThe journey from Narayangang to Goalando used to take about six hours by despatch steamer and about fifteen hours by the slower boats which had stops at the following stations after leaving Narayanganj : (1) Kamala Ghat, (2) Shatnol, (3) Bahar, (4) Sureshur, (5) Tarpasa (Lohajang), (6) Mawa (7) Kadirpur (Bhagyakul), (8) Narisa, (9) Moynot, (10) Jelaldi (11) Kanehanpur, (12) Goalando. [BC Allen, East Bengal District Gazetteers: Dacca, The Pioneer Press, Allahabad, 1912, pg. 132] Navigation companies used to organise pleasure trips between Kolkata and Goalanda.\nInteresting descriptions of the steamers plying the Goalanda route and the long journey can be found in the reminiscences of journalists, bureaucrats, writers and politicians. In 1884, Shambhuchandra traveled from Golando on board the large steamer Princess Alice en route from Calcutta to Dhaka. Every Friday morning this steamer used to leave Golando for Dhaka. Journalist Shambhuchandra Mukhopadhyay's travelogue 'Travels and Voyages in Bengal between Calcutta and Independent Tipperah' published in 1887 provides various details related to Goalando. Ashok Mitra in his memoir 'Towards independence, 1940 1947: Memoirs of an Indian civil servant' (1941) wrote that River Steam Navigation (RSN) company's steamers used to travel between Kolkata and Dhaka via Sundarbans, Khulna and Barisal. They used to go as far as Guwahati and even Dibrugarh. India General Navigation (IGN) used to own large steamers. This company operated paddle steamers Ostrich, Kiwi, Emu and Pelican on the Goalanda-Dhaka and Goalanda- Chandpur route. Lunch used to be served in the launches by half past twelve. The food menu consisted of chicken soup, fried bhetki, famous IGN-RSN Captain chicken curry and caramel custard.\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wrote in his memoir: \"Goalando then had a very comfortable steamer service to Dhaka. The government had issued an inter-class ticket for me. I said I would go only on a first-class ticket. Since the steamer would be awfully crowded I wouldn't be able to get any sleep. Why couldn't they use my money which they had in deposit to buy me a first-class ticket?\" [ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, The Unfinished Memoirs, UPL, 2012, pg. 192]\nOn January 1, 1871, railway communication was established from Kushtia to Goalanda. This expansion took place under the Eastern Bengal Railway (EBR). The acquisition of land for the construction of railways became necessary. On March 20, 1866, an advertisement related to land acquisition was published in the Government Gazette. This ad is unique proof that Goalanda was then a part of Nadia district. After the establishment of railway communication, Goalanda's importance increased greatly. Passenger numbers increased so much that the Eastern Bengal Railway Authority introduced return tickets on the Goalanda to Kolkata route in 1874 for third-class passengers only.\nRailway service from Dhaka to Narayanganj started on January 4, 1885. Steamers of the Navigation Company and Railway Company then started ferrying passengers and goods from Goalanda to Narayanganj. Chandpur Ghat station was inaugurated on July 1, 1895 under the Assam Bengal Railway (ABR). This made it possible to move railway passengers and goods up to Chandpur Ghat. Passengers from Chittagong, Comilla, Dhaka, Sylhet and Assam started their journey to Kolkata through Goalanda Ghat. Due to the presence of large rivers, many places in East Bengal had not yet had a direct railway line. It was not feasible to build bridges at all those places in the initial stage. Because of that, the railroads on both sides of the river were connected by steamer and wagon ferries. Apart from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th class compartments, trains then had a special compartment for freight. A list of freight charges is given in S.C. Ghosh's\u00a0 A Monograph on Indian Railway Rates (1918). The charges for paddy and other grains used to be fixed in terms of maunds and miles. Freight rates were determined on a seasonal basis.\nMail from Sealdah to Chittagong used to leave in the morning. People from Comilla and Chittagong used to travel by Chittagong Mail. A description of the Dhaka Mail can be found in Comrade Muzaffar Ahmad's 'Kazi Nazrul Islam: Memoirs'. Coaches of West Bengal's Dhaka Mail were red in colour. The mail steamer from Narayanganj used to reach Goalando between six and half past six in the morning. At seven o'clock in the morning, the Dhaka Mail would leave Goalando for Sealdah with the steamer's passengers and carriage of fish. Customs checking would be done at Darshana. The train would reach Sealdah station between 1.30 and 2.00 pm. East Pakistan Railway coaches were green in colour. There were four types of compartments \u2013 first class, second class, interclass and third class. There were separate compartments for women known as Zenana compartments. Inter and third-class coaches had four rows of benches. Two rows next to the windows on both sides and two rows in the middle. Not all compartments were equal in size. This is how Jalal Miya reminisced while talking about the period after the partition of India in the article titled 'Two Decades of Goalanda'. Golanda was a first-class railway station of European standards in British India. Not a Bengali, not even an Indian was given the station master's duty.\nDuring the British period, sub-divisions were formed with police stations, and districts were formed with sub-divisions. Goalanda was made a subdivision in 1871. In 'A Statistical Account of Bengal (Volume-5)', published by W. W. Hunter in 1877, it can be seen that Faridpur district was composed of Faridpur Sadar and Goalanda sub-divisions, and Goalanda sub-division was composed of three police stations namely Goalando, Belgachi and Pangsha. Goalanda was the terminal station of the railway line starting from Kolkata. However, it had to change location 10 times in about 30 years of its inauguration due to changes in the course of the Padma River.\nAccording to the 1951 census of East Pakistan, Faridpur district consisted of four subdistricts, namely Sadar, Goalanda, Gopalganj, and Madaripur. Due to the shifting nature of the Goalanda ghat, the administrative work of Goalanda subdistrict and thana used to be conducted from Rajbari. On March 1, 1984, all the subdistricts were declared as districts \u2013 except Goalanda. In fact, it was made an upazila of Rajbari district! Goalanda railway station gradually lost its past glory; several railway lines leading to Goalanda were abandoned. Decaying red brick buildings now stand as testament to the past. Abandoned windows of ticket booths, money lockers, sharing a seat with other passengers on the deck of a steamer, hurrying down to the Goalanda ghat to board the train \u2013 all are now grey memories of the golden past.\nHossain Muhammed Zaki is a Researcher.

        "full_article": "It's been barely a week since we demanded critical scrutiny of financial irregularities unearthed in a number of public offices by one of the government's own oversight institutions, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG). Even yesterday, we published an editorial calling attention to such irregularities in the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). To have to come back to this topic so soon is not just a matter of timing, however. It symbolises the near-ubiquitous presence of corruption in all institutions run under state management. The latest to be caught in the CAG dragnet is Petrobangla.\n\nCan such a huge pile of money simply vanish into thin air? If not the state coffers, whose coffers did it fill? Petrobangla did offer some justifications, none too convincing, and did nothing to rectify this gross anomaly.\nAccording to our report based on CAG findings presented in parliament in June, the state coffer has been robbed of about Tk 4,697 crore because of irregularities in 11 companies under Petrobangla between FY 2014-15 and FY 2016-17 and in two companies of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) \u2013 another corruption A-lister \u2013 in FY 2013-14. This was done through 19 counts of irregularities, which really boggles the mind. These include purchasing goods and services at inflated prices, flouting instructions of the finance ministry and the National Board of Revenue, and disregarding the Gas Sales Rules 2004 and 2014, Bangladesh Gas Act 2010, Public Procurement Act 2006, Public Procurement Rules 2008, etc.\nOf the Tk 4,697 crore thus lost, Petrobangla's failure to deposit with the state exchequer portions of the value-added tax and supplementary duties \u2013 collected from gas distribution companies \u2013 alone cost the Treasury some Tk 4,597.3 crore, of which Tk 4,270 crore in FY 2016-17. The outstanding amount, we're led to believe, remains unpaid to this day. The question is: Where did the money go? Can such a huge pile of money simply vanish into thin air? If not the state coffers, whose coffers did it fill? Petrobangla did offer some justifications about its usage, none too convincing, and did nothing to rectify this gross anomaly.\nClearly, those in charge of this vital cog in the state machinery and the powerful network that holds its reins feel so emboldened that they see no reason to refrain from breaking the law or taking arbitrary decisions. Before Petrobangla, we've had damning CAG reports on the BTCL, the Directorate General of Food, the Directorate General of Health Services, public hospitals and other healthcare facilities, the ministries of agriculture and fisheries and livestock, and of course the BPC \u2013 the last so immersed in corruption that even the chief of the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings expressed his shock to journalists. Their inclusion is by no means selective, nor their mismanagement a total shock, given how frequently the media reports on such corruption across the public sector. It's only a question of who gets to be exposed. Even that may not be enough to hold those responsible for financial irregularities to account.\u00a0\nThis cannot be how the public sector is run. Mismanagement cannot be our default management style. There must be accountability for the actions and decisions of all offices run with public money. We urge the administration to reform its modus operandi and take stern actions based on the CAG revelations.\n",

        "full_article": "We are shocked at the heavy-handed legal response to a Jagannath University (JnU) student, Khadijatul Kubra, who has been languishing in jail for over three weeks after being charged under the Digital Security Act (DSA). Since her arrest on August 27, she has been denied bail a total of three times. Her \"crime\" was hosting a Facebook webinar wherein an expatriate speaker made \"contentious\" remarks. Reportedly, two separate yet curiously identical cases were filed against Khadija in October 2020, when she was only 17 years old. Both cases, however, showed her to be an adult \u2013 one claimed she was 19, the other claiming she was 22.\n\nAs with most DSA lawsuits, the very ground of the cases filed against Khadija is also shaky. One could assume that the police knowingly showed her to be of adult age in 2020, and waited for her to legally attain adulthood before submitting the charge sheet.\nAccording to case documents, Khadija and the accused expatriate were apparently trying to \"cloud\" the existing political situation, engage the general public in anti-government activities, and besmirch the reputation of Bangladesh on the global stage. While the expatriate was sued on similar charges before, we fail to understand how Khadija's pre-scripted questions \u2013 \"What is your opinion on the deterioration in law and order and social degradation?\", \"How important is student politics?\", and \"Do you think BNP is failing to play its role as the opposition?\" \u2013 could warrant the punishment she has been facing. In what world would such punishment be proportional to her \"crime\"?\nAs with most DSA lawsuits, the very ground of the cases filed against Khadija is also shaky. One could assume that the police knowingly showed her to be of adult age in 2020, and waited for her to legally attain adulthood before submitting the charge sheet. This could also have been a way for the police to avoid informing her parents of the charges being filed against her. But why lie about her age? Why go to such lengths to pursue a DSA case? Is it to protect the image of the government? Is that image so flimsy that it can be ruined by a single webinar? We have had similar instances of minors being implicated in DSA cases before, including a 14-year-old boy arrested for \"defaming the PM\", which only shows the moral nullity of this law.\nOur stance regarding this is the same as it always has been: the DSA needs to be abolished. A law that has been mostly used as a tool for muzzling freedom of speech cannot exist in any democracy. Even our post and telecommunications minister, in June, admitted that the DSA had been misused and apologised to the victims. Still, we continue to see law enforcers and ruling party sympathisers using it randomly, causing victims unimaginable sufferings. This needs to stop. As the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also said recently, the government should ensure freedom of expression and peaceful assembly ahead of the 2023 general election, which includes people's right to express their opinion online. This is an inalienable human right, and no law should have anything to do about it.\n",

        "full_article": "Few of the country's medical treatment seekers have much expectation from the existing public hospitals. It stems from the huge rush of patients, and the resultant messy situation and the heavy load of duty on doctors and nurses. Yet finding no other options, patients keep thronging the hospitals drawn by the reputation they once used to enjoy. Most of the patients belong to the lower, lower-middle and middle classes. Patients of the affluent class normally take treatment at private hospitals. When it comes to complicated surgery, the relatively richer segments opt for hospitals in Singapore, Bangkok or in southern India. Yet patients do come from all parts of the country to take treatment and undergo surgery at Dhaka-based famed public hospitals. Against this backdrop of medical treatment, the inauguration of the Super-specialised Hospital at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) at Shahbagh by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sept 14 marks a notable shift in the country's hospital service. The first of its kind in Bangladesh, the super-specialised hospital is set to become an alternative for Bangladeshis thinking of going abroad for medical reasons. The multi-faceted treatments and facilities at the super-specialised hospital would help Bangladesh save annually a sum of Tk 3.50 billion, a local news agency quoted the premier as saying. As could be expected from the multi-modal hospital, medical attention of the most advanced kinds and the related services like prognoses, further tests and referrals etc will be coordinated from a single venue much to the satisfaction of patients and their near and dear ones. Many people have money. They have the ability to receive expensive treatments at reputable hospitals abroad. But people with limited income go to public hospitals, where they can get treatment at nominal charges. The just-inaugurated super-specialised hospital can be expected to meet this preliminary need of the average people apart from providing specialised treatment at the high end. A patient at the 750-bed hospital is expected to receive comprehensive treatments at its five centres having numerous departments. Besides, around 5,000 to 8,000 patients are set to receive outdoor service at the hospital. The basic strength of the super-specialised hospital lies in its 100-bed well equipped ICU, with 25 beds reserved for surgical patients, and 25 others for cardiac patients. The 14 operation theatres also give a hint of the hospital's capacity.The just-inaugurated BSMMU super-specialised hospital is expected to emphasise medical research. It is imperative that a full-scale and vibrant hospital does not have any dearth of research activities. Insufficient research works by specialised doctors lead to below par functions of a hospital. The super-specialised hospital authorities should not allow it to happen. At the same time, gathering hands-on experience is a sine qua non for younger doctors. There is only one way to achieve it: remaining in rural health centres for longer periods and serving patients. The urge for acquiring the latest medical knowledge and information prepares talented young doctors to face any emergency. These potentially diligent doctors will surely add to the goodwill of an institution like the BSMMU Super-specialised Hospital.",

        "full_article": "Britain's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill was wont to brooding. Weighing heavily on his mind was the political shenanigans that pushed him from a nobody to the coveted position of the then Empire. He had been set up for failure. Except those that had so lined him up made a cardinal mistake. Churchill didn't brook failure. When faced up to it, he always found his way out of it. From infamy of a disastrous strategic mistake during the first Great War a daring escape from a prison camp catapulted him to fame. He had few qualms about mortgaging most of the empire in return for munitions and equipment that his staved troops required. The mortgager just happened to be the United States, Britain's great ally. That too, after President Roosevelt denied previous requests on grounds of an obfuscate treaty with Germany about not selling arms to parties in the conflict. Pearl harbour consigned all such treaties to the bin. Just as similar is the shredding of present day pacifism of Germany and Japan centring around the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Britain paid dearly. It's mortgage payment that altered geo-politics and it's debt management was severely stretched for more than half a century after the war. Ukraine is as likely to pay a hefty price for the $50 billion aid taken so far, not to mention the $5.0 billion daily bill raked up over revenue losses for its produce. When it comes to pure math, the equations are hard to solve as Saudi Arabia found out after being saddled with the Desert Storm bills. That's one reason why apart from Antonio Guterres, no one has complained about the absurd, indeed vulgar profits of $48 billion the country raked in just one quarter of the year through energy sales. There's no complaining either that the Saudis refuse to ramp up oil production so as to relieve price burdens on the world. Having said so, there are softer tones emerging. Two sets of prices, one for the Western world and the other for the developing world may be forthcoming. Lest that be presumed as charitable let it not be missed that Russia has beaten them to the trick. The motherland is already selling oil at discounted prices to its staunch allies (read those that refused to condemn them in a Security Council resolution).While that takes care of the pricing element leaving the sanction pushing the West to sort out its economic woes. The development, however, brings into play the fate of countries either bankrupt or fast heading that way. Economic integration induces disruption as well. Historically, the West made its money through plundering resources of the colonies, continued that through unfair trade exemplified by horrific trade imbalances and the direct and indirect arms sales that only supported internecine conflicts. There have been no apologies, not even acknowledgements about how warring factions in the Middle East, Asia or Africa got funding and weaponry. The Islamic State reduced to operating in cellular mode had sophisticated armaments at their display as did the Tamil Tigers and as do the Tigray rebels and Ethiopia's rival factions. The only outcry is over arming of the Houthi rebels by Iran, somehow legitimising Saudi Arabia's impunity in bombing Yemen. For all the desperate appeals by UN agencies the impending famine in Sudan and the inhumane conditions in Afghanistan have drawn no sympathy. Money can be found for the war in Europe but not for a manmade disaster. On the contrary, overseas aid funds are being reduced by a growing list that includes Britain and Germany. Many such programmes had been earmarked for propping up self-sufficiency projects in the Indian sub-continent. It creates further pressure on hapless Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Pakistan has been literally going around with a hat and has raised close to $10 billion in loans from friendly nations. Added to that is release of the rest of a $6.9 billion IMF tranche that had been suspended. How they will overcome the $20 billion loss resulting from half of the country being flooded is anyone's guess. Sri Lanka is somewhat relieved by a $1.9 billion IMF fund. That might ease immediate pressure but they have a $59 billion loan default to think of. In not so many words, Pakistan has removed fuel subsidies, super-taxes the super rich and promised hard nut approaches to revenue collections. Sri Lanka has agreed to similar terms including reversal of tax cuts.Bangladesh has been prudently proactive in seeking IMF support. The roughly $4.0 billion it is seeking is more to balance budget and support SMEs hard hit by Covid economics. Exports in the past three months have been growing as have remittances. The IMF has more confidence in the country's ability to steer through uncertainty, especially with close, cold and hard focus on austerity and control.Stranger events plague the world. In the middle of an economic morass, Japan has announced $30 billion dollars assistance to Africa. That's the tip of the iceberg for a continent where collective debt is at $550 billion and climbing. The Liz Trusses of the world must think twice before taking China head on in trade conflict. Let's not forget that the country that bought off Europe's largest share of debt holds some trump cards. Let it not be missed that in 1976 the UK went to the IMF with hat in hand. The country currently has the biggest budget deficit since World War II. Climate change is reminding us. The flooding in Pakistan is like hen's teeth but is happening. It has first flooded and then set the fires crackling in Europe and the U.S. The bonfires this time are of sensibilities.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "So, the country's rice huskers or millers have managed to bluff their ways into business. For more than one and a half decades they have been marketing rice under the fictitious brand name called 'miniket' which in reality has no existence in terms of generic types. What has come to be known as 'miniket' is a misspelt word derived from 'minikit', a packet of two kilograms of paddy seeds distributed among farmers first by the West Bengal state government and then by the central Indian government under a series of test programmes to evaluate the variety's adaptability to soil and weather conditions of different regions in India.In the mid-1980s, farmers in Jassore close to the border procured what is known as 'Shatabdi' variety for cultivation but in terms of yield this slender and aromatic paddy could not compete with BRRI-28 and 29. It seems the misspelt 'miniket' tag has stayed in West Bengal for the rice still available there. But what has gained currency in Bangladesh is a monumental bluff. No such rice is cultivated here but the business is as brisk as half of the total 38.4 million tonnes of rice produced here is passed as 'miniket' and 'super miniket'. Now what are these two so-called fine varieties of rice? If the hybrid coarse varieties such as BRRI-28,29, 33,43,48,50 are chiselled to slender shapes and polished in the auto-husking mills to give them white and shiny look, they turn into 'miniket' and if Bina,Swarna, Guti, Jira Shail and other slimmer varieties are thus doctored with, they become 'super miniket'. Now the question is, how could this fraudulent practice with the nation's staple go on for decades? It seems the authorities knew it from the beginning as agricultural scientists have made it explicitly known. Some of them even carried out research on this subject but this deception was overlooked. If adulteration of food and outfoxing a buyer take place in a business transaction where substandard goods can be passed on as a genuine variety, are these not considered criminal acts? In this case, the coarse varieties of rice at least had the inside coat containing fibre, oil, vitamin-B, thiamin anti-oxidant, selenium and magnesium etc. But when cut and polished (with chemical that may hazardous for health), rice lose 80 per cent of vitamin B1, 67 per cent B3 and 90 per cent of B6 and 50 per cent of magnesium. According to the food ministry, millers make an extra profit of Tk 300 on tampering with a sac (a little over 37 kilograms) of rice. The gullible public may be faulted with their demand for a finer variety of rice but not making the extra effort to know about the main dish that comprises their daily meal. But this is no culpable crime. After all, here is a sellers' market and traders more often than not resort to the arm-twisting tactic to dig deep into consumers' pockets. After decades, the food ministry appears to have woken up from its epical Kumbhakrna-like slumber to inform the public that the multitudes of miniket-loving people are in fact being deceived. They pay more and get less value on their money. Under its instruction, the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP) has decided to launch a drive against, production, marketing and sale of what is deceptively known as 'miniket' rice. Let the drive be as stringent as it should be to bring an end to the bluff. However, should the elements who have committed the crime in the name of business be allowed to go scot-free without penalty? Indeed, law has not been impartial to people with muscle and money power. This explains why leniency shown to the privileged segments has left a corrupting influence on society. Business syndicates and others have taken undue advantage and manipulated market, social and legal system, creating a culture of arcane social justice. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

According to experts, some of these spots are accident-prone because drivers' vision is obstructed by billboards and roadside trees. Most of these spots are located at or near intersections, roundabouts, junctions and sharp turns on the highways. Road crashes take place frequently on these spots. We, however, need to thank the authorities concerned for informing drivers about those risky turns and spots. But the question is, if they are aware that certain spots are accident-prone why can't they resolve the problem? They need to check as to why accidents frequently take place there, rectify the defects, undertake remedial measures or find alternatives. This would help protect innocent lives and fatalities. I hope the authorities will take actions to rectify the accident-prone zones as early as possible. \nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
