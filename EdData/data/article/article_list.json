Such incidents are an increasing feature of localised urban flooding in which human failures play a major role. Basements in buildings have limited access and often limited ventilation. Getting in and out can be a challenge and being trapped is a real possibility as the water will find its way there first. Special pumping arrangements would be required to mitigate flooding. In general, rules do not permit basements in buildings across the country to have habitation, while allowing storage, parking and utilities such as electric equipment and generators. Habitation would include offices and residents. Shops are sanctioned especially in malls or mixed-use buildings as they are seen as temporary habitation. A classroom or a study centre may well be considered habitation in such an interpretation of rules, which could mean classes or long hours of study should not be allowed in the basement. Building byelaws for Delhi (2016) consider the basement as a storage area but recognise mixed-use buildings that may use basements for other purposes. As India urbanises and land value and building value become increasingly expensive, it would be inevitable for buildings to be used for purposes other than mandated. In such mixed-use buildings, basements are also seen as income generators.The Delhi Master Plan 2021 explicitly says that the use of a basement in coaching centres shall be subject to clearance from fire authorities and other statutory bodies as per the relevant laws. It is not known if the IAS coaching centre had the relevant permissions and if any changes made on basement use were notified to the authorities. In India, questions need to be asked whether a renewal of permits was done after inspections; users prefer not to notify the authorities since it causes hurdles and invites bribe demands. In what appears to be a case of poor civic infrastructure, a stormwater drain burst with the water entering the basement of the coaching centre. Big cities getting flooded has become routine and the flooding is as much due to natural topography as changes in land use and haphazard constructions. In 2015, for instance, in Chennai, flooding of basements damaged electric equipment in many buildings and disrupted businesses. It caused deaths in a hospital since the water damaged emergency power generators and lifesaving ICU equipment stopped functioning. Buildings can be made flood-resilient by ensuring that no water enters inside up to the one metre to 1.5 m level on the road. Concrete, non-porous compound walls, flood-barrier gates and non-return valves on plumbing lines can help achieve this resilience. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nNew Delhi\n\n/\n\naccident (general)\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\nChennai\n\n/\n\nwater\n\n/\n\ncorruption & bribery\n\n/\n\nflood",

        "full_article": "A rocket attack on a football ground in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, in which 12 young people were killed, has taken West Asia to the brink of a wider war. Israel and the U.S. have blamed Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s powerful Shia militia that is backed by Iran, for the attack. Hezbollah, which initially claimed rocket strikes on an Israeli military outpost in the nearby Mount Hermon, later denied any role in this incident. But Israel has not bought Hezbollah\u2019s claims and is preparing its response. From October 7, 2023, the day Hamas carried out a cross-border attack in Israel, killing an estimated 1,200 people, a slow-burning war has been raging on Israel\u2019s northern border with Hezbollah. When Israel launched the Gaza war following the Hamas attack, Hezbollah began rocket attacks from southern Lebanon, its stronghold, mostly targeting Israel\u2019s military outposts in the occupied Shebaa Farms or the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel. Hezbollah\u2019s attacks forced some 60,000 Israelis to flee from Upper Galilee, with Israeli forces carrying out air strikes inside Lebanon in retaliation. Hezbollah claimed that it was fighting Israel \u201cin solidarity\u201d with the Palestinians, while Israel\u2019s leadership said none of Hezbollah\u2019s attacks would go unpunished. However, both sides were, until recently, cautious not to let the conflict spiral into an all-out war. But the Majdal Shams attack seems to have broken those unwritten rules of the war.Hezbollah\u2019s claim that it was not involved in the attack cannot be taken for granted. It is possible that the group targeted IDF outposts in the Golan Heights, under Israel\u2019s illegal occupation since 1967, and the rocket fell on the football field, but still the responsibility lies with the militia. Israel\u2019s hands are not clean either. The IDF, whose Gaza campaign has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians, has also carried out strikes in Lebanon\u2019s civilian neighbourhoods. Hezbollah and Israel last fought an all-out war in 2006, and it did not end well for the Jewish state. Hezbollah also takes credit in forcing Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon after 18 years of occupation. And since 2006, Hezbollah has built a stronger army and a huge stockpile of weapons. A war could spiral out of control with a high risk of Iran\u2019s involvement. Hezbollah\u2019s rocket attacks in recent months have only provoked Israel; and Israeli strikes on Lebanon have done little in deterring the group. This cycle of violence is self-defeatist and there will be peace only if both parties reset the current hostility and calm the borders. The obvious first step is to end the war which triggered this regional crisis \u2014 the war on Gaza.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nLebanon",

Some may have forgotten, but this also means full rumpus. Artistic director Thomas Jolly approached the whole project as \u201ccreation in the extreme\u201d. Extremely different reactions naturally followed. Those who were wowed are debating the best vs bestest moments. Others are busy mining insults and ridicule. But no one is being physically hurt or silenced or arrested. Instead, art is thriving as conversation. One ceremony, endless exchanges of opinion, spread across the world. About heavy metal, pink pompoms, religion, rain, sexuality\u2026\u00a0\nThe loudest fuss is over a tableau of Greek gods, officially intended to make \u201cus aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings\u201d. Instead, we have been struck by the absurdity of predicting audience reactions. Of anticipating where hurt sentiments can spring from. In this case, a similarity has been spotted with the Last Supper and thence an insult to Christians. To be clear, the resemblance is only to da Vinci\u2019s depiction of something that happened 1,500 years before him. Trump Jr, Musk and Kangana Ranaut are of course perfectly entitled to see what similarity they will. Even to take offence as they like. Just as others are free to helpfully school them in what it means to be free and cultured, how ideas and images take on lives beyond themselves. Raja Ravi Varma did not reach Indian homes thanks to those who accused him of impiety.\u00a0\nThe presence of drag queens has led to objections. The singing of French-Malian Aya Nakamura. The beheading of Marie Antoinette. List goes on. To do art is to invite criticism as much as praise. But when artists know they will still be safe, that their imagination can soar free, then and only then can great art become possible.\n\n",

The din buries the reality of most metros and haphazardly expanding cities \u2013 the near total lack of accountability, capability and capacity of municipal bodies. Consider the following:\nDelhi |\u00a0Just days before the basement drowning, a 26-year-old died by electrocution when he touched a colony gate electrified by a naked wire. Last June, another 26-year-old was electrocuted right outside the New Delhi railway station.\nMumbai |\u00a0In May this year, 17 people were killed and over 80 injured after a massive hoarding at a petrol pump in Mumbai suburb Ghatkopar collapsed within 15 seconds of gusty winds.\nBengaluru |\u00a0Last Nov, a 23-year-old woman and her baby died when she stepped accidentally on an abandoned cable on the pavement, which was, however, a live wire. The inquiry found a total lack of awareness of existing standards and practices.\nRajkot & Surat |\u00a0In May, a fire in a recreational facility in Rajkot killed 9 children along with 28 adults. In 2019, a Surat coaching centre fire killed 22 youngsters.\u00a0\nThese are of course the most horrific of accidents and fatalities. There have been 43 deaths countrywide of the most marginalised, while cleaning sewers and septic tanks, between the two budgets this year, Feb to July. Counting manual scavenging deaths is relegated to NGOs. Countless accidents occur, injuries aren\u2019t even considered. Little is on record. For instance, ask any municipal body for records of numbers of electrocution incidents or pothole accidents, or open-drain drownings, or waterlogging damage.\nMunicipalities have four primary stakeholders \u2013 residents, service providers, businesses and political class. Corruption at each intersection plays a huge role in norms being flouted. Inspections are fronts for graft. Personnel are neither trained nor paid adequately. Urban local bodies are strained for funds. Norms are observed only in exception. After serious accidents, engineers are sacked, arrests made, cases drag on for years. But how will the next accident be prevented? No one has any idea, because accountability within networks of urban local bodies is iffy, liability is shared.\nThe bottom line is urban chaos and zero oversight by municipal bodies is India\u2019s terrifying new normal. Parties and legislators will play blame games without a shred of concern about the economic cost of such criminal negligence and apathy. What will it take for urban local bodies to not be dysfunctional?\n\n",

They are just out of earshot, say those for whom eavesdropping is second nature. One of the guilty pleasures of life, it\u2019s a gender-neutral pursuit no one admits to enjoying until they overhear an interesting conversation.\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t tap phones or bug homes, just keep an ear to the ground. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s often that you get to hear things people want no one to know. There\u2019s also a premium on getting info when it\u2019s half-baked.\u00a0\nThey take much longer to finish coffee when the couple chatting at the table behind theirs suddenly goes hush-hush. They keep the waiter guessing with virtuous silence till the mugs turn cold too. If they have a partner in crime they order another coffee.\nThey mute television sets to get a better insight when neighbours fight. Pace of their night walks depends on strength of their hearing and distance from potential targets. Railway stations, metros, airports, shopping complexes and parks are among their favourite hunting grounds.\nNot every tidbit has a shelf life but it can still have some inherent benefits. What better opportunity to feel good about oneself than hearing a child ask his clueless father a GK question in a bookstore. If you know the answer you get an ego boost. Or else enjoy the father\u2019s plight, provided you have the skill to linger around long enough.\u00a0\nThere are straws in the wind everywhere. It takes a bit of aptitude to pick up nuggets from phone conversations others are having nearby. Like connecting the dots with imagination because only one side of the story is available on a platter. It\u2019s a jackpot if someone has forgotten to turn off the speakerphone.\nIt\u2019s not always fun though. Hands-free phones have made some people carefree about how they sound. If they are salespersons, it\u2019s a lesson in sophistry. Interesting details, however, are buried under a heap of cuss words. There\u2019s also hard work involved in keeping an impassive face while savouring tantalising, mysterious or plain boring stuff.\nThis is not a trait to be passed on to the next generation but a benign pastime for those with the ears for it. There\u2019s only so much that one can learn from National Geographic or Discovery channels. But eavesdroppers need to check the width of their walls. They have ears too.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Amid nationwide crackdowns in response to the recent violence centring the quota reform movement, we are alarmed by the reckless disregard for Supreme Court guidelines for arrests and remands. Reports published over the last few days paint a disturbing picture of how arrestees have been treated. Between July 18 and 28, some 8,914 people, including students and BNP and Jamaat men, have been arrested in 46 districts. In Dhaka alone, 2,764 people have been arrested. But as claimed by relatives and lawyers, many of the suspects were picked up by plain-clothes officers who did not identify themselves, and in many cases, the accused were not produced before court within the stipulated 24-hour period. Families of many students were left in the dark as their children were picked up and only learned of their whereabouts when they were produced before court days later. Many on remand were allegedly subjected to inhumane torture.\nAll these instances are blatant violations of the guidelines issued by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in 2016. According to the guidelines, law enforcement officials are obligated to identify themselves before arresting an individual and inform the next of kin within 12 hours. Moreover, arrests cannot be made in plainclothes, and the arrested must be allowed to contact their relatives and seek legal counsel.\nIt is worrying how due process is still being openly flouted by the law enforcement personnel. Former Ducsu Vice-President Nurul Haque Nur's wife Maria Nur told daily Samakal\u00a0that those who picked him up from their home in the early hours of July 19 did not identify themselves, and produced him before a court after 39 hours of detention. During that time, he was physically tortured to the point where he was unable to walk by himself, as he told the court. BNP leaders Aminul Haque and Sultan Salauddin Tuku also complained of being tortured in remand.\nThe detention of the six quota reform coordinators by the Detective Branch (DB) of DMP is another case in point. They were all picked up between Friday and Sunday\u2014\"for the sake of their security,\" according to the DB\u2014in a manner that legal experts called \"unconstitutional\"; two of them were even undergoing treatment at the time. Then there is the case of a minor\u201417-year-old student Hasnatul Islam Faiyaz\u2014who was taken to court tied with ropes and placed on a seven-day remand, which was later cancelled. We can also talk about how police falsified facts in the First Information Report (FIR) on slain university student Abu Sayed, which completely contradicts widely circulated video footages, in an apparent bid to absolve themselves of responsibility.\nThese are just some of the more prominent cases highlighted by the media. We understand that the law enforcement authorities are operating with a sense of urgency to restore order in these volatile times\u2014when six days of violence took at least 163 lives across the country, not to mention the damage caused to key public infrastructures. But this is also precisely why they must operate strictly within the bounds of the law, with utmost accountability for their actions, as restoring order may not be possible without restoring confidence about their integrity. In any case, violating law and citizens' rights in the name of law enforcement is totally unacceptable.\nThe Supreme Court guidelines were issued to prevent police excesses and ensure accountability. There is no scope for even an iota of oversight or violation in their activities. We, therefore, urge the law enforcement authorities to look into this matter urgently and ensure that anyone accused or arrested in connection with the recent violence is treated as per court guidelines and constitutional obligations.\n",

        "full_article": "On Friday, plainclothes policemen forcibly took three key coordinators of the Students' Movement against Discrimination\u2014Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud and Abu Baker Majumdar\u2014from a hospital in Dhaka city. Nahid and Asif were receiving treatment for injuries sustained after being picked up allegedly by law enforcers several days ago. Family sources have reported that that the trio was dragged to the vehicles and subsequently taken to an unknown destination. The plea of hospital authorities against apprehending two under-treatment patients fell on deaf years. Cell phones of all three detainees and of a sibling of theirs were seized. On that evening, the student activists were scheduled to brief the media about the ongoing movement.\nIn response to the burgeoning criticism of the detention of the three activists, the Home Minister claimed that they were picked up \"to find out who were threatening them\". Further explaining the situation, the head of the detective branch (DB) said, \"They (the coordinators) spoke on social media about feeling insecure\u2026 We think it's our responsibility as law enforcers to provide safety and security to those who say they're feeling insecure.\" He also said that the state would solicit clarification about telephone communication of the detainees with others.\nTwo more protest organisers, Sarjis Alam and Hasnat Abdullah, were also taken to custody by the authorities in Dhaka on Saturday. The additional deputy commissioner of the DB of police said the move was to \"to ensure their security and to get information about recent incidents.\"\n\nThe claims of the senior state functionaries tasked with law enforcement that the students were detained principally \"for their safety\" raises some important questions.\nFirstly, at least two among those detained are on record claiming that they were subjected to involuntary disappearance and torture only days ago. In their posts, they made amply clear about the source of their insecurity. Have the police and other law enforcement agencies had any discussion with the activists about who inflicted such unlawful detention and torture on them? If so, people have a right to know what actions the authorities have taken to bring the perpetrators to account.\nSecondly, did the activists explicitly state in their social media posts that they felt unsafe in the medical facility they were lodged in? If not, what made the authorities assume they would opt for state protection (in an unknown premise, possibly the DB office) over the security of their homes with their loved ones, or that of a hospital to recover from their bodily and mental wounds?\nThirdly, were those detained informed about the reason within three hours of detention, as per the Supreme Court guidelines? Was not the failure of the authorities to produce them before the nearby magistrate's court within 24 hours a violation of the law? Were the individuals acting on behalf of the state not obliged to produce their identity documents?\n\nFourthly, if indeed the intention was as benign as to grant the activists safety and security, why then would the activists be hauled to the vehicles against their wishes? And why were their next of kin not informed of the place they were being taken to? What precluded the DB authority to grant the group of university teachers a brief meeting with those being \"provided protection\" when the former went to the Minto Road office of the DB on Saturday?\nAnd finally, Article 37 of the Constitution grants every Bangladeshi \"the right to assemble and to participate in public meetings and processions peacefully and without arms\u2026.\" Under Article 43, citizens also enjoy the right to privacy of correspondence and other means of communication. Does the current political leadership, particularly those responsible for law enforcement, not believe that those engaged in the quota reform movement enjoy the rights under granted under those articles? If so, why would they need to explain whom they have been in touch with to organise these events? Why do they have to explain the contents of such communication?\nUnder the law, abduction is a criminal offence, and no one can arbitrarily be picked up and detained. \"If they (the police) want to arrest anyone, they have to comply with the directives of the Supreme Court,\" Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua was quoted saying in a report published in this paper. In this case, it is clear that there was a serious breach of the apex court's directives.\n\nIn addition to undermining the constitutionally guaranteed right to free expression and assembly, the state actions against the organisers of the quota reform movement also manifest uncanny transgression of the fundamental right to secure medical treatment by the wounded and the sanctity of a medical premise. Such tactless measures will only contribute to further deterioration of the already charged political environment. The government should immediately halt detaining and harassing the students for their role in the quota reform movement and instead take stern and visible action against those involved in wanton killing of hundreds of students, protestors, and bystanders.\nDr CR Abrar\u00a0is an academic with an interest in human rights issues.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Violence centring around the quota reform movement, a five-day total internet blackout, and the ongoing curfew have naturally shaken foreign investor's confidence in Bangladesh, which must be addressed. According to a report in this daily, the country needs to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) equal to 1.66 percent of its GDP annually to become an advanced economy by 2041. But in 2022, Bangladesh's FDI inflow amounted to only 0.75 percent of its GDP. Bangladesh Bank data shows that in 2023, net FDI inflow fell to $3 billion, a decrease of 14 percent from $3.5 billion in 2022. Against this backdrop, the confidence crisis caused by recent events becomes more concerning.\nWhen it comes to attracting investors, a country's reputation as a reliable investment destination is vital. Investors already had a number of issues with Bangladesh in that regard. Problems like corruption, bureaucracy, anti-competitive procurement system, violation of intellectual property rights, and inconsistent policy shifts have all been previously identified as barriers to Bangladesh attracting higher FDI. With several international rights organisations and foreign countries having identified a number of human rights violations during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters recently, the country's image as an investment hub has surely taken a further hit. And this crisis cannot be quantified, as explained by the president of the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).\nThe modern nature of business is such that all business activities around the world have become tremendously dependent on the use of the internet. The five-day total internet shutdown\u2014along with the fact that internet services across the country are yet to be fully restored\u2014has had a massive impact on all businesses. And although the country is slowly recovering with limited online and physical connectivity, full operations are yet to be revived.\u00a0On top of that, foreign investors with a stake in the export sector are anticipating losses and increased expenses due to overtime bills. Some of them will now have to go for costly air shipments to make up for lost time and meet their lead times. And the uncertainty that many businesses and investors faced during the internet outage have made them particularly antsy, with many foreign investors raising questions about the country's political stability.\nEven though the government has remained confident about the country's ability to attract FDI despite recent turmoil, we believe there is a lot that can, and should, be done to regain investors' trust. First, the government must urgently restore full internet services, and reinstate normalcy by lowering tensions within society at large. It also needs to take all necessary steps to ensure a positive business environment that is conducive to attracting investment, and that can largely mitigate the losses businesses suffered.\n",

        "full_article": "Dhaka has added yet another dubious sobriquet to its already infamy-laden epithets. The Forbes Adviser has found it to be the sixth riskiest city for tourists among the world's 60 cities it has considered on the basis of seven key metrics. These seven metrics---crime rates, violence, political instability, terrorist threats, health, natural disaster, digital security---have evidently been chosen in order to guide tourists intending to visit such cities. Tourists are warned of the danger they may encounter in some cities or advised to take life easy in others. Which cities knowledgeable tourists are likely to prefer for a visit need hardly any elaboration. There is no reason to think that amateur visitors and globe-trotters alone visit places, there are business tourists who travel to capitals and other cities for business purposes. When they know that a city is infamous for high crime, violence and political instability, they are unlikely to invest in such countries.  It is clear that Dhaka, which is the seventh worst liveable city according to the Economist Intellience Unit's (EIU's) Global Liveability Index for 2023 and also the one that remains the world's top polluted urban centre for days together, could fare even worse as a host to foreign tourists if the recent violence, arson and death over quota reform movement were taken into consideration. When the Forbes Adviser evaluated Dhaka's position, the country passed a relatively peaceful time. If a city proves dangerous to tourists, it is unlikely to be any better for the common people who have to come out on its streets for work and other businesses. If a brick comes flying to land on a pedestrian's head killing the person or the girder of an elevated expressway falls on a passing private car to take away lives of people inside, the city's hazardous status is pronounced loudly. The death of at least three children in their homes or on the roof of a building from stray bullets during the violent clashes between the law enforcement agencies and the quota demonstrators is a grim reminder of life's insecurity in this city. It is the mindset that matters. When life is treated as something cheap and dispensable or human rights go unrecognised by people at the helm of affairs, law and order cannot be what it ideally should be. Yawning socio-economic disparities have created a super class of plutocracy which can ensure the security of its members either by state intelligence and law enforcement agencies or by private gunmen. The ordinary citizen find themselves at the mercy of musclemen, muggers, extortionists and robbers. Apart from the law and order situation, people at times invite disasters because of their notorious habit of a casual approach to safety issues. Precarious scaffolds used for construction workers, a lack of required gears for safety tank cleaners, jam-packing vehicles and vessels, travel on rooftop of trains and buses ---the list is long. So the image created from all such affairs is hardly pleasant to the eyes of foreigners. The Forbes Adviser may not be fully aware of the hidden dangers of gaping manhole or drains and the protruding iron rods that can cause serious injuries or even death. People here are used to living with all such threats to life. But one thing goes to the country's credit---ordinary people here are incomparably friendly.",

        "full_article": "The country's economy was passing through a challenging time well before the start of the 'quota reform' movement. The situation has become far more difficult following the violent protests that have claimed many lives and left public and private properties worth billions of taka damaged. People in this part of the world have witnessed movements and protests on several occasions in the past, but never like the very recent one. The happenings centring the students' movement are bound to leave widespread ramifications, social, political, and economic. The trauma and shock emanating from death and destruction will last for a longer time in the public mind. Though normalcy has returned to a large extent following the imposition of a curfew and deployment of the army to restore law and order, there is a sense of uneasiness. Whatever the situation, life must go on with the economy's wheels moving. What remains in store for the economy in the coming days is haunting businesses and policymakers' minds. All the ominous rumours and developments have only compounded their worries. Businesses had faced prolonged trouble during the Covid pandemic. Yet they could continue with their activities albeit in a curtailed form. Uninterrupted internet communication helped them operate from home and maintain contact with local and foreign counterparts. In contrast, the events during the last couple of weeks came quickly. None was prepared for such a countrywide upheaval that has taken a heavy toll on the economy. It is hard to assess the economic loss because of the latest disturbances. However, the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has come up with an estimate of losses caused to the economy. It says the economic impact of the shutdown is around US$10 billion. Its estimate comes close to the one done by economist Dr Ahsan H Mansur of the Policy Research Institute (PRI), who puts the economic loss per day at US$1.0 billion. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has said its members have suffered losses worth Tk.64 billion because of the recent unrest. Others will surely come up with similar estimates, making the amount of losses a substantial one. The businesses always seek fiscal support from the government following any significant disturbance, natural or manmade. They usually want bank financing at a lower interest rate and other loan-related facilities, such as rescheduling with a nominal down payment. Under the prevailing circumstances, the banks might find it difficult to offer any concessions to the businesses. They, however, could be pressured into swallowing the bitter pill. The shutdown, marked by killings and widespread violence, has dented the image of the country abroad. Foreign investors, buyers and lenders might find Bangladesh violence-prone and unreliable. The international media highlighted the latest violent incidents in Bangladesh prominently. The positive image built through hard work and dedication of all over the years has come under threat because of violence that many think could have been avoided through timely and appropriate administrative measures. The inflow of export orders in the coming weeks or months will show the buyers' attitude towards Bangladesh. Following the troubled times in the past, foreign buyers of apparel hardly deserted Bangladesh. They now have viable alternatives such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Yet, they are unlikely to leave Bangladesh as a sourcing destination soon.The inflow of greenbacks, such as export receipts, remittances, foreign investment, and assistance, must worry policymakers and businesses. The country's reserves have been under pressure despite a substantial cut in imports. The Taka-dollar exchange rates stabilized because of the introduction of the so-called crawling peg system, which is somewhat near to the free float. However, stability is at risk because of the downward revision of export incomes through data correction last month and the latest violent incidents. Remittance inflow, the second most important lifeline of Bangladesh's economy after RMG exports, is also facing uncertainty. The inflow has not been smooth in recent months, as there have been fluctuations. Demonstrations staged by a section of Bangladeshi expatriates in support of the quota movement and a campaign urging the expatriates not to send their money through legal channels might impact the forex reserves. There is a strong possibility that the majority of the expatriate population would ignore such a vicious campaign. Another issue that the central bank and relevant authorities should note is that during uncertain and turbulent times, some people who have amassed enormous wealth through illegal means feel insecure and resort to transferring funds abroad. The Financial Intelligence Unit at the Bangladesh Bank needs to be vigilant against such moves, which can potentially erode the country's reserves. There is no denying that the economy, which was amid a turnaround during the last couple of months, now faces unforeseen risks because of the latest developments. In a relatively tight situation, the government must meet certain conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the next tranche of the latter's $4.0 billion-plus loan is due. Implementing a few conditions might invite the wrath of the consumers, who are already hard-pressed because of soaring inflation. Overall, the economy needs deft handling under the prevailing situation. We need to find out whether the men in charge are shouldering that responsibility. For quite some time, the finance minister has not been seen in public, nor has he spoken on the economy. It is a testing time for him, no doubt.",

        "full_article": "New research by Forbes Advisor has ranked Dhaka the sixth riskiest city on earth for tourists. However, Dhaka was never a great tourist attraction to be shocked by this poor ranking by an international rating body. True, it has been notorious for its dreadful traffic, poor air quality, not so enviable infrastructure and other features that cannot be called ideal for drawing many tourists from across the world. But there was also never any serious attempt from the government's tourism department to make Dhaka with its long history and rich culture a place worth visiting by sightseers from home and abroad. Nevertheless, unlike some other South Asian cities that draw a large number of tourists despite their poor reputation for high incidence of crime, Dhaka was considered at least a safe place for visitors. But if one is to believe the new research by Forbes Advisor, Dhaka has now lost its earlier reputation as a safe place for tourists. Now, let's take a look at the metrics used to conclude that Dhaka is not so safe a city for visitors. The factors that Forbes analysis considered to assess safety features of a city included crime, healthcare quality and risks of natural disasters. The score points ascribed to the safety factors range from 0 to 100. The higher the score of a city on this measuring scale, the riskier it is for tourists, while lower the points earned on the score card, safer is the country for tourists. Singapore, an Asian city, could beat, by the Forbes Advisor standard, the traditional European competitors and make it to the top followed by Tokyo, Toronto, Sydney, Zurich, Copenhagen, Seoul, Osaka, Melbourne and Amsterdam. On the Forbes Advisor's safety yardstick, these 10 countries, out of the 60 it assessed, are the safest destinations for tourists. And the most unsafe city on this scale is Caracas, the capital of the South American nation, Venezuela, as it scored 100 out of 100. As mentioned before, Bangladesh is the sixth most unsafe country by scoring 89.50 out of 100. Such risk assessment of tourist spots is actually promoted by insurance companies and these valuations are also not entirely free from bias. Venezuela has a very strained political relation with the USA and, by default, with rest of the West. Naturally, fewer tourists will be willing to visit that country. Same will be the case with other low-rated countries on the Forbes Advisor's safety scale. Even so, there is no room for complacency in the case of Bangladesh. For its score was no better even according to the study conducted by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on travel and tourism, the result of which was released in May. It ranked last among the 19 Asia Pacific countries. Worse yet, even among the 5 South Asian countries, Bangladesh was placed at the bottom as it scored 3.19 out of 7, while India topped the South Asian list by scoring 4.25, followed by Sri Lanka (3.69), Pakistan (3.41) and Nepal (3.34).The ranking was done among 119 economies of the world to assess their travel and tourism development index for 2024. It's no surprise that Bangladesh earned 109th place among those 119 countries assessed in the Travel and Tourism Development Index.Despite the fact that Bangladesh's overall performance was poor on both Forbes Advisor's and WEF's yardsticks, it still fared very well at least in relation to one area of the latter's (WEF's) assessment criteria. And that was about its 'Travel and Tourism (T&T) Resources' dimension. That means Bangladesh is a potential tourist destination considering its travel and tourism resources. So, what is necessary is to improve other dimensions of rating considered by the rating agencies such as 'enabling environment', 'travel and tourism (T&T) policy', 'infrastructure and services' and so on.Dhaka deserves a better place among the great tourist spots. And it does rightfully so. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The World Tiger Day was observed on Monday highlighting the importance of tiger conservation. These majestic animals, the largest and most recognisable of the big cats, are facing critical threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. The celebration of this day serves to raise awareness and draw attention to the dire circumstances affecting tigers worldwide. It also aims to rally public support and promote sustainable projects to ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures.According to recent reports, the release of the latest tiger census data has been delayed due to disruptions in regular activities following student protests and subsequent curfews. This census, conducted under the Sundarbans Tiger Conservation Project using camera trapping methods, is now expected to be published next month. Despite the delays, preliminary data suggests a hopeful increase in the tiger population in the Sundarbans, offering a glimmer of hope amidst ongoing conservation challenges.The Forest Department's use of scientific methods, such as creating unique IDs for each tiger photographed, exemplifies the meticulous efforts being made to protect these endangered species. However, this is just the beginning. The global community must unite to address the issues threatening tigers' survival. It is crucial to combat illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching, protect and restore habitats, and foster coexistence between humans and wildlife.The survival of tigers is not just about preserving a species; it is about maintaining the biodiversity of our planet for future generations. Let us all support the initiatives aimed to protect these iconic animals.\nAsif IslamStudent Jahangirnagar University",
