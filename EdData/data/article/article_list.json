It is undoubtedly a political boost to the ruling BJP and an endorsement of its audacious move in August 2019 to strip Kashmir of its special status and bring it on a par with other States. However, it is also a verdict that legitimises the subversion of federal principles, fails to appreciate historical context and undermines constitutional procedure. The most potent attack on federal principles is the Court\u2019s unconscionable conclusion that Parliament, while a State is under President\u2019s Rule, can do any act, legislative or otherwise, and even one with irreversible consequences, on behalf of the State legislature. This alarming interpretation comes close to undermining a basic feature of the Constitution as enunciated by the Court itself and may have grave implications for the rights of States, permitting a range of hostile and irrevocable actions in the absence of an elected body. The government and its supporters have much to cheer about as the Constitution Bench has endorsed its stand and rejected strong arguments from the petitioners, especially the point that the government had acted in a mala fide manner by imposing President\u2019s Rule preparatory to the intended abrogation of special status without the need to involve any elected representative from J&K.The government had adopted a complicated process to give effect to the ruling BJP\u2019s long-cherished ambition of removing the State\u2019s special status. It had gone on to divide and downgrade it into two Union Territories (UT). It began with a Constitutional Order on August 5, 2019 applying the whole of the Constitution to J&K and changing some definitions so that the State\u2019s Legislative Assembly could recommend the abrogation instead of its now-dissolved Constituent Assembly, as originally envisaged in Article 370(3). Ultimately, the Court ruled that parts of the August 5 order were unconstitutional as they, in effect, amounted to amending Article 370 itself, which was impermissible; but, in a peculiar twist, it held the consequential notification on August 6 declaring Article 370 as valid and that the President was empowered to do so even without the legal underpinnings of the previous day\u2019s notification that sought to bolster the validity of the action. The President could remove the State\u2019s special status without any recommendation.The Court has reasoned that the Constitution of India has been applied incrementally from time to time even after the Constituent Assembly was dissolved in 1957 and that the removal of special status is nothing but the culmination of the process of its integration. Even if this line of argument is seen as unobjectionable, the idea that in the absence the Constituent Assembly and in view of the subordination of J&K to the sovereignty of India, there is no fetter on the government\u2019s intention to hollow out its residual autonomy is opposed to all canons of federalism and democracy. There is no doubt that J&K is not vested with any sovereignty. The Court says Article 370 represents no more than a form of asymmetric federalism and that additional features \u2014 such as having a separate Constitution, residuary power of legislation and requirement of its consent to some legislative subjects before Parliament can make law on them \u2014 will not clothe it with sovereignty. All of this is true. But, how this can mean that historical obligations owed to it and promises made by constitutional functionaries can be blown away at the ruling dispensation\u2019s whim is beyond comprehension. Forgotten is the fact that the process of integration itself was by and large built on a constant dialogue between Kashmir\u2019s leaders and the Union government, the context and conditions in which it acceded to India, the terms of the Instrument of Accession and the progressive extension of constitutional provisions with the consent of the State government over the years.The Court\u2019s failure to give its ruling on whether the Constitution permits the reorganisation of J&K into two UTs is an astounding example of judicial evasion. It is shocking that the Court chose not to adjudicate a question that arose directly from the use of Article 3 of the Constitution for the first time to downgrade a State. The only reason given is that the Solicitor-General gave an assurance that the Statehood of J&K would be restored. It is questionable whether a mere assurance of a remedial measure can impart validity to any action. At the same time, the Court upheld the carving out of Ladakh as a separate UT. On this point, the verdict is an invitation to the Union to consider creation of new UTs out of parts of any State. The Court\u2019s position that there is no limit on the President\u2019s power or Parliament\u2019s competence to act on behalf of the State government and its legislature is equally fraught with danger. In particular, the reference to \u201cnon-legislative\u201d powers of the State Assemblies poses a significant threat to the powers devolved to the States. A future regime at the Centre could impose President\u2019s rule to carry out extraordinary actions through its own parliamentary majority that an elected government in a State may never do. Some examples could be ratification of Constitution amendments, abrogation of inter-State agreements, withdrawal of crucial litigation and bringing about major policy changes. The view that some of these may be restored by a subsequently elected government or House is of little consolation if actions taken under the cover of President\u2019s Rule cause great damage to the State\u2019s interests. This is a verdict that weakens institutional limitations on power, and, while rightly upholding Indian sovereignty over J&K, it undermines federalism and democratic processes to a frightening degree.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nArticle 370\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nhistory",

It was not, however, surprising. By a 6:4 majority, including the vote of a suspended Congress MP, the committee recommended her expulsion, holding her guilty of \u2018unethical conduct,\u2019 \u2018breach of privilege\u2019 and \u2018contempt of the House.\u2019 These were charges raised by a Bharatiya Janata Party MP, who was in turn depending on the statement of Ms. Moitra\u2019s estranged partner. The committee cited in its report a precedent of the expulsion of 11 MPs in 2005 for a cash-for-query sting operation by a news platform. There was video evidence that established a strong case then, unlike the charges against Ms. Moitra. She shared her login credentials with businessman Darshan Hiranandani to upload Parliament questions, a fact she herself admitted. The committee conceded in its report that it had no proof of cash exchanges and its report called for \u201clegal, intensive, institutional and time-bound investigation\u201d, into that aspect. Nevertheless, it was emphatic in calling for her expulsion, and even labelled the sharing of her login credentials a criminal act.The links suggested between Ms. Moitra\u2019s Parliament questions and the business interests of the Hiranandani group are frivolous. For instance, a question on steel prices or India\u2019s trade relations with Bangladesh is of interest to numerous business groups and consumers. The committee said it acknowledged the fact that several MPs share their login credentials with others, but went on to make a laboured case that Ms. Moitra had endangered national security. The argument that MPs have access to documents on the Parliament portal that are not in the public domain is a stretched one. In fact, there is no good reason to keep draft Bills secret. Bill drafts are meant for public circulation and debate before being brought to Parliament for discussion and voting. That there is very little of that happening these days is a sad commentary on parliamentary democracy. The report of the Ethics Committee also faced the same fate. The 495 page report was tabled and voted on the same day, rejecting the appeal of Opposition MPs for a more detailed discussion once Members had the time to read it in detail. The precedent that the majority in Parliament can expel an Opposition member on a dubious charge is ominous for parliamentary democracy. The expulsion of Ms. Moitra is a case of justice hurried and buried.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nLok Sabha\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nParliament proceedings\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s many post-Mandal reservation agitations have upended the original aim of providing temporary support to historically disadvantaged groups. Agitations are often carried out by socially and politically influential groups, aiming to use reservations as a route to enhance job prospects. On the other side, political parties are weaponising caste surveys to offer false solutions to frustrated youth.\nMaratha reservation\u2019s continuing woes\nMaharashtra\u2019s politics is in flux because of the unresolved issue of reservation for Marathas. Agitators for reservation issue ultimatums to the state government, which has so far treated even violent protesters with kid gloves. But the state cabinet is not united. Senior members have questioned the policy.\n\nRunning afoul of judiciary\nIn May 2021, the Supreme Court struck down a state government decision to provide reservation to Marathas. The judgment rested on reasoning similar to other such cases. The judiciary in general is unconvinced about the need to breach the 50% cap on group-based reservation. Exceeding the cap is only possible if governments are able to show a compelling case through the provision of credible data. None of the dominant group agitations that have been supported by political parties has managed to do so. That\u2019s unsurprising. Dominance and disadvantageousness don\u2019t usually coexist.\nA pan-India problem\nThe unwillingness of political parties to firmly deal with these demands means that the problem lurks just beneath the surface. In Tamil Nadu, representatives of Vanniyars continue to push the state government after the apex court disallowed a law that carved out a standalone sub-quota for them. The problem cuts across regions, with dominant group agitations having their roots in what they see as poor economic prospects.\n\nMore quotas won\u2019t create jobs\n\nIndia\u2019s employment market is not creating enough pathways for faster upward mobility. It\u2019s a structural economic problem. And it\u2019s not going to be solved by social engineering. Around 79% of the workforce is either self-employed or in casual labour. Relatively, few of the remaining employed are in government. Additional jobs have to come from the private sector. That means private investment. That\u2019s where political parties need to focus on.\n\n",

Despite the long \u2018aaanh\u2019 between Chinese sentences, the lilting Irish brogue, the guttural clipping of \u2018oo\u2019 to \u2018u\u2019 and \u2018ee\u2019 to \u2018eh\u2019 by Germans, the Italian tendency to throw around \u2018si\u2019 and \u2018basta\u2019 and the downright refusal to speak anything but French by the French, English is the most spoken lingo. A 1,452 million speak it around the world \u2013 in 1,452 million ways. No two Englishes are the same.\nIndians, with their elaborate ritual of nods, head shakes and shoulder rotations, find it easier to mime when abroad. Our accent, immortalised globally by Peter Sellers in The Party, precedes us. However, on a recent trip to Australia, I found it necessary to occasionally utter a word. The airport part is easy to navigate as signboards indicate \u2018exit\u2019 clearly. At the immigration point, officials greet fellow-Aussies with a \u2018howdy, mate?\u2019 and surprisingly no one stops to describe the state of their digestion or daughter-in-law\u2019s lack of cooking skills. After great confusion about customs declaration forms and any watan ki mitti sticking to their sneakers, Indians walk into the big-boned Australian sunshine still stunned by the lack of vegetarian food on the flight unless pre-booked.\n\nAussie accent with Brit and Irish is considered among the top hot foreign accents. Like their roads \u2013 scarily vacant, with cars stopping to let jaywalkers cross in what one hopes is not exaggerated courtesy \u2013 their drawls are broad, taking \u2018nice\u2019 to \u2018noice\u2019. When confronted by live Australians I forgot to practise slangs picked off Packed to the Rafters. But our endearing tendency to end sentences with \u2018no?\u2019 must go.\n\nOf course, a Sydney is different from an Adelaide, where shops and cafes shut at 4 pm. The former bustles 24/7, especially around a harbour called Darling \u2013 not because it provides us with sweethearts but was renamed thus by a Ralph whose last name happened to be Darling. Somewhat suspicious of the present continuous tense, Australians go walkin\u2019, never walking. When it comes to English, they get there faster than the rest of the world. Barbecue is barbie, thank-you is ta, okay is K. Kangaroo is roo, joey a baby roo. Is it a commitment issue? A disinterest in linguistic foreplay? What do they do with all the time they save?

        "full_article": "If the announcement of an official embargo on export of a commodity or its extension by a country triggers an outright double price escalation overnight and two and a half times the following day in another country, it is a disgrace. Disgrace, because traders of the item---in this case onion, the price of which was intriguingly skyrocketed at Tk 100 plus --- in Bangladesh can resort to such nasty ploys and the administration looks helpless let alone take any decisive action against the players playing foul. Not that there has been a severe crisis of this popular cooking item. It cannot become short in supply overnight. If the official statistics is correct, Bangladesh could be self-sufficient in growing onion because against its demand for 2.6 million tonnes, it reportedly produced 3.4 million tonnes. However, avoidable waste during harvest and in storage compel it to import 600,000-700,000 tonnes mostly from India annually. Between April and September, it imported 490,000 tonnes from its big neighbours.The stock has not depleted, let alone dried up. Also the new harvest of onion has started arriving in the market. By the next week, the supply of new harvest will increase appreciably. So this insensible move by the onion syndicate is highly deplorable. Already it has pushed up the price to the record price registered in November 2019 when a kilogram of onion was sold at Tk 250. Will the price go further up for yet another record? There is every likelihood it will. The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP) has launched a drive against hoarding and fined as many as 133 trading houses to no effect. Realising fines from traders has now become a useless ritual. In this case, the amount of total fines realised from 133 trading houses was Tk666,000 or, a paltry amount of Tk5,008 on an average. Does it hurt the traders who are making profit at astronomical levels? Conceptually, this is light punishment for a grave crime. Burglars and robbers, considered dangerous criminals, are only so if they commit homicide; otherwise they do not cause financial bleeding to the mass people like the looters and robbers in the guise of members of a trading syndicate. Their offence need to be reviewed in legal parameters for meting out far stricter punishment to the criminals. In countries where the dispensations are authoritarian, any crime of this order would have invited the worst possible punishment for the perpetrators. No community of a society can be so mindless to the sufferings of the rest of society in order to serve its own selfish interests. The business syndicates have been doing it openly with impunity and now enjoy blessings from powerful quarters or otherwise they would not have dared commit such crimes against the nation. Economists lament that social disparity is on the rise in leaps and bounds. A look at the nominees for parliamentary election can provide an answer to why. More than 99 per cent candidates submitting their financial statements have gained wealth many times over in the past few years. The poor and the marginalised have become poorer. If such open exploitation continues, it bodes ill of society ---one that is destined to lose equilibrium and sanity.",

        "full_article": "In Bangladesh, like elsewhere migration plays a significant role in society and economy. Considering that reality, neither data management to support policy making and field level implementation is of quality. It is not looking at the present with the urgency that is needed in such a critical sector nor with concern at the future that a low skill employment arena requires in the rapidly changing scenario. Migrants are of various types- legal, irregular/non-legal and in-between. Thus although various sources are used, the actual data has not been pinpointed so policy making is not there. We can only assume that most migrants are legal but the figure which the Finance minister quoted in the Parliament and which UN agencies mention varies by almost 50% showing the gap in understanding and interacting. But even if the numbers were not so high, it has a massive population that needs much more attention than it is getting now. Problem is, the authorities have looked at the issue only from a remittance point of view making the matter very limited in scale given the impact they are having now in every aspect and will have in future. While UN statistics says that Bangladesh is the 6th largest migrant sending and the 8th largest remittance receiving country, many estimates show that it could be the highest or close in sending and higher in remittance as well. IOM REPORT AND DATA The IOM report says that in 2020, 7.40 million Bangladeshi migrants lived abroad and played a key role in the country's development. The World Bank estimates that the Bangladeshi population abroad sent home over USD 18 billion in 2019, with 73 per cent coming from those working in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. These remittances account for over 6 per cent of GDP, representing the country's second largest source of foreign income.\"The efforts by policymakers to encourage and facilitate the sending of remittances have greatly aided the remittance landscape in Bangladesh. The Central Bank of Bangladesh more than tripled the ceiling on its 2019 cash incentive scheme - whereby remittance beneficiaries receive a 2 per cent bonus on transfers made using formal systems - up to USD 5,000. Additionally, some commercial banks are providing an additional one per cent incentive to increase the attractiveness of sending remittances even more.\" \"Overall, international migration has been a critical part of the development story of Bangladesh, with migrants moving to pursue opportunities for economic and social development, and then helping raise the living standards in the home\" said Fathima Nusrath Ghazzali, IOM Bangladesh's Officer In Charge.Problem is, the migrants are seen as cash cows of the dollar variety only and the rest are ignored.IS IT DEVELOPMENT OR REMITTANCE ONLY? Bangladesh may have passed its \"golden age\" of remittance as the corona period shock showed. It was a global health crisis which exposed the fragile form of economic inter-connectivity particularly which affects low \u2013 skilled migrant labour. The result was the decline in income at both national and household levels. However, actions that are being taken don't take into account that the opportunity to shift to another sector is limited in Bangladesh creating a labour supply that is huge and the demand that is often uncertain. This is all the more worrying because the RMG sector largely based on internal migrant labour is on a similar plane as it faces multiple threats from introduction of AIs to fall in the international market demand and political sanctions globally. The similarity of the threats are however not being visibly addressed by those who matter. Part of the crisis is that the capacity of the government - the formal sector- is limited and burdened by limited efficiency. This also includes the think tanks linked to the sector whether migration or RMG whose capacity appears muted beyond appealing to the Government which usually are not heeded. Very little work is being done on long term planning and impact on society and institutions including politics. DENIAL SYNDROME OF IRREGULAR MIGRATION Officially Bangladesh has around 15 million migrants as stated by the Finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal in his budget speech of 2023. Around one million women workers have got employment opportunities abroad in the same period.However, this doesn't include two critical zones of migration- Pakistan and India. While one is politically embarrassing- Pakistan-, the other is politically inflammatory-India. While Bangladeshi migrants in Pakistan number around 2.0 million, the number in India is not known as it is an issue that has many connotations. The Indian ruling party has used the issue of irregular migrants in India to justify various policies while in response Bangladesh has taken a position of denial that there are any. However, field level data collection does show that migration to India occurs significantly particularly from Southern and Northern Bengal. It helps the economies of both the countries. Migration to India too is largely from the lower economic classes. The impact, contribution and problems of this group which again would number into several millions are not included in any estimation. Even if they are 3-4 million, this figure added to Pakistan would make it 5-6 million. Together, it is safe to assume that around 20 million Bangladeshis are working abroad. Given the population size, 170 million is around 12% of the total population. That is the highest migrating population in the world. Yet Bangladesh doesn't seem to see the kind of current impact it is having and the future impact too. Nor is it assessing what could happen if the slow skilled global market declines. The short sighted remittance driven policies are a bomb waiting to explode. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It is common knowledge that people cry when they chop onions. But in Bangladesh, even a look at this essential kitchen item at the grocer's can bring tears to a buyer's eyes. Why that is so everyone knows here. And it is the unpredictability of the bulb's price, which is in the habit of skyrocketing often without rhyme or reason. Obviously, being not something sentient, onion by itself cannot do anything unless the market operators dealing in this commodity irrationally create supply crisis in the market. And that traders are driven solely by profit motive, not altruism, is also common knowledge. So, if they find the conditions suitable they will lose no opportunity to artificially drive up the price of a commodity to make profit, even super-profit. And there is nothing surprising about that. But what is surprising is the government's knee-jerk response to such predictable price hike of essential commodities, which in most cases fail to improve the situation. The latest instance of onion price shooting up by about a hundred per cent in the retail market was when India banned export of onion on Friday (December 8). Just within hours of the Indian ban, the local variety of the bulb was found selling at city's Karwan Bazar kitchen market at over Tk.200 a kilogramme (kg), while the day before the ban, the price was Tk. 130 per kg. And according to the state-owned autonomous trading body, the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), too, the price of local variety of onion which was selling between Tk.105 and Tk.125 per kg a week before (last Friday), has now risen to between Tk. 180 and Tk.190 per kg. Similarly, imported onions are also much dearer now than a week before (the price increased by around 78 to 88 per cent per kg). Considering the speed with which the traders both at the retailers' and wholesalers' ends pushed up onion price, one cannot help wonder at the efficiency of their manipulative nexus. When reporters asked retailers the reason for the sudden spike in onion price, their instant answer, as expected, was the Indian ban. It is as though the existing stock of onion in the market has evaporated overnight. But should the Indian ban make any difference seeing that there was already a virtual embargo on onion import from India following October 28 when that country fixed the vegetable's minimum export price at USD800 per tonne? For, at that rate, importing the commodity would make no business sense. So, the rise in onion price immediately after India's announcement of the export ban is totally irrational. In some places, traders say, the rain due to the recent low pressure in the bay submerged harvest-ready onion fields under water. As a result, farmers could not collect their crop for a couple of days and hence the price hike. The excuses are many and they are often used to justify the unjustifiable. The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP), the government's quasi-judicial body, as usual, carried out raids on different kitchen markets and punished errant traders. Small wonder that such actions by DNCRP could not strike fear into the hearts of market manipulators. Since the locally grown variety can meet only around 85 per cent of the country's total demand for the vegetable, the government should have a long-term policy to control onion market through timely import of the commodity.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Almost every year onion makes headlines in Bangladesh for outrageous increases in its price. This year is no exception. The prices of onion have recently increased by Tk 100 or more per kilogram overnight as traders began stockpiling following a piece of news that India has banned the exports of the vegetable till March next year. Since the rising prices of everyday essentials have already been making it harder for people to make ends meet, the nearly twofold hike shocked consumers. In kitchen markets, a kg of onion is now sold for more than Tk 200, which was only Tk 110-120 just a few days ago. As the manager of a students' mess, I know how hard it is for us nowadays to have three proper meals each day amid unabated price hike of daily commodities including onions. Sometimes, it seems, it is better not to use onions for cooking our meals. But the reality is that the way we have been habituated to onions, it is quite difficult for us to quit the bulb as our essential cooking ingredient. In such a situation, it is never possible to guess a whole month's expenditure in a students' mess. The students who live in university dormitories or messes are now passing a terrible time. Though they now have to spend more, their income has not increased. Earlier, a varsity student's income of Tk 4,000 from tutoring would be enough for a month. But now, they cannot manage one month even after earning Tk 10,000. To cool off onion prices, the authorities concerned, in my view, should take action against unscrupulous businessmen, hoarders and syndicates. Finding out the alternative import process and making people aware of upcoming crises is also important. \nSheikh Saymon Parves Himel,Student of Pharmacy Department,Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Tangail, [email\u00a0protected]",
