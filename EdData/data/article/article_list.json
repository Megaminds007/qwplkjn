        "full_article": "India\u2019s goods exports fell for the third time in five months during February. The $33.8 billion of shipments marked an 8.8% drop from a year ago. In recent times of generally exuberant export growth, the only steeper decline was recorded in October 2022. A sharp 29% collapse in oil exports, a 12% fall in chemical shipments and a 10% contraction in engineering goods outflows \u2014 accounting for almost half of India\u2019s merchandise exports \u2014 propelled February\u2019s decline. But the effects of faltering global demand went beyond, dragging down 13 more of India\u2019s top 30 export items. February\u2019s exports are still 7.3% above October\u2019s number, but the immediate outlook is reverting to the gloom that prevailed in the last quarter of 2022 \u2014 about large parts of the world slipping into recession. Resilient economic data from major markets over the past couple of months had infused a belief that the world economy may just end up avoiding the worst that was feared in 2023. But the Ides of March dispelled those hopes \u2014 for now, at least.Retail sales in the U.S., India\u2019s largest export destination, soared 3% in January as a positive surprise, but slumped in February. The failures at two U.S. banks and the disclosure of vulnerabilities by European banker Credit Suisse amid the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s scramble to rein in inflation, suggest this momentum may not turn around anytime soon. On Wednesday, Brent crude prices dropped almost 5% \u2014 recession risks have clearly resurfaced after the unexpectedly benign start to the year. With manufacturing already shrinking for two quarters, a sustained spell of slipping shipments could mean factory job losses and dent consumption. As it is, the 8.2% drop in February\u2019s imports \u2014 the sharpest in a three-month contractionary streak and the lowest import bill in almost a year ($51.3 billion) \u2014 does not reflect well on domestic demand that is hoped to insulate the economy from global shocks. Some of this may be due to prices rather than volume factors (oil and edible oil prices had zoomed after the Ukraine war). The government is looking to curb inessential imports to keep the deficit in check amid weaker exports. But this is tricky territory where factors such as quality, pricing and supply chain linkages matter too, and missteps could curb consumer (and investor) choice. With the deficit already constricted sharply over January and February from the record $29.2 billion level hit last September, policy bandwidth may be better used to support exporters to tap new markets and react more nimbly to fast-shifting dynamics in key markets. The long-dithered rejig of the 2015-20 foreign trade policy must not be delayed any further, at any cost.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nexports\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nbanking\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\noil and gas - downstream activities\n\n/\n\nimports\n\n/\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nrecession/slowdown",

        "full_article": "The high-altitude manoeuvring between two Russian fighter jets and an American drone over the Black Sea, which resulted in the splashing down of the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone on Tuesday morning, has underscored the dangerous risks of the Ukraine war. In conflicting narratives about the incident, the Pentagon says the Russian Su-27s intercepted the surveillance drone in international airspace, dumping fuel on the drone, colliding with it and forcing it down. But the Russian Defence Ministry said its jets were scrambled after a U.S. drone violated its \u201ctemporary airspace\u201d off the Crimean peninsula (declared for its war in Ukraine) and that the American aerial vehicle \u201clost altitude\u201d in \u201csharp manoeuvring\u201d. The MQ-9 recorded the incident. The video has been declassified and would help establish the truth. But whatever the reason, the fact that the U.S. lost a drone in the Black Sea, where it does not even have a naval presence, is a grave reminder of how close the nuclear powers have come to a conflict. While both sides have responded with maturity, the underlying situation that triggered this crisis remains unchanged.The U.S. has provided over $30 billion in military assistance, including advanced defensive and offensive weapons, to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, and imposed tough sanctions on Moscow. Washington says it is not directly involved in the war but is helping Ukraine defend its territories, while Russia alleges that the \u201ccollective West\u201d is seeking to destroy it. As the war drags on, with Russia\u2019s failure to take a quick victory, the relationship between Washington and Moscow has broken down. Last month, Russia suspended its participation in the New START nuclear arms control treaty, the last of the Cold War-era weapons control mechanisms between the two countries. Steadily deepening mutual distrust amid an ongoing conflict is a perfect recipe for disaster in great power rivalries. Even if the Biden administration has clearly ruled out a direct conflict with Russia, irresponsible and high-risk manoeuvring or even accidents could lead to, as the Pentagon said, \u201cmiscalculation and unintended escalation\u201d. The U.S. and Russia already have a deconfliction hotline to avoid mid-air collisions in different theatres where they operate. They should use that mechanism around Ukraine as well to avoid a repeat of incidents such as the Black Sea one. But a bigger challenge is to arrest the deterioration of their bilateral ties, which is now reminiscent of the bilateral hostility of the first two decades of the Cold War. If the U.S. and Russia address this problem and find some stability between themselves, it would help them bring the war in Ukraine to an end.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\ndefence equipment\n\n/\n\nnuclear weapons\n\n/\n\nemergency incident\n\n/\n\ndisaster and accident",

        "full_article": "Supreme Court\u2019s strong words on the role of governors \u2013 while hearing the case related to the fall of MVA government \u2013 is another reminder of a problem that\u2019s getting worse. Free India cut back in large measure powers the colonial British gave governors to control legislatures. Under the Constitution, a governor, in letter, enjoys powers to appoint ministers, summon legislatures, call for central rule and most importantly, give assent to bills passed in the state assembly \u2013 but in spirit for decades these have mostly been left for the executive and the legislature.\nStill, there have been tussles before between governors and state governments. However, the frequency and the sharpness of the discord have gone up of late. Earlier this month, SC, hearing a Punjab CM vs governor case, said levels of discourse should not degenerate into a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d. Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Rajasthan, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Bengal have all protested governors\u2019 using their office in a manner that\u2019s seen as slowing down or meddling in state government function. The tussles are multiple but governors not giving assent to bills passed by assemblies seems to be the biggest issue. It is also the most important \u2013 delaying assent to bills directly affects governance. Telangana\u2019s CM, who faces voters later this year, has moved SC on this very reason, accusing the governor of \u201cdeliberate withholding\u201d of assent \u2013 the governor has reportedly not signed seven bills since September, neither has she cleared the state budget.\nIn another matter, an EC opinion on Jharkhand CM has remained in governor\u2019s office in Ranchi for six months, an extraordinary fact, especially given that the governor in question was moved to Maharashtra in February. Among other friction points are governors\u2019 refusal to convene assembly sessions, and vice-chancellor appointments. Of course, not every row is a constitutional impasse. Bengal CM\u2019s run-ins with the earlier governor, who\u2019s now Vice-President, played out on Twitter. One blocked the other, who responded with a spirited tweetstorm.\nNone of this is conducive to healthy democracy. For too long, governors have been perceived to be following the Centre\u2019s writ, whichever the party in the Centre. One device to correct this and stem the spiral into ever more ruinous clashes is to urgently review appointments and removal of governors \u2013 making governors accountable to not just the Centre but also the state and Rajya Sabha.\n\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Maharashtra finds itself in a tough position following an unreasonable demand by government staff to revert to a guaranteed pension system, or OPS, after having joined service knowing that it\u2019s not part of their benefits package. About 1.7 million government staff have been on strike since March 14, agitating for it. OPS is a fiscally unsustainable guaranteed pension scheme where the monthly pay-out is linked to the last drawn salary. In a rare moment of political consensus 20 years ago, major political parties phased out OPS and also introduced fiscal responsibility legislation at both the Centre and states.\nOPS was replaced by the National Pension System, implemented across two different central governments, which functions on the line of EPF for private sector employees. Post-retirement benefits are linked to the returns on the accumulated corpus. Maharashtra in November 2005 under a Congress-NCP government switched to NPS which was to be implemented only for new employees. Given this background, the spate of demands for OPS is unreasonable. Reverting to it will come at the cost of the vast majority not employed by the government as resources are limited. Guaranteed pension pay-outs are a committed liability. Development spending can take place only after meeting it.\nMoreover, the reversion to OPS announced by some states is inexplicable as it\u2019s not legally possible for the pension regulator to refund the accumulated corpus of the employees to states.\u00a0 Given this, Maharashtra initially made a poor choice by establishing a panel to study both pension systems and signalling that it\u2019s willing to look for a middle path. However, in the face of blackmail through a strike, the state government\u2019s done well to look for private agencies to fill positions. Reverting to OPS is a path to fiscal ruin.\n\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are alarmed to see the chaos and violence that took place on the Supreme Court premises during the two-day election of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA). On Wednesday, the first day of voting, rival lawyers from BNP and Awami League panels engaged in arguments and scuffles which later escalated. At one point, police intervened, and attacked pro-BNP lawyers and even journalists covering the election, injuring at least 25 people. Due to the situation, voting started two hours late and without the participation of pro-BNP lawyers. Such incidents are unprecedented in the history of SCBA elections.\nReportedly, tension was rising between the two groups of lawyers after a senior lawyer, Mansurul Haque Chowdhury, whom both sides had accepted as convener of the election sub-committee, resigned citing \"personal\" reasons, just a day before the election. As a new convener took charge, pro-BNP lawyers took issue with it, and demanded that the election be held under someone accepted by both sides. But that did not happen. Voting ended on Thursday amid continued scuffles and chanting, with a little less than 50 percent of votes cast. Eventually, the AL-backed panel won all 14 posts.\nSuch conduct by lawyers \u2013 that, too, on the premises of our apex court \u2013 is most unlawyerlike and objectionable. Those obscurantist elements that engaged in clashes may be only a segment of the legal fraternity but they surely besmirched the good name of lawyers, who have a rich history of fighting for pro-people and democratic causes in the country. If democratic practices are missing in institutions related to the apex court, what can we expect from other institutions? What signal does it give to the people about the state of our justice system?\nMoreover, the way police entered the court premises and attacked pro-BNP lawyers and journalists is alarming. Noted Supreme Court lawyer ZI Khan Panna tells us that he has never seen police enter the court and attack people, not even during the military regime. Such behaviour is also extremely concerning ahead of the upcoming national election.\u00a0\nReportedly, the DMP commissioner has regretted police attacks on journalists. That is not enough. The DMP must hold an investigation into the incident and punish those responsible as per the law. Police authorities should also explain whether police can enter SC premises without any prior permission and beat people.\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time that SCBA elections were marred by chaos. Last year, we saw how it took an unusually long time to even declare the results of the election. If this chaotic trend holds, we have every reason to worry about the future of the legal profession. We urge the relevant authorities to treat this matter with the seriousness that it deserves. As for the SCBA election, we think proper actions should be taken so that both the electoral process and the results are acceptable to everyone.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "In the annals of the political struggles of Bangalees, March 17 shall forever occupy a special place as, on this day in 1920, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born. Bangabandhu, which means \"friend of Bengal,\" as he was fondly addressed, was indeed special because without him, it is rightly doubted if the advent of a sovereign Bangladesh could have been a reality. To understand the import of such a belief, one has to trace the history of our pre-1971 political struggle.\nEven a dispassionate study of our political emancipation would clearly show that years of political mobilisation by Bangabandhu \u2013 particularly after February 1966 when the historic Six-Point Programme was presented \u2013 had made Bangalees conscious of their identity. In Bangladesh's case, national sovereignty was inculcated into the consciousness of the masses through a deliberate political process. This mass character of consciousness-building provided the underlying strength to the nationalist movement. It also gave substance to the assertion of national sovereignty in March 1971 by Bangabandhu and the people of Bangladesh.\nBangabandhu, through an intense process of national consciousness-building, equipped a people politically to take up arms and be prepared to shed their blood to defend their newly acquired sovereignty. Herein lies his greatness, because in March 1971 \"a sense of Bangladesh's sovereign status took root and people became psychologically prepared to defend their sovereignty\" (Rehman Sobhan,\u00a0From Two Economies to Two Nations: My Journey to Bangladesh). When the Pakistan Army launched its attack on the people of Bangladesh on the night of March 25, 1971, the entire population rose up to resist it in the absence of any coordinated military direction.\nIn 1971, Bangabandhu transcended conventional political reckoning, and his charisma dominated the political campaign. He became a symbol in his own lifetime and personified Bangalee nationalism, \"just as Nasser personified Arab nationalism or the Quaid Muslim nationalism.\" He became the unchallenged spokesman of Bengal, and his voice was heard beyond Pakistan and within the international community. History chose him to lead Bengal's struggle for emancipation. \"For the first time, since the Battle of Plassey, Bangalees awoke to the fact that they were ruling themselves through their freely elected representatives.\"\n\nEven a dispassionate study of our political emancipation would clearly show that years of political mobilisation by Bangabandhu \u2013 particularly after February 1966 when the historic Six-Point Programme was presented \u2013 had made Bangalees conscious of their identity. In Bangladesh's case, national sovereignty was inculcated into the consciousness of the masses through a deliberate political process. This mass character of consciousness-building provided the underlying strength to the nationalist movement. It also gave substance to the assertion of national sovereignty in March 1971 by Bangabandhu and the people of Bangladesh.\nBangladesh \"owes a blood debt to the people who shed their blood for the liberation of (the country) and to the leader who played such a critical role in inculcating this sense of nationhood within the people.\" It is a tragedy that Bangabandhu, the symbol of our nationhood, was not only assassinated but also shamefully marginalised from our historical consciousness for 21 long years.\nBangabandhu's lifelong struggle was centred on establishing real democracy, as he believed that democracy expresses the long-suppressed desire of the people to govern themselves and to guide their own destiny. People looked ahead to a new dawn, after a long spell of terror and oppression suffered under colonial rule and military dictatorships.\nUnfortunately, there were in Bangladesh events to undermine democracy and subject the people, once again, to the oppression of a military dictatorship.\nBangabandhu was strongly against the cynical exploitation of religion for bolstering the interest of the ruling elite. He believed in creating an environment in which all religious communities could coexist in harmony, free from discrimination and intolerance. In 1973, at the Non-Aligned Summit in Algiers, in response to a query from Libya's President Muammar Gaddafi as to why Bangladesh embodied secularism in its constitution, Bangabandhu replied, \"Our secularism is not against religion. Our secularism stands for harmony among members of all religions. Indeed, in the opening of the Koran, Allah is described as\u00a0Rabbul Alameen, the Lord of all creation, and not\u00a0Rabbul-Muslimin, the Lord only of Muslims. This is the spirit which underlines our secularism\" (Kamal Hossain,\u00a0Bangladesh: Quest for freedom and justice).\nDiscerning observers would like to know if, in our political discourses, we are witnessing a temper that presses a partisan advantage to a bitter end, and that there is no serious effort to understand and respect the other side and also to create a feeling of unity among all citizens. Surely we cannot deny that democracy depends on habits of consent and compromise, which are attributes of mature societies. The objective of such a society is to establish a lawful government by the majority, under the rule of abiding law, and with freedom of opposition and dissent. By upholding the spirit of moderation, we will surely be paying a fitting tribute to Bangabandhu's contribution to our democracy.\nIt is also time, in line with Bangabandhu's cherished goal, to create and strengthen an environment in which all religious communities would adequately live in harmony by rejecting the bigotry and hypocrisy of pre-1971 times. The struggle against communalism has to be fought relentlessly.\nThe verve and vigour of Bangabandhu's personality was brilliantly illustrated by his continuous wandering beyond the safe provision of personal gratification. He was in our midst for cohesiveness and dignity, and not for power and acquisitiveness. Salute to the great patriarch.\n\u00a0\nMuhammad Nurul Huda\u00a0is a former IGP of Bangladesh Police.\n\n",

        "full_article": "On many issues, we don't see eye to eye with the prime minister. But when it comes to issues of sovereignty, national purpose, and dignity, we are her sincere supporters. When she says that Bangladeshis must stand tall in the world, it resonates in the heart of every one of us. Recently, when asked about outside pressure to hold a free and fair election, she replied, \"No pressure will work on me,\" and added, \"We will do whatever is required for the welfare of the people.\" On both counts, we are with her.\nBut the question, on which so much hangs, is: who is to determine what is \"required for the welfare of the people\"? The PM has made it clear that only the Awami League can deliver it. For the BNP, only the removal of AL from power will ensure people's welfare. Theoretically, people are expected to decide what's good for them. Free and fair elections are the only global and historically tested mechanism to ascertain \"public will\" that will ensure \"public welfare.\" And hence the need for its free and unhindered expression through a genuine election.\nNothing should be done just because our foreign friends are saying so, but because we want it, and we want it because we know its value and have fought for it (our War of Independence was for democracy and our right to vote, which Pakistanis denied us till 1970) and have suffered terribly due to its absence in the recent past.\nNational pride can be a great pusher for the positive. But it can also make us insular and resistant to vital messages \u2013 both internal and external \u2013 that contribute to public welfare. The biggest example is the transformation of our RMG sector following the Rana Plaza tragedy. The buyers formed two groups \u2013 the Accord and Alliance \u2013 and literally forced upon us crucial reforms that benefited the whole sector to the extent that our global status, devastated by the deaths of 1,100-plus garment workers, is now largely restored, and presently we have the highest number of fully compliant \"green\" factories in the world.\nWhile we are not particularly fans of the IMF, we welcome their conditionalities for granting the $4.7 billion loan. We feel that our financial sector, especially the banking sector, may finally see some crucial reforms that hundreds of media reports, editorials, and columns could not bring about, as was also the case with enforced disappearances and custodial and crossfire deaths at the hands of Rab and police. Like magic, it almost disappeared. So much for internal accountability versus external actions.\n\nTheoretically, people are expected to decide what's good for them. Free and fair elections are the only global and historically tested mechanism to ascertain \"public will\" that will ensure \"public welfare.\" And hence the need for its free and unhindered expression through a genuine election.\nIn the present-day world, all of us are entwined in a web of interdependencies, some of which are apparent, but most are invisible. To drive home the point at a personal level, consider the operation of airlines in and out of Dhaka airport. The number of agreements that needed to be signed, protocols observed, clearances acquired, and compliance ensured before a single flight could operate illustrates fully the nature of the present collaborative world. Every aspect of our lives, even for our remote villager who never ventures anywhere save the village\u00a0haat, is determined by global agreements and legal frameworks and their meticulous compliance on everyone's part, including ours.\nAnother example of the integrated world is our acceptance of the graduation process from being a Least Developed Country (LDC) to becoming a Developing Country. Who termed us an LDC? Shouldn't our nationalistic pride have made us reject it, saying, \"Who are you to stigmatise us as being 'least developed'?\" Why don't we now declare ourselves a \"developed\" country without waiting for some international body's consent? Not only did we comply, but requested two years' extension so that we continue to enjoy concessions given to LDCs as we prepare to graduate. This is not surrendering to outside pressure, but living together in a global village to derive maximum self-benefit.\nLike in the world of trade and business, so also in the area of democracy, rights, freedoms, governance, especially in the specific area of democratic elections, there is a huge stack of laws and global practices formulated by the United Nations with our consent, at least the ones professing democracy. Compliance with these practices gives global recognition to national elections that ultimately translate into respect and acceptance of national governments on the international stage. The most potent indicator of it is FDI, and for us the message should be unambiguous. In spite of us being termed a \"super star of development\" \u2013 by\u00a0The Economist\u00a0magazine \u2013 we have a very low FDI, notwithstanding road shows, visits, and conferences.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, regardless of her unmatched track record in the area of development, will be well advised to examine the questions and the scepticism that surround the last two parliamentary elections. These are not merely BNP propaganda or the work of what she frequently terms \"conspirators trying to discredit her government.\"\nWhatever the faults of the past two elections were, Sheikh Hasina was able to weather the criticisms and carry on in power without difficulty. That has emboldened her as to her ability to hold elections, however flawed, and retain power. But far more damagingly \u2013 a point we want to stress \u2013 it has encouraged her fair-weather supporters, who are corrupt to the hilt, to operate in double shifts believing that they will remain above accountability as she will find some way through another election and retain power.\nIt is these elements who are far more opposed to a free and fair election than others, as their lives depend on a \"managed\" election. This group includes \u2013 many but not all \u2013 politicians, business leaders, senior and mid-level bureaucrats, law enforcement bodies, intelligence community, and other wielders of power including members of my own profession.\nThis formidable group forms the core of the nexus who are fundamentally opposed to a genuinely free and fair election in Bangladesh, and will do everything possible to subvert all attempts to go in that direction. They serve as an obstacle to any flexibility that the PM may be willing to exercise. (It is rumoured that in the last election, the PM was willing to share some number of seats with the opposition, but the plan was sabotaged at the operational level).\nReturning to Sheikh Hasina's assertion that \"we will do whatever is necessary for the welfare of the people,\" the question remains: what will serve \"the welfare of the people\" best \u2013 a controversial election or a free and fair one? The answer is embedded in the question itself \u2013 anything that is free and fair is infinitely better than that which is not. And that should be our option of choice \u2013 not to please this or that power, but to work \"for the welfare of our people,\" as the PM said.\nPostscript\n\nWe are deeply disturbed by the happenings of the past two days. If elections to the Supreme Court Bar Association cannot be held peacefully on the sacred premises of our highest court, participated by those who practise law, then what can we expect in the national polls, where the stakes are so much higher and voters are both neutral and party supporters? These lawyers, practising in our highest court, did not confine their differences to be resolved through dialogue, but transformed themselves into bamboo-wielding violent activists, injuring journalists engaged in their professional work.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "We are alarmed to see the chaos and violence that took place on the Supreme Court premises during the two-day election of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA). On Wednesday, the first day of voting, rival lawyers from BNP and Awami League panels engaged in arguments and scuffles which later escalated. At one point, police intervened, and attacked pro-BNP lawyers and even journalists covering the election, injuring at least 25 people. Due to the situation, voting started two hours late and without the participation of pro-BNP lawyers. Such incidents are unprecedented in the history of SCBA elections.\nReportedly, tension was rising between the two groups of lawyers after a senior lawyer, Mansurul Haque Chowdhury, whom both sides had accepted as convener of the election sub-committee, resigned citing \"personal\" reasons, just a day before the election. As a new convener took charge, pro-BNP lawyers took issue with it, and demanded that the election be held under someone accepted by both sides. But that did not happen. Voting ended on Thursday amid continued scuffles and chanting, with a little less than 50 percent of votes cast. Eventually, the AL-backed panel won all 14 posts.\nSuch conduct by lawyers \u2013 that, too, on the premises of our apex court \u2013 is most unlawyerlike and objectionable. Those obscurantist elements that engaged in clashes may be only a segment of the legal fraternity but they surely besmirched the good name of lawyers, who have a rich history of fighting for pro-people and democratic causes in the country. If democratic practices are missing in institutions related to the apex court, what can we expect from other institutions? What signal does it give to the people about the state of our justice system?\nMoreover, the way police entered the court premises and attacked pro-BNP lawyers and journalists is alarming. Noted Supreme Court lawyer ZI Khan Panna tells us that he has never seen police enter the court and attack people, not even during the military regime. Such behaviour is also extremely concerning ahead of the upcoming national election.\u00a0\nReportedly, the DMP commissioner has regretted police attacks on journalists. That is not enough. The DMP must hold an investigation into the incident and punish those responsible as per the law. Police authorities should also explain whether police can enter SC premises without any prior permission and beat people.\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time that SCBA elections were marred by chaos. Last year, we saw how it took an unusually long time to even declare the results of the election. If this chaotic trend holds, we have every reason to worry about the future of the legal profession. We urge the relevant authorities to treat this matter with the seriousness that it deserves. As for the SCBA election, we think proper actions should be taken so that both the electoral process and the results are acceptable to everyone.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "A 17-member delegation from Myanmar is in Bangladesh now to verify the identities of Rohingya refugees in Teknaf, with the first batch of refugees reportedly expected to be repatriated in a few months. While this indicates that pressure from the international community has been effective to some extent, it is essential that the community does not take its foot off the pedal until Myanmar authorities live up to their responsibility of creating a safe environment for the return of the refugees, and completely end the persecution campaign against the Rohingya. It is also important to remember that Myanmar has backtracked on most of its previous commitments. Therefore, there is no reason to take its words at face value unless there are substantial actions taken to back them.\nThe reason for the ongoing visit by the Myanmar delegation, according to Bangladeshi officials, is that there were some issues regarding the earlier verification process. So, the delegation is apparently meeting the Rohingya in person and verifying their names, villages, towns, and other information. Foreign ministry officials say that Myanmar has shown growing interest about the repatriation in recent times, and also arranged a trip for the ambassadors of Asean countries as well as Bangladesh, India, and China to the Rakhine State last week to show them the conditions there. While all this sounds positive, we cannot ignore the fact that there have been two failed attempts of repatriation since 2017, when around 750,000 Rohingyas fled a military crackdown in Rakhine. And on both occasions, it was because of Myanmar authorities.\nThe latest visit comes ahead of the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) planned hearing (scheduled for April 28) on the genocide case filed by The Gambia against Myanmar. And we sincerely hope that Myanmar's recent activities are not intended to somehow pull the wool over the court's eyes. However, that is not something that can be fully ruled out, as we have seen the Bangladeshi government appealing many times to the authorities in Myanmar to take steps for repatriation, only for it to be ignored. Moreover, we have seen Myanmar authorities delaying the repatriation process over and over again, using trivial excuses and arguments. In fact, every time there seemed to have been a breakthrough in the process, Myanmar found a way to throw a wrench into the whole thing.\nAfter hosting the Rohingya for more than five years, Bangladesh is now in a position where it cannot afford any more delays in repatriation. That is why the government must work with the international community to continue the pressure on Myanmar authorities to expedite the repatriation process. Given the speed at which Myanmar seems to be working currently, it might take a whole decade for all the Rohingya to return to Myanmar. That would be completely unacceptable. While we cannot forget the humanitarian aspect of things, which means that safe conditions must be ensured for the Rohingya to return, the Myanmar authorities must be pressured to fulfil such conditions and complete the repatriation process much faster.\n",

        "full_article": "Finally, the customs intelligence has cracked the nut. Reports have it that the intelligence unit of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has detected siphoning of Tk 3.82 billion by four export-oriented companies through trade-based money laundering. There were few reported moves taken earlier by the central bank including detection of trade-based money flight, details of which were, however, not released. This time the important thing that the customs intelligence has done is naming the companies involved in the misdeed, the amount of money transferred through fake and manipulated documents, and the modus operandi applied.While vigilance of the Customs intelligence is appreciable, it is sad to see that despite repeated alarm bells sounded from various quarters, it is only lately that these cases of trade-based money laundering got caught under the scanner. The plummeting foreign currency reserve due mainly to the escalated import payments causing instability in the foreign exchange regime as well as shooting up of inflation is believed to have prompted the action -- though belatedly. The country's forex reserve dipped 23 per cent in the past one year and the central bank is learnt to monitor every letter of credit (LC) beyond $3 million. Conscious citizens, including economists, would agree that the work should have started long back. A report quoting the Washington-based Global Financial Integrity (GFI) said in 2021 that Bangladesh lost $8.27 billion every year on an average between 2009 and 2018 from mis-invoicing of imported and exported goods by traders to evade taxes and illegally moved money out of the country. How much money got laundered in the process is not known to the central bank. All that has been gathered are from published reports of several international agencies, but the fact that huge quantity of money is laundered from the country is well established.For sometime now, there were reports that the government was going for a mechanism to bring back huge amount of money siphoned off the country through various conduits. An inter-agency taskforce was formed for gearing up efforts to set out deterrent measures in this regard. The issue, because of its magnitude and scale, has been receiving media focus for quite a while--- set off by rough estimates made by international bodies about the money flown off the country to so called tax heavens and overseas financial institutions. There were moves, reportedly, within the country to combat the situation through collaboration of key state agencies such as the central bank, national board of revenue (NBR) and law enforcement agencies, but unfortunately nothing noticeable has been done as of now. The latest incident is, no doubt, a well targeted and commendable move.Observers are of the opinion that there has to be a customised mechanism -- automation to be precise -- that can ensure the fraudulent practice will not happen anymore. Automation has been on the NBR's agenda for long, believed to be potentially capable of addressing a host of malpractices including, among others, misuse of bonded warehousing and mis-invoicing. It is high time work for NBR automation got completed as a priority job to discipline the trading regime once and for all.",

        "full_article": "Educationists, scholars and experts in teaching are unanimous that the new education curriculum is quite appropriate for acquiring knowledge ---both theoretical and practical---and skills by young learners. But at the very outset, the controversy over two books' contents involving the progressive theory of evolution, anthropological findings and history as well as chapters of plagiarism has come as a setback. The withdrawal of the books, critics claim, is nothing but appeasement of some conservative religious quarters. There is uncertainty about the books that will substitute those two reaching the learners within any reasonable time.As if it was not enough, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) had to issue a circular directing schools not to hold any kind of examination or model test for students of class VI and VII. This the DSHE did when reports of arrangement of monthly and model tests by some school authorities came to its notice. The new education curriculum has devised a radical system, in complete departure from the traditional marking method, of evaluation of students' merit and performance. This latest directive has reiterated that the evaluation will have to be made following the guideline it will prepare. However, the question is, after two and a half months of the new academic year, teachers so long habituated to marking students' examination scripts are still in the darkness how they will assess their students. All books are yet to reach students everywhere and the guideline for student evaluation is not available. What is the impression! Are not the authorities making a hotchpotch of everything? The endemic problem of putting the cart before the horse has once again staged a comeback apparently to discredit a sound system with tremendous prospect if, of course, it could be introduced in a planned and smooth manner. What is particularly concerning is that teachers inquisitive of knowing about the 60 per cent continuous evaluation of students through schooling did not reportedly receive any answer from their teaching instructors. Understandably, the instructors themselves have no idea of how this will be done. Notably, there is no provision for any examination up to class III. From class IV to VIII, 60 per cent of the evaluation for subjects like Bangla, English, mathematics, social science and science will be through continuous assessment and the rest 40 per cent through overall evaluation meaning two exams---one after six months and another at the end of the academic year. How the exams will be conducted is still not clear. Although the introduction of the new curriculum has been on a piloting basis, much of the enterprise is too opaque to be congenial for carrying out a challenging system ---one that is supposed to lay the foundation of education for millions of learners.Now young learners may not quite appreciate the virtue or realise the problems encountering them. That no examinations or model tests will be held is music to their ears but teachers cannot but be extremely worried how they will perform their duty. Even parents and guardians of students are keeping their fingers crossed. A shift from an education system dependent on private tuition, technically developed coaching centres, guides and notebooks to one based on continuous assessment and overall assessment overnight is indeed fraught with many risks. Under the new system, as far as could be gathered, students will have no home work but will have projects---personal or group, practical assignments which they will have to complete following more or less the way university students accomplish. They will be required to talk to parents or people in particular occupation and even take note and interview, collect evidence of what they are dealing with. Then they will enter those in a format under a rubric. Thousands times better than learning by rote, no doubt. But the fundamental question is, are the teachers who have never in their life done anything even remotely similar capable of guiding their students? There is apprehension that like the teachers who failed to prepare structured questions in the previous so-called creative system, the majority of teachers will now not only fumble but lose their ways in the wilderness. Teachers who received orientation did so reportedly only for three to five days, of which two days were spent for introduction and conclusion. The least said about those teachers who are yet to receive any such teaching orientation. If the question-answer pro forma is totally done away with, how will students develop writing skill. Acquiring writing skill is no less important. Here is a coordination between the perceived world and imagination that demands logical analysis of things seen or unseen, known or unknown. Well, mathematics may do without writing capability but even science demands coherent and logical description of the process of doing experiment in the laboratory. When a young learner is asked to write an essay on the cow, s/he has to be a keen observer to know about this domestic animal and put into words his or her observation. An excellent teacher can help stoke the inquisitiveness, ready-to-learn mentality and guide his or her charges to express their minds with clarity. Evaluation of students' creativity should not, therefore, be confined to a limited boundary. The bottom line is to develop a whole new set of teachers and orient the capable among the existing batch who together can take up the challenge. To make it happen the profession has to be financially rewarding enough.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The government is out to narrow the infrastructural gap that has been hurting the country's development process for decades. A few major infrastructural projects have already been completed and some more are on the way to completion. The Padma Bridge, built at a cost of over Tk 300 billion and opened to traffic in June last year, is a landmark in the country's developmental journey. The government has taken up some more mega projects in some other sectors, including power, port, shipping, and aviation, at a huge cost. The aggregate cost of six metro rail projects to be implemented in Dhaka is likely to run into more than Tk 2.0 trillion. The estimated cost of projects approved at every regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the national economic council (ECNEC) comes between Tk 40 billion and Tk 80 billion. The cost of most of the projects, however, goes up two to three times finally because of implementation delays. None would dispute the fact that the country needs to execute development projects, both large and small. It would not be proper to ignore national priorities while taking up projects for execution. For instance, employment generation, that too at the grassroots level, remains a top national priority. Is the government doing enough to address that priority? The policy planners might claim that the projects, including the mega ones, included in the development plans, would help create an environment conducive to employment growth. Such a claim, however, if made at all, will be a matter of debate. Poverty reduction and employment generation are two interlinked issues. The State itself will have to generate enough employment opportunities and ensure a climate where the private sector can also add jobs in sufficient numbers. Employment opportunities need to be generated in all regions in a balanced manner, instead of their concentrating in a few major cities such as Dhaka, Chittagong, Gazipur and Narayanganj. The rate of poverty, which was over 40 per cent in the late 1980s, had started falling continuously until the Covid-19 pandemic struck in the early part of 2020. As the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy, there was a reversal in the poverty reduction trend, as many people lost jobs and other means of earning their livelihoods. The situation has not improved though the pandemic is almost over. The economy is under stress because of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and internal mismanagement. With inflation soaring, some economic activities have slowed down. In such a situation, there is hardly any scope for creating new jobs. Rather, the opposite might happen if the current situation persists for some more time. It would thus be wise for the government to lay a greater emphasis on transforming the upazilas into 'growth centres' with the main objective of creating employment opportunities. Most upazilas are now connected with Dhaka or nearby district headquarters through improved feeder roads. So, marketing of goods, industrial or agricultural, should not be a problem. Farm produce reaches Dhaka on the same day even from remote areas of the country because of better road conditions.The government should divert a part of the development fund to upazilas to establish small-scale manufacturing/commercial facilities after conducting proper feasibility studies. The authorities concerned could also lease khas land in upazials to well-organised cooperative societies for use in poultry and fish production. Such ventures, however, would require proper monitoring and supervision. There could be many more employment-generating ventures. The government does need to pay its due attention to employment-generation priorities. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

From these centres, people are also getting a total of 30 types of medicines free of cost. However, most of these complexes have been suffering from an acute shortage of doctors, nurses, medical assistants, pharmacists, general officers and staff. More than half of the posts of physicians and other staff have been lying vacant for long at these health care units. Another problem of these complexes is that most of them do not have any facilities for disease diagnostic tests. Around 59 per cent of upazila health complexes cannot provide patients with X-ray services, according to a study conducted recently. About 41 per cent of these complexes lack blood transfusion service while the ultra-sonogram services are unavailable at around 88 per cent UHCs. At present, medical treatment relies heavily on pathological tests. But test facilities are not available at the government-run upazila health complexes. So, patients have to get their diagnostic tests done from private facilities, which is quite expensive. Many people cannot afford such tests. Therefore, the government should focus more on improving healthcare facilities at these complexes by introducing pathological tests at an affordable price. \nMd Ashraf Hossain,120, Central Bashabo, Dhaka-1214,[email\u00a0protected]",
