The BJP has returned to power after over 26 years, while the AAP, a political force that rose spectacularly in 2013, has been swept away. However, this shift does not signify a sudden change in Delhi\u2019s political landscape. Since 2014, the BJP has maintained significant control over governance through the Lieutenant Governor, municipal corporations, the Union Urban Development Ministry, and the Delhi Police (Union Home Ministry). Additionally, it has won all seven Lok Sabha seats across three general elections. AAP\u2019s rise was rooted in its appeal to Delhi\u2019s middle class, transitioning from an anti-corruption movement into a political entity that initially captivated voters with its fresh rhetoric against the traditional political establishment. However, its governance style soon became synonymous with reckless populism, a cynical approach to politics, and an increasingly coarse political discourse. While it sought to consolidate power through unchecked welfarism, the effectiveness of governance declined, and its credibility began to erode. The final blow came when serious corruption allegations surfaced, culminating in revelations that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had spent approximately \u20b952.7 crore of public funds to refurbish his official residence. This exposed the contradiction between AAP\u2019s founding ideals and its actions while in power, leaving its integrity in tatters.For the BJP, this decisive victory presents fresh opportunities. The party can now focus on improving infrastructure, civic amenities, and governance, areas that could help it score quick wins. Its grip on the Hindi heartland is now reinforced as Delhi\u2019s political and economic dynamics are tied with those of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana. Meanwhile, Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s ambitions of positioning himself as a national alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi have suffered a severe setback if not a complete collapse. His strategy of securing Muslim voters as a captive support base has also faltered. More broadly, AAP\u2019s downfall has implications for the non-BJP Opposition. The assumption that the 2024 general election results signalled a fundamental shift against the BJP now appears unfounded. The Opposition parties must reassess their strategies if they hope to challenge the ruling party effectively. The Congress, despite drawing a blank, might be encouraged by AAP\u2019s defeat, but it could also face challenges to its helming of the INDIA bloc as it faces criticism for not helping build a common front against the BJP.

        "full_article": "The Budget 2025-26 announcements suggest a potential bonanza for scientific research and development. The Finance Minister outlined \u20b920,000 crore budgetary support for developing small modular reactors, with the goal of readying five such reactors by 2033. Another major initiative is the Research, Development, and Innovation fund, included in the Department of Science and Technology (DST)\u2019s expected expenditure. This substantial allocation is expected to benefit start-ups and sunrise sectors, though these remain undefined. The expectation is that private sector entities will receive financial support to boost R&D, a domain historically dominated by government spending. India\u2019s R&D landscape has long suffered from low private sector participation. While government funding has driven most scientific advancements, private investment in research has remained inadequate. Currently, private sector R&D contribution is only 36%; overall R&D spending in India was 0.64% of GDP in 2020, the lowest since 1995. Over the last five years, business enterprises have accounted for around 40% of government R&D expenditure. Public sector R&D units allocated only 0.30% of their sales turnover to research, compared to 1.46% by the private sector in 2020-21, according to DST estimates.The government\u2019s \u20b920,000 crore infusion hikes the DST\u2019s total budgetary allocation to around \u20b928,000 crore, over three times last year\u2019s allocation and seven times the actual expenditure in 2023-24. These figures are encouraging, but a key concern is whether such massive investments can be effectively absorbed. Despite India\u2019s strengths in technology-driven sectors such as fuel, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, textiles, IT, and biotechnology, returns from core R&D and intellectual property generation are still meagre. Though the government has launched ambitious missions in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies, the supporting infrastructure remains inadequate. India still lacks the essential building blocks, chipsets, semiconductor fabs, a skilled engineering workforce, and a strong innovation ecosystem, to fully capitalise on these investments. Without these, the lofty targets set for R&D growth risk falling short. The government must present a clear road map on how private sector entities can access these funds and what tangible benefits the public can expect. Increased funding alone will not guarantee success unless structural bottlenecks are addressed. To truly transform India into a research powerhouse, the focus must shift to strengthening foundational infrastructure, incentivising private innovation, and ensuring long-term, sustainable engagement from industry leaders.\r Published - February 10, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Union Budget\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        science (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        research\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government departments\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        technology (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        biotechnology\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        IT/computer sciences\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        pharmaceutical\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        metal and mineral\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        computing and information technology\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Artificial Intelligence\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        semiconductors and active components",

        "full_article": "Biren Singh should have gone earlier. He\u2019s made Manipur peacemaking tougher for successors\nThat Biren Singh stepped down almost 21 months after Manipur was engulfed by ethnic violence highlights five key points. First, no political resignation in recent memory has been as overdue. After the turmoil in Manipur began, the responsibility of restoring law and order was largely Singh\u2019s domain. But not only did he fail to impose the writ of the state, his public posturing exacerbated the situation. This led to greater polarisation and avoidable loss of lives and property.\u00a0\nSecond, Singh\u2019s resignation now certainly provides an opening for a resolution of the Manipur crisis. But the delay means it will be far tougher. There is now almost total separation between the state\u2019s Kuki and Meitei communities. Both sides have armed themselves. And a political resolution would mean big compromises. Meiteis won\u2019t accept division of the state, while Kukis will certainly push for greater autonomy. This will require deft negotiations on the part of New Delhi.\nWhich brings us to the third point \u2013 disarming both sides. Kuki and Meitei gangs raided and looted the armoury of security forces in Manipur. Plus, Manipur police was accused of behaving in a partisan manner throughout the strife. Unless stolen guns are recovered and Manipur police reformed, no headway can be made in negotiations. Fourth, the situation in neighbouring Myanmar may have played a part in Singh\u2019s resignation. With the rebel Arakan Army practically taking over Rakhine state in recent months, New Delhi perhaps realised that banking on the Myanmar junta to secure the border, and stop militants and arms from crossing over into Mizoram and Manipur, was no longer a good bet. Thus, Singh had to go before the situation in Manipur became beyond repair.\u00a0\nFinally, it\u2019s not clear at this point if Singh will be replaced by a new CM or will central rule prevail. But whether it\u2019s Manipur governor or the next CM, either has his task cut out. Addressing the deep distrust between Kukis and Meiteis will take massive effort, involving security forces, civil society groups and political solidarity. Given the level of polarisation, this won\u2019t be easy. But Singh\u2019s exit is at least a start.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Delhi verdict tells all parties urban voters want liveable cities. But local bodies are funded poorly & run worse\nLast year, Supreme Court hauled up Delhi\u2019s govt and its municipal corporation at least four times over piling garbage. On Feb 5, voters booted out the govt. Pundits say the middle class swing that kneecapped AAP in Delhi may have started with civic problems like garbage and broken roads. So, parties that have promised Singapores and Shanghais \u2013 and roads as smooth as an actress\u2019 cheeks in Patna \u2013 for years should stop mistaking voters\u2019 patience for amnesia, and start fixing city governance.\nMunicipal bodies are called the third tier of govt for a reason. Roads, water, sewers, schools, clinics are their mandate. But in state after state, their powers have been curbed even though cities house more than a third of India\u2019s people and generate about two-thirds of GDP. Forget smaller cities, elections to BMC \u2013 Mumbai\u2019s corporation \u2013 are three years overdue. A mammoth budget of almost \u20b975,000cr is left to the discretion of unelected administrators. That\u2019s no way to run a great city. NYC, London and Paris take civic bodies seriously. Their mayors have real executive powers. Remember Rudy Giuliani in his NYC mayor avatar after 9/11? Boris Johnson chose to be London mayor for eight years after two terms as an MP.\u00a0\nEmpowering India\u2019s municipal corporations would mean deepening their pockets. Currently, according to an RBI report, their revenue receipts amount to just 0.6% of GDP. Property tax, the biggest municipal revenue stream, accounts for a fifth of this. Loss of levies like entertainment tax and octroi after GST has left civic bodies at the mercy of state govts and Centre. In Delhi\u2019s case, AAP govt claimed Centre didn\u2019t allocate any funds to MCD even though it set aside \u20b982,207cr for local bodies in last year\u2019s budget. As cities grow, so will their municipal financing needs, and bonds are an option worth considering now. US cities use them to raise funds regularly, and the country\u2019s municipal bond market is worth $4tn. It helps that scores of US municipalities have AAA rating. To tap markets, Indian cities would need to be more transparent about their accounts. Double-engined Delhi and Mumbai should start now.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Book\u2019s gung ho about life after the breakup\nAll those authors who are living under a false name and buying fake moustaches can now come out of hiding. There\u2019s a chance they may no longer be pestered to furnish breathless praise for books they\u2019d read only at gunpoint. With a major Simon & Schuster imprint ditching this practice, the end of arm-twisted blurbs may be nigh. Some say this will usher in a new era of organic word-of-mouth reccos; others suspect a clever, specialised form of sales pitch that will aim to sound artless and unprompted. Like all that makeup for a no-makeup look.\nWriters are often interrupted by their agents, publishers, editors, author friends with blurb requests. While back blurbs are coined by insomniac editors to sum up what goes on in the novel, it\u2019s the endorsements that are real fiction. If a book isn\u2019t casting a magical spell, it\u2019s stealing our breath and leaving us gasping. Coming-of-age generational sagas are always subverting genres. All books are unputdownable, luminous, stupefying, brilliant, a tour de force and primal cry.\nBook jackets are battlefields of quotes from rival authors in what is a mini genre of its own. While the blurbist must maintain his voice and style, she must also make a blurb sound different from her other blurbs; she can\u2019t be \u2018stunned\u2019 by every book without admitting to paralysis. Giving a quote for another writer establishes her as the superior author; this is so intoxicating that some write more blurbs than books. Once a decent number of quotes has been collected \u2013 three minimum and ten the norm \u2013 the editorial team decides which quote goes on the front cover, which on the back cover and which to lump with the rest inside the book. A blurb hierarchy comes into play.\nNo rest for the average writer. After writing multiple drafts, bagging a publisher, pretending to agree to every edit suggested by the editor and duly changing pubic to public, they must now beg other writers to lie flamboyantly about their new book. A writer is defined by the writers she knows! Even if curated blurbage is eradicated, books will not automatically confess to being humdrum, pretentious or lacking a plot. They will still claim to change your life, but in more cunning, farm-to-table marketing. A previously \u2018heart-touching and heartwarming\u2019 read will henceforth be recommended by your doc during an ECG.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\u2013 By Hansaji Yogendra\nThe preamble to the constitution of India begins with the words, \u201cWe, The People of India\u201d. The opening words of the constitution bear testimony to the precedence Indian polity places on the sovereignty of the people in the Union of India. This sovereignty is a natural corollary of the process of free and fair elections through the length and breadth of the country. Political leaders, whether in power or in opposition, bear an acute responsibility towards this objective of making the people sovereign.This becomes particularly significant as the results of elections to Delhi\u2019s legislativeassembly will be declared today. As Delhi decides, it is paramount that political leaders remember that the peoplebecome sovereign when despite the outcome of elections, politiciansare deeply aware and committed to seva, service of the people of India.\nOne profound example of exemplary governance from Indic mythology is the story of King Shibi. Renowned for his unwavering commitment to justice and compassion, King Shibi once offered his flesh to save a dove being pursued by a hawk.This act of selflessness was not merely symbolic; it underscored his dedication to protecting the vulnerable at all costs, embodying the true essence of leadership as service and sacrifice. King Shibi\u2019s story reminds us that leadership is a sacred duty prioritising the well-being of others above personal gain or convenience.\nThose who win elections must learn from King Shibi that their mandate is not a trophy but a responsibility, their dharm. Winners must approach their roles with gratitude, recognising the trust placed in them.\nA leader\u2019s dharmis to prioritise the welfare of all, especially the most vulnerable. Thisrequires humility, transparency, and an unwavering commitment to serve. The essence of political sevalies in dissolving one\u2019s ego and dedicating every action to the betterment of society. This should guide every decision. Just as a farmer tends to the land with care, leaders must nurture aspirations of the people. They can create an environment where every individual feels valued and heard.\nConstructive engagement with critics and opponents strengthens the democratic fabric, transforming governance into a collaborative effort.\nOn the other hand, in Indian philosophy,setbacks are opportunities for self-reflection. Those who lose elections are not failures but participants in a greater karmic cycle. Drawing from the ideal of introspection, they must examinetheir actions and strategies, seeking to understand where they fell short. Like Yudhishthir in the Mahabharat, who faced defeat and exile after thedice game, politicians must use setbacks as moments of deep self-reflection.\nThe role of opposition is as sacred as that of the governing party. Their duty is to hold govt accountable, not out of spite but as an act of sevato the nation. By offering constructive criticism and advocating for the marginalised, they ensure that the voice of every citizen resonates in the corridors of power.\nWhile winners carry the immediate responsibility of governance, opposition plays the more important role in shaping ajust and equitable society by ensuring govt accountability. Both must remember that their ultimate allegiance is to the people whose trust they seek to honour.\n\n",

        "full_article": "All the colonies around the world had to pay the highest price for liberating themselves from the shackles of colonisation. However, not all colonies fared the same as India. Revolutionary activities for India's independence movement took place on a vast canvas that extended across many parts of the world.\nWe usually discuss the sacrifices of anti-British revolutionaries who were active within the Indian subcontinent. However, there were also individuals who made immense sacrifices abroad, engaging in a myriad of activities to liberate India from the yoke of British rule. Narratives of their sacrifices are seldom explored in academic discourse or popular literature such as prose, poetry, or novels in Bangladesh.\n\nOn 17 September 1938, Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani was executed by firing squad at Kommunarka, near Moscow, on Stalin's orders. However, in 1957, the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court declared his trial a miscarriage of justice and posthumously exonerated him.\nNevertheless, there exists a grand and glorified tale of these heroes that deserves to be told not only to the people of the Indian subcontinent but also to the world\u2014one that will surely inspire future generations. Imagine a revolutionary swimming off the coast of Singapore to escape the police and reaching the islands of Sumatra in Indonesia with the help of fishing boats. Consider another who crossed the Suez Canal in Egypt to evade the surveillance of British agents. These are just a few examples of how revolutionaries outside India became unstoppable in their quest to free their motherland.\nSubhas Chandra Bose is renowned for his revolutionary activities abroad. However, long before him, a group of individuals were engaged in diverse efforts across Europe to accelerate India's freedom movement. Initially, they sought assistance from Germany and later from the erstwhile Soviet Union. One such hero was Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani, who hailed from Sirajganj, Bangladesh. He was not alone\u2014two other Bengali revolutionaries met the same fate in Moscow: Virendranath Chattopadhyaya from the then Bikrampur (now Munshiganj) and Abani Mukherji from Satkhira.\nThe Journey of a Book\n\nThe recently published book Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani: Ek Ojana Biplobir Kahini (Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani: The Narrative of an Unknown Revolutionary) offers insight into the colourful life and multifaceted activities of revolutionary Luhani. In the introduction, the book's author, Matiur Rahman\u2014editor of Prothom Alo\u2014narrates his 42-year quest to uncover Luhani's life and work.\nRahman first heard about Luhani in 1981 in Delhi from Dr Gangadhar Adhikari, a scientist and communist leader. Dr Adhikari had come across Luhani's diverse activities while documenting the history of the Communist Party of India in several volumes. He was also known for his arrest in the Meerut Conspiracy Case of 1929, which led to a notable protest\u2014none other than Albert Einstein himself wrote to the British government, demanding his release. Dr Adhikari had previously worked at Einstein's research institute in Berlin in the 1920s.\nSince 1981, Matiur Rahman has been on a relentless quest to gather information about Luhani. He searched archives across Berlin, Moscow, Delhi, and Kolkata. While he may not have uncovered everything, he managed to collect an unprecedented volume of material on this forgotten revolutionary. In the book, Rahman not only captures Luhani's multi-dimensional work but also sheds light on various aspects of his family life. He includes letters written by Luhani from Paris to his mother in Sirajganj, correspondence from Luhani's wife Gabrielle to his mother, and exchanges between Luhani's family members and a British officer, as well as a shipping agency in Kolkata, in their attempt to bring him back home.\nThe depth of Rahman's dedication to this book is evident from an incident in the mid-1980s when he met Russian historian and India expert Leonid Mitrokhin in Moscow. In 1991, Mitrokhin published an article in Soviet Land magazine, printed in Delhi, where he was the first to reveal the tragic fates of the three Bengali revolutionaries\u2014Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Abani Mukherji, and Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani\u2014all of whom had roots in present-day Bangladesh. At the end of the article, Mitrokhin expressed hope that Matiur Rahman was planning to write a book on Luhani, believing it could offer new insights into the life and work of this revolutionary. Decades later, in October 2024, this long-awaited book finally came to light.\nThe book reveals that after passing his Entrance Examination (equivalent to today's secondary school exam), Luhani studied at Aligarh University in India before enrolling at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1914. He was the maternal uncle of prominent Bangladeshi media and film personalities Fateh Lohani and Fazle Lohani, as well as their sister, the distinguished singer and professor Husna Banu Khanam. Through Fazle Lohani, Matiur Rahman was able to connect with Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani's nephew, Major General (retd.) Helal Morshed, who had preserved the family's letters for many years.\nJust as the book was nearing publication, in May 2024, Julia Boddewyn, an art researcher from New York, contacted Matiur Rahman to inquire about Luhani's wife, Gabrielle Soene. This communication revealed that Gabrielle was a model and fashion designer. The famous Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani had made several drawings of her. Additionally, she had modelled for Roger Fry's paintings, Jacob Epstein's sculptures, and Edward Wolfe's portraits. A key document included in the book, sourced from the England and Wales Marriage Registration Index (which records marriages from 1837 to 2005), provides official evidence of Luhani and Gabrielle's marriage ceremony, which took place in Pancras, London, in 1919.\nTracing Ghulam Ambia Khan Luhani\n\nVarious documents from Matiur Rahman's collection reveal that Luhani was engaged in the labour movement and supported the Soviet Revolution in London without being affiliated with any particular political group. He worked as a journalist and teacher for his livelihood. From 1920 to 1925, he lived in France, Germany, and Switzerland, writing for newspapers in those countries on India's political and labour movements. Besides English, he was proficient in French, Persian, German, and Hindi.\nLuhani first visited Moscow in 1921 as part of an expatriate Indian revolutionary group led by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya. Although the group returned after failing to secure support from the Comintern, Luhani stayed behind for a while and worked in its publicity department, known as Agitprop. While in Paris, he served as editor of The Masses of India, the official publication of the Indian Communist Party. He was also involved in an organisation that promoted India's freedom movement. This organisation, named Committee Pro-Hindu [where 'Hindu' denoted 'Indian'], was founded by the French writer, journalist, and political activist Henri Barbusse, whose works profoundly influenced the Lost Generation writers, including Ernest Hemingway and Erich Maria Remarque.\nDuring his time in Paris, Luhani was accused of anti-British imperial activities and denied permission to remain in the country. In October 1925, he relocated permanently to Moscow. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1928 and became a Soviet citizen in 1933. During this period, he undertook various roles within the Communist International (Comintern), the global centre of the communist movement.\nThis book on Luhani vividly portrays his flamboyant life. He worked as a journalist, translator, researcher, and teacher in various organisations, including the Comintern. He was involved with Peasant's International and MOPR (the international organisation for aiding revolutionaries). Additionally, he worked in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Narimanov Institute, Institute of Oriental Studies, and the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. He also lectured at the University of Moscow on Indian affairs.\nLuhani represented India at the Sixth Comintern Congress in Moscow, where he openly expressed his differences with M.N. Roy. On 30 August 1964, Link's Moscow correspondent, P. Unnikrishnan, wrote an article stating that Luhani served as a consultant to the Comintern on national and colonial issues. Through this book, Matiur Rahman reconstructs Luhani's extraordinary life and multifaceted contributions, using documents he has meticulously collected over the past 42 years with great passion and dedication.\nBeyond Luhani, this book also explores the activities and initiatives of Indian revolutionaries based in Berlin and Moscow. In 1921, Luhani, along with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and Pandurang Khankhoje, co-authored a thesis titled India and the World Revolution and sent it to Vladimir Lenin, leader of the Russian Revolution. Remarkably, they received a response from Lenin. Notably, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya was the younger brother of renowned political activist and poet Sarojini Naidu, also known as the Nightingale of the East.\nLuhani's intellectual and analytical prowess is evident in his articles and reports included in this book. The eminent revolutionaries M.N. Roy and Saumyendranath Tagore praised his sharp intellect and theoretical insight. Saumyendranath was the grandson of Dwijendranath Tagore, the elder brother of Rabindranath Tagore, and the son of Sudhindranath Tagore.\nPosthumous Redemption\n\nSoviet intelligence documents used in this book reveal that suspicion and distrust surrounded Luhani during Stalin's era, a period when many were executed for alleged dissent. Luhani was not spared from this tragic fate. On 17 September 1938, he was executed by firing squad at Kommunarka, near Moscow, on Stalin's orders. However, in 1957, the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court declared his trial a miscarriage of justice and posthumously exonerated him.\nThe same fate befell Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and Abani Mukherji. Virendranath, widely known as Chatto, was a prominent revolutionary and early internationalist who worked abroad for India's struggle against British imperialism. He was also closely associated with Jawaharlal Nehru. Chatto spent most of his life in Europe, leading the Berlin-based revolutionary group, where Luhani and Abani were also active. In his later years, he worked as a social scientist and university lecturer in the Soviet Union. Like Luhani, he was executed during Stalin's purges in 1937 and was posthumously rehabilitated with honour in 1956.\nAbani Mukherji, another significant revolutionary, was associated with the Berlin group and had been living in the Soviet Union since 1920. He famously escaped from a Singapore prison by swimming and using fishing boats to reach Kolkata via the Indonesian islands while returning from Japan to rally support for India's independence. He later became a professor at the University of Moscow but was executed in 1937 during Stalin's purges. He, too, was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957.\nThis book includes numerous letters and documents related to Luhani, including the thesis India and the World Revolution, along with various articles and reports written by him. The second and third chapters focus on these writings. The final chapter features an article by Dr. Binayak Sen, Director General of BIDS, analysing the ideological backgrounds of the revolutionaries of that period. Additionally, the book includes Leonid Mitrokhin's article A Triple Trap, which discusses Luhani, Virendranath, and Abani, as well as a conversation between Matiur Rahman and Dr. Shobhanlal Dutt Gupta, a Comintern expert and professor at the University of Kolkata. This discussion sheds light on various topics, including the revolutionaries of that era, the Comintern, and the future of socialism.\nThe book is further enriched with rare colour photographs of Luhani, drawings and portraits of Gabrielle, images of their residences in different cities, and significant letters.\nReading this book provides insights into the tragic fate of a Bengali revolutionary and transports us to a historical period that continues to influence various layers of our politics and society. It reveals the extraordinary, adventurous lives of these revolutionaries and the profound sacrifices they made. Moreover, it highlights many crucial yet overlooked events that were pivotal in shaping our history.\nUndoubtedly, this book is an essential contribution to the political history of the Indian subcontinent.\nKhalilullah is the Climate Project Manager at The Daily Prothom Alo.\n",

        "full_article": "For the past few years, Bangladeshi consumers have suffered terribly due to price inflation. Ministers and members of parliament of the previous government relentlessly blamed \"syndicates\" for increasing the prices of chicken, eggs and other foods. Regulatory bodies like the Bangladesh Competition Commission subsequently ordered several large poultry companies to pay fines. These orders were stayed by the High Court; but this sequence of government actions culminated in the Department of Agricultural Marketing dictating ceiling prices for eggs and chicken. In any industry, ceiling prices tend to discourage further investment and may become counter-productive: without plentiful investment and expansion of production and supply, prices tend to remain high.\nAbsent from the above events was a real economic analysis of why the inflation occurred. Yet inflation is an economic phenomenon with well-understood causes, and it's worth looking at these.\nThe first possible cause of price rises is a shortage. Whenever there's a shortage of any good, consumers who want it bid up the market price. Economists call such inflationary shortages \"supply shocks.\" In fact, the start of the Ukraine war in 2022 caused an international shortage of both grain and fuel as export of these from Russia and Ukraine were disrupted. Expensive maize and soybeans made poultry feed, fish feed, and cattle feed more costly. Thus, there was an element of supply shock inflation in 2022, which was not the result of syndicates but of the Ukraine war.\nThe second possible cause of inflation is a bit more technical; all prices rise when there's too much money being printed by the government. Money is exchanged for goods; so, when there's excess money, the value of money goes down, and the prices of all goods increase. For example, if the money circulating in Bangladesh suddenly increases by 50 percent, the price of an egg could be expected to rise from Tk 8 to Tk 12. This is monetary inflation, and it's also not caused by syndicates, but by economic mismanagement. Monetary inflation happens when a government spends more than what it receives in taxes, and decides to fill the gap (technically called the budget deficit) by irresponsibly printing money.\nIn published data, there is strong evidence that the AL government printed money irresponsibly. The following figures are found in the Monthly Economic Trends dated October 2024, published by the Department of Statistics of Bangladesh Bank.\nWhat we see is that the total increase in currency in circulation was 44 percent over only three years (quite close to the 50 percent of the earlier egg price inflation example). So as per our earlier egg example, we might indeed expect a Tk 8 egg to rise close to Tk 12 over this period. In fact, this is more or less what happened. At the same time, prices of many other commodities including rice and vegetables also went up over the last few years. This widespread price rise across many sectors further indicates that the cause was monetary inflation. Effectively, the government printed money, which caused price to rise and made all Bangladeshis poorer.\nWhy would the previous government cause inflation and make everyone poorer by printing so much money? The answer is obvious: massive bank fraud which occurred during the previous government. Those weakened banks would certainly have failed, had money not been printed indiscriminately to bail them out. Had that been allowed, millions of families would have lost their savings and the economy would be mired in recession for years.\n\nThe politicians responsible for allowing banks to be looted, and then causing inflation by printing money to bail out those weak banks, are not likely to tell the truth about how they have made a mess of the economy. It's more likely that they would try to find a scapegoat to blame for rising prices. Unfortunately for the poultry industry, government ministers found it to be an easy target to blame. Eggs and broiler chicken are the animal proteins most consumed by the masses. Bureaucrats at the Competition Commission were happy to follow ministers' lead. The result is that an anti-business environment has been created in the poultry sector.\nThe question is how this mess will be fixed. Economic theory dictates that inflation has to be fixed by raising bank interest rates, which fortunately the interim government has already done. Printing money to prop up weak banks also has to stop. To restore a pro-business environment in the poultry sector, the unjustified Competition Commission cases should be dropped. The ceiling prices imposed by the Agricultural Marketing Department should also be increased, or preferably removed, to accelerate investment in poultry. Increased investment in chicken and eggs will raise their supply. This will ultimately lower prices through the economic rules of supply and demand, which always work more effectively and efficiently than government intervention.\nKazi Zeeshan Hasan is director at Kazi Farms Ltd.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We endorse the chief adviser's recent statement urging all citizens to restore complete law and order and to ensure that there are no further attacks on properties associated with Sheikh Hasina, her family, others associated with the Awami League, or any citizen. We support his appeal to the citizens to abide by the law and to show the world that Bangladesh is a nation that respects the rule of law\u2014this is what should differentiate the \"new Bangladesh\" from the autocratic regime it has now freed itself from. While empathising with people's pent-up anger against Hasina's tyrannical rule, he urged them not to undermine Bangladeshis' sense of security and stability and stated that disregarding the law endangers the lives and property of citizens.\nAll that he said in this statement can only be considered wise, sensible, and befitting of the head of government. However, it is a statement that has come after the fact, when it should have come long before, accompanied by strong preventive steps. We are baffled that the government did not take adequate measures to stop the attacks when it was quite clear from announcements on social media that they were imminent. What we saw unfold on our screens was a well-orchestrated series of attacks on properties all over Bangladesh, starting, of course, with Dhanmondi 32. Those who took part in this violence were no doubt provoked by Sheikh Hasina's call to her supporters to mobilise and march towards Road 32, as well as by another one of her regular hate speeches from Delhi, where she has taken refuge.\nHowever, that this should result in such violent reactions in the form of vandalism and arson is unacceptable. These acts have only served to increase people's insecurity in an environment where incidents of lawlessness are occurring with a sense of impunity among those who want to indulge in violent acts and crime. They have also provided fodder for Indian media propaganda, portraying the country as one where militancy is being allowed to thrive. Most of all, it serves Sheikh Hasina's agenda to show the world that without her, the country has fallen into lawlessness and mayhem.\nThis is the last thing we, the people, or the interim government would want. Rights organisations and noted citizens have expressed their concern over the attacks and criticised the government for its failure to take preventive measures. The government has now stated that it will firmly resist attempts by individuals and groups to vandalise and set fire to establishments across the country. We hope these are not empty words and that the government's forces will take the necessary measures to ensure that no one feels emboldened to carry out attacks on any piece of property, regardless of who it is associated with.\n",
