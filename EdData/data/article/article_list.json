        "full_article": "With polling over in 379 of the 543 constituencies after the fourth phase in the general election, the electoral campaigns of parties have reached closer to the end point. Deep into the campaign calendar, though, the disconnect between the concerns of the electorate and campaign rhetoric \u2014 especially that of BJP lynchpin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 remains, unfortunately, intact. While job creation, inflation and development have been emphasised by voters as primary issues, Mr. Modi refuses to be driven by the idea of contesting mainly on his government\u2019s record over 10 years of rule and focusing on measures to ameliorate the main concerns. Instead, he seeks to do what he has always revelled in \u2014 attacking the Opposition with truths, half-truths, and non sequiturs. Mr. Modi\u2019s recourse to this is also helped by the shrill noise of television and social media being a useful tool to distract from concerns with the rhetoric that he has used, be it hate speech against Muslims or dog whistles to rev up support from Hindutva adherents. Other parties, including the Congress and its public face, Rahul Gandhi, are also \u2014 even if not to the same extent \u2014 guilty of raking up identity issues such as those related to caste politics. But Mr. Modi and some of his colleagues have taken vituperation as a campaigning device to new levels. In his rally in Jaunpur, he accused the Opposition in Uttar Pradesh, the SP and the Congress, of silence when their southern allies used \u201cabsurd and abusive language\u201d for the people of U.P. and \u201csanatana dharma\u201d.Some of the northern parties in the INDIA bloc have publicly disagreed with DMK leader Udhayanidhi Stalin\u2019s comments on \u201csanatana dharma\u201d while emphasising their stances on social justice and taking on the issue of caste hierarchy. There is more that unites the politics of federalism and social justice espoused by these parties than what divides them \u2014 questions related to linguistic nationalism such as the need for English as a link language \u2014 but that is to be expected from coalitions made up of different political parties. Mr. Modi should focus on the differences in emphasis on how to tackle socio-economic issues between the BJP and the INDIA bloc. But, instead, his use of half-truths as a weapon to rile the Hindi heartland against southern parties is problematic, at a time when there is greater north-south economic integration, with working class citizens from the north migrating to the south for employment. Recently, the BJP inducted Manish Kashyap, a YouTube content creator who had been jailed in Tamil Nadu for spreading false news about Bihari migrants being attacked in the State. Such actions could foment divisive politics that does not help the Indian nation as a whole.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\ndevelopment\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nmedia\n\n/\n\nhate crimes\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nSamajwadi Party\n\n/\n\nRashtriya Janata Dal\n\n/\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam\n\n/\n\nreligion and belief\n\n/\n\nmigration\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nBihar",

        "full_article": "By signing a 10-year agreement with Iran to develop and operate the Chabahar port, India has taken its infrastructure and trade partnership with the Islamic Republic to the next level despite tensions in West Asia. India will invest $120 million and offer a credit facility of $250 million to further develop the terminal it operates in Chabahar\u2019s Shahid Beheshti port and related projects. However, after the deal was signed, the U.S. State Department said entities considering business deals with Iran \u201cneed to be aware that they are opening themselves up to and the potential risk of sanctions\u201d. In the past, American sanctions on Iran had delayed the project. Conceived in 2003, the project did not take off for years after the U.S. and the UN imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme. India signed a memorandum of understanding in 2015 after Washington eased sanctions on Iran following that year\u2019s nuclear agreement, and in 2016, the contract was executed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Iran visit. The U.S.\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran raised questions on India\u2019s continued cooperation with Tehran. But India managed to win a carve-out from U.S. sanctions that allowed it to operate the port through ad hoc measures.The Chabahar port is critical for India\u2019s connectivity plans. First, it offers an alternative route to Afghanistan and Central Asia by bypassing Pakistan, allowing better trade with Central Asia. And, Chabahar is expected to be connected to the International North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC), bringing India closer to Europe through Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. An alternative to the Suez route, a fully operational NSTC would reduce the time and money spent on intercontinental trade. The port, roughly 200 km from Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar, where China is developing a port as part of its BRI, would also help India expand its geopolitical influence in Central Asia. But the U.S. seems to have taken a narrow view of the project over its hostility with Iran. America\u2019s interests in the region have also changed. In 2018, when U.S. forces were backing the Islamic Republic government in Afghanistan, it gave a sanctions waiver to India as Kabul also stood to benefit from the port project. Today, U.S. troops are out of Afghanistan, the Taliban has replaced the Islamic Republic, and the U.S.\u2019s focus is on containing Iran. India, in the past, had taken U-turns in its Iran engagement depending on the policy changes in Washington DC. It should not do that any more. It should stay invested in Chabahar and seek to improve its trade and connectivity projects with Central Asia, which is essential for India\u2019s continued rise.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nIran\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\neconomic sanction\n\n/\n\nnuclear policy\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nAfghanistan\n\n/\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nBelt and Road Initiative",

In other words, there\u2019s no daylight between their strategic positions anymore.\n\nBack to Cold War? |\u00a0Russia and China criticised US for harbouring a Cold War mentality and destabilising global security.

But with Beijing and Moscow boosting their defence cooperation, New Delhi can\u2019t blindly rely on Russian platforms. Ongoing diversification in weapons systems must be speeded up.

SC was dismayed that tree-felling had started before forests ministry gave a prelim permission on March 1. Court took to task DDA\u2019s vice-chairperson \u2013 saying it was criminal contempt of court to allow the felling to continue though SC had rejected DDA permission for the same.\nNo stopping them |\u00a0Daylight murder is what the felling of trees in Delhi\u2019s Ridge Area is. The abandon with which the triad of authorities in National Capital Region spanning Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana routinely sidestep SC orders, and work in cahoots with land mafia and illegal mining outfits to level the Aravallis and Delhi Ridge is well-established. In this case, DDA, the urban development planner for the dustbowl heat-island capital of a $3.7 trillion economy, is in the dock for wilful environmental degradation. Nothing is stopping the loot.\n\nNo saving forests |\u00a0Compensatory afforestation, 100 trees to be planted for every tree felled, that SC has directed DDA to do, is a useless measure. Compensatory afforestation simply puts a price on trees, making them a commodity. It puts forests into a business model. But reality is that chopping down forest stretches destroys entire ecosystems of microflora and fauna, multiple species and habitats of tree-dwelling creatures. Afforestation is invariably a monoculture, and no matter how many saplings are replanted, they can never replace a forest. Compensatory afforestation is a dead-end.\n\n",

        "full_article": "With record breaking heat and pollution in one of the least livable cities in the world, it is increasingly difficult for the people of Dhaka to breathe. As the economy of the country grows at a rapid rate, there are megaprojects being implemented which are touted by the government as \"innovative\" and \"technological marvels.\" Yet when it comes to public spaces in urban areas which serve millions of people at a fraction of the cost, our public officials have failed.\nIdeally, a geographical area is supposed to have 25 percent tree coverage to protect its environment, but Dhaka has less than 7 percent. Cities use parks to maintain and protect their environment. Parks encourage active lifestyles and reduce health costs, make cities more resilient, manage stormwater and mitigate flooding, increase community engagement, reduce crime and, of course, help cleanse the air and improve public health. Dhaka lags behind woefully in terms of park coverage. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) has only 27 parks for its 75 wards while there are 23 parks in the 54 wards of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).\nHow these parks are managed is another tale altogether.\nThe DSCC has leased out six of its parks to local ruling party members. One of them is the Nawab Siraj Ud-Daulah Park in Old Dhaka, which underwent a renovation worth Tk 1.5 crore three years ago. It was intended to be open to the public as a green space. However, food stalls and warehouses have mushroomed since, encroaching on the space. Part of the park has been taken over by various types of rides, including trains and swings, which are being marketed as entertainment for children and teenagers at the cost of Tk 30-50 per person. Leased out for a meager daily rate of Tk 650, this public park has now become a private money making enterprise.\nThe same thing has happened with the historic Bahadur Shah Park. Local residents have been protesting for a year to preserve this small patch of green space but the park's environment has been destroyed with the construction of permanent commercial structures in the already limited space. Similar scenarios can be seen in the Shaheed Sheikh Rasel Park in Jatrabari and Shaheed Matiur Rahman Park in Gulistan, which were both leased out. These are examples of a dangerous trend of privatising public spaces.\nIn 2021, a large number of mature trees were cut down to build restaurants and walkways at the historic Suhrawardy Udyan. After months-long protests by environmentalists, artists, curators and regular people, a writ petition resulted in putting a stop to the destruction of the environment and ecology of the park.\nNone of the parks in the DNCC have been leased out, but Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed Park in Gulshan was given to a third party for maintenance. Tall glass fences were built around the park which blocks airflow and a coffee shop was built inside the park. Regular parkgoers criticised the move and deemed this modification unnecessary.\nLocated in Farmgate, one of the busiest spots of Dhaka, is Shaheed Anwara Park, named after the first woman martyr of the Mass Uprising of 1969, Anwara Begum. It was temporarily handed to the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL), the government owned company in charge of Dhaka's metro rail projects, during the construction of the MRT-6 back in 2016. Hundreds of trees were cut down to make space for the depot for construction materials and machineries. After the completion of the construction of the first metro rail of Bangladesh, the park was supposed to be handed over to the DNCC for restoration. But now, the DMTCL wants to build a station plaza there instead. While inaugurating the newly built footover bridge in Farmgate in October 15, 2023 both the DNCC mayor and the home minister promised concerned citizens that they will protect the park. The mayor promised that the Shaheed Anwara Park will be brought back to its glory and opened to the public. The park is yet to be handed over to the DNCC authority and repeated statements from the DMTCL proved that the idea of building a commercial plaza at the public park is still a possibility. It begs the question whether building more commercial space in an already busy commercial area like farmgate benefits local residents or not. If the DMTCL really wished to make shops, then why did it not build commercial space within their multi-storey stations? We all give example of developed countries every time we undertake a project, yet we do not follow developed countries' examples when it comes to preserving nature and protecting public spaces.\nSimilarly, located not too far from Farmgate, the triangle shaped Panthakunja Park in Karwan Bazar used to be an oasis for local residents. A project worth Tk 19.2 crore was undertaken for the \"beautification\" of the park a few years ago, work on which has since stopped. DSCC stated the pillars of the expressway might fall in the park which is why the renovation work was halted. The majority of trees were cut down in the park whose space has been used as a dump yard for construction materials and machinery. It has remained like that for the last few years and once a green gateway in the middle of the city fell victim to the uncoordinated \"development\" work of the city. In April, the DSCC mayor said the park will be renovated by July this year, but the results of this promise remain to be seen.\nAt the beginning of last year, the DSCC cut down most of the decades old trees in the median of Satmasjid Road in Dhanmondi. After protests from locals, students, environmentalists and others, only 37 trees still survive on the road. DSCC argued from the beginning that the newly designed road divider could not be built without cutting down the trees. But after fierce protest and public pressure, the portion of road divider at the Shankar Bus Stand was built with the trees still standing there. These last remaining trees are standing examples of how all the trees on that road could have been saved if the DSCC had wished.\nWe would hope as the citizens of a soon to be \"smart\" country that the concerned authorities would take smart decisions when it comes to protecting the urban environment, trees and parks. We need to rethink our approach towards privatisation of public spaces and find sustainable solutions which will serve the citizens as well as the urban ecosystem. We demand that the authorities hand over the parks to whom they belong, the people of Dhaka.\nAmirul Rajiv\u00a0is an art historian, curator and co-founder of Duniyadari Archive.\n\nBareesh Chowdhury\u00a0works at the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association.\nNaim Ul Hasan is an economist.\nViews expressed in this article are the authors' own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Despite there being a specific law against child marriage and many awareness campaigns and ongoing efforts to prevent this practice across the country, the harsh reality is that child marriage is a curse that still persists stubbornly. In remote areas such as chars, where life is particularly hard, the situation is more dire. A report published by this paper on Saturday paints a grim picture of hundreds of child brides at the Rasulpur char in Barishal. Parents here are forced to marry off their minor daughters because of poverty and insecurity.\nPoverty, it goes without saying, has always been a major factor behind child marriage, which increased manifold during the pandemic but persisted in subsequent years as well. According to a recent Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) report, a staggering 41.6 percent of young women were married off before the age of 18. This led to many girls dropping out of education at the secondary level, severely compromising their future potential. An uptick in sexual violence and harassment is also directly related to this evil.\nIn Rasulpur, girls as young as 13-15 are often married off and subsequently forced to take on the responsibilities of adulthood. This includes having children at a very early age, leading to all kinds of health complications. There are no doctors or community clinics, and so many married girls develop pregnancy-related complications that are left unattended. The char is also notorious for being a major drug hub with local influentials and some members of the police being allegedly involved. The safety of young girls is, therefore, a big issue leading to so many child marriages.\nRasulpur is a blatant example of the utter neglect of local administrations towards the welfare of poorer households and neighbourhoods. Here, there are no wholesome recreation options for young people and very few opportunities for education. Instead, the drug trade thrives bringing with it waves of crime, addiction and insecurity. Locals are left to deal with these challenges on their own and, finding no recourse, marry off their daughters to protect them.\nWe must reverse this cycle of events. The government should focus more on chars like Rasulpur; it must cleanse the local administration of corrupt officials, clamp down on drug trade, establish more schools and healthcare centres there, and introduce youth centres that can create awareness of the devastating consequences of child marriage and drug addiction. The government also must initiate programmes to lift char people out of poverty, create education and employment opportunities for both boys and girls, and enforce the law against child marriage. Without such interventions, this curse\u2014a formidable obstacle to the nation's progress\u2014will not be eradicated.\n",

        "full_article": "The words \"reset,\" \"rebuild\", and \"strengthen\" normally imply the use of mechanical tools to reconstruct something that needs repair. However, the same words\u2014when put in the context of diplomacy\u2014can, and do, have the same connotations. During the just-concluded visit to Dhaka by the US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu, these words appeared in various forms at briefings from both sides. This daily saw this as \"an apparent policy reset\" by Washington, and did so with an abundance of logic.\nThe comments to the media by the Adviser to the Prime Minister for Private Investments Salman F Rahman, following his dinner for Mr Lu, were very much on the upbeat side. Both the adviser and the state minister for information sounded exuberantly happy with whatever was talked and not talked about at the dinner table, where some current and former cabinet members were also present.\nWhile talking to the media following his meeting with Dr Hasan Mahmud, the Bangladesh Foreign Minister, Mr Lu did not mince his words when he said the US administration's \"hard work\" to promote a free, fair and nonviolent election in January this year \"caused some tensions here,\" but was also explicit that it was now time \"to look forward and not look back.\" He also made it known that Washington is now seeking to \"rebuild the trust in its relations between our peoples and in its relations with Dhaka.\" In essence, he admitted that certain moves from his government prior to the election did cause a perceptible dip in the element of trust.\nAlthough Donald Lu had visited Bangladesh more than once before the general election, this was his first visit after the polls. In fact, this was the first visit to Dhaka from anyone at this level from Washington after the January 7 election.\nWhile sending positive signals in general on the future of the bilateral ties between Bangladesh and the United States, Mr Lu also highlighted his government's plans to work together to fight corruption, promote transparency of governments and accountability of officials, labour reforms, human rights and reforms in the business climate. There was no clear answer to issues like lifting the sanctions on RAB (although a US government representative later clarified that the sanctions would not be lifted) as well as visa restrictions\u2014both of which were imposed before the elections. There were a lot of speculations about the US position on these issues.\nMr Lu also spent an hour with the Minister of Environment Saber Hossain Chowdhury. Climate change and the ill effects of global warning for a country like Bangladesh are all too well-known. However, the US's offer of free real-time use of satellite data to monitor the impact of climate change has raised questions among some observers about if the offer was related to just monitoring climate change. Only time will tell.\nBy any measure, the optics emerging from Donald Lu's visit were good, and both sides have had much to feel pleased about. But as the saying goes, \"the devil is in the details.\"\nIt is clear that Washington has decided to take the election issue out of the bilateral agenda. However, in the current and emerging global scenario, geopolitics has acquired a much greater place. When an official of the level of US assistant secretary of state talks of his government's wish to deepen its ties with Bangladesh, it is actually an expression of an intent, not necessarily an end in itself. Bringing that intent into a mutually acceptable level of fruition is the real challenge for both sides.\nBangladesh's relationship with the United States is no longer confined within the bilateral framework. The real canvas is much larger\u2014it is the Indo-Pacific domain and how the US would want to see Bangladesh fit into this bigger picture.\nAccording to some US officials and analysts, the US has a huge stake in Bangladesh for the former's Indo-Pacific strategy. In this, the relationship between the two countries has to have the elements of give-and-take and of reciprocity built into it. This involves mature diplomacy, a realistic and forward-looking mindset, and sustained engagement at all levels. Major global players are all too aware that Bangladesh today is in a position to exercise a good measure of autonomy in determining the course of its foreign and security policies, and to protect and preserve its national, political, and economic interests while maintaining strategic balance with its friends, both near and far. The visit of the Indian foreign secretary to Dhaka just a few days prior to that of Donald Lu also needs to be seen in that context. One can be sure that there will be others.\nDonald Lu's visit can be seen as a first step in Washington's desire to reset its ties with Bangladesh, keeping the larger canvas in mind. How Bangladesh prepares itself for this scenario is something one needs to wait and see. The task, though, is by no means easy, and the challenges are many but not insurmountable.\nShamsher M Chowdhury, Bir Bikram, is president of Trinamool BNP and a former foreign secretary of Bangladesh.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "It is now difficult to predict what will pan out finally, but the idea of preparing five-year development master plans for districts, as mooted by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the just-held meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), appears to be realistic under the prevailing circumstances. The head of the government wanted the formulation of the proposed master plans to be made participatory. To make it happen, in addition to lawmakers and government officials, the process should involve the local-level public representatives, including Upazila chairmen. The idea of taking up such an approach could be to make the plans realistic and need-based. When plans are conceived centrally, the planners, deliberately or otherwise, overlook some specific yet important needs of districts. If plans are made at the district level, that problem, hopefully, would be resolved.  However, getting a new approach integrated into the overall development plan might not be that easy. Under the prevailing system, the Upazila administration takes up small-scale projects that are mainly implemented using grants made available by the government. Large and medium projects in districts are prepared and financed centrally. It is understood that the basic reason behind suggesting formulation of district-based master plans is to get rid of the rivalry between the upazila parishads and the lawmakers in the local-level development activities. The rivalry that has turned bitter lately is hurting the local-level development activities. Whether the problem will go away or not with the changed approach is difficult to say at the moment. But if the district-level officials are entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the preparation of master plans and their execution, new problems are likely to crop up. As the government is in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the country has witnessed a raft of policy reforms that had been toyed with for decades by successive administrations, but never implemented. Apart from the IMF, bilateral and multilateral development partners like the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), JICA, China's EXIM Bank, etc. have, at different times, expressed dissatisfaction over the slow-paced implementation of donor-backed projects. Indeed, rate of implementation in the past budgets for foreign aided projects have rarely passed the 50 per cent mark. Obviously, something had to change at the policy level. Even so, such a gigantic step in that direction has taken everyone by surprise. The prime minister has asked the various branches of the government to \"speedily complete the foreign-aided and grants-funded projects with additional efforts, if required, to expedite further the country's development drive\". A very tall order, but it needs to be administered with great care. There will obviously be a lot of resistance coming from various quarters, for the plan hopes to achieve a number of milestones that will make a serious dent in corruption. But, if the government wishes to propel growth at a time of global economic downturn, it must initiate reforms and implement the budget focused on realistic needs of the people. In that respect, the new budget and its operational plan makes a lot of sense.",

        "full_article": "Advanced developing countries like China and India have been trying to push their currencies in the bilateral trade settlement with their different trading partners like Bangladesh for a long time. The core logic is that it will help reduce the risk of volatility in the international dollar market. As Bangladesh has been facing bilateral trade deficits with both countries for a long time, it seems logical to use Chinese and Indian currencies to settle a part of the import payments. Official statistics showed that Bangladesh's exports of goods to India stood at US$2.13 billion in FY23 against imports of $9.50 billion. So, the trade gap with India reached $7.37 billion in the last fiscal year. Again, exports to China were only $0.68 billion during the period under review, whereas imports from the country were recorded at $17.83 billion. Thus, the bilateral trade deficit with China stood at $17.15 billion in the last fiscal year. Bangladesh has to use the US dollar to settle the deficit payments, which creates pressure on the country's foreign exchange reserve. It also led to a big depreciation of the local currency against the greenback. The country's forex reserve has been depleting rapidly for the last two years due to the settlement of higher import payments against lower export earnings. To check the depletion of the forex reserve, the government took a series of steps to restrict imports and reduce the outflow of the US dollar. The restrictive measures paid off to some extent, as overall import payments were reduced by 15 per cent in FY23 over FY22. The declining trend has continued in the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Nevertheless, restricting the import is a temporary measure, and it can bring benefits for the time being. But it is difficult to continue the import restriction for a more extended period. That's why other alternatives like the use of local currency to settle a part of international trade may be beneficial for countries facing the deficit. Now, trading partners enjoying trade surpluses push for using their respective currencies as the countries facing deficits are on the back foot. This is the case for Bangladesh now, and both China and India argue that Bangladesh should settle the import bills in yuan and rupee, respectively. One, however, needs to keep a few things in mind to understand the implications of the move. First, five currencies now constitute the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement the official reserves of its member countries. The currencies are the US dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Second, currently, around 59 per cent of the global foreign exchange reserve portfolio is in the US dollar (at the end of 2023). According to the IMF's Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), the ratio of Euro is 20 per cent. The ratios of other major currencies are: Japanese Yen (5.70 per cent), Canadian dollar (2.60 per cent), Chinese Yuan (2.30 per cent) and Australian dollar (2.10 per cent). The rest of the amount includes some other currencies, including Swiss Francs. Third, the Chinese currency (CNY) is now in fourth position for settling international payments, though the ratio is still less than five per cent of the total settlement. From what mentioned above, it becomes clear that the Chinese Yuan is the only currency among the developing nations that is much more advanced than its peers. It is also internationally recognised as a reserve currency, besides being one of the leading currencies of developed nations. It means any country can use CNY, like the US dollar or Euro, to settle international payment bills like the US dollar or Euro. At least no country can say that CNY is not a reserve currency, regardless of whether they use it or not. Indian rupees or other currencies of developing nations have to go a long way to catch the Chinese currency now. Meanwhile, a media report suggested that China has already expressed its interest in offering Bangladesh more than CNY 36 billion in the form of a 'trade facility'. The amount is equivalent to US$5 billion or Tk 585 billion. If the loan is available, it may help repay a part of the Chinese import bill in Chinese currency, reducing some pressure on the dollar reserve. As the Chinese proposal is new in type, Bangladesh needs to scrutinise it cautiously. Flexibility of repayment and interest is critical. The government has already decided to negotiate with China to make the proposed CNY loan as a long-term budget support with flexible terms and conditions. Moreover, the Chinese proposal has geopolitical implications. During the last decade, Bangladesh-China bilateral economic-commercial relations have deepened, an unpalatable development for both United States and India. To India, China's growing 'footprint' in Bangladesh is much 'alarming' mainly due to its own geo-strategic concerns. Over the years, China has invested in some mega infrastructure projects, including Padma Bridge, and also expressed a desire to invest more, mostly in terms of loan or credit. As Chinese investment and finance are surging, Indian officials, along with a section of researchers and media analysts, have started sounding an alarm bell expressing their reservations about Bangladesh-China's economic relations. They are trying to argue that Bangladesh is heading towards a danger of what they term a 'Chinese credit trap'. The proposed CNY loan may spark another round of discouraging words from India, although it is a bilateral matter between Bangladesh and China.Currently, one-fourth of Bangladesh's total imports is from China. Many Chinese workers are working in various development projects in Bangladesh. If a part of the import bill and payments of Chinese workers can be settled in CNY, it may be helpful when the country's foreign reserve is depleting, although things are not as simple as they seem. There are procedural complexities, along with the risks of high interest rates and stringent repayment conditions. Nevertheless, after proper negotiation, Bangladesh needs to think positively about accessing the credit in Chinese currency. Internal mismanagement and governance issues, coupled with geopolitical turmoil, have threatened the country's macroeconomic stability. It now requires some prudent measures to meet the challenges.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "At a time when the deteriorating conditions of rail tracks have already made rail routes accident-prone causing recurring human tragedy, it is alarming to learn that wooden planks and bamboo sticks are being used in repairing and maintaining the dilapidated Teesta Rail Bridge in Lalmonirhat instead of using proper equipment. Reportedly, Tk4 lakh is annually allocated for the upkeep of the Teesta Rail Bridge, and yet those responsible for the task are using wooden planks, bamboo cane, and dry tree branches as makeshift replacements at various points on the bridge.It is alleged that many nuts and bolts are missing in several parts of the bridge, while many of the wooden sleepers are damaged. This raises serious questions about the accountability of those responsible for its upkeep and the effective use of the funds annually allocated for the maintenance of the bridge. Passengers rightly expressed their concern that this glaring example of corruption and indifference towards passenger safety may cause a fatal train accident at any moment.Bangladesh Railway, long considered to be the safest mode of transport, is now increasingly becoming a cause for concern and considered unsafe. Over the past five years, more than 2,000 accidents have occurred, claiming the lives of over 150 passengers and injuring around 500 more. The situation has worsened in recent months, with 160 accidents, including sabotage, reported just in the last four months alone. These incidents resulted in 18 fatalities and 200 injuries. The figures paint a grim picture of the railway's safety record and do nothing to dispel anxieties felt by the travelling public.According to Bangladesh Railway's own findings, deteriorating tracks - replacement of those being long overdue - and dilapidated bridges cause approximately 63 per cent of all rail accidents. This critical infrastructure suffers from a lack of proper maintenance, putting the lives and limbs of passengers constantly at risk. The findings also reveal widespread rusting of iron sleepers, broken and rotten wooden sleepers, missing joint clips, and loosened nuts and bolts, with many connection points completely detached. These chronic failures in proper maintenance not only raise the risk of accidents but also cause significant delays in train operations.Against this backdrop, the incidents relating to Teesta Rail Bridge provides indisputable proof of the common allegation that massive amounts of money are plundered from government funds, allocated for the construction or maintenance of public sector infrastructure. This is not the first reported incident of the use of bamboo to replace iron rods, or the use of substandard materials, in government infrastructure projects. Such allegation also surfaces from time to time regarding construction of roads, bridges, or buildings, raising serious concerns about overall structural integrity and public safety. Government action, however, has so far gone no further than warning the errant contractors and officials. The authorities must probe much deeper and act decisively to stem the snowballing corruption in nearly all areas of governance.That said many ambitious initiatives are underway to expand and improve the rail service. If corruption and mismanagement persist, it is most likely that these dreams will transform into nightmares and no improvements made. Therefore, a lot depends on the sincerity of the people responsible for managing the BR affairs. If their primary intention is to plunder instead of making rail service a safe, viable, comfortable, and reliable option for travellers, the BR won't ever be able to get out of the mess. It is time the authorities concerned took a serious look into the matter and put the railway system back on track, prevent lives from being lost, or maimed, and confidence in rail travel restored.[email\u00a0protected]",
