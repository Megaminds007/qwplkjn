Governor Shaktikanta Das, who had just two months ago spoken of the \u2018elephant\u2019 of inflation having begun its journey back to the forest after going on a walkabout, flagged the risk that stubborn food price gains pose to the overall disinflation path as justification for the MPC\u2019s stand. Food inflation as measured by the Consumer Food Price Index accelerated to a provisional 8.7% in April, from March\u2019s 8.52%, and recent indicators such as Crisil\u2019s food plate costs suggest that price gains spurred by a surge in tomato, onion and potato prices may have quickened even further in May. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) forecast on June 8, that headline retail inflation likely increased by 31 basis points last month to 5.14%, driven almost entirely by a 40 basis points acceleration in food price gains to 9.1%. The MPC, which voted by a 4-2 majority to \u201cremain focussed on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target\u201d of 4%, flagged the challenges it faces in achieving this goal as increasing adverse climate events trigger supply shocks that make it very hard to foresee the food price trajectory. The CMIE cited last month\u2019s heatwaves as the cause for the rise in the costs of fruits and vegetables.The MPC is also only too aware that besides the threat from escalating food costs, which remain vulnerable to the precariously low water storage levels at the country\u2019s reservoirs as well as the ongoing exceptionally hot summer temperatures, rising prices of industrial metals could undermine the deflationary trend in core inflation. Add to the mix the uncertain outlook for crude oil prices given the tensions in West Asia and the output cuts being implemented by the OPEC+ producer nations, and it is a recipe for heightened uncertainty on the inflation path. The RBI\u2019s latest round of surveys underline precisely why price stability is the central concern for policymakers. While households\u2019 surveyed in May expect inflation to quicken for all major product groups, both over the three months and one year ahead periods, consumer confidence too moderated from the March round of the survey with an increased majority of almost 80% of respondents expecting price gains to accelerate in one year\u2019s time. Governor Das is absolutely justified in maintaining an unwavering focus on anchoring inflation expectations, given that it is, as he put it, \u201cthe required foundation for sustained\u201d long-term growth.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\nfruit and vegetable\n\n/\n\nwater\n\n/\n\noil and gas - upstream activities\n\n/\n\nmetal",

In the latest round, the National Testing Agency, which conducts NEET, has been forced to appoint a four-member committee to go into the charges and allegations made about the conduct of the eligibility and entrance test for medicine for 2024. About 1,500 students from six centres complained that they were not given the full time for completing the exam, because of various reasons: distribution of the wrong question paper, torn OMR sheets, technical glitches, and delay in distribution of the OMR sheets. The court allowed granting grace marks to those who were affected. After publication of results, it was noted that some students scored 718/719 out of 720, impossible with the existing evaluation pattern. It was also charged that an unusually high number of students scored full marks. The NTA later clarified that the odd marks were a result of granting grace marks as mandated by the court, and that in general it was an easy paper, so many students had scored full marks. But that was not all; there were reports of the NEET UG question paper being leaked before the exam. Inaccuracies were reportedly found in the NTA NEET UG official answer keys, and there were charges of inconsistent evaluation of the UG papers. Political parties have called for a thorough, competent third-party probe into the charges, and groups of students have also demanded a retest. Every year, there are charges of poorly managed exam centres, and absurd high-handedness over what the candidates are allowed to wear. Cheating scams where candidates have sent in proxies to write the exam in their stead, have been exposed.Arguably one of the biggest entrance examinations conducted annually, with nearly 23 lakh students taking the test, it is no surprise that NEET has had a chequered past. Experts argue that with an exam of this scale, it is impossible to be completely error-free. But, year after year, news of egregious violations during the exams hits headlines. The NTA must, with the assistance of States, ensure that technical glitches and cheating scams, including premature release of question papers, and using proxies, do not recur. If this can be done by exercising greater rigour, and with a longer, more meticulous preparation routine, then no efforts should be spared to do so. Additionally, it should pay attention to demands that all NEET admissions come under single window counselling only; and a re-evaluation of the zero-percentile benchmark for PG admissions, besides strict regulation of fees in private medical colleges.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nmedicine\n\n/\n\nentrance examination\n\n/\n\ntest/examination\n\n/\n\nstudents\n\n/\n\nmedical colleges",

        "full_article": "Political compulsions of coalition govt may test BJP, on reforms and on the fisc\nAs Modi-led NDA assumes office with 72 ministers, BJP heavyweights have returned. They include, perhaps in a first, seven former CMs, bringing their considerable experience to the new govt. The coalition has a daunting task that 10 years of BJP govt struggled with \u2013 jobs, jobs and jobs. The new govt will need no reminder that NDA\u2019s, especially BJP\u2019s, performance tripped over cracks on the highway of speedy economic growth.\nInequality a deal-breaker | The new govt must take on board the reality that a central issue this election has been the uneven distribution of fruits of growth \u2013 variously seen in faster growth in consumption of better-off classes, pockets of rural distress, and joblessness and underemployment. Specific policies that promote low-skilled employment will be a priority.\u00a0\nWelfare by itself no solution | Filling such craters on the multi-trillion-dollar highway with a rash of welfare schemes can only paper over the fundamental problem. Handouts have been every govt\u2019s fallback option. But they have failed to kickstart the jobs engine and expand livelihood options and markets, especially for small and medium enterprises. Modi govt expanded free rations to more people and by 5 years more, earlier this year. Free food grain for 80cr of India\u2019s 142cr population is a sobering reminder of the economic precarity of 60% of India\u2019s population.\nRBI & hurting food prices | The upcoming budget is one reason RBI didn\u2019t cut the repo rate in the recent monetary policy. More important was that it acknowledged the stickiness of inflation, especially of food. As food prices, especially those of milk and vegetables increase, exceptional heat and low water reservoir levels will likely cause more stress on summer vegetables and fruits, RBI has noted. Its optimal 4% inflation rate is at present far below the rural food inflation rate of\u00a0 8.75% recorded in May.\nCoalition dharma | As portfolios find their ministers after hard bargains, the days ahead are a test for Modi, who has never headed a coalition. India\u2019s macroeconomic indicators are strong, but it\u2019s the micros where political compulsions of coalition will test NDA. Special status category for Andhra and Bihar, as Naidu and Nitish have demanded, will add to fiscal burden. Reforms will likely be slower. To run a stable coalition govt will be a new experience, and a challenge, for the third-term PM.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Pundits are going to be busy analysing the messages from this election for a while, but it is already apparent that economic distress and lack of jobs are critical issues. Young India wants jobs more than temples.\nIndia has had a brewing jobs crisis for at least 15 years.\u00a0 It is a wicked problem that manifests in all sorts of statistics, particularly our low workforce participation rate (49% overall). The data also shows that the lack of good work particularly hits young people (80% of the unemployed are below 30), women, and graduates. The last is particularly shocking.\u00a0 For most of us, a good education was the passport out of poverty into the middle or affluent class. Now, a young person with a college degree is NINE times as likely to be unemployed as her illiterate counterpart, according to an ILO report. This indicates both the quality of degrees as well as the low-end nature of work that is available. What has changed recently is that this is no longer a lower-middle class problem. This year, 35% of all IIT graduates and nearly 20% of IIM graduates are still looking for jobs. The problem now affects elites too, and that may be good news; it can no longer be ignored or wished away. (Incidentally, this appears to be a global issue affecting US computer science and Harvard Business School grads as well)\nOne reason why we have such a massive problem with good jobs is because our economic thinking is still very elitist.\u00a0 Affluent India, our media, and policymakers are obsessed with catching up with the US and China in GDP terms without care for other indicators of broad-based well-being. We are captivated by big companies that can compete globally like the Tata group, Reliance or Infosys. In entrepreneurship, we celebrate unicorns, not the millions of mundane small businesses that create 60% of all employment. To incentivise manufacturing, we dream up (production-linked incentive) PLI schemes to bring iPhone assembly or semiconductor packaging rather than seek grubby labour-intensive companies that make apparel, toys, shoes or all sorts of household products and hardware.\nNobel-winning economist Edmund Phelps, who examined the economic rise of England, then America and later China (in a book titled \u2018Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change\u2019), points out that in these countries, prosperity was defined by a broad sense of \u2018flourishing\u2019. This flourishing included meaningful work, self-expression, and personal growth for a large portion of the population. Phelps believes that the source of this flourishing was a change in societal values that fuelled widespread innovation and entrepreneurship at the grassroots level, meaning many people, not just a few famous ones, were coming up with new ideas and businesses.\u00a0 Such widespread tinkering and \u00a0 entrepreneurship led to a period of economic and personal prosperity that he calls \u2018mass flourishing\u2019.\nNew gambit: An inclusive grassroots movement in chess has given us a funnel of talent. A similar campaign is need for entrepreneurship\nLessons from chess\nIndia has witnessed such a flourishing of sports. Our success, first in cricket and more recently in chess, is because these sports have become dramatically more inclusive, thereby drawing in massive talent. Chess is growing at the grassroots across the country, and is now included in the school curriculum in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Chess clubs and tournaments are pervasive, creating a movement just like in cricket. This democratisation has made a fast-growing funnel for talent, with at least a million people playing local tournaments across the country, including Uber and auto drivers and construction workers who sign up for free entry tournaments. Prize money and sponsorships, though still a trickle, are growing fast with the sport\u2019s success. As a result, India has 73 grandmasters now, up from 20 in 2007, and seven players ranked among the top 100 in the world. Our success in chess has great parallels with mass entrepreneurship. For India to prosper and reach its potential, we cannot have just a handful of large firms and a few thousand tech startups. We need a grassroots movement of millions of young people who want to start and build their businesses rather than seek elusive good jobs. These are not just gig workers or necessity entrepreneurs who are forced to start small businesses such as tea shops or grocery stores out of compulsion, but entrepreneurs who are drawn to an opportunity and are growth-oriented.\nSchooled in entrepreneurship\nFor this, not only must entrepreneurship be a mandatory part of all curricula, we also need thousands of venture clubs, incubators and accelerators in schools, colleges, ITIs and districts. Competitions like Shark Tank are highly effective in inspiring young entrepreneurs. The key is to build a pyramid of competitions that build a huge funnel of entrepreneurial talent that can see opportunity in every problem and build a business out of solving it.\nIndia\u2019s innovation and economic potential cannot be unlocked by a small elite. Imagine instead a future where every small town and city feels like Bengaluru, buzzing with innovation, brimming with opportunity, and alive with the entrepreneurial spirit of our young people.\n\n",

        "full_article": "When writing a confidential report on the Bengali workers of Karnaphuli Paper Mills to the Superintendent of Police, D.I.B Rangamati, Sub-Inspector of Police Md. Nurul Islam noted with disgust and frustration: \"The Bengali Muslims, after brutally murdering their non-Bengali brethren, who are nationals of the same state, shouted the victory slogans 'Naraye Takbir-Fateh.'In this foolish idea of victory, the non-Bengali Muslims find no meaning other than the clear expression of the depth of hatred in the minds of Bengali Muslims. Furthermore, the Bengali Muslims expressed their deep-seated hatred against the non-Bengali Muslims by allegedly dishonouring, abusing, and injuring the dead bodies of the non-Bengali Muslims after brutally killing them. This hatred led the Bengali Muslims to disregard the noble principle that one does not war with the dead.\"\nFrom the mid-1950s, the relationship between Bengali and non-Bengali workers began to deteriorate to such an extent that the East Pakistan mills witnessed two serious riots in the same year. The first riot between Bengali and non-Bengali workers occurred at Karnaphuli Paper Mills, Chandragohna, on March 22, 1954. In less than two months, Adamjee Jute Mills, then one of the largest jute mills in the world, experienced violent riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers, resulting in the deaths of more than 600 people.\nThis essay attempts to understand why, within a few years of the creation of Pakistan, serious riots occurred between workers of two linguistic groups: the Bengalis (almost all of whom were Muslims) and the Urdu-speaking Muslims. The Urdu-speaking groups, who migrated to East Pakistan, are commonly perceived as Biharis. Although an overwhelming number of them were Biharis, not all Urdu-speaking Muslim refugees to East Pakistan were Biharis. In official papers, they are treated as upcountry Muslims, non-Bengali Muslims, and Mohajirs or holy migrants. This essay examines whether they were able to forge significant labour solidarities and whether Bengali and non-Bengali industrial workers in East Pakistan were able to produce powerful concerted industrial actions. If the workers failed to produce such solidarity and concerted industrial action, what hindered them from doing so? Was it because of the workers' ethnic and linguistic differences? Some historians suggest that the riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in East Pakistan, which occurred shortly after the general election in 1954, were provoked by the central government to undermine the victory of the newly formed United Front's coalition government in East Pakistan. Layli Uddin, however, argues that the riots were mainly the outcome of a severe crisis in labour-management relations.\nTo explain the relationship between class, ethnicity, and the role of the state, this essay explores the riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers at the Karnaphuli Paper Mills.\nThe morning of March 22, 1954, was a busy day as usual for the Karnaphuli Paper Mills. However, discontent and grievances permeated the air of the mills and the working-class neighbourhood of Dobashi Bazar, where most Bengali workers gathered for leisure time adda and daily groceries. M.H. Shah, the deputy commissioner of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, mentioned in his letter to the commissioner of the Chittagong Division, that he received news of the 'disturbance' at Chandragohna at about 1 PM while he was busy counting votes for the Chittagong Hill Tracts Buddhist constituency.\"\nS.M. Hasan, C.S.P., the commissioner of the Chittagong Division, arrived at Chandragohna camp on March 23, a day after the horrific riots occurred. His letter to the chief secretary of the government of East Pakistan provided a detailed description of how the riots at Karnaphuli Paper Mills began. Hasan met with S.S. Nohri, a senior technical assistant in charge of the process section of the mills, who narrated to him how the riots started. Nohri informed him that initially, the riots began over a simple matter. On March 18, Nohri sent some workers to M. Ekhlas, the Bengali senior technical assistant (chemical). However, unhappy with the management's treatment of him, Ekhlas sent the workers back, stating that he was not aware of his position in the mills. Upon learning of this, Khurshid Ali, the non-Bengali chief operating director of the mills, summoned Ekhlas to his office. Khurshid and Ekhlas had a heated debate there, during which Ali asked Ekhlas to return to his former government job. This concluded the events for that day, and Ekhlas returned to work. However, news of the heated debate between Khurshid Ali and M. Ekhlas spread throughout the mills.\nAccording to Nohri, the Bengali workers of the mills organised a meeting at Dobashi Bazar, Chandragohna, on March 21. Some members of the Majdur Union were also present at the meeting. Following the meeting, the Bengali workers, along with the members of the Majdur Union, held a procession and paraded at the Dobashi Bazar and the workers' colony. They were heard chanting slogans such as \"Hindustani chaina [we don't want Hindustani], Khurshed Ali murdabad [ Down with Khurshed Ali], Majdur dabi mantey hobe [workers' demands have to be met], Ekhlas Saheb zindabad\" [ long live Ekhlas Saheb], etc.\nOn March 22, the fateful day, Khurshed Ali went to the 1st floor of the Soda Recovery Bailer House of the mills, the working station of Ekhlas. There, Khurshid Ali and Ekhlas again had a heated debate. Agitated, Khurshid asked Ekhlas to leave the building, which Ekhlas quietly observed, and he went back home. The news had already spread around the mills and the workers' colony. Soon, the agitated Bengali workers gathered adjacent to the turbine house. To his misfortune, Khurshid Ali went there to calm the aggrieved workers. Ali was subsequently mobbed by the workers, resulting in injuries and bleeding. However, with the help of some workers and officers, Khurshid Ali was able to escape major injuries at that time. Unfortunately, luck was not on his side, as a mob of 800 people chased him again at the main gate of the mills. After a while, Ali was found missing. The agitated workers also chased H.M. Shirazee, a labour officer, who jumped into the river. Eleven injured workers, of whom 5 were Bengali and 6 were non-Bengali, were admitted to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA situation report to S.M. Hasan informed that a total of 10 people were killed in the riots, including the operating director of the mills, Khurshid Ali, and M.H. Shirazee, the labour officer. Other individuals killed in the riots were: 1. Baktear Khan, a watchman; 2. Amin Bin Rashid, a contractor; 3. Abdur Rahim Khan, a watchman; 4. Modassir Khan, a camp jomadar; 5. Mhod. Ishaque, a foreman; 6. Mr. Maqbul Ahmed, an assistant establishment officer; 7. Kala Khan, a foreman; 8. Sheikh Mahaboob, an orderly of the operative director.\nSo, why did the Bengali workers become so aggrieved, leading them to engage in serious riots at the Karnaphuli Paper Mills that resulted in the deaths of 10 people, including top officers? Scholars argue that the riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers, which occurred shortly after the victory of the United Front in East Pakistan, were instigated by the central government mainly to sabotage the provincial government formed by the Front. Some scholars assert that the riots were, to some extent, a manifestation of the excitement created by the victory and the formation of the government by the United Front. For them, these new developments signalled a new promise. However, Layli Uddin recently refuted these assumptions in her excellent essay. For her, although the riots in East Pakistan were 'ostensibly' between Bengalis and non-Bengalis, they mainly stemmed from an inner tension within the labour situation, which she describes as 'a severe crisis in labour management'. She provides a nuanced understanding of the crisis, stating: \"the management exploited this weakness in two ways. First, the rest of the Bihari workers organising against the management was removed due to their economic dependencies. Second, the management used this ethnic division to discipline Bengali workers. The Biharis were perceived as tough, and they were appointed as security guards. Many of them were appointed as supervisors, contractors, and labour officers at the mills. They were paid better... The management used the Bihari workers as a buffer between themselves and an unfamiliar, and consequently unstable, workforce. The contradiction between the image of powerful Bihari workers as the strongmen for mill management and their actual vulnerability as refugees led to their deaths at the hands of their Bengali co-workers.\u00a0\nHowever, regrettably, Uddin does not further develop or extend the point; instead, she focuses solely on arguing that the riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers were mainly due to 'a severe crisis in labour-management relations'. She suggests that workers' grievances were primarily against the highest management and those in authoritative positions. However, riots between Bengali and non-Bengali workers at the Karnaphuli Paper Mills, the Adamjee Jute Mills, and other industrial spaces indicate that lower-echelon Bengali and non-Bengali workers were actively involved in the riots. In the Chandragohna riots, too, most of the workers killed and injured were lower-echelon workers. Among the 10 workers killed in the riots were watchmen, contractors, camp jamaders, foremen, and an orderly. Only three of them were high-ranking officers. In the Adamjee riots in May 1954, most of the rioting workers were lower-grade workers.\nThe Bengali workers were indeed aggrieved with the management and the labour policies. However, I argue that the mill authority and the state systematically used these grievances to fragment class solidarities between Bengali and non-Bengali workers. As the Pakistani state frantically sought capitalist industrial development, it aimed to thwart any powerful concerted labour action in the industrial spaces. The state's concern to thwart any concerted powerful industrial action by the labourers is evident in official correspondences. Labour commissioners were instructed to observe daily labour situations and report on developments to the concerned state agencies. In 'Capital', Karl Marx demonstrates that the liberal narrative represses the violence associated with the emergence of the capitalist mode of production. Marx illustrates how the state deploys force to dispose of the masses to create labour markets and establish bourgeois idioms. He also shows that to create labour markets and establish bourgeois ideology and idioms, the state employs particular social policies and legislation. Michel Foucault's analysis of biopolitical power shows how biopolitical power individuates populations through legal means and creates a highly political environment of economic competition to ensure smooth circulation.\nFrom the Pakistan government's secret documents and statistical publications, it appears that the government rigorously and elaborately maintained statistical data on the population regarding ethnicity, race, gender, and class. In its labour policy, the state clearly showed a bias towards non-Bengali Muslim refugees. They were given preference in the employment of industrial workers. However, there were multiple complex reasons behind this. Indeed, among the non-Bengali refugees, there were more skilled individuals. The state implemented various support programmes to assist these refugees. Consequently, the state's labour policy created a kind of labour aristocracy in East Pakistan's mills, where non-Bengali workers enjoyed more benefits than Bengali workers. This conscious government policy, over time, created an inviolable rift between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in the factory spaces.\nA memorandum by Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury, then assistant secretary of the East Pakistan Federation of Labour, dated April 21, 1953, just around a year before the Chandraghona riots, details the discrimination in wages and benefits between Bengali and non-Bengali workers at the Karnaphuli Paper Mills. The memorandum also expressed the grievances of the Bengali workers. Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury was a founding member of the Awami Muslim League. In 1954, he was elected to the legislative assembly from the United Front. He was a labour union leader and was closely associated with the Bengali workers of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills. Representing the General Council of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills Workers' Union, Chowdhury highlighted the grievances of the Bengali labourers of the mills. In his letter to the commissioner of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, he pointed out, in his words, the 'nepotism' and 'provincialism' of the non-Bengali top-ranking officers, whom he referred to as outsiders. As he wrote, \"the history of the Chandraghona Paper Mills Projects under Khurshid Ali, operative director for the last three years, has been a dismal story of provincialism, jobbery, nepotism, and corruption. The outstanding feature of the entire administration has been a systematic policy of persecuting the poor local employees.\"\nIn the memorandum, Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury highlighted the wage discrimination between Bengali and non-Bengali workers. Chowdhury stated, \"the disparity of pay and service conditions between the local workers and workers (non-Bengali workers, he forgot to use the word) must shock the conscience of every civilized man. Not to speak of the upper hierarchy of officers, the ratio of pay between a section of clerks and another section of clerks is 2:1. With microscopic exception, the pay of a Bengali clerk ranges from Rs 90/- to Rs 150/- whereas that of an outsider clerk ranges from Rs 150/- to 300/-.\"\nHistorians Raj Narayan Chandavarkar, Nandini Gooptu, and Subho Basu have emphasized the importance of the neighbourhood in working-class culture, politics, and everyday life. Workers' consciousness, politics, and activism are not only shaped in the shop floors, but the neighbourhood also plays a crucial role. For the workers of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills, Dobashi Bazar served this crucial function. As we have seen, prior to the Chandraghona riots, workers gathered at Dobashi Bazar, held meetings, paraded, and chanted slogans. Dobashi Bazar was where Bengali workers encountered emerging Bengali nationalist leaders, such as Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury, and nationalist ideas and rhetoric.\nSubaltern historians highlight the autonomy of subaltern domain. However, I argue that the consciousness of subaltern people, whether peasants or workers, is not always immune to ideas from the outside world. At Dobashi Bazar or in the neighbourhoods of other mills in East Pakistan, Bengali workers were exposed to the teachings and excitement of newly emerging nationalist enthusiasm and the idea of autonomy. The growing distance and strained relationship between Bengali and non-Bengali workers were, in many ways, engineered by the state. This vitriolic relationship hindered their ability to organise powerful concerted labour action. Consequently, in the 1960s, Bengali workers gravitated towards the flourishing democratic and nationalist mobilizations in East Pakistan led by middle-class leadership. In turn, Bengali nationalist leaders pledged support for various labour actions organised by Bengali workers and promised to incorporate workers' demands into their agendas. Thus, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, solidarity between Bengali and non-Bengali workers was marked by a significant rift.\nAzizul Rasel\u00a0is a PhD scholar at McGill University, Canada. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "In a frustrating if predictable move, the government has once again allocated a third of the budget for subsidies to the power sector, an overwhelming majority of which will be used to pay off capacity charges. It seems no amount of expert logic, public outrage, or even IMF prescriptions can discourage the government from wasting public funds on paying private power plants to sit idle. It has already spent more than Tk 1 lakh crore in capacity charges over the last 14 years. Research by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) reveals that capacity payments have skyrocketed from Tk 5,600 crore in 2017-18 to a staggering Tk 32,000 crore in the outgoing fiscal year, accounting for a whopping 81 percent of total subsidies in the power sector.\nInstead of bringing down capacity charges as a matter of priority, the government is constructing an additional 27 power plants, which can only translate to a further increase in capacity charges in the coming year(s). What's more outrageous is that the government has decided to raise power tariffs three to four times a year apparently to lower subsidies over the next three years. Electricity prices were raised by 8.5 percent in February this year, and thrice by 5 percent each last year. Why is the public being asked to pay higher prices in the name of reducing subsidies when, in fact, the government is increasing subsidy allocation in the power sector\u2014from 32 percent of the total allocation last year to 37 percent in the proposed budget?\nAs always, it is the people who are being unfairly tasked with absorbing the burden of chronic mismanagement, collusion, and corruption in the power sector. This is simply unacceptable, particularly given that the government does not seem to be taking any visible steps to address the root causes of high production costs\u2014a lack of transparency and accountability in awarding contracts, overreliance on expensive imported fuels, and neglecting domestic gas exploration and renewable energy sources. Subsidies make sense when they ensure cheaper and more accessible services and amenities to the public, not when they prop up big business groups at enormous cost to the country and ordinary citizens.\nAs we have argued time and time again, the power sector needs an overhaul. At the very least, and on an immediate basis, the government needs to renegotiate power purchase agreements with the private power plants, replace outdated plants with efficient ones to reduce overall power generation costs, and diversify its fuel sources. The energy sector has been allowed to remain unaccountable for far too long. Such looting of public funds must stop.\n",

        "full_article": "The results of the\u00a0Indian general elections are out. The leader of Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), Narendra Modi, is all set to become the first non-Congress Prime Minister to win a third term in the country. Yet the results are disappointing for the incumbent ruling party, BJP, which has won a mere 240 seats in the 2024 elections. Failing to cross the majority number of 272 seats, the party is now forced to form a coalition government with two other parties, Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Despite disproportionate financial resources, supportive media, and personal branding of Narendra Modi around \"ab ki baar, 400 par\" (this time, above 400 seats!), the opposition alliance, INDIA, performed better than expected and won 232 seats.\nThis result is important for the future of Indian democracy. It marks a potential return of regular politics in India. By regular, I mean a system whereby parties negotiate with each other, consult, compromise, and above all lose elections in a competitive environment. In the last 10 years, the regular democratic politics came under severe pressure in India. The opposition leaders were frequently jailed and harassed through financial regulation institutions (what scholars refer to as \"constitutional hardball\" whereby the legal system is used to selectively target opposition forces and dismantle democracy from within). Civil society, activists, and dissenting voices were systematically criminalised and made dysfunctional. Media was either bought or intimidated to act in collusion with the ruling party.\nWith the change in the balance of power, there will be internal pressure from coalition partners and external pressure from stronger opposition to not act unilaterally. In the last 10 years, the BJP has often kept the parliament in the dark, initiating big changes in constitutional structure and policies overnight. Demonetisation policies that demonetised approximately 85 percent of the Indian currency overnight, declaration of lockdown on a four-hour notice that led to death and suffering for many Indians desperate to return home, passing of three new criminal laws that changed the basic criminal justice system of India, and the abrogation of Article 370 that took away autonomy of Kashmir and led to complete shutting off of civil liberties in the state are a few examples to name. Under a parliamentary system, the prime minister and the government are accountable to the house. A stronger opposition may be able to demand more responsibility in the house from the government. Further, the federal structure of the Indian Constitution may also get fresh air as the coalition partners push for protecting federal constitutional scheme in their respective states.\u00a0\nBut the dream of a complete revival of Indian democracy may remain a dream, if long-standing issues of Indian democracy are not addressed.\u00a0Constitutional scholars have argued that the Indian Constitution has a centralising tendency which reduces overall responsibility and accountability of the executive power. For instance, in the parliamentary process, it is not mandatory to release draft bills to the public or refer bills to parliamentary committees for consultation and advice. The opposition has no right to set the agenda or call a session of the parliament. In the Lok Sabhas in 2014 and 2019, there was no leader of the opposition. Similarly, the office of speaker of the Lok Sabha, which is expected to be independent and non-partisan, has become heavily politicised. At state levels, the constitutional office of the governor has been abused to trample over the governments of opposition parties. The BJP has also weakened other institutions of accountability like the Election Commission and the Information Commission through regressive amendments. All of this requires repair and restoration without which the institutions will continue failing to act as a check on executive power. There is no guarantee that a party will not be able to dismantle Indian democracy in the future if a serious conversation is not started on these reforms.\nAnd finally, early analysis of election results suggests that the vote against the brute majority of BJP may not necessarily mean a vote against Islamophobia and politics of hate. Since Independence, the Muslim community in India has been disproportionately left out of state resources for health, education, and employment. In the last 10 years, they have faced systemic targeting through lynching, hate speech, frequent harassment in public places, criminalisation of ways of worship, food, and discrimination in access to housing, civic amenities, etc. During the election, the prime minister himself ran a deeply divisive campaign. The communal prejudices and discrimination tend to become entrenched and survive beyond the political party in power. The social fabric of India remains torn. What is needed is a grassroot constitutional culture whereby the wounds are healed, and dignity and justice are ensured to all. For today, Indian democracy breathes, but the future requires serious self-reflection and work.\nSurbhi Karwa is a graduate from the University of Oxford.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

In recent years, the situation has worsened further for people living below the poverty line due to the skyrocketing prices of food. The worst victims, as is always the case in crunch times, are the innocent and vulnerable children. According to a recent UNICEF report, two out of every three children aged under five in Bangladesh are living in poverty. This means that 10 million Bangladeshi children consume fewer than the minimum five food groups recommended by the UNICEF and the WHO for adequate nutrition. It also ranked Bangladesh among the 20 countries that account for almost two-thirds (65 per cent) of the total number of children experiencing severe child food poverty globally. This dubious distinction, coupled with the lack of purchasing power, should be a wake-up call to the government and citizens alike. Childhood malnutrition has severe lifelong consequences for a child. As the UNICEF report emphatically illustrates, children deprived of proper nutrition in their early years perform poorly in school, their development is impaired, they, earn less as adults, and remain stuck in a cycle of poverty, deprivation, and despair. The lack of proper dietary diversity increases a child's risk of literally wasting away by up to 50 per cent. Overall, good nutrition is fundamental to children's health, growth, development, indeed, survival. Families are expected to play a leading, indeed crucial role in providing their children with nutritious food. Impoverished families, however, find it difficult and cannot shoulder the responsibility alone. The UNICEF calls for supporting them through a systematic approach, leveraging the potential of food, health and social protection systems and driven by a decisive political will and targeted investment.Food insecurity isn't just about food scarcity. In Bangladesh, the biggest barriers to food security are the unaffordability caused by social inequality and difficulty to manage food due to inflation. Job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent economic stagnation have exacerbated the problem. The double-digit food inflation for the past two years has also had an enormous impact and left more households food-insecure. The gravity of the situation can be assessed just by observing the long queues of people at open-market sale (OMS) trucks run by the Bangladesh Trading Corporation (TCB). To help alleviate the sufferings of low-income people the government has substantially increased and widened the OMS programme. But the war against poverty is far serious and cannot be won by just providing a few food items at subsidised rates. This is like cosmetic surgery when the need is invasive operation. Achieving food security for all Bangladeshis demands a no-nonsense multi-pronged approach from the government. This includes revamping the marketing of agricultural products to ensure fair prices for growers, protecting the supply chain from extortion, monitoring markets to check manipulation, implementing systematic measures to curb record-high food inflation, and tackling poverty through creation of employment. Encouraging private investment, particularly in agro-based industries, and financially empowering women would further strengthen this strategy. Besides, implementing school feeding programme for underprivileged children can reduce the malnutrition problem of poor children. The UNICEF says that by transforming food systems into healthy diets that are accessible and affordable, Bangladesh can ensure that every child has a solid start in life.",

        "full_article": "'Black money', according to Investopedia,'includes all funds earned through illegal activity and otherwise legal income that is not recorded for tax purposes'. The sources of black money, as defined, include tax evasion as well as corruption, money laundering and illicit trade. So, ideally, in a law-governed society, earning and holding of black money is a punishable offence. But in the real world it is often allowed to exist and, in many cases, even thrive. Bangladesh is no exception. Earning of black money is so widespread in this part of the world that the practice is not even questioned nowadays. So, one is not surprised, though some economists and social activists who are still critical of the so-called unethical practices like corruption, owning ill-gotten money, etc., when the finance minister in his budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 kept the provision of whitening black money without scrutiny through payment of 15 per cent tax. In other words, illegally earned money has again been given the seal of approval. However, the money-whitening opportunity, according to the proposed budget for FY25, will be available for only one year till June 2025. But the provision of legalising black money has continued year after year in the same manner and there is no guarantee the practice would stop by the next financial year. In fact, this culture of wooing black money in the hope of mainstreaming it is indicative of the power of black money and its owners in society. Interestingly though, despite all the coaxing and cajoling, the holders of black money never responded to the government's offer at the expected level. Successive governments since independence have been offering such amnesty to black money owners. Going by the country's top tax regulator, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), since independence till 2022, Tk455.22 billion could be whitened by such means so far. The revenue that went to the government's coffer is a paltry sum of Tk46.41 billion. The amount was earned over a period of 50 years (between 1972 and 2022)! So, it is not hard to see why and how a section of society is getting richer by the day. Unsurprisingly, the tax authority, or the government for that matter, is getting lukewarm response from the black money holders making it clear that they are not willing to come under the NBR's tax net. This approach of the government's handling them with kid gloves only betrays its weakness, which the corrupt quarters take full advantage of. So, what is the point of showing such generosity to those people who are having a field day by defying law, whereas the honest income earners are paying taxes just out of their honesty and willingness to abide by the law? And this softness towards those earning money illegally and hiding it from the tax authority is only apt to send a wrong signal to society. It is that if you are somehow able to earn a large sum of money illegally, keep it to yourself evading tax, you will be rewarded. But if you are a law-abiding, honest citizen and not hiding your earnings from the tax authority, you are nobody. Worse, if you fail to pay your tax, you will be subject to legal proceedings.Given the nature and composition of the governments in the developing and least developed world, fighting corruption, illicit trading, money laundering that create black money is in most cases a tall order. How is the government, for instance, going to bring those involved in illegal earning to book? Are the enforcers of law above board? Moreover, do they have the power to question someone in high office about her/his source of earning in case there is a report on the latter's acquisition of money illegally,? The fact of the matter is that the law is selectively allowed to take its own course, despite all the claims to the contrary. Whenever one sees the instances of law being applied, or appearing it to be so, oftentimes, there is a political decision working behind it. Law, which in an overwhelming number of cases is an ass, does not operate the way it is formulated to do. However, this is not a great revelation that law cannot operate independent of political will in the developing or the least developed world. Recent developments in the advanced West, which so far appeared to be the role model before the rest of the so-called less developed societies with flawed or no democracy, make one suspicious if ethics and law are just maxims to be found only in books and not in real life anywhere, not even in the so-called developed societies. However, that should not be the reason for us to be complacent either. Despite all the limitations, corruption that breeds black money has to be addressed, if only not to demotivate the segment of citizens who are still willing to abide by the rules and regulations of the state. Especially, the syndicates, cartels and middlemen engaged in embezzling public funds, giving illegitimate patronage to some through abuse of power, illicit trading through over and under-invoicing and so on need to be at least brought under control, if not eliminated altogether. Otherwise, if the black money holders, whether by paying the penal tax or not, continue to flaunt their wealth before the rest of the people who cannot make ends meet with their honest incomes, the income disparity goes on widening unabated. That is a recipe for disaster. It must be avoided at all costs.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Very good looking and suave, he made a favourable impression on all who watched him speaking softly, never betraying impatience and anger. The high positions he graced and the personality he cultivated seemed to be made for each other. He was, moreover, an alumnus of the Department of English, Dhaka University. Notwithstanding all these attributes, his name and profession were somewhat anachronistic to his gender and the background of English literature respectively. Yes, Benazir, a Persian-Arabic name reserved for girls means 'without like', matchless, peerless, unique etc; fits neither the top position of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) nor the chief of the police in Bangladesh. The former Inspector General of Police (IGP) was not the only person from the Dhaka University's English Department to grace the highest position of the law enforcement agencies---the police and RAB to be precise. Before him Hassan Mahmood Khandker from the same department had the distinction of serving as the police chief for the longest tenure in Bangladesh's history and the force under him was awarded the Independence Day Award. Moreover, it was during his time, the rank badge of IGP was elevated to the 3-star general. He was even made ambassador to Spain following his retirement. Compared with Mahmood, Benazir has hardly made the force under him proud. His accumulation of filthy amount of wealth for which the Anti-corruption Commission (ACC) has brought charges against him and the court ordered freezing of his 33 bank accounts and attachment of all the property acquired under as many as 83 deeds. Appearances could not be more deceptive. The peerless Benazir has amassed ill-gotten fortunes of matchless proportion. How many bank accounts a person in government service, whatever may be his rank, is supposed to have? The ACC came to know of 33 but who knows if there are more of those! So far, 114 acres of land, of which 466 bighas he acquired in the last three years of his service, could be traced. There are allegations galore including owning a second home in Malaysia and suspecting of possessing, but not confirmed, another in Canada. How tragic and disgraceful it is that the man who in his capacity as the police chief used to exhort newly recruits saying that in the life of a man, there is no need of too much of land property nor many a roof on one's head. One should do as much as is required for living with members of one's family in peace and happiness. It is this same preacher-like innocent-looking man conducting himself so endearingly has possessed how many flats and resorts only God knows. Double-faced, he could not perhaps be more duplicitous. This country has become witness to life-threatening medical malpractices by impostors like Shahed Karim, multi-level marketing scandals, online business fraudulence, outsize banking and financial scams and many more. But Benazir's is a case incomparable with all those simply because the nation vested in him the power and responsibility to enforce laws of the land and watch over crime and corruption. Beyond this sacred duty, the moral obligation and the people's trust he was made a custodian of have been devastated by his betrayal. Instead of upholding the moral principles and the oath in his position one takes, he became obsessed with amassing wealth. Indeed, a man does not need basket-full of dirty money to live a decent and happy life. His honest income as an IGP would have been enough for him, his wife and three daughters. What made a student of English literature intoxicated with wealth accumulation can give an insight into the country's moral degeneration. When the principal custodian of the nation's sacred trust violates it, this has profound impacts --- negative on the force he heads and honest civilians, and more worryingly as a green signal for the criminally bent. There is no reason to think what he did, he did alone without accomplices higher up and down the rank. If the cases filed against him have their logical consequences, those should be a lesson for others making money left and right caring little whether in the process they sell their soul to the devil Mephistopheles like Dr Faustus.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
