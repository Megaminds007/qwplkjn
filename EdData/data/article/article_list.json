The party reportedly elected Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy as its president for life in July 2022. The ECI says such a step is inherently anti-democratic. The YSRCP\u2019s response to the ECI\u2019s letters sent earlier, that it will conduct an \u201cinternal enquiry\u201d, borders on the absurd. There is merit in the ECI\u2019s view and its insistence on internal democracy, as no individual should be elected leader for life. Any party that participates in a democratic process, and wants to govern and legislate, should include formal and periodic election of office-bearers as part of the way it functions as an association. Indian political parties are of myriad kinds \u2014 some, such as the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Communist parties, are structured, cadre-based organisations that function towards an ideological goal or a principle; others, such as the Congress, are more loosely structured collections of individuals with even different strands of opinion but functioning within an association that has core ideals; some others still reflect social or regional cleavages and so on.Increasingly, the fragmentation of India\u2019s polity into a federalised, multi-party system has also given way to domination by \u201ccharismatic\u201d individuals or their families, mainly because of the nature of support that these parties enjoy or due to their financing structures which necessitates centralised control by a single coterie or a family. This is why several political parties today do not insist on thoroughgoing internal elections to secure their leadership; and even if they do conduct polls, they lack sufficient contestation and are done to reaffirm the dominance of the high command. In some cases, with electoral politics being a zero-sum game, political parties are loath to allow internal contest, fearing that this could foster disunity, as opposed to nomination and consensus-building on leadership. The ECI has periodically used guidelines issued for registration of parties under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 to remind parties to conduct elections and to ensure that their leadership is renewed, changed or re-elected every five years. But the commission does not have any statutory power to enforce internal democracy in parties or to mandate elections. The lack of such substantive power only leads to parties carrying out the ECI\u2019s edicts in a mechanical manner. However, with dynasticism and a lack of internal democracy becoming a matter of public debate, perhaps public pressure would finally bear upon parties to do the right thing.",

These past few months, India\u2019s sports administrators have been in the news far too frequently. Rarely does a day end before one of them is pulled up by the court, another is forced to resign or yet another stakes claim to a post. In the latest instance, the sports official to hit the headlines has been Anil Khanna, who resigned on Wednesday as the acting-president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). He had assumed charge after Narinder Batra was forced to quit in July. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made it clear that it would not recognise any acting/interim president of the IOA. The IOC is not pleased that the long-pending elections to the IOA have not been held and has even threatened India with serious consequences. The IOC could ban India if the elections are not held by December. Then, Indian athletes would not be able to represent the country in events, including the Olympic Games, and India would not be able to receive funds from the IOC. Only a month ago, the Gokulam Kerala football team found out what happens when such a ban is enforced. The players had to return from Uzbekistan, where they had gone to take part in the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship. That was because the world football governing body FIFA had banned the All India Football Federation (AIFF).The ban has since been lifted and the AIFF has conducted its elections. But there are other sports, such as hockey and table tennis, that continue to be run by the court-appointed committees of administrators. The main reason behind the messy state of affairs in India\u2019s sports administration at the moment is the reluctance of the officials, across sports bodies, to accept the National Sports Development Code of India, introduced by the central government in 2011. Its intention was noble. By putting a limit to the tenure and age of an administrator, it had the potential to stop sports federations from remaining as the personal fiefdoms of a few, many of them politicians. At a time when Indian sport is showing more promise than it ever did before \u2014 the Tokyo Olympics, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, the Thomas Cup and the Chess Olympiad have shown that the country has more to offer than just cricket \u2014 the administration needs to get its act together. The incumbents should gracefully make way for new administrators with fresh ideas and also allow more former international sportspersons in key administrative posts.",

        "full_article": "GoI has put out a draft Indian Telecommunication Bill, inviting comments. When drawing up the final bill, GoI should note some legitimate concerns. Telcos have for years wanted the same regulations to apply to them and apps that provide communications services. There\u2019s some merit in this. But it\u2019s also true that telcos\u2019 services are based on the use of spectrum, a key national resource that\u2019s auctioned (or allocated), whereas apps ride on the internet. So exact equivalence is hard to establish. More important, if OTT services are asked to obtain licences just as telcos have to, India\u2019s attraction as a global digital hub, the tempo for domestic innovation, creative interfaces with the global ecosystem, all of this will suffer. That\u2019s not what a major digital player with big ambitions should be looking at. As for regulating these apps, there are enough laws to deal with them. Licensing is undesirable not because these apps deserve special treatment but because letting an internet ecosystem flourish is in India\u2019s economic interest.\nIndeed, another proposal in the draft \u2013 changing the name and scope of the universal service obligation fund \u2013 is a more progressive idea in this context. The draft says this fund will also be used to spur investment in R&D. If used wisely, this can be the public trigger for private innovations in communications technology. India still hasn\u2019t created an app or a technology in this space that\u2019s a world-beater. If GoI can choose talent wisely and fund the incubation period relatively generously, chances will improve. And if there are Indian apps that compete with (largely) American apps, competition will keep everyone on their toes.\nUnsurprisingly, the draft says state agencies will have wide powers to intercept messages for national security and other broadly defined reasons. Does this mean encrypted messaging services, whether or not they are licensed, agreeing to formally providing a backdoor to GoI? How will that pan out? And will these interception requirements be different from those in other laws? These are critical questions. But the most critical is what happens to privacy, what are the guardrails for protecting it?\n\n",

The forthcoming paper in the American Economic Review, based on biannual mental health surveys done across US campuses of 4.3 lakh respondents in that period, correlated to the introduction of Facebook in each campus. It found a 9% increase in depression and 12% increase in anxiety disorders over the pre-FB period mean, which researchers said was due to Facebook increasing the ability of students to do unfavourable social comparisons. More worryingly, it noted a 23% increase in students reporting academic impairment as a result of mental health decline.\nScoping out the research for current times, researchers also attributed 24% of the jump in depression rates in the US over the past two decades to Facebook use. The US CDC had found that relatively stable suicide rates among 10-24 year-olds between 2000 and 2007 had shot up 57% between 2007 and 2017. India also tells a similar story. There were 43,000 victims of suicide in the sub-30 age group in 1991, which rose marginally to 45,000 in 2006, but then saw a near 50% rise to 67,000 in 2021. This is the time social media usage spread rapidly.\nThere\u2019s much worse. Last year, a leak revealed Facebook had kept secret for two years internal research suggesting its Instagram app made body image issues worse for teenage girls. While Indian authorities take great pains to criminalise addictions of many kinds, social media in many ways is a worse menace. Facebook\u2019s poor track record in filtering out hate content and fake news, Twitter\u2019s seeming helplessness in face of fake content and fake accounts, all social media employing scandalously few content checkers \u2013 all of this adds up to a real and deepening 21st century problem.

In the latest episode of political violence in Bangladesh on Wednesday, Munshiganj was witness to the return of a familiar terror that has engulfed BNP's month-old countrywide agitation that began on August 22, protesting against the price hikes of daily essentials including fuel and the deaths of several activists in police shootings. Only this time, it didn't seem like a one-party show. BNP activists seemed more prepared, more eager to ward off a marauding police force.\n\nThe authorities must prevent an escalation of violence if we are to have any chance of a political consensus over the fate of the upcoming parliamentary election. Political reconciliation, not violence or intimidation, is the way to that consensus.\u00a0\nIf this is a sign of things to come, we may\u00a0once again be headed for a very tumultuous election year, with the ordinary people ultimately paying the price. According to media reports, in the latest incident, violence began, as it often does in opposition street programmes, with a face-off over forgettable reasons between police and BNP men holding rallies. After some heated arguments, police started to charge batons. The activists started to hurl brickbats. Police doubled down on resisting them. Activists tripled down on countering them. In the end, it turned into an hourlong bloody spectacle with 50-70 individuals injured, including BNP activists, police officials, and journalists.\u00a0It's unfortunate to think that even such ghastly details may soon cease to matter because of their pointlessness and repeated nature.\nBangladesh, of course, deserves more from politics than strikes and sloganeering. But it also deserves more than a blunt, partisan response to political opposition based on grievances of the citizens. This is precisely what has been happening, however, as a rundown on the one month of BNP's countrywide movement shows. Reportedly, violent attacks have been witnessed in as many as 52 of its street events, with police and ruling party men collaborating in many cases. In 27 places, the houses, personal vehicles and business establishments of BNP men were vandalised. Multiple cases were also filed against them. Finally, in 18 places, section 144 was issued because of Awami League events overlapping with BNP's. The overlapping is of course orchestrated, a familiar strategy to foil opposition gatherings.\nBNP leaders have recently signalled their willingness to match violence with violence. Several leaders have asked party cadres to join street events with clubs and rods to \"defend\" themselves against attacks. This can only mean an escalation which, together with anti-BNP provocations, must be avoided if we are to have any chance of a political consensus over the fate of the upcoming parliamentary election. Political reconciliation, not violence or intimidation, is the way to reaching that consensus.\u00a0\nThere is no denying that BNP, or any opposition party for that matter, has the right to peaceful assembly. The current strategy of Awami League to answer BNP's street mobilisation with force and provocations is not only in violation of its own commitment to allow opposition movement ahead of the election, but also a denial of an inalienable right guaranteed by the constitution. We urge the government and also the Election Commission to ensure that all parties are given equal political space with the bigger goal of a fair and peaceful election in mind.\n",

And the mastermind behind this is the headmaster of Nehal Uddin Pilot Girls' High School, Lutfar Rahman, who also serves as secretary of the local exam centre. Police investigations have found that he, along with two other teachers of the school, were involved with the leak.\n\nWe shudder to think how teachers, who are supposed to be role models for their students, could be involved in such criminal activities. What kind of an example have they set for the young minds through these despicable acts? \nWe shudder to think how teachers, who are supposed to be role models for their students, could be involved in such criminal activities. What kind of an example have they set for the young minds through these despicable acts? Details that have emerged of the activities of this group, led by Lutfar Rahman who has served as a headmaster for a decade now, are disturbing. All of them should be brought to justice immediately.\nWe also wonder what has happened to the measures taken by the authorities concerned after SSC question papers were leaked in 2018. During that time, it was decided that the \"set\" of question papers for any specific exam will be announced only before the commencement of the examination; use of mobile phone by exam officials would be banned during the exams; internet speed would be slowed down, etc. Are these measures still being implemented? These steps are needed to stop question paper leaks or any other exam-related irregularities. Moreover, according to the parents and guardians of local students, there is a gang active in Kurigram and Rangpur who sell question papers at a high price prior to such exams. The police should investigate the allegation and arrest the gang members.\nInterestingly, while the Dinajpur Education Board has acknowledged the incident of the question paper leakage and later rescheduled four of the postponed exams, the students, guardians and teachers of the Bhurungamari upazila have alleged that apart from the abovementioned six subjects, question papers of two other subjects also had been leaked. According to them, handwritten copies of question papers of English first paper, held on September 19, and English second paper, held on September 20, were sent to examinees and their guardians the nights before the exams through various messaging apps, including WhatsApp. These allegations should also be investigated by appropriate authorities, and if found to be true, those exams should also be retaken.\nWe hope the SSC examinees of Dinajpur will be able to recover from the leakage trauma and sit for their next exams without having to worry about the recurrence of any such nuisance. The responsibility to ensure this lies with the education board, the local administration and the police.\n",

        "full_article": "Just a glimpse at the budget allocation for healthcare every year is enough to understand how terrible our indifference towards our health sector is. It has been seeing a decline in the budget allocation as a proportion of GDP, dropping to 0.83 percent in the current fiscal year. But according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it should be at least five percent. Bangladesh ranks lowest in South Asia in terms of health allocation as a proportion of GDP. Currently, we have to pay 72 percent of our medical expenses out of our own pockets.\nWHO has committed all member states to ensure universal health coverage (UHC), which means everyone will have access to quality healthcare as needed, regardless of financial constraints. Global health insurance is an important regulator in achieving UHC. Many countries in the world are or have been moving towards achieving UHC through private optional health insurance, community-based health insurance, compulsory payroll-tax-based social health insurance, etc. Germany and France took more than 100 years to cover 100 percent of their populations via social insurance. Many low- and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have continued efforts to implement labour-tax-based mandatory social health insurance for decades.\nBut the idea of \u200b\u200bachieving universal health coverage or its implementation is completely absent in Bangladesh. The ruling government did make a pledge to formulate and implement UHC in the country, but there has been little progress to this end. Despite Covid-19 and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, our economy has not been severely affected. In terms of macroeconomic indicators, Bangladesh should be able to increase the budget for the health sector without disrupting the dynamics of the economy.\nAre our policymakers aware that sustainable development is not possible without investment in the health sector? Investing in healthcare is not just about spending; it strengthens the economy in many ways and contributes to alleviation of poverty and inequality. Investment in the health sector will lead to improved labour force availability, better contribution to school education, employment opportunities for women, and higher productivity in the economy.\nHealthcare financing in Bangladesh comes entirely from the government's general taxation system. There is an opportunity to greatly increase the finance by expanding the scope for the tax base, by consolidating and redistributing the fragmented financing system, and by redistributing priorities. Tax evasion, corruption, and harassment should be prevented. Financing the health sector can be done more easily by expanding the narrow tax system than by trying to collect health insurance premiums from poor and informal sector populations.\nThe need to increase the government budget for our health sector is now beyond debate. In the next national budget, therefore, the health allocation should be increased to two percent of GDP. The finance minister should think about how he will allocate this money. The WHO recommends allocating at least five percent of GDP or 15 percent of the budget to the health sector. An increase in health spending per one percent of GDP would protect 0.13 percent of the population from falling into financial disaster.\nThe challenges of healthcare delivery are mainly twofold: financing and service delivery. Corruption in the health sector, doctors' misconduct, and the lack of capacity to implement the budget are the highlights among the issues. Prioritisation of cost management should be done by accepting the reality of the financial crisis in healthcare. Priority should be given to the inclusion of the poor and vulnerable groups to the maximum extent, and which services are possible to deliver should be taken into consideration. A strong stance should be taken against corruption. Expenditure and results in the health sector should be presented transparently in front of the people. A government survey found that 63 percent of the individual's out-of-pocket expenses were on medicines. A strong primary healthcare system plays the most cost-effective role in achieving universal health coverage.\nPublic healthcare programmes should be implemented through all-out initiatives to prevent diseases. The government should develop a flawless structure capable of fair understanding with drug and medical device manufacturers to procure and supply medicines, medical supplies and new technologies. Help should be provided to build non-profit private healthcare. Differences in service quality and cost between public and private healthcare systems should be reduced, if not eliminated. In addition to public and private healthcare, there should be an opportunity for NGOs to work as a complementary body with the self-sacrificing attitude and capacity to engage in healthcare. The government also must invest in the improvement of the quality of life of healthcare workers.\nUniversal health coverage will not be achieved overnight by some miracle. Learning from the experience of low and low-middle income countries from the last 50 years, Bangladesh should develop a healthcare system keeping in mind the historical evolution of those healthcare systems, cultural acceptance, and political-economic reality. Measuring progress in achieving the UHC requires an integrated national health database. The UHC structure should be constructed by analysing the information obtained from there, making plans, and implementing new decisions from the lessons of success and failure. The countries that have achieved UHC have consistently had high budget allocations for healthcare at the top of their political agendas. Strong political commitment is needed to expand healthcare coverage to the poor and vulnerable, and to prioritise the voice of marginalised people over that of opportunistic groups.\nOur constitution mentions the pledge to establish a state based on equality. A fundamental human aspiration is that the individual or family will not be destitute or be driven into further poverty while seeking medical treatment. Otherwise, our constitution will not be able to play any regulatory role to protect the health and lives of the people of this country.\nDr Rakib Al Hasan\u00a0is a physician, author, activist & youth leader.

        "full_article": "I found out last Sunday that Ajay Devgn taught my husband about consent.\nHe was a budding teenager watching a movie clearly not intended for his age group. It was a 90s romance where the parents forcefully married off the heroine, Aishwarya Rai, who loved someone else. Not able to tolerate Ajay's advances on the wedding night, and in a climactic turn of events, Aishwarya shrugs off her bridal saree defiantly, daring him to take her \u2013 knowing her heart isn't in it. Ajay, ever the gentleman, steps back and insists nothing would take place in this relationship without her full consent. \"It taught me it's only fun if both parties are having fun,\" my husband mused over a cup of tea. I wondered how, out of all the problematic Bollywood films that surrounded him growing up, he learnt from one of the only ones that were not.\nI soon realised it was not the movie that found him, but he who chose which movie would impact his psyche. It was only because he was equipped with a modicum of empathy that he could filter out all the eve-teasing-heavy 90s films, and cling on to a humane approach to sexuality and individuality. Hundreds of social awareness programmes and thousands of opinion pieces like this one would not have swayed his perspective on bodily autonomy, had his moral compass been slightly askew from an early age \u2013 an age so early that most of our conversations and policies surrounding consent education completely miss it. We depend on families to educate children with the basics of empathy and morality, and we depend on society to guide them to healthy relationships. But more often than not, any successes in either field is completely accidental.\nThe verdict on comprehensive sex education is out: there is a significant positive correlation between access to sex education in schools and having healthy relationships in adulthood. Sex education in childhood translates to improved well-being indicators on nearly all fronts \u2013 physical, emotional, and mental health of adults \u2013 and the benefits far outweigh any other intervention at this stage of life. Law enforcement, community-building, and urban design may lower the chances of sexual assault in public spaces, and may even force citizens to engage in civil debate around sexuality, but it does little for direct or indirect violations of human rights behind closed doors. When it comes to such grievous social harm, we cannot relegate the tasks to external bodies to punish criminals or seek retribution; we must push for prevention so that the harm does not take place in the first place.\nGiven that sex education is the answer, the main questions that we need to ask are those that plague all practitioners: What, when, and how? What type of sex education, at which age, presented in what manner would be most effective for our demographic? These are the questions I have pursued for a good part of my adult life, mostly because of a singular drive to prevent what happened to me from happening to anyone again. I am sure many women and men around the world feel the same. It is a slowly seething, burning rage at a system that is not designed to keep abuse at bay, but invites it. Even though Bangladesh has improved significantly in gender parity, especially compared to its neighbours, it faces the prospect of a bitter end to the economic growth witnessed through the emancipation of women if it does not hold social forces in check. The government is acutely aware of this.\nIn 2012-2016, the education ministry introduced gender education \u2013 Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS) module \u2013 in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in hundreds of schools. People graduating from the programme speak highly of their lessons, which have stayed with them to this day. While national implementation is in the works, I find it important to share transferable lessons from countries with similar context or characteristics (India, Oman, and Israel) for Bangladesh's design of comprehensive sex education, not merely gender education.\nMost countries I researched found that the earlier they implemented comprehensive sex education, the more effective it was. GEMS was launched in the 12-14 age group, when it should be imparted phase by phase from earlier grades \u2013 even elementary school, bearing in mind that sex education for children is not the same as that for young adults. For example, \"consent\" or \"autonomy\" are complex terminologies for a child to grasp, but the ideas around consent \u2013 good touch/bad touch, respectful bodily contact, moderated language \u2013 are age-blind. Interactive curricula, follow-up group exercises and class discussions provide the greatest bang for buck as they are more cost-effective than impressive audio-visuals, which often act as passive engagement. Additionally, adjusting language for localities and including non-central examples do wonders for communication. Imagine a Sylheti teacher speaking in his dialect and bringing in examples that are relevant for that locality.\nThat brings us to one of the biggest determinators of success in comprehensive sex education: facilitators. Not only is it crucial that teachers are trained to carry out these interactive lessons, but also that they believe in the material that is being taught. Authentic engagement with the principles of the programme is of paramount importance and not something that can be forced. The Bangladesh government may wish to hire separate roaming, specialised sex educators, but I personally don't think that is required. Even in remote Goshairhat, I found teachers lecturing about sanitary napkins and period without using a single euphemism \u2013 a prospect unthinkable a mere decade back. Bangladesh has a lot to be proud of, and our teachers \u2013 underpaid, under-trained and underappreciated as they are \u2013 are in most parts phenomenally dynamic. However, whether they have the time or support to accommodate an extra module in a chaotic educational environment is something that the education ministry badly needs to assess.\nWhen all assessments are done and dusted, our interventions are not executed in a vacuum. The module that teachers present to students might be innocuous and effective, but students can only retain lessons if society is actively involved. In Bangladesh, local government, central government, and private actors are often in alignment in the execution of social programmes \u2013 think family planning and girl education. But where engagement is crucially missing is on the religious front.\nMy research on countries with a similar demography found that the inclusion of Islamic bodies and authorities in early-stage design raises the credibility of the course content while making implementation smoother. Many may argue that it leaves too much room open for religious interjection in a textbook, but what it in fact ensures is that there is a check on religious sensitivity prior to national launch. Islamic countries throughout the world have comprehensive sex education at schools, and the\u00a0ulama\u00a0of Bangladesh are aware of that. In Islam, there is specific mention of a child's right to understanding their body and mind \u2013 and, by conjecture, their relationship with other people in context of that mind and body. I am not positing at any point that all stakeholders in this venture \u2013 government, schools,\u00a0ulama, priests, parents \u2013 will agree on all aspects of the design, but it is important that they agree on the need for it. That need is evident, and ultimately, sex education will only be successful if every part of the community owns it.\nWhat \"successful\" means also varies. We cannot hope for a Scandinavian version of sexual awareness in a decade, and we should not hope for that either. If my research has shown anything, it is the importance of careful lesson extrapolation, not replication, as the latter always results in a mixed bag of results. After a decade of comprehensive sex education, Bangladesh should hope to have a tolerant society, where interpersonal relationships are approached with respect \u2013 not necessarily Western liberalism or Arab conservatism. I envision a Bangladeshi society with a basic understanding of consent, where there is no need for Ajay Devgns to come to sudden realisations on screen, but only a somewhat peaceful acceptance of another human being's right to live freely and without interference. That will do just fine.\nMastura Tasnim\u00a0is a policy consultant working on local development, religiopolitics, and gender education.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Once again, the street has been stained with blood. Once again, batons have been charged, teargas and bullets fired, and brickbats hurled. In the latest episode of political violence in Bangladesh on Wednesday, Munshiganj was witness to the return of a familiar terror that has engulfed BNP's month-old countrywide agitation that began on August 22, protesting against the price hikes of daily essentials including fuel and the deaths of several activists in police shootings. Only this time, it didn't seem like a one-party show. BNP activists seemed more prepared, more eager to ward off a marauding police force.\n\nThe authorities must prevent an escalation of violence if we are to have any chance of a political consensus over the fate of the upcoming parliamentary election. Political reconciliation, not violence or intimidation, is the way to that consensus.\u00a0\nIf this is a sign of things to come, we may\u00a0once again be headed for a very tumultuous election year, with the ordinary people ultimately paying the price. According to media reports, in the latest incident, violence began, as it often does in opposition street programmes, with a face-off over forgettable reasons between police and BNP men holding rallies. After some heated arguments, police started to charge batons. The activists started to hurl brickbats. Police doubled down on resisting them. Activists tripled down on countering them. In the end, it turned into an hourlong bloody spectacle with 50-70 individuals injured, including BNP activists, police officials, and journalists.\u00a0It's unfortunate to think that even such ghastly details may soon cease to matter because of their pointlessness and repeated nature.\nBangladesh, of course, deserves more from politics than strikes and sloganeering. But it also deserves more than a blunt, partisan response to political opposition based on grievances of the citizens. This is precisely what has been happening, however, as a rundown on the one month of BNP's countrywide movement shows. Reportedly, violent attacks have been witnessed in as many as 52 of its street events, with police and ruling party men collaborating in many cases. In 27 places, the houses, personal vehicles and business establishments of BNP men were vandalised. Multiple cases were also filed against them. Finally, in 18 places, section 144 was issued because of Awami League events overlapping with BNP's. The overlapping is of course orchestrated, a familiar strategy to foil opposition gatherings.\nBNP leaders have recently signalled their willingness to match violence with violence. Several leaders have asked party cadres to join street events with clubs and rods to \"defend\" themselves against attacks. This can only mean an escalation which, together with anti-BNP provocations, must be avoided if we are to have any chance of a political consensus over the fate of the upcoming parliamentary election. Political reconciliation, not violence or intimidation, is the way to reaching that consensus.\u00a0\nThere is no denying that BNP, or any opposition party for that matter, has the right to peaceful assembly. The current strategy of Awami League to answer BNP's street mobilisation with force and provocations is not only in violation of its own commitment to allow opposition movement ahead of the election, but also a denial of an inalienable right guaranteed by the constitution. We urge the government and also the Election Commission to ensure that all parties are given equal political space with the bigger goal of a fair and peaceful election in mind.\n",

Reportedly, question papers of six subjects \u2013 General Mathematics, Higher Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Agricultural Education \u2013 have been leaked. And the mastermind behind this is the headmaster of Nehal Uddin Pilot Girls' High School, Lutfar Rahman, who also serves as secretary of the local exam centre. Police investigations have found that he, along with two other teachers of the school, were involved with the leak.\n\nWe shudder to think how teachers, who are supposed to be role models for their students, could be involved in such criminal activities. What kind of an example have they set for the young minds through these despicable acts? \nWe shudder to think how teachers, who are supposed to be role models for their students, could be involved in such criminal activities. What kind of an example have they set for the young minds through these despicable acts? Details that have emerged of the activities of this group, led by Lutfar Rahman who has served as a headmaster for a decade now, are disturbing. All of them should be brought to justice immediately.\nWe also wonder what has happened to the measures taken by the authorities concerned after SSC question papers were leaked in 2018. During that time, it was decided that the \"set\" of question papers for any specific exam will be announced only before the commencement of the examination; use of mobile phone by exam officials would be banned during the exams; internet speed would be slowed down, etc. Are these measures still being implemented? These steps are needed to stop question paper leaks or any other exam-related irregularities. Moreover, according to the parents and guardians of local students, there is a gang active in Kurigram and Rangpur who sell question papers at a high price prior to such exams. The police should investigate the allegation and arrest the gang members.\nInterestingly, while the Dinajpur Education Board has acknowledged the incident of the question paper leakage and later rescheduled four of the postponed exams, the students, guardians and teachers of the Bhurungamari upazila have alleged that apart from the abovementioned six subjects, question papers of two other subjects also had been leaked. According to them, handwritten copies of question papers of English first paper, held on September 19, and English second paper, held on September 20, were sent to examinees and their guardians the nights before the exams through various messaging apps, including WhatsApp. These allegations should also be investigated by appropriate authorities, and if found to be true, those exams should also be retaken.\nWe hope the SSC examinees of Dinajpur will be able to recover from the leakage trauma and sit for their next exams without having to worry about the recurrence of any such nuisance. The responsibility to ensure this lies with the education board, the local administration and the police.\n",

        "full_article": "Gas shortage that seemed to have affected industrial production in a few selected areas since the past months has by now become a major threat to almost the entire range of industrial productivity. Notable among the sectors badly affected include textiles, RMG, light engineering, fertiliser, cement etc. As reports have it, the country's textile mills are the worst victims of gas shortage which have been struggling to cope with power cuts for more than a month. Production in the export-oriented textile mills has drastically fallen due to the ongoing gas supply shortage. Some 300 textile mills located at Gazipur, Savar, Ashulia, Shreepur, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Narsingdi and Bhaluka are reportedly finding it extremely difficult to remain operational in this situation. At a time when the country's textile and apparel sector is recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, shortage of gas supply signals a grim prospect for its recovery. Exporters are fearing delays in shipment, if the present situation continues or further worsens in the coming days as the industry needs uninterrupted supply of gas. The country's gas production drastically fell due to a reported technical fault that surfaced in the Bibiyana gas field. As a result, gas pressure came down well below the required level, according to sector insiders. Expressing concern, the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) has said that it would be difficult for the millers to meet their administrative costs, pay workers' wage and bank-loan instalments, if such a situation persists for a longer period. The mills cover a wide range of sub-sectors like spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, finishing and knitting. More importantly, it is their critical role as backward linkage industry--supplying most of the fabric and yarn to the export-oriented garment factories--that makes the textile mills uniquely distinctive. Currently, garment factories procure more than 70 per cent of their raw materials for export of woven garments and almost hundred per cent of knit garments from the local textile mills.  The BTMA in a letter to the power, energy and mineral resources minister pressed upon the need to urgently address the situation. The situation is worrying-- not just for the millers but for the country's garment export. Presently, following a brief span of abundant export orders in the past few months, there is a lull which industry insiders fear might dip further if the exporters fail to keep their commitments to deliver shipments on time. This undesirable situation may happen if supply of raw materials from the local textile mills gets hampered due to gas shortage. What is important to note here is that given the volatile international market marked by increasing competition, a slump in export of a seasonal product like garment due to supply disruption may leave a long-term effect on RMG business.  Given the situation and the worries expressed by the industry people, the authorities should put in their best to mend the situation. Any technical glitch responsible for the gas shortage should be identified and fixed as soon as possible.",

        "full_article": "It is mind-boggling to think that one person is dying of hunger every four seconds in this world of advanced science and technology. In terms of number, on an average 19,700 human beings succumb to starvation every day. Belying the United Nations' optimism and pledge that no person will be allowed to die for want of food in the 21st century, the number of deaths is an abysmal affront to the civilisation poised to embark on its fourth industrial revolution (4IR). No wonder that 238 NGOs of the world in an open letter to the world leaders gathering in New York for the United Nations General Assembly have tried to draw the latter's attention to this manmade hunger for immediate action. In their statement they mentioned, \"A staggering 345 million people are now experiencing acute hunger, a number that has more than doubled since 2019.\"Now contrast this with such news as 573 people became new billionaires --- one every 30 hours during the critical period of the pandemic. Add to this, the 5.2 million millionaires who joined their category of the rich worldwide. Again, 10 richest people in the world doubled their net worth during the Covid crisis. Earlier, the charitable organisation Oxfam put it succinctly on the eve of the World Economic Forum conference at Davos, Switzerland thus, \"We've seen this explosion in billionaire wealth during the pandemic, and now on the back of food and energy price increases. And you're seeing this historic rise in poverty worldwide, which we also haven't seen for decades\". How the Oxfam analyses this is even more important. It is categorical that the superrich could outrageously accumulate their wealth largely because of tax-payers' money. How? It is because rich countries ---not to mention countries like Bangladesh ---poured trillions of dollars into their economies in response to Covid-19. That indeed drove up the asset prices. The fortunes of the food and energy billionaires now getting amassed as profits in those sectors are soaring on the back of galloping prices. This has not been any different in Bangladesh where the real beneficiaries of the injection of money in the form of stimulus packages have been the country's rich and superrich. Against the creation of one billionaire every 30 hours, 263 million more people will slide into extreme poverty worldwide in 2022. As many as 50 million people in 45 countries are on the brink of starvation by this time. What will be the number of Bangladesh people hurtling into that level of misery this year? In the context of high inflation, a record number of people may fall victim to such abject poverty.What makes the world so unjust, uncaring and mindless even during and after the worst pandemic in human history? In fact, the problem lies with the system of wealth creation and its distribution. Profit-sharing is based on a most unfair and irrational conception ---a legacy of the free market economy. Investors and entrepreneurs along with the business sharks have developed a highly exploitative system in which working force is left outrageously deprived of their reasonable dues. All this is because owners of factories and industries and corporate businesses are always after capital gains for expansion of their business empires, sparing hardly any thought of all-round welfare of the workers and their families. Of course, they are smart enough to pamper the brains behind business in such a way that the latter soon become a tool for the intriguing act of exploitation.  The filthy rich who should have been scoffed at for not sharing their unethically amassed fortunes are in fact looked at with awe, if not revered, in the present system of economic order. Superrich like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates have initiated a move to reach out to the needy with staggering allocation of funds. But the poverty, depravity and needs are far more abysmal than can the charity of a few top billionaires of the world address. Also these are isolated efforts to lessen the sufferings of the teeming millions. Better it would have been had there been a concerted and collaborative venture mooted by the world's rich and superrich to share a portion of their huge fortunes with the poor wallowing in misery. Sure enough, their contribution to an internationally pooled fund would not have bled them at all but could eliminate starvation and living woes of every person on this planet once for all. Equally important, beside one-time support for building a decent shelter and livelihood, is to ensure sustainability of living standard by means of a permanent source of income for all. This is quite possible ---and was most desirable at the time of the pandemic and the post-pandemic period of economies' turnaround---if public-private collaboration is upped to wage a war against poverty and hunger. Instead of going for any such socio-economic welfare programme, states and corporate businesses are out to take undue advantage of supply crunch of energy and foods in order to maximise their profits. It is in the world leaders' and policymakers' power to bring an end to poverty and hunger the world over but there is no sign they are serious enough to respond to the crisis the humanity is facing now. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "That only a tiny percentage of the people with taxable income is paying tax is an undisputed reality. Bangladesh has the lowest tax-GDP ratio in the South Asia region. A recent survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) showed that nearly 68 per cent of people with taxable income did not pay tax to the government. The number of e-TIN (electronic tax identification number) holders is over 7.4 million, as of 30th June 2022. Of them, only 2.3 million had submitted tax returns in the last financial year. Then again, a significant number of e-TIN holders had submitted zero-tax returns, meaning they did not pay any tax. The truth is that the latter group needs tax certificates/ tax-return receipts to run their business operations or carry out trade/ bank transactions as required by laws and rules.The government's earnings in the form of income tax have risen in recent years, but are not commensurate with the size of the economy and the resultant increase in per capita income. The difference is indeed too big.Tax evasion or tax avoidance is more or less a common practice in Bangladesh. But its extent varies. The multinationals are faithful in tax payments. Local corporate houses do also pay tax on profits regularly, but it is not unusual on their part to play with numbers to pay less than actual payable taxes to the government. The number of business firms/establishments/ owners of residential and commercial buildings evading tax payments across the country will run into millions. The National Board of Revenue (NBR), reportedly, has tried to bring tax-evading firms under the tax net in recent years, but with no notable success. The officials and employees working in the organised manufacturing and services sectors are among the people who pay taxes regularly. The management at the end of every month deducts the tax amount from their salaries and deposits the same in the public exchequer. Most others are found reluctant to pay taxes. The NBR needs to continue to expand its tax net to help generate more revenues for the government. At the same time, it will be important to find out the reasons behind people's reluctance to pay taxes. In Bangladesh, there are six tax slabs, the highest being 25 per cent. There are countries, mainly developed ones, where the rate is as high as 40 per cent and the people there pay taxes regularly. The desire or motivation to pay taxes is very important. But that does not come automatically. Benefits commensurate with the payment of taxes need to be there to motivate people to pay taxes. Old-age pensions, free medical, and health insurance are among the benefits that most developed countries ensure for their citizens. Here, nothing is given as an incentive to the taxpayers. The government might say that taxpayers' money is spent on building roads, hospitals and other structures and maintenance of state machinery. A regular taxpayer does not enjoy any preference or special treatment while availing of the services of these facilities. He or she is treated just like others. Nor a taxpayer on his/her retirement enjoys any benefit, financial or otherwise, as a senior citizen. Thus, it will be important for the government to introduce minimum benefits for taxpayers when they become senior citizens. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the infection rate has seen a 47 per cent increase in the country within a week. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) statistics also show an increase in the number of infections. The daily positivity rate rose to 14.73 per cent on Wednesday from Tuesday's 12.73 per cent. It is generally believed that for every confirmed case there are five unreported cases, leading to the conclusion that the actual number of daily infection is at least five times the officially confirmed figure. If the infection is not controlled now, there may be a possibility of a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases in our country. The threat is likely since people no longer appear worried about contracting coronavirus and do not observe preventive health protocols. Public transports, as usual, are dealing with overwhelming rush of passengers, almost all without wearing face masks, in congested spaces while people are attending large social, political and religious gatherings. Those who are still unvaccinated should immediately receive vaccine to check the transmission cycle of the virus. Wearing mask and avoiding public gathering should also be considered the most effective mechanism in checking the surge of Covid cases. \nAbu Elias Linkon,Banasree, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
