Mr. Biden said he was confident that his administration, which has only some more days left in office, could secure a deal. However, experience suggests that there is no deal unless an actual deal is reached, irrespective of the progress in talks. Even now, there are conflicting narratives on the remaining bottlenecks. Mr. Biden says Hamas is an obstacle, while Qatari and Egyptian officials, who were involved in the talks, say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to agree to anything more than a temporary ceasefire is the main hurdle. Mr. Netanyahu does not want to bring the war to an end as his far-right government could collapse. But he is ready to accept a temporary halt in fighting in return for hostages. Hamas, fearing that Israel would resume fighting once the hostages are released, demand a permanent ceasefire. While talks drag on, the plight of over two million people in Gaza is nearly forgotten. Israeli strikes have already killed 46,000 Palestinians. Most of Gaza\u2019s population lives in tent cities without enough food, drinking water, medicines and electricity.When Israel launched the war, after Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack, it had three objectives \u2014 destroy Hamas, secure the release of hostages and bolster the Jewish state\u2019s long-term security. Fifteen months later, while Israel has destroyed much of Hamas\u2019s military infrastructure and killed its top leadership, the group has survived and transformed itself as an insurgency. Israel has managed to release very few hostages and its long-term security risks remain. While a ceasefire with Hezbollah brought relative calm to the northern border, the Houthis of Yemen are now firing missiles and drones to Israel. The country is also facing international isolation. The International Court of Justice is hearing a genocide case against Israel, and the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Mr. Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Rights organisations, from Amnesty International to HRW, are accusing Israel of genocide. Mr. Netanyahu seems unperturbed, thanks to the military, political and diplomatic support that Israel still enjoys from the Biden administration. But its inability to meet its objectives even in the tiny Gaza Strip, its disregard for international law and norms and the barbarity with which it is attacking the Palestinians should shock anyone interested in the country\u2019s physical and moral well-being. It is already too late. Israel\u2019s leaders and their backers in the West should not prolong this aimless war. Mr. Netanyahu should leave Gaza in return for the release of all hostages.

        "full_article": "Instead of signalling its intention to hold elections to rural local bodies, the Tamil Nadu government has appointed special officers for these bodies in several districts of the State. Elections were due in 9,624 village panchayats, 314 panchayat unions, and 28 district panchayats where the term of office of the RLBs came to an end on January 5. These government officers will function for the next six months. In support of its decision, the government has cited the ongoing re-organisation of rural and urban local bodies, which will result in a delimitation of wards of the local bodies \u2014 a step that the government considers a prerequisite to the conduct of polls to local bodies. It had given an undertaking to the Madras High Court in December 2024, that no poll notification would be issued without completing delimitation and putting in place a quota of seats and offices for women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Apart from creating four more municipal corporations by accommodating village panchayats, the stage is set for the expansion of the limits of municipal corporations, municipalities and town panchayats by taking in other village panchayats. It has proposed the merger of least 140 village panchayats with municipal corporations. Though there is nothing final about the reorganisation, the government is of the view that rapid urbanisation in village panchayats adjoining bigger cities such as Chennai and Coimbatore necessitates a fresh look at the local bodies.In Suresh Mahajan vs State of Madhya Pradesh, the Supreme Court had held that the delimitation or formation of ward \u201ccannot be a legitimate ground to be set forth by any authority much less the State Election Commission \u2014 to not discharge its constitutional obligation in notifying the election programme\u201d at an opportune time and ensure that an elected body was installed before the expiry of the five-year term of the outgoing body. It had also stipulated that in undertaking delimitation, which the Court regarded as a continuous exercise, it \u201cought to be commenced well-in-advance\u201d so that the elections were notified on time. Sections of residents in a number of village panchayats have opposed the proposed reorganisation of local bodies as they are apprehensive of the cessation of rural development schemes such as the MGNREGA if there is a merger with urban local bodies. Tamil Nadu is not the only State that has failed to hold local body polls on time. Bigger cities such as Mumbai and Bengaluru are on the list. It is time that the States realise the importance of the space that local bodies occupy in the democratic structure. Despite shortcomings, local self-governments do make a qualitative difference to people\u2019s lives.

        "full_article": "\u2013 By Arijit Ray\nWe have heard of the Sanskrit phrase from our ancient texts, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: the world is one family. Through our growing years, we are taught to avoid selfish pursuits and prioritise our families\u2019 well-being. However, thinking beyond our families can become a struggle.\nSwami Vivekananda says, \u201cLike the caterpillar that takes the thread from its own mouth and builds its cocoon and at last finds itself caught inside the cocoon, we have bound ourselves by our actions.\u201d\nWe believe we are all separate, cutting ourselves from our universal identity. Unaware of the universal energy that connects us all, we immerse ourselves in identifying with our thoughts, identity, and status, creating a bond with the body-mind complex. We create a cocoon of self-interest around our lives through our actions. The way out of this limited life lies in Swami Vivekananda\u2019s inspiring call of expansion and oneness. He says, \u201cExpansion is Life. Contraction is death. The more unselfish we become, the more peace pours into us. When we are selfish, we contract, bringing misery into our lives.\u201d\n\nSwami Vivekananda says each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity. According to him, worship of God should not be confined to churches and temples. The starting point of Swamiji\u2019s teaching was that we are all divine, and there is the same divinity in everyone.\nAnn Myren, one of his Western followers, says: \u201cDivinity of man for him was a continuous spiritual experience. His consciousness had transformed.\u201d\nWhen this idea that we are all one and this individual identity is an illusion permeates our being, humanistic impulses emerge from our personality. We can break free from our likes and dislikes, devastating jealousies and arrogance of accomplishments. From an elevated awareness comes tremendous respect for human life and relationships. It transforms our motivations and actions.\nSwami Vivekananda says, \u201cEverything that is strong, good, and powerful in human nature is the outcome of that divinity. To every man, this is taught: Thou art one with this Universal Being, and, as such every soul that exists is your soul, and every body that exists is your body; and in hurting anyone, you hurt yourself, in loving anyone, you love yourself.\u201d\nIn a world filled with discord, this uplifting message offers much-needed guidance to balance our pursuits. Swami Vivekananda has breathed new vitality into this grand ideal realised by our ancient rishis. Along with the mantra of success, this universal ideal should also be introduced to every young mind. So that, as they grow, they can break free from their selfish interests and become worthy world citizens with expanded hearts. With Vivekananda\u2019s strengthinducing message \u2013 \u201cArise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached\u201d \u2013 emblazoned in our hearts if we can manifest even a little of this oneness in our lives, it will do wonders to human relationships. Spontaneity will flow from our hearts. Feelings for others will magnify. Gradually, we can transform the world into one family, truly living the ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.\nSwami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrated on Jan 12.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Don\u2019t just step on ants. Here\u2019s why\u00a0\nA Bulgarian journalist recently asked Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: Do you step on ants? Do you notice them while you walk? She got a bit nervous. But most of us would think these are bizarre questions. They aren\u2019t. The general egotism of human species means it thinks little of other living organisms, and many of these it doesn\u2019t think about at all. Ants may be everywhere on the planet except Ant-arctica but everyday we step on them un-mindfully. Though they have been on earth 100 million years longer than us. And as EO Wilson indicated in his seminal paper The Little Things That Run the World, the truth is that we need ants but they don\u2019t need us. The great biologist went further. He said that if invertebrates were to disappear, the human species would likely not last more than a few months.\nEven worse than ignoring them, often we treat them sadistically. In a famous scene in Hemingway\u2019s A Farewell to Arms, the \u2018hero\u2019 listlessly puts them to death, alternately, by fire and water. Just as indifferently, we kick at anthills as if their being amounts to nothing at all. In one experiment, it took scientists 10 tonnes of concrete to fill an ant colony. Imagine the skill and the science that go into making an ant mega-city. Ants\u2019 collectivism, their architecture, their agriculture\u2026we are just beginning to understand their gifts and grand work. We must rein in our megalomania.

        "full_article": "Dhaka University is located at the heart of Dhaka, a city that stands by the Buriganga River with mostly northward expansion. Over the last 400 years, we have seen relatively little growth in the southern part of the town and the south bank of the river. The narrow alleys of Old Dhaka can be one contributing factor. The presence of some sensitive sites may also have stifled its growth. Dhaka University, initially spread across 600 acres of lush green Ramna, but later reduced to 275 acres in the last 100 years, is one such site. Together with the Pilkhana BDR compound and Azimpur graveyard, the university campus limits the scope of the city's expansion.\nCompare the city map to a human face, and you'll see the campus near the jawline and neck. The university authority's recent decision to regulate traffic flow at all seven main entrances has brought the spatial issue back to the surface. But we need to be cautious in portraying Dhaka University as a mere physical space. It is the symbolic heart of Bangladesh. If it misses a beat, the whole nation feels it. If it beats too often, the entire body pulsates with energy and emotion. We have witnessed this phenomenon during various protests and uprisings. It is not an overstatement to suggest that every political movement that shaped the nation's consciousness has its origin in Dhaka University. As a living palimpsest with layered memories of the past, the university serves as an essential energy base that empowers individuals and creates a space for activism and intellectual rigour. Restricting the flow of the public into the campus, therefore, has both physical and symbolic consequences.\nPrior to Victory Day, the university decided to limit campus mobility. Evidently, it prioritised self-protection over public accessibility. The exercise of autonomy by the university could potentially be detrimental to the public good. A group of teachers, representing the University Teachers' Network (UTN), recently met the vice-chancellor requesting him to reconsider the decision of blocking public thoroughfares. Engaging students to control traffic has further attenuated the situation. Newspapers and podcasts have reported on how students assisting the police force are constantly confronting passersby and preventing them from entering the campus. Their near-vigilante attitude has far-reaching consequences.\nLet me begin by considering the concerns that led the administration to restrict mobility on campus. The presence of outsiders poses security challenges such as theft, harassment, accidents, crimes, substance abuse, and trespassing. Noise and overcrowding can disrupt the academic environment, hindering learning, research, and intellectual activities. Recently, permitting a mass rally in the nearby Suhrawardy Udyan made this particularly evident: punters virtually took over the entire campus, littering and urinating everywhere. The political tension persists, and it's impossible to ignore the fear of the ousted faction resuming its full fury on campus. The proctor says he must prioritise protecting his students. His statement pits the needs of a few (campus residents) against those of many (general public). As a state-funded university that hosts numerous city corporation-owned roads, the DU administration must adopt a more pragmatic approach when managing access to key public facilities. The campus houses Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and skirts BIRDEM Hospital and BSMMU. It houses or is adjacent to two public academic centres (Bangla Academy and Shishu Academy), one vital research centre (Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission), two national parks with historical significance, one public library, many schools and commercial centres, and access to a flyover leading to the national highway. There is no rational way the university can deny access to essential services for the sake of institutional convenience.\nThe restriction has forced many passengers to walk from the metro rail station or take a second ride to move through the campus. This is disproportionately affecting non-affluent citizens, leading to an increase in both travel time and cost. With so much focus on cars and rickshaws, there seems to be little control over pedestrians. On Thursday, thousands of former paramilitary men walked through the campus to gather at Shahbagh. And there were no stops for pedestrians. But the restriction barred access for patients in ambulances or passengers in cars and motorcycles from travelling. Despite possessing a DU car sticker, the slow identification and rerouting of unauthorised vehicles created a bottleneck, delaying me from approaching the checkpoint by almost an hour. I could see how the decision to divert traffic had led to public resentment.\nAnyone who has read the comments on traffic alert groups on social media will notice a growing voice against the university's relocation from its current location to the outskirts of the city. People now associate DU with gated areas such as cantonments and housing societies due to its exclusionary policies.\nWhat's even more dangerous is that the university has recruited student volunteers to serve as gatekeepers, who lack proper training in crowd management and proper gear to differentiate themselves from the general public. Heated exchanges with frustrated members of the public are becoming commonplace, which can easily spiral into violence. Some video footage shows students overstepping their authority. Their actions can damage the university's reputation and question the administration's leadership. Confrontational incidents involving students may result in legal challenges against the university. Some of the comments made by the students suggest that they see themselves as separate or superior to the general population. This can deepen social divisions and breed resentment among the public. If this situation persists, students run the risk of losing the solidarity and goodwill that they garnered during the July uprising.\nConversely, over-reliance on students for enforcing access policies suggests a failure of institutional governance. It signals that the university administration lacks the capacity to implement policies through proper channels, such as trained security personnel, advanced technology or infrastructure improvements. A confrontational dynamic between students and the public can lead to long-term polarisation, undermining the shared civic identity that DU symbolises. DU, being a university committed to sustainability, must place a high priority on inclusion. Students should not serve as gatekeepers for decentralised agencies of power that impose discipline and punishment on the public. Instead, it should portray itself as a democratic space that upholds the public's \"right to the city\" and not a privatised space that turns the campus into a contested and polarised site.\nSince the problem concerns security, the solution lies in the employment of trained security teams for campus management. The university must hold stakeholders' meetings and devise strategies such as bypass roads, tunnels, and designated lanes for rickshaws, bikes, or cars to effectively manage traffic flow through the campus. DU must not lose its reputation as a civic space for organising public events and cultural programmes. While we must control access to sensitive or academic zones, we should maintain open access to areas such as hospitals, libraries, or museums. Dhaka University, I believe, has the intellectual acumen and pragmatism to balance safety with access and preserve the university's role as a shared, civic space.\nDr Shamsad Mortuza is professor of English at Dhaka University.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The gradual decline of migratory bird population in our water bodies, such as haors, beels and lakes, demonstrates our failure as a host. Every winter, these birds travel thousands of kilometres to escape the biting cold of their homelands for Bangladesh's warm tropical waters. In recent years, instead of finding a safe and welcoming sanctuary, these waterfowls\u2014especially those coming to Hakaluki Haor in Moulvibazar and Sylhet\u2014have been subjected to rampant poaching, noise, and plastic pollution, according to a report by\u00a0The Daily Star. They also face food shortages because of the declining fish population and the depletion of aquatic vegetation in the haor.\nAlthough the Hakaluki Haor has been designated as an ecologically critical area and a Ramsar site of international importance, the use of nets and poison baits to capture birds has not stopped. Furthermore, rivers flowing into the haor often carry plastic, polythene and other dumped waste, polluting the wetland. On the other hand, in artificial lakes, such as those in Jahangirnagar University, migratory birds suffer from the menace of noise and air pollution. According to an Ekattor TV report, noise from the nearby construction sites and loudspeakers scares the birds away in the only preserved lake on the green campus, which, in recent times, has lost many of its waterbodies, filled in to erect new buildings.\nThe arrival and nesting of migratory birds in our country is not only essential because it is a scenic, natural wonder, but also because migratory birds perform important ecological functions by moving nutrients between habitats and across landscapes. Therefore, it is not enough to declare a wetland or a water body an environmentally important zone on paper. Visible actions are required to safeguard these sanctuaries. To achieve this, the government, in collaboration with environmental activists and organisations, should run awareness campaigns to educate local communities about the importance of migratory birds. Local people should also be economically empowered and involved in safeguarding these sanctuaries so they refrain from poaching, overfishing, and resorting to other harmful practices.\nAdditionally, the government must enforce policies to mitigate plastic, noise and air pollution. Use of polluting consumer and commercial products must be restricted and gradually replaced with environmentally-friendly materials. Finally, strict legal actions should be taken against polluters and poachers to discourage such behaviours. To re-establish our reputation as a hospitable nation, we must ensure that our water bodies are safe for migratory birds.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh stands at a crossroads, navigating a tumultuous journey marked by political uncertainty, precarious law and order situation, and economic disruption and downturn. The events of the past year, from the July uprising that ousted the Awami League government to the appointment of an interim administration led by Nobel Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus, have rekindled hopes of a freer, fairer and more democratic future. Yet, as we step into 2025, it is evident that the challenges of political instability, economic stagnation, and governance inefficiencies have not been fully addressed, casting a shadow over the nation's prospects. The looming uncertainty and resulting anxiety do not bode well for a country on a tricky path to transition from an autocratic regime to hopefully a democratically elected government that will govern well and fulfil people's legitimate socioeconomic and other aspirations.\nDespite the interim government's assurances of electoral reforms and democratic progress, ambiguity persists regarding the timeline for the next parliamentary election. While the chief adviser's announcement of potential election dates in late 2025 or first half of 2026 offers some clarity, conflicting demands from major political parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and divergent visions within the administration have sown seeds of discord. The lack of consensus on the electoral road map risks further polarising the political landscape, undermining the very stability the interim government was tasked to foster.\nThe reform commission tasked with delivering systemic changes in governance and economic management represents a critical opportunity to recalibrate the nation's trajectory. However, its progress has been slow, and the extension of its tenure until January 15 highlights the complexity of the task. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and stagnating private investment continue to erode the purchasing power of citizens and discourage economic growth. The business community remains apprehensive, with political instability and law-and-order concerns threatening both trade and investment.\nThe stakes are high, and the need for leadership is paramount. A transparent and inclusive electoral process is essential to mitigate tensions and pave the way for democratic renewal. Without this, the country risks prolonged instability that could jeopardise both political stability and economic progress. It is not clear to this author why providing a road map has become such a big issue for the interim government, whose main task is to hold a free, fair, credible and participatory election while initiating reforms that, among others, would ensure that we never go back to the dark ages of repressive rule that was unleashed in 2009-2024. Common sense says that they are not mutually exclusive and can be achieved in tandem if the political parties are willing to walk the talk on reform. Unfortunately, their poor history of reform and often misrule make people legitimately apprehensive of their true intent.\nAs a concerned, conscientious citizen compelled by a sense of responsibility, this author proposes a suggestive electoral road map that hopefully can serve as a good starting point for both the interim government and political parties to come together and provide the general public clarity on where we are heading as a nation in 2025 and beyond. In providing the road map, I have mostly relied on the analysis of historical data from previous credible elections held in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2008. With the reform commission's tenure extended until January 15, the road map and suggestions will hopefully aid the government in navigating this crucial phase. For the sake of simplicity, the road map is laid out in the diagram, which is then used to walk through the steps in detail.\nThe proposed 10-step election road map\n\nAfter the submission of reports by all the reform commissions by January 15, 2025 (except the judiciary reform commission), the proposed road map commences with 10 clearly identified phases between January 15 and October 10, 2025, to complete the journey from initiation of reform measures to transition to democracy.\n1. Jan 15-23: Reform commission reports\n\nIn this phase, political parties will review the reports and recommendations submitted by the reform commissions. To ensure ownership of the reform process by the political parties, they will send representatives to participate in the consultation process with the commissions. Representation criteria are suggested based on electoral performance in the past credible elections (1991, 1996, 2001 and 2008) and the number of members of parliament (MPs) elected by each party. It is proposed that parties with the largest representation in any of these four parliaments should be invited to send three representatives for consultation with each reform commission, while other smaller parties will send one representative per commission. Since student representatives are already in the reform commissions, their representation has been ensured through existing arrangements, and it is up to the interim government as to what kind of role they would play in this process. Similarly, whether the Awami League and Jatiya Party will be invited is a matter of decision by the interim government.\u00a0\nThese recommendations are meant to provide a flexible framework, open to adaptation, to ensure that all stakeholders are effectively represented in the reform process. It is equally important that some criteria be used, as otherwise inviting too many political parties\u2014particularly those with hardly any track record of proven popular support\u2014will make discussion and negotiation between the reform commission and political parties unnecessarily complex and even infructuous.\u00a0\n2. Jan 26-30: Consultation process\nPolitical parties will engage in consultations with the reform commissions to discuss the proposed reform measures. This collaborative approach aims to build national consensus on necessary reforms, ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice in the process. Unless the political parties genuinely subscribe to the reform measures and are willing to make them effective through passing in parliament, all work of these commissions will just be another bundle of paperwork with no practical relevance for the people.\n3. Feb 2-6: Reform measures finalisation\nDuring this phase, political parties and the government will finalise the agreed-upon reforms. As an intent of goodwill, the political parties will sign the agreed reforms, which they commit themselves to implementing, if and when they are in power after the elections.\n4. Feb 10: Reform process formalisation\nThe government will complete formalities related to reform proposals, including issuing official gazette notifications that should formalise the agreed-upon changes, setting the stage for implementation.\n5. Feb 11 onwards: Reform process initiation\nThe government will initiate the implementation of institutional and administrative reforms. Due legal processes will be undertaken by the next parliament, ensuring continuity of the reforms that were agreed upon in the February 10 official declaration.\n6. Feb 15-Aug 30: Election Commission\n\nFor the Election Commission (EC), the following steps are crucial for ensuring a transparent and inclusive electoral process.\n* Voter list update:\u00a0The EC will create an accurate voter list by verifying data through biometric IDs and adding newly eligible voters. It will also remove duplicates and deceased individuals to prevent fraud. Drawing lessons from 2008, when a complete voter list overhaul led to the registration of more than eight crore voters, the modernised systems in place today are expected to make this process more streamlined and less time-consuming.\n* Resource mobilisation:\u00a0The EC will allocate essential resources and polling logistics, with a focus on ensuring accessibility, particularly in underserved areas, to effectively accommodate participation of all voters.\n* Field-level appointment:\u00a0Trained field officials will be appointed to manage voter registration and oversee polling logistics and administration.\n* Consultation with political parties:\u00a0The EC will engage with political parties to build consensus on key election-related matters, fostering trust and collaboration.\n* Announcement of election schedule:\u00a0After completing preparations, the EC will announce the election schedule, allowing political parties to undertake campaigns and inform voters of their political manifesto.\u00a0\n7. Apr 1: Armed forces\nThe armed forces are to return to barracks but remain available as a strike force, with selective deployment, if necessary, particularly during elections. The prolonged presence of armed forces in public life goes against the spirit of both their service code of conduct and the democratic values of a country heading towards a credible election.\n8. Oct 1: Parliamentary election\nThe parliamentary election will be conducted to establish a representative government. Marking a long-overdue step in addressing the Bangladeshi people's right to a fair and democratic electoral process. Between now and then, there are almost 10 months, which is three times more than the average life of the caretaker government that was mandated under the constitution for holding elections until it was revoked by the Awami League.\n9. Oct 3-9: Declaration of results\nWithin this time frame, election results will be tabulated and officially announced through gazette notifications by the EC.\n10. Oct 10: Convening of 13th parliament\nThe newly elected parliament will convene, signifying the restoration of democratic governance and the beginning of a new legislative term focused on implementing the agreed-upon reforms.\nThe road ahead\n\nAn elected government is indispensable for safeguarding Bangladesh's democratic identity, ensuring accountable leadership, and meeting people's socioeconomic aspirations. It is vital to restore stability, addressing critical national challenges, and rebuilding public confidence. The proposed road map outlines a structured approach to achieving a credible electoral process and underscores the urgency of collaborative action to secure a sustainable democratic future.\u00a0\nDelay and deferral without a legitimate reason cannot bode well for the country. Nor would it be wise for the political parties not to finally rise to the occasion and irrevocably commit themselves to the much-needed reforms, without which the supreme sacrifice made by students and people in July-August risks going in vain. We lost one such opportunity in 1991 and can't repeat the same mistake in 2025.\nProf Syed Munir Khasru\u00a0is chairman of the Institute for Policy, Advocacy, and Governance (IPAG), an international think tank.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
