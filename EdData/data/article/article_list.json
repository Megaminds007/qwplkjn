        "full_article": "The journey that started at an airport and had me navigate my way around pizza, playbooks and politics began with a simple phone call from my mother. \u2018What do you mean you are in Chennai, and why didn\u2019t you tell me before? I was getting dinner made for you.\u2019\nI replied, \u2018Well, Modiji has a rally in Chennai today. I have been invited to speak there.\u2019 When my mother began asking what my speech was about, I laughed and admitted that I was just fooling around and I was actually in Chennai for a book talk, and not any political rally.\nMy mother believed my lie, just the way people buy the fabrications they see online. But before I begin a series on the art of digital living, it\u2019s time to leave the airport and head to the car where I encountered my driver for the day, a bespectacled man with a hollow, strident voice like clamshells clanking against each other in a stirred pot. However, as I would later discover, he was both the clam and the stirred pot in this case.\nNumerous accounts floating on the internet show people getting into Olas and Ubers, engaging with their drivers, and emerging at their destination with enlightenment that they share through tweets and posts. I have always believed these accounts to be either exaggerated or entirely made up until it happened to me.\nIt began on an innocuous note. I was informed that we were taking an alternate route, so we don\u2019t get stuck in the traffic jam caused by the rally. The topic shifted to the driver living in Chennai for over a decade while his family was still back up north. Then we started playing a ping pong match in his impeccable Hindi and my Bambaiya lexicon. \u2018Who will you vote for?\u2019 \u2018Hindu versus Muslim countries\u2019. And then, of course, Bollywood. \u2018Apke Bollywood ke three Khans make fun of our gods in their movies.\u2019 I immediately denied it, giving him numerous instances of movies to the contrary. Then he said, \u2018And they are the ones who killed Sushant Singh.\u2019\n\u2018Bhai Saab, where do you get all these crazy ideas?\u2019 Looking abashed, he stated, \u2018Yes, you are right, not all three Khans, only one of them is responsible for his murder.\u2019 Then he went on: \u00a0\u2018See, first, we would not get all the proper news. We didn\u2019t know what was happening. We had only a radio. Then came TV, but still, we didn\u2019t know anything. Now, we learn the real truth through WhatsApp and YouTube. Nothing can be hidden from us anymore.\u2019\nThe World Economic Forum released its 2024 report and ranked disinformation as the most significant future global challenge, and India as the country that was likely to be most affected. We have already witnessed a spate of manipulated news stories, from the morphed pictures that showed the Phogats smiling during the wrestler\u2019s protests, to uncountable stories about the origin of the coronavirus. I have even seen my name on a mainstream television channel ticker saying I had performed a medley of songs for Dawood. Considering that even my children think my dancing skills are akin to watching a WWF match between a lone wrestler and gravity, the news channels should have known that Dawood would have chosen more skilled performers. But such is the world of fake news.\nThe New York Times had once done a fascinating deep dive into the world of fabricated news around the Pizzagate scandal. This story revolved around Hillary Clinton being connected to a child sex ring that was run from the basement of a pizza parlour called Comet Pizza. According to a public policy poll, almost 50% of Trump voters believed this ridiculous story. NYT laid out a playbook on creating fake stories that can impact a country\u2019s socio-political fabric. An old technique from the KGB era that has retained its effectiveness, the rules of this playbook revolve around first looking for differences in religion, caste, colour or language, and amplifying them. Then, making up outrageous, attention-grabbing lies that are so preposterous that people can\u2019t believe anyone could just fabricate them. It\u2019s better (though not mandatory) to have a tiny kernel of truth at the centre of these lies. The last step is to spend considerable resources over a long period fuelling these stories, and patiently waiting for the results.\nIn the coverage of news around Clinton\u2019s Pizzagate story and Sushant Singh\u2019s death, there were similar patterns. Elections were around the corner; presidential in her case, and Bihar elections in ours. And it began. Narrative divisions: the outsider versus the insiders of Bollywood. The blue-eyed boy of Bihar and the bad boys of the big city. Then an outrageous lie. Like the one I told my mother about speaking at the rally or Clinton\u2019s paedophile ring or an actor murdered by one of his colleagues. In the latter case, there was even a petition filed, and later dismissed, against some famous actors and producers on charges of conspiracy to murder Sushant in a local court in Bihar. The essential kernel of ambiguous truth: Clinton\u2019s campaign chair had exchanged emails with the owner of Comet Pizza, and Sushant Singh had once confessed in an interview that he found Bollywood\u2019s superstars intimidating. Finally, extensive resources were spent fuelling these stories, one of which finally landed as a forward on my driver\u2019s phone and was instantly swallowed and digested.\nThese digital fabrications have real-life consequences. While my driver was unlikely to turn into a vigilante and head to Bandra with murderous intent, a gunman did open fire in Comet Pizza, and closer home, reliable newspaper reports state that a single concoction about child abduction gangs, spread as WhatsApp forwards, led to over 20 people in India being beaten to death in a short span.\nIn the last few weeks, I have seen our politicians talking about the perils of circulating videos of people eating meat during Navratri when perhaps they should be warning citizens of the dangers of consuming nonsense instead of non-veg.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The world woke up on Friday to news of an Israeli missile attack in Iran\u2019s Isfahan region, where some of its nuclear facilities are located. There are competing claims about the scale of attack and extent of the damage. This comes weeks after soaring tensions between the two countries.\nThe situation in West Asia has witnessed a step-by-step escalation since Oct 7, 2023. The Hamas attack blind-sided the vaunted Israeli intelligence and defence establishments and led to nearly 1,200 Israelis being killed and more than 200 taken hostage. Assessed by Israel as the largest single day loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, it was a major escalation compared to periodic Israel-Hamas skirmishes since 2008. Israel\u2019s response, to \u201crestore deterrence\u201d, has involved another cycle of escalation with now six months of military action resulting in more than 30,000 killed and more than a million Palestinians displaced in Gaza.\nSinking reality: Seizure of an Israel-linked ship with Indian crew highlights the larger dangers of the conflict\nDespite the US locating two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Eastern Mediterranean, there has been regional escalation with Houthis attacking and disrupting shipping through the Red Sea, and Hezbollah firing rockets and drones leading to displacement of nearly 70,000 Israelis from the northern part of the country. Israel\u2019s actions against Hezbollah have progressed deeper from southern Lebanon bordering areas. The US and UK have mobilised \u201cOperation Prosperity Guardian\u201d, with several other partner countries, and carried out attacks against Houthi infrastructure.\nAssessing Iranian enabling support to Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, Israel took another step of lethally attacking several Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard commanders at \u00a0Iranian consulate premises in Damascus. This was seen by Iran as an attack on its \u201csovereign territory\u201d, a notch higher than the earlier Israeli attacks on its personnel and supplies to Hezbollah through Syria and in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s response, through 300 drones, 30 cruise missiles and more than 100 ballistic missiles, was the first direct state level attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when it had been attacked by Egypt and Syria. Israel\u2019s decisive military victories against different coalitions of Arab States in 1948, 1967 and 1973, had led to peace agreements with Egypt in 1979, and Jordan in 1994. The Abraham Accords in 2020 had led to diplomatic relations between Israel and UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Morocco. Israel now retaliated with a \u201climited strike\u201d, targeting Isfahan, signalling capacity to penetrate Iranian air defence.\nWhether or not there is any further escalation, the potential will remain so long as the current Israel-Hamas conflict is not on the path of de-escalation. There does not appear to be any imminent prospect of that. Negotiations for a six-week ceasefire have stalled for weeks, despite intense mediation by the US, Egypt and Qatar. Israel has set for itself the objective of eliminating Hamas presence in Gaza. Despite six months of effort, several thousand Hamas fighters are still assessed to be active, with their presence concentrated in Rafah in southern Gaza, so far beyond Israel\u2019s reach. This has led to intense international scrutiny and concern over potential large-scale civilian deaths.\nUS experience in Afghanistan with the Taliban, and Israel\u2019s own experience of occupation with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon from 1982-2000 should caution any expectation of rooting out Hamas. Israel\u2019s opposition to a revitalised non-Hamas Palestinian Authority governing Gaza and declared international opposition to reoccupation of Gaza by Israel are complicating the prospects of post-conflict arrangements. Buy in by Arab countries, for post conflict large-scale reconstruction in Gaza, may require a sense of movement towards a two-state solution. However, the current ruling coalition in Israel is opposed to any such solution, and Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently, since the mid-1990s, worked to undermine any such prospect. Politics in Israel has shifted gradually to the right, with their own perception that sections of Palestinians are not reconciled to the existence of Israel and have opposed compromises in the past. The large-scale Hamas attack in October, and the preparation it revealed, will also strengthen the arguments of those concerned about security threats to Israel from a fully sovereign Palestinian entity.\nDespite perceptions about its relative decline in global context, and intense debates about its extended international engagements, the US is the only major power active in seeking some way forward from the crisis. It is engaged with Israel, Arab countries, and through intermediaries, with Iran and Hamas. However, its influence has been revealed to be limited, with Netanyahu not heeding suggestions, Iran not dissuaded from attacking Israel directly, and Hamas not accepting several proposals for hostage release.\nThe crisis has potentially wider ramifications on energy prices, shipping in the Gulf and Red Sea, and security of migrant workers, including 8 million Indians, in the Gulf. A case in point is the seizure of an Israel-linked container ship with 17 Indian crew members by Iran near the Strait of Hormuz last week.\u00a0 The time has perhaps come for a wider effort. As China, Russia and the US have so far worked to thwart each other\u2019s initiatives at the UN, the G20 troika of Brazil, India and South Africa should explore if they can move the needle, along with a group of non-P5 G20 members from Europe and Arab countries. This could be a good test of whether the G20 is indeed the premier global organisation today that it often claims to be.\nArun K Singh is former Indian Ambassador to US, France and Israel\n\n",

        "full_article": "A severe heat wave now sweeping across the country has made life miserable. The latest update from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department offers little hope of respite and paints a foreboding picture of weather conditions across various regions. Khulna division together with Rajshahi, Pabna, and Tangail districts are currently grappling with a severe heat wave and the forecast is that the sizzling heat will persist until the end of the current month. Jessore experienced the country's highest temperature at 42.6\u00b0C on Saturday last. Except for Sylhet, most part of the country is now reeling from scorching heat. With one-fifth of normal average rainfall, April has turned out to be 'the cruellest month'. A combination of natural and human-induced factors has virtually turned Dhaka city into a sizzling frying pan. Vanishing greenery and water bodies, unplanned urbanisation, industrialisation and communication systems are contributing to the rise in Dhaka's temperature. Its metalled roads and high-rise buildings heat up during the day and retain heat until late into the evening. Extensive use of glass in windows, doors and walls, and air conditioning in multi-storied buildings also play a significant role in this. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of vehicles plying on the city roads remain stuck for hours in traffic jams with their engines running and releasing even more heat to the existing woeful city environment. Recently, a report entitled 'Hot Cities, Chilled Economies: Impacts of Extreme Heat on Global Cities' by the US-based Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center calculated that Dhaka is losing six billion US dollars every year due to high temperatures as labour productivity of residents is being badly affected. This productivity loss could exceed US$ 84 billion by 2050 if the issue of rising temperature is not properly addressed. Extreme rise in temperature is also contributing to the rise in various illnesses such as fever, colds, coughs, and diarrhoea. Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to heatstroke. Hospitals are now witnessing a rush of patients seeking treatment for these ailments. Moreover, the spell of searing heat could also badly impact crop, vegetable, and fruit yields. It is also straining the country's energy sector, as the demand for electricity and water has gone up. The authorities need to ensure uninterrupted supply of both water and electricity to mitigate the sufferings of people grappling with intense heat, while the consumers must use the limited resources prudently. As Bangladesh cannot simply wish away heat waves, which is attributed to global warming and a host of other human-induced factors, the nation as a whole must learn to adapt. This adjustment will require innovative strategies and resilience-building measures. The government decided to close primary and secondary schools for seven days from April 21 to April 27. Doctors are emphasising the need for taking precautions to cope with the intense heat, urging people to minimise unnecessary outdoor activities, dress in cool clothing, and stay well hydrated. These short-term emergency measures to cope with the rising temperature, however, will not suffice in the long run. A recent study warned if the root causes of the intensifying heat wave remain unaddressed, venturing outdoors could become deadly by the end of this century across vast areas of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. A concerted local, regional, and global effort must be made before it is too late.",

        "full_article": "Not many people nowadays are deeply moved by the heart-rending reports of avoidable road accidents that make families happy and together seconds before devastated in the blink of an eye. The public have accepted it as though it is something normal as they do not expect anything better from the way the transport operators are getting rowdier, rash and insensitive by the day. A lack of proper traffic management within the big cities as well as on the highways is adding to the chaos and often leads to vehicular collisions, deaths and injuries.As Jatri Kalyan Samity (JKS), a passengers' welfare platform, reported on Saturday, April 20 last, during the Eid rush in 15 days between April 4 and 18, 407 people were killed and 1,398 injured in 399 road accidents across the country. The passengers' welfare body further informed that compared to last year's road accidents over the same period, it is a significant rise in the percentage of fatalities (by 31.25 per cent) and frequency of accidents (by 24.08 per cent). As usual, concerns are routinely raised from different quarters including the government after a massive accident takes place. One may recall here the student protests that spread like a wildfire across the country at the end of July in 2018 when a bus that was in a mad race to overtake another ploughed through a crowd near the airport crushing two students to death under its wheels and wounding nine others. Outraged, students of different schools and colleges took to the streets in protest demanding 'students' safety' on the road. At a point, protesting students assumed the role of traffic police and checked papers of the moving vehicles. The general commuters and the public expressed solidarity with the agitating students despite the temporary traffic dislocations created on the streets. In fact, all wanted an end to the transport operators' anarchy on the roads. The government apparently bowed to the students' demands, issued 17 directives from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) asking the authorities concerned to adopt certain measures to introduce some semblance of discipline in the transport sector, hastily approved a draft Road Transport Act (RTA) 2018 with the provision of a maximum 5.0 years' jail for deaths caused by rash driving and so on and so forth. But when it came to the question of implementing the RTA 18, transport associations came out in a body protesting some sections of the Act and the progress of work stalled. Again we are back to square one. Anarchy is again the order of the day on the streets and highways. So, the laws for the roads remain mothballed, at least for now. However, in view of improving some infrastructural aspects of road safety, the government has undertaken the first-ever World Bank (WB)-financed project of this kind in South Asia in April last year. The project named 'Road Safety Project (RSF)' is worth about Tk50 billion and is intended to improve management capacities of the government agencies engaged in maintaining road safety. The aim is to reduce deaths and injuries from road accidents. Projected to be completed in five years between May, 2023 and by the end of June, 2028, more than 75 per cent of the project fund would be provided by the WB, while the government's share is about 25 per cent. The project activities would involve assessing deficiencies in existing road safety regime, creation of an integrated traffic management and incident detection system, training for a large number of fresh recruits of drivers, developing an integrated information database for the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and creating various infrastructures for the purpose. The roads and highways department (RHD) of the government would act as the lead agency of the project. Though it is already a year into the said RSF's implementation phase, nothing of substance could be heard so far about the progress of work. According to reports, the project is still in its preparatory stage. As always, it is learnt to be the procurement process that is eating up a large part of the project time! But when it is about saving lives of people travelling by transports, there should be a sense of urgency in implementing a project at least to meet the deadline.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), deaths from road accidents in Bangladesh are more than three times those of advanced countries. They cost the nation two to three per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is common knowledge that the death toll from these accidents is on a rising curve, but what are the real figures? The wide variation in road casualty figures from agency to agency, be those from the government, private, or from multilateral development agencies, makes it difficult to have a correct picture of the situation on the roads and highways. Consider the WHO figures on road accident-related casualties between 2015 and 2018. Calculations show, in these three years, death toll on the roads rose by over 17 per cent. But in the next three years including 2021, the death toll jumped by about 26. 60 per cent from what it was in 2018. The actual number of deaths from road accidents was 31,578 in 2021. But by comparison, the data on road accident casualties provided by the police as reported in the media were 2,376 (in 2015), 2,635 in 2018 and 5,084 in 2021, which were around 11 per cent of the WHO figures of 2015 and 2018 and 16 per cent of that of 2021 respectively. Now which figures should be used to make a correct estimation of the deaths from vehicular crashes on the roads of Bangladesh and adopt matching policies? Creating a road accident database, as indicated in the Road Safety Project, should be given the priority it deserves.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It was a pandemonium in, of all places, a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Parents and attendants rushing out of the room to save the lives of babies under treatment there for heart problems, a few of them recovering after surgery! Several of the baby patients had to be carefully evacuated because they had nasal cannulas and face masks attached for their respiratory disorder and intravenous cannulas inserted into their veins with the tubes dangling precariously. No, this is not a scene from Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital but from the specialised Dhaka Shishu Hospital in the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. No one invaded the hospital but a fire in the ICU of the cardiac unit of the hospital led to this unexpected emergency. Mercifully, no life was lost mostly due to prompt evacuation by parents and attendants with help from hospital staff. Before the fire spread to other units, it could be brought under control by fire fighters who also responded to the emergency call promptly enough. Early indication is that the fire broke out from explosion of an air conditioner in the ICU and before the fire could turn worse, all 17 baby and child patients receiving treatment there could be brought out of the facility safely. For a few of these more serious patients disruption of saline and administration of intravenous medicine could be fatal. What effect it will leave on such patients only the physicians concerned can tell. No such mishap was reported from this hospital earlier although Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) had the misfortune to experience one such fire hazard also in its ICU in March 2021, which claimed three lives during evacuation. Before that, a fire at the corona isolation unit of the United Hospital on May 27, 2020 claimed five lives. Now the question is, if the Shishu Hospital had enough arrangement for quick response to such a crisis. To go by the representative of the Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence (BFSCD), the hospital had no such system other than just fire extinguishers. This leads to the more probing question, if those fire extinguishers could be of any service to control the blaze from turning devastating. Provision of fire extinguishers is no guarantee for bringing fire under control at the initial stage. There must be people who know how to operate those extinguishers. Once informed of the breaking out of fire, the BFSCD teams reached there within eight minutes and they had to struggle for about an hour to extinguish the blaze. ICUs of hospitals are generally a secluded, confined and closed facility where the greatest danger was from fumes. Let it be noted that the death of diners and shoppers at the Bailey Road Green Cozy Cottage fire tragedy was not from fire but from toxic smoke. The fire fighters smashed some sealed glasses of the ICU at the Shishu Hospital before they could take care of the fire. The issue that must be considered here is that the hospital was established in 1972 and many of its infrastructural devices have become very old. It is run on a tight budget. More importantly, people in this part of the world are not particularly famous for maintenance of machines, devices and infrastructure. Few hospitals, offices and organisations have records of updated check and supervision of machines and apparatuses. After the winter, it is necessary to check ACs before their operation. Few people take the trouble of doing so. But when it concerns sensitive facilities such as hospitals, slightest laxity must not be entertained. The probe committee formed to investigate the fire incident should not ignore the monitoring and supervisory aspects of machines and apparatuses at the hospital. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The scorching summer heat, exacerbated by an agonising absence of rainfall, has made life unbearable for many and wreaked havoc on crops and livestock across Bangladesh. The economic repercussions of this heat wave are stark, with overall economic activity suffering a decline and daily earners experiencing a squeeze on their incomes. Meteorologists reported the highest temperature in Bangladesh reaching a torrid 42.6 degrees Celsius, further exacerbating the already dire situation.As the relentless summer days persist, the government has rightly extended the Eid vacation for schools and colleges, recognising the need to provide relief from the oppressive weather conditions. Additionally, the optional wearing of court gowns for lawyers acknowledges the challenges posed by the life-sapping heat and humidity.A significant decrease in rainfall, as reported by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, mirrors conditions observed last year, leading to a drought that severely impacted agriculture. Areas such as Jashore, Khulna, Dhaka, Rajshahi, and Pabna are currently experiencing severe-to-very severe heat wave, with temperatures soaring to alarming levels.Furthermore, studies have identified Dhaka city as particularly vulnerable to the effects of rapid population growth, reduced greenery, and global warming. This heat wave not only affects manual productivity but also poses serious health risks, particularly for low-income individuals such as rickshaw pullers, day labourers, and hawkers, who are forced to work under the scorching sun.In the light of these challenges, urgent action is needed to address the immediate and long-term impacts of the heat wave. Hospitals must be adequately prepared to handle emergency cases, and clean water should be readily available to mitigate the risk of dehydration and related health issues. Local employers should be compelled to ensure that workers exposed to the sun receive adequate rest, and public awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate people on staying safe during extreme heat.Additionally, it is crucial for the government to implement more initiatives to combat climate change and its effects, and build resilience in vulnerable communities. This includes investing in infrastructure to provide relief during heat waves, promoting sustainable practices, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In conclusion, the authorities need to take immediate action to address the ongoing heat wave crisis and implement long-term measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change. It is imperative that we work together as a community to protect the well-being of our citizens and safeguard our environment for future generations.\nAsif IslamStudent Jahangirnagar University ",
