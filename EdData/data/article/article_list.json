Biren Singh for the post of Chief Minister and the Assembly also not having been convened even six months since its last sitting, President\u2019s Rule was imposed in the State with the Assembly under suspended animation. Since mid-2023, in any case, a number of central forces have been deployed, with the Union Home Ministry in control over law and order even as the strife that began as an ethnic conflagration in May 2023 has shown no signs of easing. With President\u2019s Rule being declared \u2014 even if it was for expedient reasons and showcased an inability of the BJP and its allies in government to overcome the ethnic differences within the legislature and in the polity \u2014 the Union government now has an opportunity to ease the tensions. It can also work on pressing issues such as the persisting displacement of over 60,000 people. Reports suggest that many among them still experience severe trauma and a loss of livelihoods, which must be tackled by the government with alacrity. President\u2019s Rule also allows for the possibility of talks between representatives of the two communities in the conflict, especially those who are committed to peace. The legislators can also play a role in this exercise of reconciliation.The other major issue is the militarisation of civil society, with the burgeoning of armed groups among the two communities, who have termed themselves as \u201cvillage volunteers\u201d, brandishing arms looted from constabularies. Earlier attempts to retrieve these weapons and bring the looters to face justice have not borne fruit. The militarisation in the new ethnic conflict has also been complicated by the expanded role of insurgents who were fighting the Indian state or were engaged in the Myanmar civil war. It would take a concerted effort by the government, armed forces and civil society actors to identify the \u201cvillage volunteers\u201d, disarm them by using a firm hand and with incentives, and then work on ways to tackle the insurgents. The Biren Singh regime was incapable of doing this because of the perceived bias in leadership and Mr. Singh\u2019s tendency to stigmatise the Kuki-Zo community as a whole, leading to complete distrust. Efforts must be taken to distance the government from this coloured legacy and the Home Ministry should work on a war-footing to restore peace. Ideally, Assembly elections would have been necessitated immediately considering the deep ethnic divisions within the legislature and its failures. But, first, it is imperative to extinguish the climate of fear and reprehension from violent groups and restore the rule of law before elections.

        "full_article": "A healthy winter harvest of vegetables reined in food inflation to a five-month low of 6% in January, driving down India\u2019s consumer price inflation to 4.3%, tantalisingly close to the 4% median target pursued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). For urban consumers, in fact, inflation eased to 3.9%, while rural consumers faced a much-moderated 4.6% uptick in prices. This constitutes some relief for households, especially the urban middle class which has been awaiting relief from food inflation and has pulled back on other spending. If inflation holds around this level for some time, this may have broader connotations for consumption and growth impulses gathering fresh steam. The RBI, which slashed interest rates last week in anticipation of declining inflation, must be relieved too. As per its own reckoning, with this quarter expected to average 4.4% inflation, there may be a minor uptick from January\u2019s 4.3% price rise over this month and March. On Thursday (February 13, 2025), citing the inflation decline and the RBI\u2019s projection of an average inflation of 4.2% in 2025-26, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman exuded confidence in Parliament that food prices will be under control this year, with farm output estimates suggesting a healthy uptick.Some dark clouds, however, loom over this benign inflation outlook that is expected to create more room for the central bank to cut rates further and support growth. With the rupee declining 4% against the U.S. dollar so far in the second half of 2024-25, imported inflation can play spoilsport, particularly on fuels, and edible oils where imports constitute 60% of India\u2019s consumption needs. If commuting costs, which accounted for the highest chunk of households\u2019 non-food spending in 2023-24, and cooking fuel costs flare up along with the price of fats to fry one\u2019s meals, household budgets will be exacerbated afresh. Edible oil prices have been rising sharply for a few months already, with high global prices compounded by the Centre\u2019s decision to impose import duties. They were up 15.6% in January, the highest in almost three years. Wholesale prices for edible oils jumped 33.1%, indicating there is likely more pass-through of these costs in retail prices. Any weather shocks this coming summer and monsoon could also undo food price gains. The RBI, which is seeking to curb the volatility in the rupee, will be mindful of these risks, and having retained a neutral monetary policy stance, may hold off on its growth pursuit if warranted. To alleviate price pressures, the government, after unveiling income tax cuts to boost middle class consumption, should be open to slashing indirect taxes \u2014 fuel levies, import duties, and GST \u2014 as they affect all sections of society, including the most vulnerable.\r Published - February 15, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        inflation and deflation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Reserve Bank of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        food\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        fruit and vegetable\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Parliament proceedings\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        currency values\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        taxes and duties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Monsoon",

Gone are illegal immigrants, handcuffed and deported on military planes. High tariff walls guard US interests \u2013 China, Canada, Mexico won\u2019t dare dump a shirt button now. The fentanyl tap has been turned off, climate change cancelled, Gaza solved, and peace in Ukraine is a finger snap away. Iran and N Korea will fall in line. Everything\u2019s fixed. Except, none of this has happened \u2013 The Economist just reported that Elon Musk\u2019s relentless federal govt pruning has \u201cscarcely made a dent in spending\u201d. Trump has spoken unexpected, outrageous things, compulsively made headlines with his fiats, and created a perception. But headline management is not governance. For proof, read India\u2019s old five-year plans, or look at all the foundation plaques littering the country. A highway here, a township there, the promise of a power plant \u2013 they never got past the headline stage.\nHeadlines don\u2019t make a nation great, but they magnify the individual, the ruler, and even ideas. Brexit was not a great idea, but headlines made it the answer to UK\u2019s problems. Almost nine years after the fateful referendum, it\u2019s clear that UK\u2019s trade in goods has suffered. Travelling has become cumbersome.\nHeadlines perk up business too. AI is the latest craze, everything from ACs to water purifiers and cars must have it. What happened to IoT, the internet of things? But that was a headline peg 7-8 years ago. Five years ago we were all going to live and shop in the metaverse \u2013 a term coined in 1992 but made popular by headlines after 2017. Firms sprang up to sell designer stuff for our online avatars. We were also \u2013 according to headlines \u2013 going to buy a lot of non-fungible tokens or NFTs. And the office was dead, headlines said. But actually, WeWork collapsed. In Orwell\u2019s 1984, when the weekly chocolate ration is reduced to 20g, there are demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising it. That\u2019s the power of headlines. Trump knows it.\n\n",

No prizes for guessing: it\u2019s the one with Musk\u2019s kids. It was an unusual sight for us Indians and has created a lot of buzz here. Because when our men of state (they are, usually and sadly, mostly men) discuss matters of weight and wealth, it is not with their toddlers in tow. Same for most countries.\nBut America\u2019s a bit different. First Children, for example, are always a big deal. JFK era images of Caroline and John Jr playing in the Oval Office were all the rage, long before Instagram and TikTok. Caroline once, famously, walked into a cabinet meeting, asking JFK to tie her shoelaces. With Trump himself not having any pinafore or knickerbocker aged children, Musk\u2019s are filling in. The other day at the Oval Office he was sporting Lil X, who even ran his \u2018nosey\u2019 against the Resolute Desk. X was there at the meet with Modi too, but so were the twins Azure and Strider.\nInterestingly, it\u2019s much more common in India for small children to share their parents\u2019 bedroom. In US, by contrast, children tend to sleep separately from an early age. And yet, children sharing adult spaces is also more common over there. In a globalising world, where cultural practices are converging at pace, this trend is catching on. Some years ago, New Zealand\u2019s then prime minister, Jacinda Ardern took her three-month-old daughter to UN and played with her before delivering a big speech. That must have put ideas into the heads of a lot of working women everywhere. And Musk cavorting with his kids at high meetings can be inspirational too, for dads this time around.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Smelling is easy, also wonderfully complex & important\nSmelling is the easiest and most natural thing in the world. It creates experiences, emotions, memories and behaviours. And yet, in our age of sight and sound, scent is sidelined. The Forgotten Sense: The New Science of Smell and the Extraordinary Power of the Nose by Jonas Olofsson shows just how fundamental this capability is.\nFor starters, humans are extraordinarily good at it, contrary to popular belief. We don\u2019t realise this because 19th century Western scientists created an opposition between higher intellectual abilities (and associated this with white men) and the \u2018lower\u2019 sense of smell.\nBut in fact, humans are more sensitive to odour molecules than rats (31 to 10), bats or spider monkeys (58 to 23). The only animal that beats us hollow is the dog \u2013 but we can give even dogs a run for their money, with training. Humans\u2019 sense of smell is enhanced by the enormous capacities of the rest of their brain.\nSmell is an emotional time-machine, we know, calling up old memories. It can also summon up disgust like no other sense, whether to body odours or other associations with a negative charge. In fact, those who are more easily disgusted seem to have conservative or authoritarian political attitudes. It\u2019s not surprising that racism often manifests itself in descriptions of body odour.\nThe sense of smell works by encompassing and taking cues from other senses. If a liquid has a colour, people assume it has a smell. Smell is usually disguised as taste \u2013 ketchup and mustard taste similar if you hold your breath. Smell and taste are also very manipulable senses. Some cafes draw in customers by spreading the scent of cinnamon.\nResearch now shows that the sense of smell is an interface where the faculties of the brain meet and collaborate. Olfactory impairment has a link with dementia and other brain diseases.\nFor the millions who have lost their sense of smell after Covid, there is hope \u2013 the sense of smell can be trained, via steady exposure to things like rose, clove, eucalyptus and lemon. The book shows the current limits of the science on smell too; claims about pheromones and aromatherapy should be taken with caution.\nOlfactory processes are shaped by emotions, life experiences and cultural conventions.\nOur expectations are crucial. This is why an odd combination of innocuous things like vanilla ice cream with ketchup tends to repel us. Traditional smelly foods, like Sweden\u2019s sour herring or durian in Southeast Asia, are culturally specific \u2013 those familiar with them love them, others find them unbearable.\nThe cognitive perspective on smell can be useful in everyday life \u2013 for instance, if chocolate is your unhealthy craving, simply smelling a teaspoon of it wrapped in foil for five minutes can desensitise the brain and reduce the urge.\nThe sense of the smell is the most ancient, but perhaps also the most refined of our senses, the book suggests. And most of us have a world of smells to discover.\n\n",

        "full_article": "What's in a name? Quite a lot, actually. Names define identities. Names shape perceptions. They also help set narratives, assign blame, and even influence outcomes. It, therefore, makes sense that the simple act of naming a \"mob\" has suddenly become contentious because of all the baggage it brings with it in present-day Bangladesh. This debate\u2014triggered by the launch of the Operation Devil Hunt following renewed anti-fascist campaigns and Adviser Mahfuj Alam's characterisation of mobs as \"devils\" in a stern warning to the\u00a0Touhidi Janata\u2014was perhaps inevitable in a country reborn through a violent uprising by individuals who would have been branded terrorists or anarchist mobs, and severely punished, had they failed. In a remarkable turnaround, they are now national heroes, and rightly so.\nThe question is, who qualifies as a mob then? Can such a generic term even capture the diversity and nuances of different groups? While Mahfuz was more specific in his portrayal, the home ministry was less so as it alluded to \"saboteurs who attacked students,\" individuals with warrants against them, \"troublemakers\", and even the eponymous \"devils\" as targets of the joint forces operation. This could encompass, among others, anyone involved in the events between the demolition of the historic Dhanmondi 32 residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Gazipur incident, where anti-fascist protesters themselves became targets of a mob allegedly including Awami League activists. In other words, their identities can be as overlapping as conflicting. Despite their shared aggression, whether a group is labelled as protesters, agitators, or simply a mob can lead to vastly different public perceptions and politico-legal consequences.\n\nSo before diving into these complexities, let's establish the basics. A mob, by definition, is a large, disorderly crowd intent on causing disturbance or violence. If you search online, you will come across context-specific variations such as \"woke mobs,\" \"vigilante mobs,\" \"nationalist mobs,\" \"religious mobs,\" \"troll mobs,\" etc. I remember writing about \"lynch mobs\" in 2019 when mass hysteria over a bizarre rumour\u2014that human heads were being collected for Padma Bridge construction\u2014led to seven people being killed. As I argued back then, mob violence \"is not justice\u2014it's what justice looks like when it is privatised and leased out to the most dominant groups in society.\" And whatever form it takes, and however justified the motive seems to be, it remains unacceptable in a democratic system where due process and rule of law are considered sacrosanct.\nSince the fall of the Awami League government, there has been a wave of mob-related incidents leaving debilitating effects across various sectors, including education. On Monday, a group of individuals besieged a stall at the Amar Ekushey Boi Mela over a book by controversial writer Taslima Nasrin, forcing it to close. A day earlier, a mob torched the house of a double-murder suspect in Rangpur's Pirganj upazila. Similar disturbances, big or small, are surfacing almost regularly\u2014a trend often attributed to the previous regime's authoritarian rule that fostered deep-seated anger and distrust among people. While such behaviour cannot be condoned, things get trickier when the target of this anger is Awami League itself, or what remains of it.\n\nAnother danger of encouraging mobism is how easily it can morph into various expressions of fanaticism. For instance, the same mobs that destroyed Mujib's murals and statues over the past months could feel emboldened to attack any structure, symbol or event that they perceive to be anti-religious. In fact, some already are. A recent video shows a man standing before the Raju Memorial Sculpture at Dhaka University, calling it a \"murti\" (Hindu idol) and urging its destruction. Monday's book fair assault, the disruptions of women's football matches in Joypurhat and Dinajpur, or the spate of attacks on shrines in recent months\u2014all point to the uncontrollable effects of encouraging mobism.\nThe argument of those opposing the labelling of such acts as mob violence is, if I understand correctly, that any actions targeting the symbols of the ousted regime are necessary to prevent its resurgence. Theoretically, you cannot deny the logic\u2014the gross human rights violations committed by the party during July-August alone, as highlighted again by the just-released fact-finding report of the UN human rights office, make this non-negotiable. The question, however, is not about the goal but the methods being used to achieve it. After the uprising, there was broad consensus that what happened during this period, including the destruction of public property and infrastructure, served a greater cause, and as such, participants faced no legal repercussions. But should such concessions still be granted six months later, when the nation is trying to claw its way back to some much-needed stability? The answer is self-evident.\n\"But what if there are provocations?\" ask some. True, the Dhanmondi 32 demolition was largely a reaction to Sheikh Hasina's virtual speech from India\u2014an act that, given the trauma of her reign of terror, was bound to provoke outrage. Had she not shown the audacity to attempt a political comeback while evading justice for her many crimes, the destruction could perhaps have been avoided. But this reasoning is tenuous at best and dangerous at worst.\n\nExpecting a former dictator to behave responsibly is a naivety we cannot afford at this stage. What about our own responsibility to pre-empt her move, and more importantly, protect the greater interests of the nation? The anti-fascist camp's headlong dive into a trap ostensibly designed to raise questions about the direction of \"new Bangladesh\" exposes the fallacy of their campaign. Understanding the difference between fighting actual fascism and scoring symbolic victories in an already triumphant landscape is crucial. Moreover, a mob is a deeply unstable force that may take on a will of its own once activated. It is no surprise that the call to disrupt Hasina's speech set off a domino effect of attacks, vandalism, and arson targeting Awami League-linked houses and establishments in as many as 35 districts. Will anti-fascist mobilisers take responsibility for these attacks, or the reputational damage thus caused to Bangladesh? The UN has already warned about meeting international standards in trials for the perpetrators of July-August massacre. We cannot expect fair justice and global support for our bid while condoning extrajudicial actions against the remnants of Awami League.\nThe reason we focus more on the Dhanmondi incident and its aftermath is because of the insistence by some anti-fascist voices on challenging any labelling or questioning of their supporters, as if they are an organised force governed by strict discipline. They are not. The truth is, under the broad anti-fascist umbrella, there are numerous student, political and ideological banners\u2014just as there are numerous types of mobs. A mob, however you characterise it, cannot be expected to see reason or exercise restraint. It cannot distinguish between political and criminal actions, between \"reactions\" and \"revenges,\" or between legitimate targets and collateral damage.\n\nAnother danger of encouraging mobism is how easily it can morph into various expressions of fanaticism, which is perhaps what led Mahfuj Alam to directly address the Touhidi Janata. For instance, the same mobs that destroyed Mujib's murals and statues over the past months could feel emboldened to attack any structure, symbol or event that they perceive to be anti-religious. In fact, some already are. A recent video shows a man standing before the Raju Memorial Sculpture at Dhaka University, calling it a \"murti\" (Hindu idol) and urging its destruction. Monday's book fair assault, the disruptions of women's football matches in Joypurhat and Dinajpur, or the spate of attacks on shrines in recent months\u2014all point to the uncontrollable effects of encouraging mobism.\nAs part of the Operation Devil Hunt, the authorities have so far detained nearly 3,000 individuals, many likely linked to recent incidents of chaos and aggression. But security crackdowns alone cannot prevent this trend. It demands deeper reflection. Should we continue to condone unregulated public outbursts? Should we so easily fall for \"provocations?\" Or can we channel our grievances into structured responses that can solidify our transition to democracy, prevent the resurgence of any form of fascism, and restore Bangladesh's global standing?\nWhatever we do, the idea of a mob must be left in the past.\nBadiuzzaman Bay is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Two remarkable things happened last Wednesday\u2014the chief advisor visited \"Aynaghar\" (House of Mirrors), the secret torture cells set up by security and intelligence agencies to confine, interrogate, psychologically break, demoralise, and physically torture a select group of opponents and dissenters whom the political governments of day wanted either eliminated or at least tortured and intimidated into submission.\n\nOn the same date, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) issued its long-awaited report on the Sheikh Hasina government's handling of the July uprising and the killings that took place. The UN fact-finding mission, citing senior security officials, stated: \"The prime minister herself told the security force officials to kill protesters to quell the protests and specifically demanded 'arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies.'\" The report quoted testimonials from a meeting held on July 19, 2024. This, seen in conjunction with party secretary general, Obaidul Quader's statement to the press on the same day that security forces had been given orders to \"shoot on sight,\" reveals the diabolical mindset that appears to have dominated the thinking of the former prime minister. The previous day, July 18, the home minister, chairing a meeting of the \"core committee,\" told the BGB commander \"to order the use of lethal force more readily.\"\nNothing could have revealed the atrocious levels to which our intelligence agencies had descended more than the chief advisor's visit to the \"Aynaghar.\" We owe it to the Sweden-based Netra News for breaking the news in 2022 about the secret torture centres set up by the DGFI to torture political opponents. We carried the news one week later. Those of us who operated inside the country were highly constrained and took courage in seeing some Bangladeshi fellow journalists doing the unthinkable.\nAs we fret over, write about, and condemn what happened, the real challenge is to take effective steps to prevent it all from happening again. The OHCHR has made some vital recommendations that we must now implement\u2014ones that were prevented from being put into practice in the past. We hope that the spirit of the July uprising will ensure nothing similar happens now.\nA crucial recommendation is to reform the colonial-era Police Act of 1861. It is quite incredible that we have lived with it even after more than 53 years of independence. We have been demanding police reforms for years, especially training them to become a force for the people instead of being an instrument of violence against them. They need to be trained in modern tactics for handling protests and controlling crowds. Given our history of spirited and immensely politically relevant student movements, our police should have received special training for peaceful crowd control. Instead, they retained the colonial-era habits of violently attacking demonstrators, beating them, and resorting to lethal weapons. Then, of course, there is torture in custody, which has resulted in many deaths.\u00a0\nWe have protested for decades the use of lethal weapons to disperse crowds. None of our elected governments made any attempt to reform the police, though both of our main political parties\u2014the Awami League and BNP\u2014were victims of police atrocities while in opposition. In this regard, the suggestion to set up an independent commission to investigate police violations of the law, modernise investigation techniques, reduce mass criminal charges and arrests, and minimise reliance on coerced confessions needs urgent implementation. The establishment of a National Police Commission for fair, transparent, and merit-based recruitment also deserves swift action.\nRegarding institutionalised impunity and a politically pliant justice sector, the recommendation to establish a genuinely independent judiciary reflects a long-expressed desire of our people. The suggestion to create an independent mechanism for the recruitment of judges, protection against intimidation, and guaranteed tenure must also be implemented urgently.\nThe setting up of an independent public prosecution service and a witness protection programme would greatly contribute to dispensing justice.\nA most serious issue highlighted in the UN report is the use and abuse of intelligence agencies, especially the DGFI and NSI, by the political masters of the day. The \"Aynaghar\" detention and torture centres would not have been set up unless the DGFI and others complied. The relevant question is: did they have the option not to?\nThe DGFI is mostly manned by members of the armed forces but does not report to the army hierarchy. It reports to the Prime Minister's Office and, as such, must obey the orders of the political masters of the day. So, the crucial question is: what can that institution do if ordered to undertake illegal activities, as most dramatically exemplified by the establishment of \"Aynaghars.\" Its complicity in forced disappearances, human rights violations, arbitrary confinements, and many other abuses is well known. It is a fact that all governments\u2014both military and civilian\u2014used the DGFI for their own political goals. However, under Sheikh Hasina, it reached its most coercive height. Not only was it used to intimidate, torture, and punish political opponents, but it was also used to fulfil the agendas of notorious private companies\u2014such as capturing banks and securing lucrative contracts. This led to massive corruption. Such misuse of this vital intelligence agency, closely linked to our national security, not only greatly damaged its image and reputation but also compromised its integrity, independence, and ability to serve the nation.\nIt is our considered view that all our intelligence agencies, especially the DGFI and NSI, must be prevented from being misused by future elected governments. And this is the moment to do it. No past governments did it. And future ones are unlikely to do so, as these agencies are the most convenient tools for oppressing the opposition and implementing highly partisan goals.\nPolitical powers also used the DGFI to intimidate the free and independent media. Private companies were instructed not to advertise in\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0and\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0at the direction of Sheikh Hasina's government. This unofficial \"ban\" lasted for eight years, starting in 2016. Media institutions were aghast to observe that DGFI became involved in manipulating elections for journalist bodies such as the DRU, DUJ, BFUJ, Press Club, including vetting participants in TV talk shows.\nIn its obsession with remaining in power, Sheikh Hasina's government distorted and misused all institutions, including the judiciary, bureaucracy, police, and intelligence agencies. This facilitated the creation of the fascistic ruling structure from which we have now been freed by the student-led people's uprising.\nTo save our vital intelligence institutions from naked abuse, we must set up legal and institutional frameworks to prevent their future misuse and thereby save these vital national security institutions from politicisation.\nMost importantly, an institutional governance structure\u2014with clear channels of communication, supervision, and accountability\u2014must be set up to provide all intelligence agencies with clear mandates so that each institution and those working in them know what they are expected to do, and what falls outside their mandate. This will give each institution and their chiefs the right and the legal cover to refuse performing any tasks which fall outside of their mandates. The vagueness of current mandates allows political leadership to misuse them. In today's world, the term \"security\" is used to justify actions that create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. It must also be mentioned that some overenthusiastic individuals within these institutions allowed such abuses because it gave them a chance to take advantage of the situation for personal aggrandisement. After all, a sense of unlimited power triggers many unwarranted things within a person.\n\nWe must establish an independent and democratic oversight institution that will help govern them better and also prevent their political, partisan, and sometimes even personal misuse. There must also be fiduciary transparency in regard to budget and their utilisation. Examples abound all over the world where powerful intelligence agencies are monitored by parliamentary or other independent oversight bodies. All intelligence agencies\u2014DGFI, NSI, SB, DB\u2014would benefit from such oversight, which will help them operate independently to serve national interest instead of partisan ones.\nWith the gradual collapse of the law-based world order, the necessity and rising relevance of intelligence agencies, particularly those linked to defence establishments, are greater than ever. We acknowledge this need. However, we must also ensure that these institutions are trained, equipped, and elevated to global standards. For that to happen, we must eliminate political and partisan influence over these critical institutions.\nJust as we value these institutions and need them to serve us better in handling our security issues, we also need the legal and governance related infrastructure to prevent the kind of abuse and misuse that we have witnessed and suffered from in recent years.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We welcome the long-awaited release of the fact-finding report of the United Nations Human Rights Office about the crimes and abuses committed by the Awami League government during the July-August uprising. And as expected, it provides conclusive proof of the systematic brutalities inflicted upon protesters as well as Sheikh Hasina's role in orchestrating them. This should put to rest any lingering attempts\u2014domestic or international\u2014to distort, downplay, or whitewash the atrocities the regime carried out in a desperate bid to retain power. The facts are now indisputable, so the path to justice should be clearer than ever before.\nIn its 114-page report, the UN, based on testimonies from senior security officials, confirms that Hasina herself ordered security forces to kill protesters. On July 19, she explicitly instructed them to \"arrest the ringleaders of the protests, the troublemakers, kill them and hide their bodies.\" Her trusted lieutenant, then-home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, reinforced this directive in meetings with top security officials, ordering the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) to use lethal force. These instructions and consequent measures paved the path for the killing of as many as 1,400 people\u2014including many children\u2014in what the UN describes as \"crimes against humanity.\" Other findings of the report are equally chilling.\n\nIn its 114-page report, the UN, based on testimonies from senior security officials, confirms that Hasina herself ordered security forces to kill protesters.

It identifies the integrated role of at least seven security forces, including the Army, BGB, and RAB, as well as ruling party activists, who coordinated to arbitrarily harass, arrest, torture, and even execute protesters. The details provided by the report about these developments, and the roles played by both security and intelligence agencies, are shocking. The report also sheds light on the sexual violence committed against women protesters as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. It reveals that officers also obstructed medical care for injured protesters, intimidating doctors and pressuring them to falsify medical reports or deny treatment to victims. Forensic pathologists were forced to misclassify causes of death, erasing proof of extrajudicial killings. There were also frequent internet blackouts to disrupt protesters' ability to organise.\nFollowing the unveiling of the report, the UN rights chief has rightly called for additional criminal investigations to determine the full extent of these violations. For now, it is only appropriate that the ongoing trials of former regime figures and officials incorporate these findings as evidence, which the chief prosecutor of the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) said they would. The UN, however, said it would not share evidence from its investigation with Bangladesh unless the trials meet international standards. There are certain issues that may stand in the way of a UN approval of the justice process, but we hope for the sake of the victims that those will be resolved soon. It is also vital that past crimes by the Awami regime, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions, are tried and those responsible held to account. The UN has made a number of recommendations in its report, which too must be seriously considered and acted on.\n",
