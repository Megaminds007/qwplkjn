It follows that ministries that fund the bulk of research and development (R&D) too would see a healthy jump in allocation. The Ministry of Science & Technology has received an allocation of \u20b916,361.42 crore this year, on paper an impressive 15% increase from the previous estimate. However, between 2021-22 and 2022-23, the Ministry had seen a 3.9% decrease. The bulk of the hike has gone to the Department of Science and Technology (DST) \u2014 \u20b97,931.05 crore, up 32.1% from last year. It was \u20b92,683.86 crore for the Department of Biotechnology, or DBT (a nominal hike of 3.9%), and \u20b95,746.51 crore (1.9%) for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). The Deep Ocean mission \u2014 which includes among other components developing a deep-submersible vehicle \u2014 and the National Research Foundation have got substantially higher hikes than in previous years, a sign that they are the Centre\u2019s immediate focus.There were multiple references in the Budget speech for investing in dedicated centres for excellence in \u2018Artificial intelligence\u2019 research, initiatives to scale up technology to produce laboratory-made diamonds and a centre for research in sickle cell anaemia. While all of these efforts could be spread out across multiple arms of government, none of the budgetary allocations suggests a significant scale up of basic research. As with previous governments, this government too has not succeeded in increasing the percentage of spend on research and development to beyond 1% of GDP. While different countries define R&D spends variously, a rule of thumb suggests that developed and technologically advanced countries spend over 2% of their GDP on R&D, and India, according to a 2022 estimate by the Global Innovation Index, continues to hover around 0.7% despite being among the world\u2019s largest producers of scientific literature. While funds are not the only challenge to research and development in India, the lack of significant raises across departments shows that the absorptive capacity of scientific institutions in the country is limited. A major challenge continues to be research scholars not getting promised funds on time and the wait for the quality equipment required by researchers, continuing to be mired in a maze of bureaucratic whimsy. The bulk of research continues to be funded by government and the participation of the private sector has grown only incrementally. In the next few years, the government must not only increase the size of the funding pie but also ease the procedures to make the most efficient use of it.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nresearch\n\n/\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\nBudget 2023",

After a brief period of jubilation over the status of a separate UT, a long-pending demand from Buddhists of the region, the locals have only grown restive. An agitation demanding the inclusion of the region in the Sixth Schedule under Article 244 of the Constitution (special protection to tribal populations) boiled over last week after Sonam Wangchuk, a Magsaysay winner, went on a fast. Soon after its creation as a UT in August 2019, Ladakh came under a bureaucracy that the local population found to be hostile and irresponsive. The constant tussle between locals, elected representatives of two Hill Councils of Kargil and Leh, and the bureaucracy only widened over the months. Leh\u2019s political and religious bodies formed the Leh Apex Body (LAB) in 2020, headed by former BJP leader and former Member of Parliament Thupstan Chhewang (he is also an elected president of the influential Ladakh Buddhist Association). In Kargil district, political parties, including the National Conference and the Congress, and Shia Muslim-affiliated seminaries joined hands in November 2020 to form the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA). Kargil, unlike Leh, is for re-joining with the erstwhile J&K State and restoration of its special status under Article 370.Despite the differences in their political stands, LAB and the KDA are now together over common goals. They have put forth four major demands before the Centre, which include restoration of full-fledged Statehood, constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule, separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil districts and job reservation for locals. They describe the demands as key to protecting Ladakh\u2019s identity, culture and the fragile environment. The Centre appears to be in a bind as the two committees it appointed to reassure the local populations have made little headway in the last two years. In fact the second committee appointed this year under Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai has only deepened local anger, as it has no mandate to address the issues being raised. Ladakh witnessed a major military incursion from China in 2020, just 10 months after J&K\u2019s special status was scrapped and the erstwhile State divided. That conflict remains unresolved. In the absence of drastic measures to assuage the locals by meeting their genuine demands, the region will only remain embroiled to the advantage of those intent on fomenting trouble.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\n Ladakh\n\n/\n\npolitics",

It\u2019s now around half the floor price of the FPO. In all, seven listed companies of the Adani group have lost more than $100 billion in market value since January 24. In the backdrop of these developments, India\u2019s regulators and politicians swung into action. Parliament had to be adjourned over the issue. Separately, RBI has asked banks about their exposure to Adani firms, Sebi is also active and NSE has put some Adani firms under additional surveillance.\nIndian conglomerates now have both business and financial links with overseas markets. One of the lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis is that these links can show up in unexpected ways far from the epicentre of the crisis. Adani group firms have raised debt overseas. Over the last few days, the price of some of the debt securities has fallen sharply. Consequently, as media reports indicate, some of the Adani group debt securities are no longer accepted as collateral for trading. The fallout of such an environment will be felt by the group\u2019s firms as it\u2019s bound to affect both the flow of credit and its cost. There\u2019s also the risk that negative perceptions may impact other Indian firms that have raised debt abroad.\nConglomerates act as a link between different financial jurisdictions. Therefore, it\u2019s unwise to assume that problems with Adani group\u2019s overseas bonds won\u2019t spill over to India. Spillovers across markets were a major aspect of the 2008 crisis \u2013 and American regulators were caught napping as money markets froze and then the panic spread across many types of financial markets in almost every geography. Indian regulators need to get on top of the Adani situation before election season politicking leads to unintended consequences. Panic undermines financial stability. The longer this plays out at a political level, the greater the risk of ill-conceived interventions to neutralise the fallout. The situation is as much a test of regulatory ability as it is of the future of the Adani group.\n\n",

The charges against Siddique Kappan soon included the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and then the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. UAPA is a draconian legislation, but last September the Supreme Court found a solid case to grant Kappan bail. In December the Allahabad high court gave him bail in the PMLA case. He was finally freed yesterday \u2013 despite top-notch legal counsel he had been in jail for 846 days.\nIn multiple high-profile cases of recent years the higher judiciary has recalled Justice Krishna Iyer\u2019s 1977 pithy guidance for the criminal justice system: Bail not jail. For example, in accepting the bail of another journalist in 2020 SC said, \u201cDeprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many.\u201d But quite apart from how many laws discourage bail, usually the judiciary itself just goes along with pre-trial arrest and long jail times instead of \u201cpreserving the presumption of innocence\u201d or undertaking its \u201cprimary responsibility of preserving the liberty of all citizens\u201d.\nKappan was denied bail at multiple stages, including by a Mathura court, a Lucknow sessions court, and the Allahabad HC itself. As he told media yesterday, his time in jail without bail pales in comparison to many who spend five and even ten years in that situation when charged with UAPA. Conviction rates are low even in IPC crimes, for example standing at 42.4% for murder, 28.6% for rape, and 21.9% for riots. Meanwhile, 80% of the country\u2019s prisoners are undertrials. These bleak facts underline how different authorities are on board with the \u2018let the process be the punishment\u2019 thinking. Most victims simply do not have the legal, financial and emotional resources to fight their way out of this maze. But they wouldn\u2019t need such extraordinary wherewithal if courts would simply do what juridical principles ask them to.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Coming a year before the general election, and nearly a year after the formation of the incumbent Election Commission, it is natural that the six by-polls held Wednesday would be viewed against the wider political backdrop. It was, therefore, frustrating to know how little things have changed, despite the relative lack of violence, which would have been something to look out for under different circumstances. It's quite evident now that any changes, or promises of changes, made over the past year or so only cemented the status quo, which doesn't bode well for our electoral future.\nIf we're to pick a word to summarise the by-polls, it would be \"absence\" \u2013 absence of voters, absence of interest from the wider society, absence of strong safeguards against irregularities,\u00a0absence of main opposition BNP, whose lawmakers' resignation from parliament had led to the by-polls. Voter turnout was poor in all the six constituencies. As per an estimate, only about 28 percent of voters showed up, in a trend that has been persistent throughout all local elections and by-polls held over the last few years. The predictable nature of election outcomes, and the lack of trust about the neutrality of responsible state departments, seem to have caused ennui and despair among the people.\nIt seems almost futile to ask why the Election Commission is failing to address voter apathy despite repeated appeals from election observers. The EC, after the latest by-polls, again stuck to its \"peaceful and well-organised\" narrative, even though we have received reports of various election-related irregularities from a number of constituencies. The EC's failure to recognise that the mere appearance of elections is not enough is really alarming. We need fair and participatory elections. And we need the EC to restore the trust of all voters and opposition parties alike.\nAnother major concern about the by-polls is the \"disappearance\" of the main rival of the eventual winner in the Brahmanbaria-2 by-poll. This by-poll \u2013 which saw a voter turnout of less than 16 percent, the lowest of all constituencies \u2013 has been in the news ever since the winner, expelled BNP leader Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan, was backed by the ruling Awami League, which didn't field a candidate there. Abu Asif Ahmed, an independent candidate, has been missing for about a week now. Which makes us wonder: why is nothing being done to find him? What message does it send to the political opponents of the ruling party? And how long will the EC refuse to address the concerns of the opposition parties?\nThe culture of fear, distrust and criminality that still plagues our electoral system must be removed, and the ruling party must play a leading role in this. Lack of violence in one election means nothing given how political violence and repression continue to occur in every other sphere. If anything, the recent by-polls have shown that we have remained stuck in the same spot for too long, and the authorities must allow genuine reforms to break this status quo. They must help create a level playing field for all parties, and restore public trust in the function of the electoral system.\n",

        "full_article": "Despite the fact that sand extraction from rivers is doing severe damage to our environment and local communities, this mindless act is going on unabated across the country due to lack of action from the authorities. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, sand is being lifted illegally from the Padma river near the Baulikanda area of Shivalaya, Manikganj. Although locals fear that their homesteads and agricultural land along the river will be at risk of erosion by these acts, they do not have the means to stop these activities because of the involvement of influential people in this.\nReportedly, the local Union Parishad chairman, a UP member, as well as other politically connected sand traders are involved in extraction in the area, making the life of those dependent on the river more vulnerable. Sadly, the local administration is turning a blind eye to the issue.\nThis is no isolated incident, however. If we only look at the newspapers of the last one month, we will get plenty of reports on sand extraction as well as other types of environmental degradation. For instance, in January, this daily reported how influential locals were illegally lifting sand from the seabed along Chattogram's Sitakunda coast, increasing the risk of coastline erosion. Erosion is, however, just one example of the damage that results from sand lifting; other risks include loss of croplands and depletion of soil fertility.\nWe see such environmental degradation being carried out through countless other activities \u2013 such as polluting and encroaching rivers, cutting down hills, felling trees, destroying mangrove forests, polluting air, etc. Every day, something is being done somewhere to degrade our nature and thereby threaten our survival as a species. It is as if we are waging a war against nature. But it's not a war that we, or anyone, can win in the long run. Can we live a normal, healthy life by ruining the very environment of which we are just a part?\nWhat is inexplicable is why the state is still doing little to stop such acts, despite having of several laws and regulations as well as dedicated administrative wings to address these issues. In many cases, we have seen that local administrations only conducted mobile court drives, which helped little to improve the situation. More often than not, after the drives are over, the unscrupulous people engaged in such activities get back to their work again.\nClearly, protecting our environment from harm will need greater efforts and coordination from all the government agencies concerned. No ad-hoc measure can stop sand traders or river grabbers and polluters. We have ample laws for environmental protection which should be used evenly and effectively. Most importantly, we must break the culture of impunity of the politically connected people who are often the ones harming our environment.\n",

        "full_article": "Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader has described the just-concluded by-elections to six parliamentary constituencies as \"free and fair\" and \"a win for democracy in Bangladesh.\" Addressing a party meeting in Dhaka's Jatrabari, he said who won and who lost in the by-polls was not the main issue. \"It was important whether the by-elections were held in a free and fair manner or not,\" he added. His portrayal of the by-polls tells us what kind of general election we should be expecting.\nThere's no surprise in the results, except one, as the ruling alliance had it all settled in terms of sharing those six seats left vacant by the BNP as part of their anti-government movement. The lone loser is from the Workers Party, an important ally of the Awami League, who lost to the nominee of Jatiya Party, another partner of the 2018 seat-sharing coalition. Workers Party nominee Yasin Ali's loss might be the result of not getting enough administrative favour as a consequence of the party chief's post-2018 criticism of some of the government policies that had embarrassed the top leadership of the alliance.\nThe seat-sharing arrangement was so well-designed that none of the alliance partners objected to hiring a BNP-deserter for Brahmanbaria-2 constituency. The ruling party has set a new example of mobilising the party machine behind someone whose political loyalty, as of now, remains a mystery. Because when he left his over-three-decade association with BNP, he didn't join the Awami League or any other allied parties. It's also quite remarkable that there was no rebellion within the ruling party on the issue of supporting Ukil Sattar in his re-election bid, which is quite common in the Awami League.\nThese by-elections are nothing more than a mere fulfilment of legal obligations, as it won't be able to bring in any change in parliamentary balance. The 11th parliament for the rest of the term will remain without any effective opposition, as the official opposition, the Jatiya Party, has the dubious record of contesting the last general election under a seat-sharing accord with the Awami League. No wonder that the ruling party's all-out support for Ukil Sattar raises some critical questions.\nMany political observers believe that Awami League's real motive for getting Ukil Sattar re-elected is to entice and encourage more desertion from the BNP and show those potential defectors what kind of practical help they can expect, in the event of a poll boycott by the main opposition. Quelling internal rebellion, forcing others in the coalition to give a walkover, intimidating independents \u2013 including creating an environment where a potential challenger mysteriously disappears \u2013 and deploying the party machine in favour of an outsider are no small feat. They, however, exposed how BNP's recent resurgence has rattled the ruling party.\nReports of widespread intimidation and harassment during campaigns in all those constituencies where Awami League candidates were contesting, too, showed a lack of self-confidence, despite the fact that their main challenger, the BNP, was not in the race. Polling day scenarios were not pleasant, either. If controlling the vote centres, intrusion into booths, and voting for others by Awami League activists constitute free and fair polls, then there's every reason to think that these by-elections were truly a dress rehearsal for the upcoming general election.\nThere's little doubt that it was a genuine dress rehearsal for the Election Commission (EC). The suspension of the Gaibandha by-poll in October last year, the first under the current EC, somehow raised people's expectations that it would remain firm, try to regain public confidence in the electoral process, and recoup lost trust in the institution. The reasons the CEC gave for halting the Gaibandha by-poll were: \"evidence of people either illegally supporting or forcing voters to cast ballots, widespread irregularities, and malpractices.\" The EC then concluded that the election was out of control, and that one side (or one candidate) was able to influence it. Media reports from Brahmanbaria, Bogura, and Chapainawabganj on February 1 have suggested similar widespread irregularities and malpractices. Unfortunately, things turned out to be a complete reversal of Gaibandha 2022.\nIt appears that after the ministers' outburst following the suspension of the Gaibandha by-poll, the EC has decided not to confront the ruling party anymore. Nothing else can explain their inaction in preventing MPs from campaigning and their failure in investigating alleged disappearances of Abu Asif Ahmed, a candidate in Brahmanbaria, and his agent. Disappearance of a contestant ahead of the polling day is unheard of in any election in the country.\nA serious and fair investigation was needed to find out whether it was a deliberate and voluntary disappearance to mislead others, or a case of involuntary or enforced disappearance. In either case, the perpetrator and all others involved in such a crime should be prosecuted according to the law.\nThis incident also exposes inadequacies in our election laws, as the People's Representation Order, 1972, in its present form, only prescribes halting the election in case of a candidate's demise after submission of the nomination paper, but gives no relief to a possible victim of involuntary disappearance. Unless this lacuna is addressed, recurrence of such mysterious disappearances of prospective candidates in the upcoming general election cannot be ruled out.\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist.

        "full_article": "Rumours are flying about veiled jockeying within Russia over who will replace President Vladimir Putin, now that his war of aggression in Ukraine has gone so disastrously wrong. Such a struggle cannot fail to expose the morbid pathologies of Russian politics. The key players are not organised political parties, but rather gangs of oligarchs who preside over various informal nodes of power.\nThis explains why Russia's most effective military force on the front line in Ukraine, the mercenary Wagner Group, is not even a part of the Russian army. Russia is now a land of warlords, something one generally associates with rogue and failed states. Its current and aspiring leaders are trafficking in fever dreams of battlefield glory. Implicit in this martial culture is a Hobbesian view of life as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short \u2013 and increasingly cheap.\nThe rise of private armies in and around Russia has led to some genuinely funny developments. For example, last year, former members of US and other Western armed forces organised a voluntary military unit to fight on the Ukrainian side. With pitch-perfect irony, they call themselves the Mozart Group \u2013 a direct riposte to the Wagner mercenaries (both names being of a German composer). One can only hope they will bomb Russian army positions with weapons more powerful than chocolate Mozartkugeln.\nBut the humour ends there. Russia's apparent reversion to warlordism has been abetted by a strain of Russian religious fundamentalism that openly celebrates death. Some Russian clergy have been telling their congregations that they can \"become themselves\" only through the act of killing. The \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, they are told, is a struggle for \"all of God's creation.\" As one of Putin's chief propagandists, Vladimir Solovyov, said in a New Year's message on Russian television, \"Life is highly overrated. Why fear what is inevitable? Especially when we're going to heaven. Death is the end of one earthly path and the beginning of another. Don't let fear of death influence decisions. It's only worth living for something you can die for, that's the way it should be\u2026 we are fighting against satanists. This is a holy war, and we have to win.\"\nLikewise, Magomed Khitanaev, a Chechen theologian and Russian army commander, portrays Ukraine as a latter-day Sodom and Gomorrah, \"We're asking: Oh, Ukrainians, why did you permit gay parades in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa? Why did you permit it? Why didn't you come out against them, against your government that was overtaken by fascists? Without shame before God, people, they are openly, manifestly spreading their filth.\"\nTo understand contemporary Russian ideologists like Solovyov and Putin's so-called \"court philosopher,\" Aleksandr Dugin, one must examine the tradition of Russian \"cosmism,\" a philosophical movement that began with the 19th-century educator Nikolai Fedorov. As Jules Evans, a philosopher at Queen Mary University of London, writes, Fedorov \"was nicknamed the 'Socrates of Moscow,' because of his ascetic habits and his radical philosophy. He had one all-encompassing goal: the achievement of immortality and the resurrection of the dead.\"\nAmong Fedorov's 20th-century followers was the Soviet rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (who theorised about space travel), the science-fiction writer Alexander Bogdanov (who believed that one could prolong one's life through blood transfusions), and \u2013 in a fitting coincidence \u2013 the religious thinker Vladimir Solovyov.\nAccording to Evans, this earlier Vladimir Solovyov called for \"a universal theocracy under a Russian czar, to hasten humanity's 'long and difficult passage from beast-mankind to God-mankind.'\" Once accomplished, adherents to the faith would \"become immortal spiritual beings \u2013 only Christ has reached this stage so far, but all humanity will soon follow.\" While Solovyov believed that this evolution could be advanced with magic, Fedorov himself advocated scientific means. But both ultimately \"agreed that humanity would be saved by Russian theocracy.\"\nDenys Sultanhaliiev of the University of Tartu has explored the links between the two Solovyovs and established a clear lineage from Russian cosmism, in both its mystical and scientific forms. There is a direct through line from the cosmism that prevailed in the first decade of the Soviet Union to the nihilism and nuclear brinkmanship on display today under Putin.\nA belief in resurrection and eternal life is key. But cosmism could emerge only within the Russian Orthodox version of Christianity, whose basic formula is \"God became man so that man will become God.\" That is how cosmists interpret the appearance of the God-man Christ: as a model for what all of humanity should pursue.\nAs we watch ideological madness play out in Russia, we must be mindful of its roots in Russian Orthodoxy. Many in the West now view that tradition as an antidote to the liberal decadence that Western Protestantism supposedly unleashed. In a perverse way, they are right: death solves all problems.\n\u00a0\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek,\u00a0professor of philosophy at the European Graduate School, is international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London, and the author of Heaven in Disorder.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2023www.project-syndicate.org\n(Exclusive to The Daily Star)\n",

        "full_article": "Coming a year before the general election, and nearly a year after the formation of the incumbent Election Commission, it is natural that the six by-polls held Wednesday would be viewed against the wider political backdrop. It was, therefore, frustrating to know how little things have changed, despite the relative lack of violence, which would have been something to look out for under different circumstances. It's quite evident now that any changes, or promises of changes, made over the past year or so only cemented the status quo, which doesn't bode well for our electoral future.\nIf we're to pick a word to summarise the by-polls, it would be \"absence\" \u2013 absence of voters, absence of interest from the wider society, absence of strong safeguards against irregularities,\u00a0absence of main opposition BNP, whose lawmakers' resignation from parliament had led to the by-polls. Voter turnout was poor in all the six constituencies. As per an estimate, only about 28 percent of voters showed up, in a trend that has been persistent throughout all local elections and by-polls held over the last few years. The predictable nature of election outcomes, and the lack of trust about the neutrality of responsible state departments, seem to have caused ennui and despair among the people.\nIt seems almost futile to ask why the Election Commission is failing to address voter apathy despite repeated appeals from election observers. The EC, after the latest by-polls, again stuck to its \"peaceful and well-organised\" narrative, even though we have received reports of various election-related irregularities from a number of constituencies. The EC's failure to recognise that the mere appearance of elections is not enough is really alarming. We need fair and participatory elections. And we need the EC to restore the trust of all voters and opposition parties alike.\nAnother major concern about the by-polls is the \"disappearance\" of the main rival of the eventual winner in the Brahmanbaria-2 by-poll. This by-poll \u2013 which saw a voter turnout of less than 16 percent, the lowest of all constituencies \u2013 has been in the news ever since the winner, expelled BNP leader Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan, was backed by the ruling Awami League, which didn't field a candidate there. Abu Asif Ahmed, an independent candidate, has been missing for about a week now. Which makes us wonder: why is nothing being done to find him? What message does it send to the political opponents of the ruling party? And how long will the EC refuse to address the concerns of the opposition parties?\nThe culture of fear, distrust and criminality that still plagues our electoral system must be removed, and the ruling party must play a leading role in this. Lack of violence in one election means nothing given how political violence and repression continue to occur in every other sphere. If anything, the recent by-polls have shown that we have remained stuck in the same spot for too long, and the authorities must allow genuine reforms to break this status quo. They must help create a level playing field for all parties, and restore public trust in the function of the electoral system.\n",

        "full_article": "Despite the fact that sand extraction from rivers is doing severe damage to our environment and local communities, this mindless act is going on unabated across the country due to lack of action from the authorities. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, sand is being lifted illegally from the Padma river near the Baulikanda area of Shivalaya, Manikganj. Although locals fear that their homesteads and agricultural land along the river will be at risk of erosion by these acts, they do not have the means to stop these activities because of the involvement of influential people in this.\nReportedly, the local Union Parishad chairman, a UP member, as well as other politically connected sand traders are involved in extraction in the area, making the life of those dependent on the river more vulnerable. Sadly, the local administration is turning a blind eye to the issue.\nThis is no isolated incident, however. If we only look at the newspapers of the last one month, we will get plenty of reports on sand extraction as well as other types of environmental degradation. For instance, in January, this daily reported how influential locals were illegally lifting sand from the seabed along Chattogram's Sitakunda coast, increasing the risk of coastline erosion. Erosion is, however, just one example of the damage that results from sand lifting; other risks include loss of croplands and depletion of soil fertility.\nWe see such environmental degradation being carried out through countless other activities \u2013 such as polluting and encroaching rivers, cutting down hills, felling trees, destroying mangrove forests, polluting air, etc. Every day, something is being done somewhere to degrade our nature and thereby threaten our survival as a species. It is as if we are waging a war against nature. But it's not a war that we, or anyone, can win in the long run. Can we live a normal, healthy life by ruining the very environment of which we are just a part?\nWhat is inexplicable is why the state is still doing little to stop such acts, despite having of several laws and regulations as well as dedicated administrative wings to address these issues. In many cases, we have seen that local administrations only conducted mobile court drives, which helped little to improve the situation. More often than not, after the drives are over, the unscrupulous people engaged in such activities get back to their work again.\nClearly, protecting our environment from harm will need greater efforts and coordination from all the government agencies concerned. No ad-hoc measure can stop sand traders or river grabbers and polluters. We have ample laws for environmental protection which should be used evenly and effectively. Most importantly, we must break the culture of impunity of the politically connected people who are often the ones harming our environment.\n",

        "full_article": "That Bangladesh has slid one notch in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is no tiny blip but a manifestation of the unrelenting malady the country is in. The Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) in its latest report has placed Bangladesh at 147th position among 180 countries-down one notch from the ranking of 146th in the previous four years-2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Among the eight South Asian countries, Bangladesh remains the second lowest in both score and rank, ahead of only Afghanistan. Presenting the report, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) Executive Director Dr. Iftekharuzzaman termed the performance disappointing, adding Bangladesh's score is among 122 countries that scored below 50 points, which are considered having a 'serious corruption problem'. In South Asia, only Bhutan presents a bright picture with a score of 68, ranking 25th from the top. Among the neighbours, India and the Maldives are the two countries ranked below the 100th position in the joint 85th slot with a score of 40. Others are well behind but ahead of Bangladesh which with a score of 25 wallows in the 12th position of the most corrupt in the world and in the 4th lowest slot among the 31 Asia-Pacific countries, better than Afghanistan, Cambodia (24), Myanmar (23) and North Korea (17). Regarding factors behind Bangladesh's disappointing result, the report mentioned that the pledge of zero tolerance by the government against corruption was undermined, and no strategic initiative was taken to transform the rhetoric into practice. Widespread public sector corruption further intensified around Covid-19 response, including public contracting and distribution and no effective action was taken against \"endless exposure of money laundering\". Also, abuse of public office made the problem worse.  The same outlook was echoed in the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s Executive Opinion Survey, released last week, by the think-tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) in the capital. According to the survey findings, one of the key risks facing the country in the upcoming years is corruption-- unabated, to say the least. As high as 64.6 per cent of the respondents complained about the high level of corruption seriously affecting business. Most of the indicators in the financial sector showed lower scores in 2022 compared to 2021, due to mismanagement and poor governance. A negative perception was observed in the case of the soundness of banks, accessing start-up capital, and financial and auditing reporting standards. Weak institutions are also blamed as the most challenging barriers to doing business in the country. Improvement of institutions has been found to be sluggish and most importantly, public entities dealing with taxes, licences, public utilities, judicial system, export, and import performed poorly. Performance of the majority of infrastructure-related facilities has been stated to be below the average level despite major public investments in key infrastructures.The suggestions made by TI are nothing new. Upscaling professional integrity of the ACC, public service and law-enforcement agencies, and ensuring accountability and transparency of the banking sector are some of the measures recommended. Well known that these are, there is barely any need to harp on them. Working on them may bring some changes for the better.",

        "full_article": "That Bangladesh has slipped one notch below the position, 146th that is it held in 2021 in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of the Berlin-based Transparency International (TIB), as such is not highly concerning. What is viscerally concerning is its score of 25 out of 100 and its ranking as the 12th most corrupt country among the 180 countries in the world considered for the list. A country can occupy a lower slot even without losing any point if other countries improve their scores. Seen from the point of the cleanest countries in the world, with the top scores of 90 for Denmark and 87 for Finland and New Zealand, 84 for Norway and Singapore, 83 for Sweden, 82 for Switzerland and 80 for the Netherlands, Bangladesh's score of 25 hardly makes the country proud. Clearly, the Nordic nations have led the pack as they always do in most global rankings. Surprisingly, Singapore has emerged as the joint second cleanest nation with Finland. Surprise of all surprises is Hong Kong's and Uruguay's enviable higher ranking with Hong Kong collecting a score of 76 and Uruguay 74 --- higher than Japan and UK. The US is way behind with a score of 69. Bangladesh has a greater reason to be particularly disappointed because when war-torn Afghanistan improved its score by 8 points to be placed right behind it with a score of 24 that catapulted the Taliban-ruled country to 150th position from 174th, the country's loss of one point also makes an unease reading. It is galling on yet another count which is that the administration in Bangladesh was supposed to adopt and follow its avowed zero tolerance policy against corruption. What happened in reality is clear from the perception index the TIB prepares annually on graft primarily in the public sector. Although, there is a reference to the collusion between the public sector and the private sector actors, much of the latter's irregularities such as tax evasion, black money and hundi remains out of focus. So it is impudent to ask why Bangladesh cannot become a Singapore in terms of placement in the CPI? Well, Singapore is an island nation that under its visionary leader Le Kuan Yew has been transformed into a highly advanced one comparable to the developed countries in the West. Its scarcity of land could not stop it from setting the pace of development at a break-neck speed. Therefore let alone Singapore, why is Bangladesh and other South Asian nations way behind their small neighbour Bhutan which occupies the 25th cleanest or least corrupt position in the CPI with a score of 68. It holds the position it had in 2021. Isn't it pathetic enough to see that the land-locked country is striving to be on the scale of the least corrupt nations at the top echelon while Bangladesh is struggling to hold on to its mired position at the bottom of the heavily corrupt band? One irritating question here is the incompatibility between the level of development and prevalence of corruption. Take the case of Switzerland which has a score of 82 to hold the 7th position in the list of the least corrupt nations. This actually defies the fundamental question of corruption. Not only does it encourage corruption on its own shore but also exports it to nations abroad. How? It is simple. The Swiss banks are notorious in maintaining fabulous amount of reserves of money laundered by foreign nationals and inviting more. What is aghast, the issue is an open secret but governments of the countries from where the huge amounts have been siphoned off are not informed of the deposits and the names of the depositors. Corruption is thus bred on both ends. If this is so, how can that country be one of the toppers in the list of the cleanest countries?Then Switzerland is not alone! There are other tax havens around the world, some of which such as Panama are looked down upon. This is double standard. The fact is that the so-called advanced countries have diabolic political agendas which can make and unmake small and poor countries. At times the more equal of the nations pursue heinous foreign policies in order to sell weapons of destruction and even expand their commercial interests. In a bipolar world, at least some countries could save themselves because of their protection provided by one or the other parties of the cold war rivalry. The leeway has shrunk and countries in this region are now finding themselves in a tight position as a result of cold-war-like rivalry in the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea areas.The Russo-Ukraine war can be a good example of how armed conflicts fuelled by external political intrigues drag down human values and all other international norms in trade and commercial transactions. No wonder, more countries have slipped to lower positions than better performers. Only 49 countries have improved their scores compared with 65 in 2021 and 73 saw their scores going down compared with 66. Crisis time brings the best and the worst out of people but unfortunately, the number of the virtuous is always a tiny proportion of their opposite lot. It is certainly not easy to come out of the mess of corruption unless the present system of education for advancing self interests is changed for a social system based on balanced utilitarian and humanitarian considerations. Even with less national wealth, a people can be happy by ensuring rational distribution of the same and keeping filthy consumerism at bay. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "When the government had promulgated an ordinance on December 01 last year to amend the BERC Act suddenly it made its intention clear. The ordinance, which was later approved by Parliament in the form of a bill, empowers the government to fix gas and power tariffs anytime and the way it likes. The Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources enjoys the power to fix fuel oil prices on its own. In the case of power and gas, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) was empowered under the BERC Act to recommend tariffs after holding public hearings. The latest amendment has stripped the BERC of that authority and the consumers of the right to raise their points. The reason behind the government going back to the old ways of hiking the gas and power tariffs, and scrapping the process of public hearings is clear to all by now. Within a couple of months since the promulgation of the ordinance that had done away with a democratic process of the public hearing, the government has raised gas tariffs once by a big margin and power tariffs twice. With the public hearing mechanism in place, the government might have to wait for some months to decide on gas and power tariffs. Political parties, businesses and rights groups which used to attend public hearings were not that happy with the outcomes of such interactions. Yet they could ventilate the grievances of consumers. They also had been successful in stalling or delaying the decisions concerning gas and power tariff hikes on several occasions. In the absence of such a process, the government has hiked power and gas tariffs to an unbearable proportion that too at a time when consumers are hard hit by high prices of most consumables. The government has been providing subsidies on account of power and gas supplies for decades. The volume of subsidies has been increasing unabatedly and it has become a huge burden on the economy in recent years, primarily because of the soaring prices of fossil fuels in the international market. Here, there are issues of mismanagement and imprudence, which, according to many, have only inflated the volume of subsidies. Experts have traced a link between the hike in tariffs and the $4.7 billion loans that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved this week. The reduction of subsidy was one of the strings attached to the IMF loan. But the multilateral lender should have given more emphasis on power and energy sector reforms without which Bangladesh is unlikely to stop providing subsidies on account of power and gas supply. The latest government action on public hearings on gas and power tariffs also brings to the fore the question: Should the taxpayers support an entity like BERC? The BERC has enough duties and responsibilities under the Act concerned. But the people found its existence meaningful only in the hearings that it used to hold from time to time on the issues of hiking gas and power tariffs. The relevant Act sought to make the BERC as an independent regulatory body. But in Bangladesh conditions, it is really difficult to achieve such an objective. This is true for all the regulatory bodies. The mission and vision of all the regulatory bodies contain many lofty goals. But those remain elusive because of the role the government often plays for right or wrong reasons. [email\u00a0protected]",
