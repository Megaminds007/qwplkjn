The average monthly revenues in 2023-24 are a healthy \u20b91,65,418 crore, with four of the six occasions that the GST kitty has crossed \u20b91.6 lakh crore occurring in this fiscal. At almost \u20b91.63 lakh crore, September\u2019s GST collections were a tad below the average, but 2.3% over August\u2019s inflows that had marked a three-month low. With the festive season kicking in, collections over \u20b91.6 lakh crore may persist through this quarter. The government appears comfortably placed regarding GST revenues in the fiscal context, with room to spare for some moderation in inflows during the January-March 2024 quarter when the central bank expects real GDP growth to slow to 5.7% from 7.8% in the first quarter. Beyond the macro resilience that these numbers indicate, a few areas of concern deserve closer scrutiny from policymakers and the GST Council which convenes today.One, there is a discernible slowdown in the growth of GST inflows, which dropped to 10.2% in September, the slowest uptick since July 2021. The average growth between July and September dipped to 10.6% in the second quarter from 11.5% in the first. Growth from domestic transactions and services imports has slowed to 14% over the past two months, from 18% in June. It is important to note that revenues in September, based on transactions undertaken in August, also include pending dues from businesses since the start of the GST regime in 2017-18 as the deadline to remit them was September 30. Moreover, e-invoicing became mandatory for all firms with a turnover of over \u20b95 crore since August 1, so there was another compliance push at work. Distilling these effects is necessary to gauge the extent of growth that stemmed from actual consumption and production upticks. That a record 9.34 crore e-way bills generated during August did not translate into the highest-ever revenues may suggest that transaction sizes have shrunk, for instance. Another puzzling trend is seen in revenues from goods imports that have shrunk four times this year. Of course, the lower goods import bills recorded this year will reflect in lower GST intakes. However, imports hit a nine-month high of $58.6 billion in August, 10.75% over July\u2019s import bill. Yet, revenues collected in September were 5.7% below the previousmonth\u2019skitty. This does not add up. Authorities must dig deeper to check for revenue leakages from imports.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntaxes and duties",

That\u2019s the kind of headline that will do its students a world of good, as alumni and employers take note across various countries. But then there is also a very different kind of ground being broken here in 2023: Some tables in the mess have been reserved for vegetarians. An email from the mess administration reportedly said this was because \u201csome people\u201d cannot stomach the look or smell of non-vegetarian food. Students who have protested have been fined. Faculty members who support the protesting students credibly argue that what\u2019s taking place here is a dangerous institutionalisation of a puritypollution matrix, which can also be deeply casteist.\n\nVegetarianism is a perfectly valid food choice. As is non-vegetarianism. Students may come into IITs with a personal background where only one of these choices dominates. This will be only one of their many,many encounters with an Other who becomes familiar only through the IIT years and experience. This gaining of familiarity and comfort with the unfamiliar and even intimidating is valuable broader education. The IITs were built to provide world-class excellence in an otherwise second-rate higher educational system and over the decades, this has remained a core role. What has changed dramatically is the IIT brand value, thanks to the many professionals with IIT degrees who star the global business-scape today. And as prized as their skills and learning may be, the soft skills of dealing with varied workforces are no less critical to their success.\nIIT-B student Darshan Solanki\u2019s suicide in February had already put a spotlight on issues of caste discrimination on elite campuses. It should have made the administration more responsive to complaints of stigmatisation. That it is instead targeting students protesting about harassment of meat-eaters, accusing them of disrupting \u201cpeace and harmony within the mess\u201d is misguided at best. Too many educational institutions simply ignore the deep social cleavages playing out on campus every day. This is also what allows them to treat every student suicide as isolated, even when the causes are systemic. Institutional policies must address prejudices directly, and firmly deny all demands that perpetuate these. All the Indian students studying abroad benefit from host countries\u2019 support for diversity. It is unconscionable to deny them the same at home. IIT-B must de-segregate its mess.\n\n\n",

Officials say Sikkim\u2019s largest hydropower project, the 1,200MW Sikkim Urja on the Teesta river, will need thousands of crores in reconstruction, damaged in the flash floods that hit three Sikkim districts Mangan, Pakyong and Gangtok on Wednesday. The loss to life and economy will be counted days after the tragedy. The trigger will be scientifically debated \u2013 an earthquake or torrential rains or permafrost degradation, or a mix of such reasons. A global assessment found three million Indians in the vulnerable Himalayan region are at risk of flooding following GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) events. The Himalayas have over 7,500 glacial lakes, and the numbers are growing.\n\nWe know all this, but India lives in post-event damage-control mode. Sikkim\u2019s disaster committeehad flagged a vulnerability a decade ago for Lhonak Lake, the very site of Wednesday\u2019s GLOF event. It wasn\u2019t the only report or study. Each Himalayan state is battling consequences of a state-and-public disdain, time and again, for scientific caution, vulnerability mapping and ecological risks of construction in hill states alongside climate impact. This includes warnings against large hydro projects on terrains established as being geologically unstable.\nThe losses in Uttarakhand, Himachal and now Sikkim have much to do with a wink-and-nudge policy framework that bypasses environmental concerns to build in the mountains. It is precisely due to the doubtful resilience of such construction that many projects get mired in long delays and overrun costs. Climate change risks are barely accounted for, triggering cascading hazard chains that simply get amplified downstream. After Sikkim, there are flood alerts for Bengal and Bangladesh. The Himalayas are frequently flashing SOS signs of unsustainable operations. What scale of tragedy will it take for policymakers to sit up?\n\n",

        "full_article": "When you want to tell the story of Bangladesh cricket, you have to decide where to begin first. For our purposes, we can start with the cricketers from this region who had a love for the game in their hearts and a bat in their hands, but were forced to operate under oppression. The name of Raqibul Hasan pops off the pages of history books \u2013 he who dared to walk out with a \"Joy Bangla\" sticker on his bat while batting for Pakistan in a four-day match in Dhaka in February 1971. Then there was Abdul Halim Chowdhury Jewel, who may not have lived to achieve all his goals between the wickets, but he died trying to liberate his country. His name, and the name of his mentor Mushtak Ahmed, who was killed during Operation Searchlight, adorns the north and south stands at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka.\n\nStruggling to survive in the depths of post-war misery, we were lost in the wilderness that is the associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Eventually, the first One Day International (ODI) was played and lost in 1986 against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, but we finally had a start.\nA flood-ravaged Bangladesh hosted its first tournament, another Asia Cup, in 1988. The 1990s saw a more concerted push in cricket. Bangladesh kept playing high quality opposition in various tournaments, and losing, but quietly improving during this decade. It all led to what is possibly the most pivotal moment in Bangladesh cricket.\n\nDizzying success in 1999 was followed by what many now consider premature recognition. Test status meant Bangladesh was now one of top 10 countries in cricket, but the results were different. Bangladesh went to the 2003 World Cup without winning a game of cricket since that 1999 victory against Pakistan. That did not change during the World Cup.\nThe journey that started with the 1997 ICC Trophy for Bangladesh went beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. An easy win in the semifinals and then a closely fought, rain-curtailed final with Kenya led to the promised land \u2013 qualification to the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup.\nThe 1999 World Cup was when Bangladesh cricket finally came into common consciousness. It was a fever dream of a tournament, and Bangladesh registered their first World Cup win against Scotland on May 24. What happened a week later in Northampton, however, lives on in legend.\nPakistan was one of the favourites in the tournament, eventually making it to the final. But in Northampton, when Khaled Mashud Pilot whipped off the bails and appealed for a runout, and Bangladeshi supporters in the stadium rushed into the field even before the TV umpire could give a decision, Pakistan was the team that Bangladesh had just defeated to announce themselves on the world stage.\nDizzying success in 1999 was followed by what many now consider premature recognition. Test status meant Bangladesh was now one of top 10 countries in cricket, but the results were different. Bangladesh went to the 2003 World Cup without winning a game of cricket since that 1999 victory against Pakistan. That did not change during the World Cup. Memory of the loss against Sri Lanka lives fresh in my mind as a four-year-old watching the game on a 21-inch TV in my grandparents' living room. Chaminda Vaas took four wickets in the first over for Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh succumbed in a sad surrender. The team that captured the imagination four years ago tainted perceptions this time. The stalwarts of 1999 had left the team, and the youngsters were either too young or just not good enough.\n\nIt wasn't until March 2004 that Bangladesh finally won another game of cricket. Later that year, in Bangladesh's 100th ODI match, the opponent was India and an unlikely win buoyed the team. Images of a young Mohammad Ashraful hopping off the field in unbridled joy was rare and refreshing. The first ever win in Test cricket followed in 2005, and Bangladesh started winning games with some regularity. Surprise wins against Australia and Sri Lanka, accompanied by regular wins against Zimbabwe meant the team was confident going into the 2007 World Cup.\nOne wonders what the selectors were thinking when they included Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim in the squad for the 2007 tournament. One assumes that it wasn't predicted that these players, all between the ages of 17 and 19 then, would score three half centuries to upend the mighty Indians, with the whole country staying up watching the game on TV in the dead of night. But even that may not have been the highest point in that World Cup. The best team in the world at that time, South Africa, were next in line to lose to Bangladesh. On a slow, tacky pitch, Bangladesh spun a web of spin against the Proteas, defending 251. The 2007 World Cup also included a shock loss against a nascent Ireland, but that was rightfully overshadowed by the two huge successes against India and South Africa.\n\nBetween the 2007 and 2011 world cups, the mantra around the national cricket team was to kick on. There was the odd win against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Mirpur, where Bangladesh had finally started taking advantage of home conditions. In 2009, a West Indies tour ushered in a false dawn. Against a second or third string West Indies, Bangladesh won a Test series as well as an ODI series. Moving into the lead-up to the 2011 World Cup, Bangladesh won against England in England, a notable achievement, and then whitewashed New Zealand in Mirpur just before the World Cup.\n\nThe drama that has engulfed the team in the past few weeks may have distracted from the cricket, but in reality, expectations have not changed. This is a global tournament taking place close to home, and for a team who have made a habit of winning three games every tournament, it's time to do more.\nWhich is why, for the 2011 World Cup, hosted on our own shores, expectations might have surpassed reality. The country was obsessed, and tickets for World Cup matches sold out in hours. Fans let their emotions run riot, and the team possibly rode that wave to varying degrees of success. The only notable win was against England in Chattogram, but the two humiliating losses against West Indies and South Africa stuck in the collective consciousness. Bowled out for 58 and 78, respectively, it showed how the young team could crumble under pressure. As a fan, I remember being in the stands in the match against Ireland, going ballistic as Tamim Iqbal pouched a brilliant catch at square leg. But I also remember sitting distraught at home as the team got bowled out against South Africa in a match where a win would mean there was still hope of qualifying to the next round.\nFrom there to the 2015 World Cup, Bangladesh were winning far more regularly. A magic run in the 2012 Asia Cup in Mirpur led to heartbreak in a closely fought final. A torrid 2014 followed, where Bangladesh were seemingly losing every game, before the talismanic Mashrafe Mortaza came and steadied the ship. His leadership allowed the team to gel, just in time for the 2015 World Cup. Like 2011, Bangladesh won three matches again, and England were once again in our sights. This time, however, winning meant Bangladesh were into a World Cup knockout game for the first time ever.\n\nBangladesh finally kicked on, and after the World Cup, we kept winning series after series at home. The team struggled away from home, yet they pulled together to win against New Zealand in the 2017 Champions Trophy to get a semifinal berth. Everyone was looking at the 2019 World Cup because Bangladesh's greatest ever cricketers were in peak form, and good things had to be around the corner.\nThey were, and they weren't. Shakib Al Hasan had a world cup for the ages. He scored runs in droves and took important wickets, and Bangladesh once again got three wins. South Africa, West Indies, and Afghanistan were good scalps, but more was needed to get into the semifinal. No one other than Shakib seemed to have reached the level necessary for that sort of an achievement. Mashrafe struggled with fitness and form, and Bangladesh left the World Cup in the eighth position, not quite living up to the billing.\nThe last four World Cups produced three wins each for Bangladesh, with varying perceptions of success each time. Since 2019, the Bangladesh team has struggled off the field almost as much as it normally struggles on it. We have been winning games and losing games, but the narrative of growth has now shifted to a narrative of lost promise. In terms of good things during this time, a Test win against New Zealand stands out. The team is more mature than ever before, by dint of having existed in this state for quite some time, learning how to be a top class international team.\n\nThe drama that has engulfed the team in the past few weeks may have distracted from the cricket, but in reality, expectations have not changed. This is a global tournament taking place close to home, and for a team who have made a habit of winning three games every tournament, it's time to do more. They definitely possess the ability, and with a leader like Shakib Al Hasan, who has been outspoken about giving something back to the team one last time, the overarching story of Bangladesh cricket is screaming for a new act.\nIf the 80s and 90s were prehistory, and 1999 was when Bangladesh cricket was born, then it makes sense to say childhood and adolescence has been suffered during the 2000s and 2010s. The first cricket World Cup of the new decade has to be the one where Bangladesh cricket finally reaches adulthood \u2013 for the sake of the story, if nothing else.\nAzmin Azran\u00a0is the editor of Campus and Rising Stars at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

Against this backdrop, a Brac survey conducted recently has provided us with a somewhat holistic \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 picture of the situation on the ground. According to the survey, 45 percent of the girls in the country are currently being married off before the age of 18, and more are at risk of being married off.\nWhile poverty, absence of educational opportunities and a lack of social security were identified as the major reasons behind child marriage all these years, the study also found another factor \u2013 parents apparently marry off their daughters early when they think they have found \"suitable grooms\" for them. Yet another surprising finding is that parents from both poor and well-off backgrounds are marrying off their daughters early, which means that regardless of social status, nearly half of the parents still consider a girl child a burden. Another popular perception among parents that often leads to child marriage is that the demand for dowry is less for young brides. As shocking as this may seem, it is an unfortunate reality that men still prefer marrying teenage girls because they can be easily controlled.\nHow is it that, despite decades of work by various stakeholders and the government's so-called commitment to stop child marriage, we are still so far from reaching our goals? It is evident that the law to check this social menace is not being enforced, and it's high time the government started taking stern action against administrators who are failing to implement the laws. Women rights organisations have long warned about the dangers of keeping the special provision in the Child Marriage Restraint Act, which allows families to misinterpret and misuse the \"special circumstance\" clause in various situations. It should be obvious by now to the policymakers that there can be no alternative to repealing it. Furthermore, ad hoc measures to address child marriage will not work unless the underlying patriarchal mindsets of communities can be changed, for which we need sustained sensitisation programmes across the country. Unless the government takes strong actions now, our national target of ending child marriage by 2041 will never be met.\n",

        "full_article": "Lea Ypi's Free: Coming of Age at the End of History has met with a hostile reception in her home country of Albania, and it is easy to see why. Her self-description as a \"Marxist Albanian professor of political theory at the London School of Economics\" says it all.\u00a0\nReading Ypi's book, I was struck by the parallel between her life and that of Viktor Kravchenko, the Soviet official who defected while visiting New York in 1944. His famous bestselling memoir, I Chose Freedom, became the first substantial eyewitness account of the horrors of Stalinism, beginning with its detailed description of the Holodomor (famine) in Ukraine in the early 1930s. Still a true believer at the time, Kravchenko had participated in enforcing collectivisation, and therefore knew of what he spoke.\n\nWhen Albania descended into civil war in 1997, her whole world fell apart. Reduced to hiding in her apartment and writing a diary while Kalashnikov shots clattered outside, she made an extraordinary decision: She would study philosophy.\u00a0\nKravchenko's publicly known story ends in 1949, when he triumphantly won a big libel suit against a French Communist newspaper. At the trial in Paris, the Soviets flew in his ex-wife to testify to his corruption, alcoholism, and domestic abuse. The court was not swayed, but people tend to forget what happened next. Immediately following the trial, when he was being hailed around the world as a Cold War hero, Kravchenko grew deeply worried about the anti-Communist witch hunts unfolding in the United States. To fight Stalinism with McCarthyism, he warned, was to stoop to the Stalinists' level.\nAs he spent more time in the West, Kravchenko grew increasingly aware of its own injustices and became obsessed with reforming Western democratic societies from within. After writing a lesser-known sequel to I Chose Freedom, entitled I Chose Justice, he embarked on a crusade to discover a new, less exploitative mode of economic production. That quest led him to Bolivia, where he invested in an unsuccessful effort to organise poor farmers into new collectives.\u00a0\nCrushed by that failure, he withdrew into private life and ultimately shot himself at his home in New York. And no, his suicide was not due to some nefarious KGB blackmail operation. It was an expression of despair, and further proof that his original denunciation of the Soviet Union had always been a genuine protest against injustice.\nYpi's Free does in one volume what Kravchenko did in two. When Albania descended into civil war in 1997, her whole world fell apart. Reduced to hiding in her apartment and writing a diary while Kalashnikov shots clattered outside, she made an extraordinary decision: She would study philosophy.\u00a0\nBut what is even more extraordinary is that her engagement with philosophy brought her back to Marxism. Her story attests to the fact that the most penetrating critics of Communism have often been ex-Communists, for whom the critique of \"actually existing socialism\" was simply the only way to remain faithful to their political commitments.\nFree grew out of an earlier treatise on how socialist and liberal notions of freedom are interrelated, and it is this perspective that structures the book. The first part, on how Albanians \"chose freedom,\" provides an eminently readable memoir of Ypi's childhood in the last decade of communist rule in Albania. While it includes all the horrors of daily life \u2013 food shortages, political denunciations, control and suspicion, torture and harsh punishments \u2013 it is also punctuated by comical moments. Even under such harsh and desolate conditions, people found ways to preserve a modicum of dignity and honesty.\nIn the second part, which describes Albania's post-communist turmoil after 1990, Ypi recounts how the freedom chosen by \u2013 or, rather, imposed on \u2013 Albanians failed to deliver justice. It culminates in a chapter about the 1997 civil war, at which point the narrative breaks off and is replaced by snippets from Ypi's diary. The strength of Ypi's writing is that, even here, she is tackling the big questions, exploring how ambitious ideological projects usually end not in triumph but in confusion and disorientation.\nIn the 1990s, one such project was replaced by another. With communism toppled, ordinary Albanians were subjected to \"democratic transition\" and \"structural reforms\" designed to make them more \"like Europe\" with its \"free market.\" Ypi's bitter conclusion in the last paragraph of the book is worth quoting in full: \"My world is as far from freedom as the one my parents tried to escape. Both fall short of that ideal. But their failures took distinctive forms, and without being able to understand them, we will remain forever divided. I wrote my story to explain, to reconcile, and to continue the struggle.\"\nHere we have an ironic rebuttal to Marx's 11th Thesis on Feuerbach, which famously observes that, \"Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\" The counterpoint is that one cannot change the world for the better unless one first understands it. This is where the great initiators of both the Communist and liberal projects fell short.\nThe conclusion Ypi draws from this insight, however, is not the cynical stance that meaningful change is either impossible or inevitable. Rather, it is that the struggle (for freedom) goes on, and always will. Ypi thus feels that she owes a debt to \"all the people of the past who sacrificed everything because they were not apathetic, they were not cynical, they did not believe that things fall into place if you just let them take their course.\"\nTherein resides our global predicament. If we believe that things will fall into place by just letting them take their course, we will end up with multiple catastrophes, from ecological breakdown and the rise of authoritarianism to social chaos and disintegration. Ypi channels what philosopher Giorgio Agamben called \"the courage of hopelessness,\" his recognition that passive optimism is a recipe for complacency, and thus a hurdle to meaningful thought and action.\nAt the end of Communism, there was a widespread, euphoric hope that freedom and democracy would bring a better life; eventually, though, many lost that hope. That is the point where the real work begins. In the end, Ypi does not offer any easy way out, and therein lies the strength of her book. Such abstinence is what makes it philosophical. The point is not to change the world blindly; it is, first and foremost, to see and understand it.\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School, is International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London and the author, most recently, of Heaven in Disorder (OR Books, 2021).\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2023.\nwww.project-syndicate.org\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "While the increasing number of child marriages taking place across the country \u2013 particularly as a fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 has been in discussion for the past few years, hardly any reliable study has been conducted to find out the actual causes behind the trend. Against this backdrop, a Brac survey conducted recently has provided us with a somewhat holistic \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 picture of the situation on the ground. According to the survey, 45 percent of the girls in the country are currently being married off before the age of 18, and more are at risk of being married off.\nWhile poverty, absence of educational opportunities and a lack of social security were identified as the major reasons behind child marriage all these years, the study also found another factor \u2013 parents apparently marry off their daughters early when they think they have found \"suitable grooms\" for them. Yet another surprising finding is that parents from both poor and well-off backgrounds are marrying off their daughters early, which means that regardless of social status, nearly half of the parents still consider a girl child a burden. Another popular perception among parents that often leads to child marriage is that the demand for dowry is less for young brides. As shocking as this may seem, it is an unfortunate reality that men still prefer marrying teenage girls because they can be easily controlled.\nHow is it that, despite decades of work by various stakeholders and the government's so-called commitment to stop child marriage, we are still so far from reaching our goals? It is evident that the law to check this social menace is not being enforced, and it's high time the government started taking stern action against administrators who are failing to implement the laws. Women rights organisations have long warned about the dangers of keeping the special provision in the Child Marriage Restraint Act, which allows families to misinterpret and misuse the \"special circumstance\" clause in various situations. It should be obvious by now to the policymakers that there can be no alternative to repealing it. Furthermore, ad hoc measures to address child marriage will not work unless the underlying patriarchal mindsets of communities can be changed, for which we need sustained sensitisation programmes across the country. Unless the government takes strong actions now, our national target of ending child marriage by 2041 will never be met.\n",

        "full_article": "We are saddened to learn of the plight of the 50 families living in a slum near Amin Colony in Chattogram, which was burnt to ashes by a fire on Wednesday morning. According to our report, the fire started around 6am, and although no one died, it ravaged everything in their houses before it was doused about two hours later. Apparently, firefighters faced difficulties getting into the slum due to narrow access roads. Evacuation also became a challenge as the slum was surrounded by fences and sidewalls, with the only entry/exit points being near two warehouses, which also caught fire.\nOn the face of it, the horrors that the survivors faced are a reminder that tragedies, especially fire-related ones, don't discriminate based on one's socioeconomic status. While such incidents have come to be expected in congested cities like Chattogram and Dhaka \u2013 with the country in general witnessing a massive increase in fire incidents, from 12,182 in 2009 to 24,102 in 2022 \u2013 the same happening in slums bears a special significance. It adds a layer of injustice which deserves to be recognised.\nSlums, and such places, are a testament to the inequality that plagues our society. These communities, characterised by inadequate housing, limited access to basic services, and precarious living conditions \u2013 as exemplified by the narrow access roads and shared electric lines in the Chattogram slum \u2013 are left utterly vulnerable in the face of a fire, which serves as a double blow for them. The stories of the families of Mohammad Hasan, who endured the fire just before his wedding, or Sumi Akhter, who escaped with flames nipping at their heels, show how victims from underprivileged backgrounds suffer disproportionately.\nIt is, therefore, important to recognise the larger societal implications of such tragic events. We urge the authorities to help the Chattogram slum fire victims to rebuild their lives. We must prioritise the well-being of the poor and marginalised like them in our society, provide better and safer housing for them, and ensure that they are properly supported through our social safety net programmes.\n",

        "full_article": "As though the unrestrained hike in essential prices that the consumers have been experiencing day in day out were not enough, the bottled water and beverage market, too, have recently turned volatile. It started in June last year when the price of one litre of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-bottle water increased by 25 per cent (from Tk 20 to Tk 25). The two-litre and five-litre water bottles, except half-litre, went through a similar price hike. But this abnormally high price of bottled water came to the notice of the Bangladesh Competition Commission (BCC) recently during a drive it conducted in August, 2023. This prompted the statutory state agency to write to the commerce secretary and the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP). At the same time, it (BCC) urged the DNCRP to take immediate action against this unethical practice.The BCC reportedly found that the maximum retail price (MRP) of half-litre (500 ml) bottled water produced by big companies had earlier been raised by more than 33 per cent (from Tk 15 to Tk 20), while that of one-litre bottle by another 20 per cent. As the bottled water of these sizes is most popular for obvious reasons, higher price hit the consumers hard. Worse yet, the gap between the wholesale rate (Tk 11-12) and that at the retail level (Tk 20) for the half-litre bottles have widened by over 81 per cent without good reason. Taking advantage of this situation, multinational brands of beverages have also witnessed a 100 per cent price hike. The local brands (of beverages), too, did not lag behind. This is unacceptable. To all appearances, it looks like a veritable price-hike festival that the public has been witnessing in awe! In this connection, the argument earlier produced by the beverage and bottled water companies in favour of their products' higher price was that the import cost of PET resin (the raw material to make PET bottles) had gone up. Add to that the oft-repeated cause for price hike including the transport cost and, of course, the depreciation of taka. It is against this backdrop that the BCC recently held a meeting represented by the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC), DNCRP, National Board of Revenue (NBR) and the government's security agencies. As requested by the BCC, the different government and state agencies were expected to come up with their assessments of irrational hiking up the prices of bottled water and beverages by their producer companies concerned.However, as the bottled water and beverage companies, which were also requested to represent themselves failed to appear at the said meeting, the BCC will be required to convene another meeting to ensure their participation. It is expected that the government agencies tasked with controlling unjustifiable and unethical surge in the prices of consumer goods should give a fair hearing to the businesses producing and marketing the commodities under scrutiny. But the greed-driven frenzy to earn extra profit, a phenomenon for which a new coinage, 'greedflation, has gained currency in the West, seems to have also gripped the local bottled-water and beverage companies. So, one wonders if they are in a mood to sympathise with the government's or the public's present predicament. In any case, the government's monitoring and enforcement wings, if they mean business, should be ready to go it alone and take necessary measures against the retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers of bottled water in the interest of the public.",

        "full_article": "Due to a myriad of reasons, the energy being bought from renewable power projects in Bangladesh costs several times higher than the global prices. Depreciation of the national currency and dearth of foreign exchange and primary energy sources have got the government in a bind. Because of the inability to pay for fuel imports, the authorities have given the green signal to the renewable energy sector to install power plants. Indeed, going by reports published in the media, a number of projects have been approved and more are on the way. The three solar power contracts awarded in September will sell power at Tk10 per unit. Although in neighbouring India, it costs nearly half that amount. This has energy experts questioning as to why solar power should cost so much here. The three solar power plants that have been approved recently will have 20-year purchase agreements and it will cost the national exchequer Tk13,236 crore. A slew of such contracts has been signed this year with varying price contracts. According to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) data, more than Tk10 per unit has been paid to buy power from solar sources in FY2021-22. Some companies have benefitted more than others. Engreen solar generated energy at Tk16.42 per kilowatt (kw), Simpa solar power limited at Tk11.96/kw, KEPZ 9.8MW solar at Tk12.93/kw and Energon Renewable (BD) Limited at Tk12.11/kw. Interestingly, BPDB informs that cost of producing per kw of solar was between Tk 13 - Tk17 in FY2021-22 and that in the current fiscal is coming down. Next year it is expected to come down to Tk9-10 per unit.When solar power in a neighbouring country costs a fraction of what it costs in Bangladesh, one thing has to be clearly understood. In that country, the contracts are not given out arbitrarily, there is a fierce competitive process. Where there is competition, there will always be a pressure to provide power at the lowest possible price. Unfortunately, in Bangladesh, the energy sector as a whole appears to have fallen victim to special considerations. Through tender and bidding process, India has progressively brought down production cost of solar power. Energy experts point out that solar power plants in that country are built on the basis of competition and hence, production cost has come down. In Bangladesh, such plants are being built under the aegis of a special act, where contracts are being signed with specific companies. So naturally where this is no oversight, the cost of solar power is much higher. Other factors are also at play here. It has been seen that after signing of contracts, years pass by before power is added to the grid and payments start flowing. The third factor that is a problem is that practically all components of a solar project are imported. These carry various rates and types of duty that add to project cost. Other factors that act as hindrances include land acquisition, etc. But these are problems for all industry and if Bangladesh wishes to procure solar energy at competitive rates, the bidding process for contracts must also be competitive.Most of Bangladesh's solar projects are installed either on river banks or in remote areas. Getting these connected to the grid is increasing project costs. Drawing a comparison with India, the planning is on a whole different level. There, permission for plant location is given where it is most convenient for connection to grid transmission lines. Again, India makes most of the components associated with solar panels, ranging from the silicon panel to spares - many of which are subsidised through government incentives. No such regime exists in Bangladesh. Indeed, the eco system for making solar panels hasn't begun in the country, which precludes any profit-making market for would-be entrepreneurs.Although the authorities are hopeful that the solar tariff will get reduced in the years to come, it is difficult to imagine how that is going to happen when the entire industry is import-dependent. Where the duty structure allows for taxes to be placed on all manners of equipment and where there is a general lack of policy initiative to encourage a cottage industry to make it possible for companies to make components locally, prices are unlikely to come down. Lastly, if the renewable energy industry is going to fall into the same regime of 'no questions asked' under the power act, with no oversight on which company gets what contract at what price, then the country will have to pick up the pieces of another round of high price power that will do little to benefit consumers.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Protecting the consumers' interests is not an easy task. The thing becomes more complex, especially when the authorities concerned do not understand the issues comprehensively or try to address the problem narrowly. This is reflected in the country's telecommunication regulator's decision on discontinuing mini data packs for mobile phone users. In the last month, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) instructed mobile phone operators to discontinue with three-day and 15-day data packages from October 15. At the same time, BTRC also ordered the operators to limit the total number of packages to 40. Currently, four operators offer up to 95 packages to subscribers, ranging from an hour to an indefinite period.The order to keep the number of 40 packages may be logical to some extent. Mobile phone users will hopefully be no more baffled to choose their required data package from many offers. The BTRC also argued that too many packages make things complicated for consumers. Moreover, an opinion survey conducted by the telecom regulator showed that 61 per cent of the users favoured 40 to 50 data packages as maximum packs. Limiting the number of data packs will reduce the options for the consumers. Thus, the measure's effectiveness will depend on how the consumers respond. Having no alternative, though consumers have to choose among the available packages, they may pay extra costs if the operators charge more to adjust the cut in the number of data packs. The more problematic is the decision to stop the three-day and 15-day packs on the plea that subscribers usually can't use the entire data within the timeframe, and they needed clarification regarding the unused data after the expiration of the time. The BTRC also argued that the three-day pack offers more data at lower costs to allure youths and students. All these arguments are flawed. Instead of discontinuing these mini packs, the BTRC may ask the operators to resize the packs or cut the price of the packs and ensure the utilisation of the remaining or unused data. Interestingly, a survey conducted by the BTRC showed that around 69 per cent of the subscribers use a three-day pack, followed by 17 per cent who use a seven-day package. Nevertheless, the BTRC head criticised those who argued in favour of the three-day pack, saying that they did not understand the loopholes in the pack. Mini packs, especially the three-day, are popular for obvious reasons. Many subscribers need this kind of data package to run the internet for a brief period. It is a budget pack for those who use the mobile internet while necessary. The Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) argued that stopping the three-day pack is a move to limit access to the internet for ordinary and lower-income individuals. The CAB also said that discontinuing the three-day data packages will create a barrier to accessible and affordable internet access for all. It also needs to be clarified how the regulator will ensure that the operator will not overcharge the subscribers in revised packages. Many consumers have complained that the operators do not properly follow the BTRC guideline of adding unused data to the next pack. In many cases, they couldn't detect whether the unused data was added to the latest package.Restricting the consumers' freedom to choose data packs may distort the market and consumers may have to bear the burden. So, the latest move to discontinue with the three-day data pack needs reconsideration. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh has made significant progress in empowering women. The number of women entering the workforce is increasing day by day. They are coming out of their houses to work at offices and factories. They also go out for medical treatment and attend classes at educational institutions. Even they have to work on farmlands. When they go out for work, they sometimes need toilet facilities. But our local government bodies, such as city corporations, zila parishads, upzila parishads, municipalities and union parishads are yet to set up a sufficient number of public toilets for women. Moreover, the existing public toilets are often found dirty and unhygienic while some are found unusable. Ensuring clean and accessible sanitation is a core part of Sustainable Development Goal. It is very unfortunate that the number of public toilets for women in public places is inadequate. Besides, the existing public toilets are not free of cost. A woman has to pay Tk 10 for using public toilets. So those women who go out for their work have to face problems. The local government units must address this problem. It is one of the prerequisites for women's free movement outdoor. Public toilets are of great importance with regards to health and sanitation. Toilets in government offices, hospitals, educational institutions, bus stands and railway stations among other places need to be checked regularly for cleanliness, water-supply, etc. Adequate safety measures, especially in women's toilets, and proper ventilation need to be provided. It would be desirable not to collect any charge for the use of public toilets. The cost of maintaining the public toilets needs to be borne by the government. Fewer toilets also do not meet the needs of the general public.\nMd Ashraf Hossain120, Central Bashabo, Dhaka-1214, [email\u00a0protected]",
