From the way we live and work to the way we think and act\u2014everything has gone through dramatic change due to the ongoing pandemic. Democracy has not been spared either, with its very foundation shaken to the core because of the pandemic's wide-ranging socioeconomic impacts witnessed over the last 18 months.\nA report by Freedom House\u2014an organisation actively advocating to strengthen democracy around the world\u2014revealed that the condition of democracy and human rights has worsened in 80 countries, with \"particularly sharp deterioration in struggling democracies and highly repressive states.\" The organisation's president, Michael J Abramowitz, suggested: \"What began as a worldwide health crisis has become part of the global crisis for democracy\u2026 Governments in every part of the world have abused their powers in the name of public health, seizing the opportunity to undermine democracy and human rights.\"\nFrom strong European nations such as Hungary, where the parliament had initially voted to give the right and authority to Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree in the name of the coronavirus, to the more struggling nations such as Chile that had postponed constitutional assembly polls in view of rising Covid-19 cases\u2014democracy around the world has been hit hard by the pandemic.\nFreedom House has identified four major issues that have become even more complicated due to Covid-19: lack of government transparency and information on Covid-19; corruption; lack of protection for vulnerable populations; and government abuses of power.\nThese challenges are universal; the case is not so different in Bangladesh either, where press freedom, human rights, and the performance of vital institutions have all been affected during the pandemic.\nThe government in Bangladesh has perhaps been less ruthless in leveraging the challenges posed by the pandemic to erode people's democratic rights, as opposed to some other democratic governments that have pressed home their own vindictive agendas\u2014case in point: India, where the minority Muslims have been targeted during anti-Covid drives (The Wire published a column titled \"The Coronavirus Has Morphed Into an Anti-Muslim Virus\" elaborating this socio-political injustice)\u2014but it cannot be denied that democracy in the country has suffered overall.\nThe government's lack of transparency regarding its Covid-19 management plan has been highlighted by the media multiple times, and has caused the common people immense suffering. The government's mass immunisation drives and vaccine sourcing strategies suffer not only from a lack of proper planning and execution, but also from a lack of clarity, accountability and a meaningful engagement with the public. The government has yet to elaborate on how it plans to inoculate 70 percent of the population, and its measures so far can at best be termed as \"kneejerk reactions\" to the various Covid-19 waves the country has experienced.\nSimilarly, the lack of transparency and accountability in the government's plans to distribute relief goods among the affected people have allowed these drives to be mired in corruption and misappropriation, as many public representatives embezzled rice, among other relief commodities. While punitive action has been taken by the authorities in some cases, there has been no initiative to address the systemic loopholes that allowed this to happen in the first place, potentially leaving room for future transgressions.\nAnd when the media reported these incidents, many journalists came under fire\u2014or should one say sticks and weapons, as it happened in the case of SA Television district correspondent AH Bhuiyan Sajal. Sajal was beaten up by the henchmen of Amirganj Union Parishad Chairman Nasir Uddin Khan, when he and his colleagues were investigating Nasir's alleged involvement in the misappropriation of relief commodities.\nOne would also remember the government-imposed censorship on medical professionals\u2014especially nurses\u2014who were asked not to talk to the media amid reports of the shortages of PPE and meals, at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe government initially also warned that it would monitor the news outlets and social media, and the information they broadcast and share on Covid-19, to apparently stop the spread of fake information. In the face of protests, however, the government took a step back and only suggested keeping an eye on the social media platforms to observe if misinformation with regard to Covid-19 were being circulated.\nIn March 2020, the government also arrested six individuals for allegedly spreading misinformation about Covid-19. The Digital Security Act, which experts termed \"draconian\" due to its nature, has been used on multiple occasions to smother the dissenting voices.\nEven the notorious colonial-era law, Official Secrets Act, 1923, has been used to supress press freedom. Prothom Alo journalist Rozina Islam, who has exposed many irregularities in the country's public health sector, has been sued under this act for the apparent theft of confidential official documents. Before handing her over to the law enforcement officials, health ministry officials confined her in their office for around five hours and also \"searched\" her, raising serious questions about the abuse of power by a quarter of state officials and their deep distrust of the free press.\nWhile human rights, transparency, and press freedom are still struggling to rise above the challenges posed by the pandemic, the damage done to democracy and our democratic values are not permanent.\nSome elements within the executive and the legislative bodies may have taken advantage of the pandemic for their own gains, but one can argue that many of the problems predate the pandemic. A case can even be made that the government, over all, has been comparatively pro-people during this time. However, we cannot ignore its shortcomings in fighting the pandemic (especially its indecisiveness and inefficiency in managing Covid-19 challenges), the corruption it has allowed to go on, and its suppression of free speech in the name of combating fake news.\nThe government, if it genuinely aspires to achieve a true democracy, must work on changing the system that enables the gagging of democracy. It can start by reforming and strengthening the democratic and regulatory institutions, the statutory bodies and other public sector institutions, including the Election Commission, the Bangladesh Public Service Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission, various ministries, law enforcement bodies, and the central bank, among others. These institutions should be allowed and necessarily empowered to function with fairness and without external influence.\nThe government needs to identify the individuals who are using the pandemic to their advantage, and take punitive actions against them in order to make examples of these greedy, unscrupulous people who are hurting the democratic ethos of our nation in these trying times.\nThe authorities must demonstrate strong political will to flush out these elements and reset the system to salvage the democracy we so cherish and take pride in. Otherwise, the misdeeds of a few\u2014albeit influential\u2014will cause permanent damage to the democratic values of our nation. This scenario should not be desirable for anyone\u2014most of all our democratically elected government.\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.\nHer Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "The impacts of the recent hurricane Ida in the United States, which killed more than 50 people and caused floods as far as in New York, was acknowledged by President Joe Biden as being more severe because of human-induced climate change. The same has been proven unequivocally by the science of attribution for having raised global mean temperature above one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial revolution period, as stated by the recent Sixth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThus, it is now clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that the world has crossed over the threshold into the era where loss and damage from climate change has become a reality. This means that every day an unprecedented extreme weather event is likely to occur, causing both economic as well as non-economic loss and damage around the world.\nWhile these adverse climate change impacts in the next decade or so are no longer preventable, the worst impacts in the longer term can still be avoided\u2014but only by taking emergency measures commensurate with the urgency of the problem.\nHence it is absolutely essential for global actions to be taken everywhere every day, by everyone, to tackle the global climate emergency.\nThis was recently emphasised by the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), which consists of nearly 50 of the most vulnerable developing countries currently led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. Prime Minister Hasina called for a global Climate Emergency Pact (CEP), to be agreed upon and adopted at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), due to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year.\nThe main focus of this proposed CEP is for every country to enhance its efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) to keep the global temperature below 1.5 degrees, which is still possible, but only if every country enhances its emissions reduction plan as quickly as possible. The CEP calls for every country to provide information on their actions on an annual basis, rather than every five years as currently required, as there is no more time to lose.\nThe second requirement in the CEP is for the developed countries to provide a firm plan on how they will deliver on their promised funding of USD 500 billion over five years from 2020 to 2024, which they pledged back in 2015. So far, they failed to deliver even the USD 100 billion that was due in 2020.\nThe CEP calls for the UK as the presidency of COP26 to get the developed countries to provide their plans to deliver this funding over the next few years. After 2025, the annual funding amount is also supposed to be enhanced to more than USD 100 billion.\nAn associated demand from the CVF countries is that half of the funds must go towards supporting adaptation actions in the most vulnerable developing countries, and the other half should go for mitigation actions. This is in contrast to the current ratio of 80 percent of the fund going into mitigation in the form of loans, and only 20 percent for adaptation in the form of grants.\nIn addition to grants for adaptation and loans for mitigation, the CEP also calls for debt swaps to enable the Covid-19 affected developing countries to convert their debts to support actions in order to tackle climate change and also to preserve nature. The case of Belize in converting its debts to conserve a major maritime reserve in the Caribbean is a good example.\nFinally, the CVF countries are asking for the UK presidency of COP26 to elevate the topic of tackling loss and damage from human-induced climate change to a high priority status in every COP, starting with COP26, as we are now already in the era of loss and damage from climate change.\nThe recent imposition of Red List by the UK on many members of the CVF, including Bangladesh, requiring delegates from these countries to be quarantined in hotels for 10 days on arrival in the UK prior to participating in COP26, has caused a lot of consternation about the ability of the most vulnerable developing countries to participate in COP26. It is incumbent on the UK as the host country to either drop the Red List requirements or pay for the hotel quarantine and reduce the time to only a few days. It is good to see that the UK may be willing to do this.\nIn the case of Bangladesh, the parliamentary declaration of Planetary Emergency has already laid the foundation for the country to treat both climate change as well as biodiversity conservation as a national emergency. Now this needs to become a part of national priority and should be implemented urgently.\nBangladesh, thus, has an opportunity to show the rest of the world how to deal with climate change as the genuine emergency that it is for every country.\nDr Saleemul Huq is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at Independent University, Bangladesh.\n",

He came from a poor Kentucky neighbourhood, his son was born with cystic fibrosis, and he had no insurance. He had gone to the army only to pay for his son's medical expenses. His mother, wife, and son have since been bearing the burden of the US's Global War on Terror. With this sad story, the University of California Professor David Vine starts his book \"The United States of War.\"\nBut for some, the same war has been immensely beneficial.\nWhile Madden's wife and mother were grieving, the US defence contractors saw their profits soaring. Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics\u2014the top five\u2014saw their share prices increase tenfold in 20 years, since President George W Bush launched the War on Terror in September 2001. It is almost twice the average gain of the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index Fund during the same period. The unprecedented war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya has played out quite well to fill up the coffers of the world's most influential corporates. A symbiotic relationship between these corporates and the government policymakers has instigated wars in far-flung countries to make such profiteering possible. Let's look into some instances to elaborate on this point.\nMajor General (retd) Mike Boera had once been the US Air Force's director of programmes and requirements; he developed programmes and business plans for weapon systems. After retirement, he joined Raytheon as the executive of intelligence, information, and services. Within a year, the company received approximately USD 2.9 billion in air force contracts. Incidents such as this are aplenty, as a 2018 study by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO)\u2014an independent watchdog\u2014elaborates. Termed \"the revolving door,\" such moves from the Pentagon to the corporates benefit the wider defence industry.\nUS-based global defence and aerospace contractor BAE Systems, Inc had Gerard \"Jerry\" DeMuro as its CEO from 2014 to 2020. DeMuro had previously worked as an acquisition official at the US Department of Defense (DOD) for almost a decade. Before joining BAE, DeMuro had served two other defence contractors: GTE Government Systems and General Dynamics. President Barack Obama recruited an industry lobbyist as his first deputy secretary of defence\u2014an example of the reverse-revolving door.\nMany private military and security contractors (PMSC) have also greatly benefitted from the wars. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991 and the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993\u2014where 18 American rangers were killed\u2014made sending troops to distant places difficult to justify to the voting public. The use of contractors provided a way to avoid public scrutiny and congressional oversight. The war efforts eventually became so contractor-dependent that in 2020, the PMSCs deployed 27,388 personnel compared to only around 5,900 troops in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan (\"Congressional Report: Department of Defense Contractor and Troop Levels in Afghanistan and Iraq: 2007-2020,\" updated February 22, 2021). The Blackwater (later renamed Academi) incident sheds some light on the PMSCs' influence on the US government. In 2007, four of its employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians at Nisour Square in Baghdad. All four were found guilty by a federal district court. However, President Donald Trump pardoned them in December 2020, just before leaving office.\nThen there are the oil giants. While the Iraq war was not necessarily only about oil, the oil industry played a crucial role. On April 15, 2013, CNN ran a story titled \"Why the war in Iraq was fought for Big Oil,\" elaborating on how the big oil companies profited from the Iraq war. During the rule of Saddam Hossain, Iraq's domestic oil industry was under government control and closed to Western oil companies. After his fall, oil giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, and Haliburton secured most of the industry.\nBrown University estimates the enormous cost of the War on Terror under its \"Cost of War\" project. Many columnists have quoted it to say the total cost was USD 8 trillion. Had it not been for the war, how could it have benefitted the US public? The National Priorities Project, a federal budget research organisation, provides an idea. As a rough estimate, USD 5 trillion could have paid for 18 years of healthcare for the 13 million poor US children, two years of their schooling, four-year public college scholarships for 28 million students, 20 years of healthcare for one million military veterans, and four million clean energy jobs\u2014all at the same time. All of these were foregone to satisfy the big corporates' insatiable hunger for profit.\nThe nature of today's war is such that there is no definite end, nor are there any clear victors or vanquished. It has been amply demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere. While the war rages on, men and women such as Russell Madden and their families lose. Russell was just one of more than 7,000 who died in all these inconclusive wars. Then there are 1.7 million veterans who had reported disability due to wartime deployments until 2018.\nIt's pretty tempting to say that the US has failed to achieve its mission in Afghanistan. But what was the mission's objective? Whose mission was it? Have all in the US lost? If not, who has won? Perhaps we can be sure about only one thing: the withdrawal from Afghanistan marks the end of one chapter of the extended global war. And a new one has already begun.\nDr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO at Bayside Analytix, a tech-focused strategy consulting organisation. His Twitter handle is @sayeed_ahmed2\n",

        "full_article": "News of child marriage is unfortunately quite common in Bangladesh. But the report about 50 young girls from the same school being married off during the pandemic is something that hits you especially hard. It happened in Alipur Ideal Secondary Girls' School of the Alipur Union of Satkhira district, according to a national newspaper. School authorities, parents and activists say that child marriage has increased at an alarming rate during the prolonged school closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThere is a lack of data on child marriage since the pandemic began. However, non-governmental organisations have confirmed, based on information gleaned from their field-level operations, that child marriage has indeed increased. According to the \"Rapid Analysis of Child Marriage Situation during Covid-19\" by Manusher Jonno Foundation, at least 13,886 girls from 84 upazilas of 21 districts were forced into child marriage from April to October last year. The media has been reporting on incidents of child marriage during the pandemic quite regularly.\nChild marriage is a serious violation of children's rights and a form of sexual violence. Girls who are forced to marry early have increased health problems and face more domestic violence. Child marriage also means school drop-out and an end to childhood. It's worth noting that Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 5.3 aims to eliminate child marriage by 2030. Each year, globally 12 million girls are married before they turn 18. International organisations project that an additional 10 million girls will marry as children by 2030 due to Covid-induced restrictions, school closures, disruption to child marriage programming, and economic instability.\nAccording to \"Ending Child Marriage: A Profile of Progress in Bangladesh\" (a report launched by Unicef in October 2020), Bangladesh has the highest prevalence of child marriage in South Asia and ranks among 10 countries in the world with the highest levels of child marriage. About 51 percent of women currently aged 20-24 were married while they were still children. I have been privileged to meet many adolescent girls\u2014from the haors of Sunamganj to the slums of Khulna\u2014who were determined to continue their education but lived with the constant fear of marriage. I wonder how many of them had to give up on their dreams of education and a decent job if they were forced into marriage.\nPoverty, lack of social safety of adolescent girls, natural disasters, and weak enforcement of Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017 are some of the reasons for child marriage in Bangladesh. Our patriarchal society places disproportionate emphasis on girls' and women's caregiving and reproductive roles. As a result, there is a high level of social acceptance of child marriage. Parents arrange the marriage of their daughters whenever they find a \"suitable groom\" without thinking how this would affect their education, health and future.\nIn Bangladesh, incidence of child marriage begins to decline only among those with at least 10 years of schooling, and its prevalence falls below 50 percent among those with at least 12 years of schooling. It is, therefore, extremely important that girls stay at schools. In many places, as the schools were closed for so long, friends and teachers did not know about the forced marriages of victims and could not do anything to prevent them. Union-level committees meant to prevent child marriage were not that active either during the pandemic.\nEvidence from a multi-country study in Africa and Asia on the pandemic's impacts on the lives of young people shows that families turn to child marriage as a coping strategy to reduce the number of mouths to feed. Concerns regarding joblessness, poverty, food shortages and fear and insecurity among parents due to the pandemic are the reasons for a surge in child marriage in different parts of the world. This is reversing the progress made over the last 25 years.\nIn Bangladesh, it is estimated that 24.5 million people have become new poor due to the pandemic. This means that even now, when schools have finally reopened after 543 days, girls, especially in the rural areas, are less likely to return to classrooms because their families cannot pay the fees. This, among other factors, increases their risk of early marriage. Many girls have become the main caregiver for their sick family members or had to look after siblings. They may not return to schools. This happened to girls in West Africa after the Ebola crisis.\nTherefore, it is crucial that girls are especially supported to return to education. This might involve flexible learning, catch-up courses and accelerated learning opportunities. Teachers need to check school enrolment lists to identify and follow up with those girls who have not returned to schools. Specific attention should be paid to the unequal distribution of unpaid care and domestic work so that it does not hinder girls' return to schools.\nTargeted initiatives should be taken by the government to protect and support the incomes of families with girl children, including social protection interventions such as cash transfers to reduce the risk of child marriage as an economic coping strategy for the families. Adolescent girls should also have opportunities for skills development to find jobs. Initiatives should be taken to strengthen the child protection system so that communities themselves can protect girls from early marriage. Girls' safety in the communities must be ensured. Also, efforts should be made to bring back married girls to schools. All stakeholders have to listen to girls while taking decisions affecting their lives.\nIn addition to the proper enforcement of the law against child marriage, birth and marriage registration systems should be strengthened. Local administrations must perform their duties effectively to prevent child marriage. Parental awareness of the rights of girls to education, health and protection should be increased. Social norms regarding the acceptance of child marriage have to be addressed so that community members learn to respect the academic and professional aspirations and achievements of girls and women. NGOs and government authorities can work in a collaborative way for a greater impact in this area.\nIt is our collective failure that we have not been able to prevent so many child marriages during the pandemic. And the danger, even after schools have reopened, is far from over. If we are serious about achieving the national target of ending child marriage by 2041, then we must make this a priority and bring momentum to implementing the plans we have made. The government, parents, teachers, civil society, the media, community members, etc. all must be more committed to ensuring that our girls can grow up to realise their full potential.\n\u00a0\nLaila Khondkar is an international development worker.\n",

        "full_article": "On Monday, Education Minister Dipu Moni unveiled the revised National Curriculum Framework, which, in its current form, looks set to bring major positive changes to our education system. According to the draft new curriculum, there will be no public exams before Class 10, and no exams of any kind for students up to Class 3. Students will be introduced to the stream system\u2014science, humanities and business studies\u2014from Class 11 instead of Class 9. And the evaluation process in schools will also significantly change.\nIt is important to mention that educationists and experts have been demanding most of these changes for a long time now. Although it was disappointing to see the government take so long to act on their recommendations concerning such a critical matter, we commend the authorities for finally acknowledging the ground realities and being open to changing things.\nAs educationists have long been saying, exams such as the PECE and the JSC do nothing but put immense mental and physical pressure on students. The present national obsession with tests has steered students' focus more towards memorisation and rote learning, and away from critical thinking and problem solving. Education has become mostly centred on guide books and coaching centres. As a result, students are losing out on the chance to obtain the benefits of a wholesome academic experience. Therefore, scrapping these exams is an excellent first step. Additionally, the new curriculum proposes greater emphasis on continuous assessment\u2014i.e. regular school work\u2014over the overall assessment, meaning exams.\nWhile we are delighted with the changes proposed in the new curriculum, we must highlight that the teachers will have a much more important role to play now. Under the new evaluation process, teachers will be required to evaluate the performance of their students throughout the year. For that, they need to have proper training. Moreover, the way students are given lessons under the new system will also have to change. The government should set up training programmes for teachers to familiarise themselves with these new teaching techniques and evaluation methods.\nIn order to have a smooth transition from the current curriculum to the new one, the government will begin implementation of the new plan from 2023, in phases. That should give the authorities ample time to train the teachers and formulate a step-by-step guide for the transition. We urge the government to keep academics and experts in the loop of things during this process, to make the switch quick and effective.\n",

        "full_article": "The basic human rights are enshrined in universal declarations and guaranteed by our constitution to every individual, irrespective of cast, creed or colour. But human rights involve much more than written guarantees, legislation or ratification of international conventions. What is required is the correct attitude and fair application. Unfortunately, in countries like ours, laws and conventions are observed more in their violation than in their application.\nWhile our leaders wax eloquent about human rights, they are found wanting in upholding those. Because of bias and prejudice and a certain lack of respect for individual rights and dignity\u2014not only among the ruling party, but also among many in the administration\u2014the application of basic rights is done selectively, while gross violations are overlooked.\nThat being the case, it is imperative that the national watchdog on human rights should be made more eclectic, by appointing people with differing opinions and from all across the political spectrum. That would lend it the gravity and importance it deserves and engender public confidence in it. Our experience has been, regrettably, quite the opposite. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has been made up of people with affiliation to the ruling party. This belief has once again been affirmed at a discussion organised by Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) on Wednesday.\nUndeniably, there are flaws in how the NHRC recruits\u2014not only the chairman and other members of the committee, but staff in various capacities as well. It is also true that the NHRC has done little to fulfil its mandate. Its tendency to tread gingerly on issues of human rights points to its restricted independence in functioning. For example, it is surprising to see the very tepid reaction, if at all, of the NHRC to the extrajudicial killings that have made our government the focus of international human rights watchdogs.\nWe believe that the observations made in the ASK discussion are worth noting and acting on. The Paris Principles must be followed in letter and spirit. The first imperative for institutions like the NHRC to be credible is to be independent\u2014something that a statutory body composed of people with party affiliations cannot be expected to be. Having credible people at the helm is a basic requirement. Apart from that, the commission should be invested with adequate power to ensure that its recommendations are followed unfailingly.\nSince the only reason for the NHRC's existence is to protect the human rights of the country's citizens, it should be willing to pursue and point out any violation of those rights. And the government should ensure that those violations are dealt with appropriately under the law. Unfortunately, as with many other national institutions and statutory bodies in Bangladesh, our NHRC has been crippled by partisanship over the years. This must change. The administration would do well to take note of the ASK observations and allow the NHRC to fulfil its mandate.\n\u00a0\n",
