        "full_article": "It is regrettable that the customary address to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly by the Governor in the beginning of a new year\u2019s session is turning into an unsavoury event year after year. For the third consecutive year, Governor R.N. Ravi\u2019s penchant for raking up a controversy has come to the fore. He left the Assembly without reading out the address, claiming that the national anthem and the Constitution of India had been insulted because the anthem was not played prior to the delivery of his speech. The State government maintains that the practice in the Assembly was to play the State\u2019s invocation to Tamil before the address and the national anthem at the end of the Governor\u2019s speech and that this had been conveyed to the Governor\u2019s office. As in the previous years, Mr. Ravi has to bear much of the blame for the flagrant politicisation of the event. If he had such prior knowledge about the practice followed in the Assembly, his grievance comes across as a ruse to create a controversy and avoid performing his constitutional duty of propounding the government\u2019s policy statement on the floor of the House. In 2023, Mr. Ravi had skipped portions of the address prepared by the State government, including a reference to the \u2018Dravidian model of governance\u2019 and some praise for the law and order situation in the State. Last year, he expressed his inability to read out the address, citing what he termed \u201cmisleading claims and facts\u201d in it.It is noteworthy that there was a recent round of gubernatorial changes and new appointments. Notably, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who has been a thorn in the flesh of the Kerala government, was shifted to Bihar, while Manipur and Mizoram got new incumbents in Raj Bhavan. However, Mr. Ravi, whose continuance in Tamil Nadu has been rendered untenable long ago, remains untouched. He completed a combined period of five years as Governor in two States, having been appointed to the office in Nagaland in 2019. He was shifted to Tamil Nadu in 2021, but has often found himself in the thicket of political controversy, making overtly political comments on the one hand and holding up legislation on the other by delaying assent to Bills. Going by recent Supreme Court judgments and observations, there ought to be no leeway for Governors to use their position to undermine regimes led by the political adversaries of those in power at the Centre. Given the scale of Mr. Ravi\u2019s persistent differences with the elected regime, it is indeed strange and questionable that the Union government should retain him in this office, unless its objective is to test the limits of the State government\u2019s tolerance.

        "full_article": "A decade-long dominance wound to a close at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the second-biggest silverware in terms of stature after the Ashes in cricket, and the biggest on the basis of viewership, has been India\u2019s preserve since 2015. Australia last won the title in the 2014-15 home series and after that India claimed the trophy on four occasions. This winning streak ended once the fifth Test concluded at Sydney with Pat Cummins and his men winning by six wickets and seizing the series at 3-1. The margin could hint at a vast gap in ability between the two squads. But it was anything but that and India had its moments and could have finished on the victor\u2019s podium. This was a series where the batters played second fiddle to excellent speedsters. It is no surprise that when Jasprit Bumrah, the most dominant among them, got injured and could not bowl during the Australian second innings chase in the last Test, the host prospered. Bumrah began the series as captain, a position he returned to once the regular skipper, the out-of-form Rohit Sharma, opted out at the climax. And Bumrah, with 32 wickets, led the charts. Again with a resilient bat, he even helped India avoid the follow-on at Brisbane\u2019s Gabba.A transition is upon the Indian Test unit, especially after failing to qualify for the ICC World Test Championship final. Having eased out Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane and now dealing with R. Ashwin\u2019s retirement mid-series, the selectors and coach Gautam Gambhir need to look at the future of Virat Kohli, Rohit and Ravindra Jadeja. These players were India\u2019s core in Tests, but a change is inevitable. Tours Down Under often force a flux. Dilip Vengsarkar retired after the 1991-92 tour, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman followed suit after their 2011-12 visit. In the current sojourn, despite scoring a ton in the first Test at Perth, Kohli\u2019s overall yield of 190 at 23.75 was poor. Rohit\u2019s numbers are even worse as he scored 3, 6, 10, 3 and 9. Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s runs, K.L. Rahul\u2019s initial consistency, newcomer Nitish Kumar Reddy\u2019s hundred at Melbourne, and the odd lower-order resistance, bailed out India but that was not enough. India lost due to batting ineptitude, a frailty that affected Australia too before its middle-order found a second-wind through Steve Smith, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj toiled hard but beyond him, Bumrah did not have much support from the bowling ranks. This was a series on which Cummins, through 25 wickets and 159 runs, imposed his will. India will need to find younger heroes, especially batters who are adept at playing both spin and pace, at home and abroad, in Tests and limited overs.

        "full_article": "Why MP\u2019s HC & govt can\u2019t just expect people to believe assurance on Bhopal waste disposal\u00a0\nForty years since the world\u2019s worst industrial accident, the Bhopal gas leak, it\u2019s still the people left to clean up Union Carbide and state govt\u2019s mess. Which is why one wonders if MP HC\u2019s nod to proceed on disposal of toxic waste from the deadly gas leak will suffice to reassure Pithampur\u2019s residents, who protested the incineration of Bhopal\u2019s hazardous waste in their town. The protests are but a measure of people\u2019s lack of trust in authorities. They cannot be blamed. Half a million exposed to the poison gas, over 15k dead over the years, congenital birth defects, compensation languishing in courts \u2013 the disaster\u2019s aftermath has been hell for victims\u2019 families and survivors. There\u2019s no putting it behind. To this day the horror strikes cold fear in people\u2019s hearts.\nAuthorities promise \u2018transparency\u2019 in testing air, soil and water quality and keeping tabs on people\u2019s health during the period of the waste\u2019s disposal \u2013 waste that sat at Bhopal\u2019s Union Carbide plant for 40 long years. But the 337 MT set for disposal is only one part of what needs done. A 2010 govt study reported 1.1mn tonnes of contaminated soil, 1 tonne of mercury, and nearly 150 tonnes of underground dumps on factory premises. A 2018 toxicology study showed groundwater in over 40 residential areas in the factory\u2019s vicinity had high levels of metals/chemicals.\nLet alone plans, no one has any clue how to begin to deal with this. HC blamed the Pithampur stir on \u2018misinformation in media\u2019. Govt believes grand promises of transparency\u2019s the only thing needed to reassure the public. All this is only one part of it. Reality is, it\u2019s 40 years of inaction and dodgy govt response that\u2019s contaminated trust in authorities. It\u2019s not surprising residents feel the need to look out for themselves.\u00a0\n\n",

The blame can be laid on shoes, clothes, and seemingly small but the most pernicious of all articles \u2013 cosmetics.\u00a0\nThe \u2018happening\u2019 clothing stores are like the sea \u2013 you can never really fathom them even as cupboards are no longer able to hold one\u2019s possessions. With clothes taking over the chairs and other furniture, it\u2019s not uncommon that one loses one\u2019s favourite old garment in the heap, and finds it again after months or even years.\nSkincare and cosmetics are another universe, infinite and puzzling. Earlier, you bought a cream. Now, you buy a hand cream, face cream, body lotion, exfoliating cream and body butter, while sunscreen has multiple SPF levels. For night, there are healing creams and ones that remove dark circles. It is horrifying to my family when a fashion rustic \u2013 me \u2013 deliberately uses a foot cream on the face with no allergic reactions the next day.\u00a0\nThe search for the right shade of eye shadow, eye liner, mascara, lip gloss and lip liner is endless. Since perfection doesn\u2019t exist, the shopper makes do with what is at hand. But she never stops searching, collecting multiple articles, each making the previous one redundant.\nAs for shoes, the choice has gone past bellies vs heels. Now there are pumps, stilettos, wedges, platforms, block heels, Cuban heels and puppy heels. Footwear beyond heels comprises boots, sneakers, chappals and flip flops with an array of options, all of which are meant for a very specific purpose and all must be owned.\u00a0\nThe \u2018outing\u2019 aspect of shopping has become compromised as malls have become places where you must avoid \u2018phonambulists\u2019, people walking while staring into their phones. You must also learn to avoid agents who accost you to sell credit cards. Checkout counters remind of queues at AIIMS OPDs, and the prices of shoes and clothes of the salaries of so many people you know.\nYet, I am not averse to a visit to the mall with the family, but prefer stores which have a place to sit, even though finding seats in a store is never easy with men not giving these up, unless summoned outside the fitting rooms. But once they are called, they rush with eagerness to conclude the purchase and win their freedom.\n\n",

        "full_article": "When unmarried couples can\u2019t book a hotel room it tells us something ugly about our society\nOur fundamental rights are individual rights. They do not come down to us via tradition or identity or community. It is the freedom and equality of every single citizen that is affirmed by the Constitution. It is this core constitutionalism that is subverted by a hotel chain\u2019s new check-in policy, shutting out its services to unmarried couples, starting with Meerut. The budget hospitality company has justified this change by saying that it\u2019s listening to \u201cthe law enforcement and civil society groups in the micro markets\u201d. Translation: consenting adults have been thrown to the moral policing wolves.\nYes, cops are often seen terrorising couples, be it in parks, or by the beaches, at the movies or in hotels. Also yes, India has no shortage of \u2018civil society groups\u2019, be it khap panchayats or anti-Romeo squads or just the neighbourhood Uncleji-Auntyji gangs, that think they have a right to tell everyone else how to live their life. They don\u2019t. Nor do the cops have a right to chase away a peaceably canoodling couple with danda and screams. Their fond phrase \u2018indecent behaviour in public\u2019 needs to be retired. It allows for a lot of meddling and abuse \u2013 and hypocrisies.\nSex is as basic a part of the human life cycle as breath. Sure, people can choose not to have it. But this is an uncommon choice. Some of those defending the hotel chain\u2019s policy change are saying it\u2019s intended to curb prostitution. But like mob judgments, collective punishments are inherently wrongful, legally and ethically. Where there is crime, curb it. Don\u2019t go othering and scarlet-lettering consenting adults en masse. That\u2019s a terrible infringement of their privacy and rights.\nThose \u2018civil society groups\u2019 may expect Indian youth to follow celibacy till marriage. Whether or not young persons did so in the past, this is a nonsense expectation when the mean age of marriage is increasing and the mean age of puberty decreasing. When this cohort is expected to compete in a global job market, how can it be insulated from global social trends? Again, the hypocrisy of such expectations is acute. It\u2019s also fighting a doggedly rising tide. No amount of pressuring young people to wear this, eat that, don\u2019t love her, don\u2019t love him, and behave only like that, will get them back into busybodies\u2019 ideas of \u2018tradition\u2019. Regressive groups can badger individual businesses to reverse social progress. But free choice must prevail. And, over time, it will.\n\n",

        "full_article": "-By Yogi Balkrishna\nBryan Johnson, techpreneur, has plunged into an exorbitant experiment to reverse ageing and extend human life indefinitely. Spending millions annually on his health regimen, Johnson adheres to a rigorous lifestyle, including advanced medical tests, cutting-edge technology, and experimental therapies. While these efforts may yield advancements in well-being and longevity for humanity, achieving immortality is a pursuit fraught with philosophical and spiritual contradictions.\nThe Indian spiritual tradition has long critiqued such endeavours. According to ancient wisdom, the desire for bodily immortality aligns with the tendencies of an asur, demon. The etymological root of the term \u2013 \u2018asusu ramate iti asurah\u2019, suggests one who revels solely in prana, life force, without transcending it. This fixation on the transient body, a mere vessel of existence, underscores a fundamental misalignment with the eternal truths of life and consciousness.\n\nInterestingly, modern science aligns with spiritual wisdom in rejecting the concept of annihilation at a fundamental level. The law of conservation of matter and energy states that neither can be created nor destroyed. This principle underscores continuity and transformation inherent in the universe. Gross matter and subtle energy undergo perpetual cycles of assembly and disassembly, but their essence remains indestructible. Extending this logic to the spiritual domain, the subtler dimension of existence, consciousness must also transcend mortality. Consciousness, as the shaper, user, and enjoyer of both matter and energy, operates at a level far more pervasive and subtler than either.\nThe Indic tradition succinctly captures this truth: \u2018yadrishyam tadnashtam\u2019 \u2013 that which is seen is perishable. Forms arise, endure, and dissolve, in accordance with universal laws. This law very well applies to the human body, too. The deh, body derived from the root meaning, \u2018dahanam yogah\u2019, worthy of being burnt, is inherently mortal. It is an assemblage of elements destined for eventual disassembly.\nWhy, then, does the desire for bodily immortality persist? The error lies in a profound misunderstanding of one\u2019s true nature. At the level of consciousness, one is already immortal. This timeless truth seeks validation through the temporal body, creating an illusion \u2013 a sophistical pursuit of immortality. The transient body cannot mirror the eternal nature of consciousness. Attempting to do so is akin to seeking permanence in a shadow rather than in the object casting it. The body, remarkable as it is, serves as a vehicle for experience, growth, and transcendence \u2013 not as an end in itself. Indic philosophy teaches that clinging to the body as locus of permanence is avidya, ignorance that leads to suffering. True immortality is not in preserving the form but in realising the formless, eternal essence that animates it.\nBryan Johnson\u2019s pioneering experiments may indeed unlock paths to healthier, longer lives, profoundly shaping human lives.\nPhenomenon of death adds poetry and profundity to the symphony of life. Imagine a garden without autumn, where flowers never fade, fruits never ripen, and leaves never fall \u2013 a static, lifeless existence. Death lends the garden of life its vibrancy, a reminder that endings are as sacred as beginnings in the eternal cycle of existence.\n\n",

Hospitals in other districts are also overwhelmed by the influx of diarrhoea patients as winter intensifies. At the icddr,b, an average of 675 children were admitted daily in 2024; this number has risen to 914 in the last 18 days. Among them, 60 percent of the children affected by diarrhoea were infected with rotavirus, which typically peaks in winter. Its vaccine is not yet part of the national immunisation programme in Bangladesh.\nWhile the vulnerability of under-five children to cold-related viral diseases is well-documented, it is disheartening that many parents across the country remain unaware of the risks. Children are often brought to hospitals only when symptoms worsen due to improper disease management. Many mothers, for example, lack the knowledge of preparing and administering oral rehydration solution (ORS) correctly. On December 30, a nine-month-old baby was admitted to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital with diarrhoea after being given improperly prepared saline, resulting in high sodium levels in his body that led to kidney failure. Such incidents are unacceptable, especially considering Bangladesh's prior success in managing and raising awareness about diarrhoea.\nA recent icddr,b study of 350 mothers revealed that 88 percent lacked correct knowledge about ORS, while 72 percent used incorrect methods to administer it to their children. This underscores the urgent need for public awareness campaigns. Furthermore, the state of accommodation and treatment facilities in hospitals is alarming. In many hospitals, children with diarrhoea are treated on the floor due to a lack of beds, and parents are forced to stand for hours holding saline bags because of a lack of stands. Complaints about medicine shortages are also common. These challenges demand immediate action.\nWe urge the authorities to ensure that public hospitals are adequately equipped to handle the growing number of diarrhoea and pneumonia cases. Raising awareness about proper diarrhoea treatment and ORS preparation at home is also essential. Considering the significant number of rotavirus infections, the government should strengthen nationwide vaccination programmes, and diagnostic facilities for rotavirus must also be made available at all district-level hospitals to expedite treatment.\nGiven the likely role of poor air quality in the rising pneumonia cases, especially in Dhaka, the government must also take urgent steps to improve air quality during winter. A holistic approach from our health authorities is crucial to address these interlinked issues effectively.\n",

        "full_article": "In recent weeks, the prices of vegetables have doubled or even tripled, sparking the usual chorus of complaints about price manipulation by so-called \"syndicates.\" However, the real story behind this spike is far more complex and in this particular case rooted in severe supply shortages.\nBangladesh faced three rounds of floods this year due to untimely rains, which destroyed much of the country's crops. With supply drastically reduced while demand remained steady, the basic principles of economics took over\u2014prices were bound to rise.\nThe same pattern occurred with eggs and chicken. Beginning in May, an intense heatwave coupled with high humidity severely affected egg production. Chickens, too, were underweight and in poor condition, further reducing supply. The floods that later devastated the vegetable market also hit the poultry industry, compounding the shortages and leading to inevitable price increases.\nWhen supply drops sharply due to natural disasters, price hikes are unavoidable, regardless of market manipulation. We must understand the underlying causes rather than jump to conclusions about price fixing, especially in situations driven by unpredictable weather events.\nUnfortunately, in Bangladesh whenever prices rise, public perception often points to price manipulation by sellers. This sentiment, deeply ingrained in the public mind, misses some crucial nuances. Prices don't just go up\u2014they also come down in the short run, even though the long-term trend may be upward. Yet, consumers rarely notice or remember price drops, especially when it benefits them. This is particularly true for perishable goods such as fish, vegetables, and other similar products, which lack proper storage facilities. For instance, during favourable seasons when weather conditions and other factors influencing agricultural output align for farmers, production surges. The resulting price drops are often so severe that farmers sometimes leave unsold produce in the market or somewhere nearby, as transporting it back home and storing it for resale is not profitable. These cases of prices going down are often overlooked by the public, who are quick to focus on price hikes instead.\nPrice manipulation is nearly impossible in highly competitive markets. Take potatoes, for example. With thousands, if not millions, of sellers in the market, who can realistically believe that they all coordinate to artificially raise prices? In a competitive market, if 10 sellers agree to fix the price at Tk 60 per kilogram when the market rate is Tk 40, the first seller who notices their stock remaining unsold will lower their price. This single act would trigger a chain reaction, as other sellers follow suit. Collusion is incredibly difficult to sustain in such markets, particularly when the product being sold is uniform, offering consumers easy alternatives to switch to other sellers.\nWhen the market has many sellers, no individual seller has the power to control prices. If a seller raises prices above the market rate, consumers will immediately switch to another seller offering the same product at a lower price. The very nature of competition keeps prices in check.\nThe idea that there's a \"syndicate\" behind every price hike is not only over-simplified but also misleading. However, collusion or price-fixing may occur in industries with only a few sellers, such as in the case of imported goods if the number of importers is few. In industries with only two or three dominant importers, price manipulation becomes more feasible because it's easier for them to coordinate and set higher prices. However, this is not the norm in most markets.\nEven if we suspect foul play in the market, proving the existence of a price-fixing syndicate is not easy. It requires thorough research and, at times, pure detective work. In the US, for instance, the FBI once caught an airline CEO colluding with another CEO over the phone to fix ticket prices by phone tapping. Such investigations are rare and complex, and jumping to conclusions about syndicates without evidence can divert attention from real issues. Ultimately, price collusion is a matter of law and order, as it is a criminal offence. Countries like the US have strict antitrust laws to combat such anti-competitive behaviour. Bangladesh also has a competition commission, which is tasked with discouraging price-fixing and monopolistic practices. However, the enforcement of these laws in Bangladesh may not be as robust as needed.\nThe media also play a vital role in this issue by shaping public perception, and they must tread carefully. Every time the media declares the presence of a syndicate without proper investigation, it fuels populist rhetoric. It is easy to villainise businesses, and the public, having recently purchased goods at higher prices, will often accept this narrative without question. But the media's role is to investigate and inform\u2014not simply to echo public sentiment.\nIn the end, both the media and consumers must approach the issue of price hikes with more maturity. If every instance of rising prices is attributed to a syndicate without proper investigation, it could actually make it harder to identify the real culprits behind any genuine market manipulation cases.\nRushad Faridi, PhD, is assistant professor at the Department of Economics at the University of Dhaka.

        "full_article": "While Bangladeshis frequently express solidarity with oppressed communities around the world, the Indigenous communities of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) at times remain overlooked in their ongoing struggle for recognition and rights.\nWhile places like Cox's Bazar and Sylhet are the most visited places among tourist attractions, the CHT region has seen many tourists over the last decade. The sprawling hills and the different rivers that wind through the valleys offer views that mesmerise the eyes. Thus, it is not unfair to assume that tourist groups nowadays are considering exploring locations within the CHT for their next adventure. However, these exquisite tourist locations, such as Sajek Valley, Kaptai Lake, and Bandarban, carry the dark past of the Indigenous communities; behind all the beauty of the region, the pain of their suffering quietly lingers.\nThe Indigenous communities have experienced oppression in different forms, including arson attacks and forced evictions. For instance, on the night of February 19, 2010, arson attacks targeted 200\u00a0Pahari\u00a0households in the Baghaihat area of Sajek union in Rangamati. Furthermore, in Bandarban's Nilgiri, many Mro and Marma families from six villages were evicted to make way for resort developments. There have been countless instances of such \"land-grabbing\" cases.\nWhile these spots are spellbinding and major contributors to the tourism sector, they certainly raise questions about our morals when we visit these places; thereby, indirectly supporting this expulsion. Does exploring these places bring out the \"righteousness\" we readily claim to uphold as per our captions on social media awareness posts? Aren't we tacitly approving of these evictions? Our double standard is glaringly evident in this case. We lay significant emphasis on equality and equity, yet we almost invariably turn a blind eye to the persecution that has been going on for decades in these regions. This ignorance reflects a massive gap in awareness about these matters. Nevertheless, among young tourists\u2014a major portion of visitors to these regions\u2014there appears to be a fair level of cognisance. Despite this, the pursuit of adventures almost always supersedes moral considerations.\nIf we want to be \"morally correct,\" our actions should align with what we stand for. Thus, we should carefully weigh our decision before booking a ticket to one of these places. Well, these might prompt knee-jerk remarks like \"these spots are remarkably contributing to the tourism sector,\" which is absolutely true. Nonetheless, that is not an apt response, given the fact that we are dealing with moral principles. Morality addresses right and wrong based on ethical principles, irrespective of economic gains. The question I am asking is: whether or not these so-called \"trivial\" moral aspects should be considered. If we can stop consuming Coca-Cola for its endorsement of Israeli aggression in Palestine, the continuation of travelling to these spots solely for pleasure is, by no means, morally justifiable. Well, it's true that the situation might not change much if we stop going to these places, and no one might not effectively benefit from that. However, there are various ways through which we, as individuals, can contribute to making things better for the Indigenous communities, thereby not only staying true to our morals but also focusing on the greater good of the society.\nTo begin with, one of the easiest ways to ensure a morally responsible trip is to stay at a hotel or resort that was built on undisputed land, ensuring no displacement of the local population. Besides, we can follow the path often adopted by some adventure lovers, such as staying with the Indigenous communities in their traditional\u00a0machang\u00a0homes. These homes, built on elevated platforms, offer the best experience, providing picturesque views and a serene environment. This also gives travellers an opportunity to understand the sufferings of the Indigenous communities, fostering empathy. However, many travellers may feel unsafe, or find such arrangements inaccessible, rendering this impactable for many. Alternatively, we can integrate them into the workforce of this growing tourism sector to ensure peaceful and sustainable livelihoods for them.\nIf achieving such option is not viable, we can contribute to community-led initiatives aimed at improving the livelihoods of the Indigenous communities. While it is very easy to list all the measures that can be adopted, the ground reality is very different, and execution often poses challenges. If all else fails, and if we get the chance during our trip, we can still leave a mark by sitting with them, sharing stories, learning from their resilience, and recognising the humanity that binds us all beneath the surface.\nAzwad Bin Karim\u00a0is a content writer.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
