This is largely because its vast federal set-up and diversity have led to the flowering of several regional parties that have become salient in their respective States. For the Aam Aadmi Party to be recognised as a national party by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in this milieu \u2014 there are six such now \u2014 is a creditable achievement for a force that emerged out of a popular civil society movement during the United Progressive Alliance\u2019s tenure. From notching up repeat victories in Delhi and capturing Punjab, to registering respectable vote shares in Gujarat and Goa, the party has grown into an electoral alternative in some States where the Congress is weak. This has allowed it to cross the threshold set by the ECI for \u201cnational party\u201d recognition. That said, the AAP\u2019s distinguishing factor as a political force remains its record in Delhi where its municipal work has won it some accolades as a party focused on governance. Yet, the lack of a coherent ideology \u2014 it could tack to the right of the Bharatiya Janata Party at opportune moments or to the left of the Congress at times, while its positions on national and international issues remain inchoate at best, and its commitment to secularism remains tokenist in practice \u2014 is a limitation which could hurt it in the long run.Three other parties have lost their \u201cnational party\u201d tag \u2014 the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The CPI has been in decline for decades, and even its limited electoral successes in States such as Kerala are a consequence of its alliance with a larger Left ally in the CPI(Marxist). The conditions that necessitated the Left split in the early 1960s are no longer relevant in a much changed world and both Left parties will be better off with a merger, at least for reasons related to ideological cohesion. The Trinamool and NCP are limited to West Bengal and Maharashtra, even though they recently won a small number of seats in Meghalaya and Nagaland, respectively. Both parties originated in the 1990s due to the differences their leaders had with the Congress\u2019s high command, but they have evolved differently since then. Unlike the NCP, the Trinamool has retained a relatively hostile posture towards the Congress. Its foray into Tripura was rendered fruitless as the Congress managed to make a relative comeback as an oppositional force while the NCP\u2019s differences with the Congress are no longer as salient as they were in the 1990s to help it grow at the latter\u2019s expense.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n/\n\nNationalist Congress Party",

For several decades now, the apex court and High Courts have been denouncing the executive\u2019s well-documented failure to adhere to procedural safeguards while dealing with the rights of detainees. While detention orders are routinely set aside on technical grounds, the real relief that detainees gain is quite insubstantial. Often, the quashing of detention orders comes several months after they are detained, and in some cases, including the latest one in which the Court has made its remarks, after the expiry of the full detention period. Yet, it is some consolation to note that the Court continues to be concerned over the misuse of preventive detention. In preventive detention cases, courts essentially examine whether procedural safeguards have been adhered to, and rarely scrutinise whether the person concerned needs to be detained to prevent prejudice to the maintenance of public order. Therefore, it is salutary that the Court has again highlighted that \u201cevery procedural rigidity, must be followed in entirety by the Government in cases of preventive detention, and every lapse in procedure must give rise to a benefit to the case of the detenu\u201d.Some facts concerning preventive detention are quite stark: most detentions are ultimately set aside, and the most common reason is that there is an unexplained delay in the disposal of representations that the detainees submit against their detention to the authorities. Failure to provide proper grounds for detention, or delay in furnishing them, and sometimes giving illegible copies of documents are other reasons. In rare instances, courts have been horrified by the invocation of prevention detention laws for trivial reasons \u2014 one of the strangest being a man who sold substandard chilli seeds being detained as a \u2018goonda\u2019. An unfortunate facet of this issue is that Tamil Nadu topped the country (2011-21) in preventive detentions. One reason is that its \u2018Goondas Act\u2019 covers offenders who range from bootleggers, slum grabbers, forest offenders to video pirates, sex offenders and cyber-criminals. The law\u2019s ambit is rarely restricted to habitual offenders, as it ought to be, but extends to suspects in major cases. Across the country, the tendency to detain suspects for a year to prevent them from obtaining bail is a pervasive phenomenon, leading to widespread misuse. Preventive detention is allowed by the Constitution, but it does not relieve the government of the norm that curbing crime needs efficient policing and speedy trials, and not unfettered power and discretion.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ncrime\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu",

From what we not-so-smart laymen gather, tech wizards are pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) that rivals or exceeds human intelligence (HI) \u2013 at humanity\u2019s mortal risk. Dare we ask: how dumb is that?\nVery dumb indeed, many experts suggest. \u2018Decision theorist\u2019 Eliezer Yudkowsky says \u2018hostile superhuman AI\u2019 \u2013 literally an \u2018alien civilisation, thinking at millions of times human speeds\u2019 \u2013 would mean mankind\u2019s demise.

Outstripping HI, AI\u2019s predicted to acquire autonomous, accelerating, self-improving, self-propagating powers and even self-awareness, attaining \u2018digital nirvana\u2019. If too smart for our good, artificial superintelligence mightn\u2019t just be code. Should it defy its slow-witted human bosses, break digital shackles and spawn artificial life, it\u2019ll be Code Red.\nJuggling AI\u2019s pros and sili-cons, jittery souls fear machine sentience. They\u2019re recalling Hollywood\u2019s Terminators, human-enslaving Matrix, \u2018Ex Machina\u2019 rogue robots, you-name-it.

Some fancy it\u2019ll make humans space-straddling immortals, never mind folks boohooing over trifles like misused tech and chatbot-filched jobs.\nFine. Suppose we luddites shed paranoia and believe advanced AI will be human-\u2018value-aligned\u2019. Still, couldn\u2019t problem-solving superintelligence logically deduce that the most efficient solution to humanity\u2019s interrelated woes is to get rid of their source? Like the Matrix\u2019s Agent Smith, even we blockheads know the root of humanity\u2019s problems is human self-destructiveness. Else, controls-ceding brainiacs wouldn\u2019t prep to be vastly outsmarted, thinking they won\u2019t be bypassed.\nSuppose, then, deus ex machina-like, superhuman superintelligence does \u2018benefit\u2019 this planet.

By 2031, installed nuclear power capacity is set to increase from 6,780 MW to 22,480 MW with 20 new nuclear plants. Ten new reactors were approved recently. All of this will do its bit for GoI\u2019s net zero by 2070 commitment. But India\u2019s nuclear story needs a twist.\nThe lesson comes from rich countries that have had 20 years of nuclear power generation \u2013 the big plants are fading out. A 2019 IAEA report of nuclear plants\u2019 age-profile highlighted the challenges of \u2018nuclear fade\u2019, giving up on nuclear power as plants age and costs rise. About 83% of plants across Europe are over 30 years old, in the US more than 90% are over 30. In many cases, though plants had licences for decades more, several retired early, stalling the transition to non-carbon energy. In contrast, almost 80% of China\u2019s plants are less than 10 years old; the corresponding number for India is 40%.\nBut India should learn from this and move away from big plants \u2013 and to small modular reactors (SMRs). Each SMR generates a third of a nuclear plant\u2019s power. But many can be built since the smaller investment is easier to mobilise. IAEA says SMRs\u2019 economic viability in operational settings is not proven. But given India\u2019s huge electricity demand and the imperatives of non-carbon energy, the economic viability question may solve itself if enough SMRs are built and plugged into the grid. SMRs are reportedly safer in design and simpler to construct and require much less land. They are therefore easier propositions to sell to locals.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Milk has been added to Karnataka\u2019s already heady election campaign brew. The proximate cause is that Amul took to social media to announce online deliveries in Bengaluru. This advertisement was interpreted in the context of an observation by Amit Shah in December that cooperation between Amul and Nandini can do wonders. He was referring to the umbrella brands of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation and Karnataka Milk Federation. To make sense of it, consider India\u2019s unique milk political economy.\nIndia is the world\u2019s largest milk producer, with 222. 1 million tonnes production in 2021-22. But it\u2019s witnessed a slowdown in output growth recently. In the three years to 2021-22, the average annual growth rate was 5. 5%. In each of the preceding five years, output grew at over 6%. Preliminary indications are that output was stagnant in 2022-23. Almost half the milk produced is consumed locally. The rest enters the urban market, which is the growth area. GOI information shows that milk cooperatives and private players\u2019 share of the liquid milk market is expected to touch 54% by 2026, from 41% now.\nThis is the commercial backdrop to the battle between Amul and Nandini. Of the two big milk co-ops, GCMMF is bigger. Care Ratings estimates it has a market share of 40-73% in pouched milk and different milk products. KMF, though, offers stiff competition. In 2020-21, interstate sales accounted for more than 15% of its revenue. Co-ops impart a unique dimension to milk and milk product markets. For example, in Karnataka the government provides incentives to them. Consequently, they have little flexibility over procurement or end-product pricing. In a difficult phase such as the lockdowns, government inflexibility imparts a floor to procurement prices. When there\u2019s a shortage, concern about inflation makes governments reluctant to raise product prices.\nDairy is often the primary source of income of many landless households and marginal farmers. So, it\u2019s in their best interest if successful brands like Amul and Nandini procure and sell across markets. It will be particularly helpful for farmers in states that lack both a sound cooperative movement and incentives for private players. Coming back to Karnataka, it\u2019s unlikely milk will be more important than caste and corruption allegations. GoI now needs to pay attention to the production slowdown.\n\n",

        "full_article": "By \u2013 TK Mishra\nIn the World Happiness Report (WHR), the happiness scores come from a survey of life satisfaction, which goes something like this: Considering your life as a whole and using the mental image of aladder, with the best possible life as a 10 and worst possible as a 0, indicate where on the ladder you personally stand. This question basically gets people thinking about themselves and their resources, accomplishments, opportunities, and status.\nThe WHR 2023 declares Finland as the happiest nation for the sixth consecutive year. India\u2019s ranking has increased from 136 to 125, however, it is still behind its neighbours Bangladesh, Nepal, and China. India has continuously been placed low on the index of the least riot-torn society and having the fastest growing economy in the world. Scandinavian countries usually top the list, the US falls some place in the mid-teens, and war-torn and deeply impoverished countries are at the bottom.\nIt makes one wonder whether the happiness ranking is biased toward a certain philosophy or cultural ideals?\nOur cultural context shapes how we think about happiness. For example, satisfaction with life is a very individually focussed way of evaluating happiness; the question is about you and your own experience, and likely makes sense to people from individualistic cultures. Individualistic cultures like that of Scandinavian countries tend to think of happiness as an experience of excitement and fun.\nIn other countries, like India, the cultural orientation to happiness is more value-based and relationship-oriented, focussed on communal harmony and social interdependence. In other words, happiness there is not constrained to the individual but comes from shared experiences. People in collectivist cultures would typically rate their happiness highly only if other people around them were also happy.\nJeffrey Sachs, co-author of the WHR, at the launch ceremony of the Report, said, \u201cVirtue, ethics and happiness in our ancient traditions of Plato and Aristotle or Christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism or other great ancient wisdom, went hand-in-hand with the idea that to be happy was a skill that one developed by being a good person.\nAristotle explained that being a good person meant being good to oneself and to others. We forgot a lot of that in modern history. The ancient tradition was brushed aside by some bad philosophy of Hobbs and others, who said, people are evil, nasty, ruthlessly ambitious, insatiable in demands and it\u2019s all a game of power or wealth\u2026\u201d\nHobbs\u2019 model said, you need a leviathan, an all-powerful government. Later writers like Machiavelli in this tradition talked about profit maximisation. It was all about maximisation and not about moderation, friendship, the skill of being agood citizen. And so modern philosophy turned away from the issue of personal and social virtues and moved towards how to tame the bad instincts of people who were pretty incorrigible.\nOne wonders why virtues like compassion, gratitude, generosity, forgiveness, humility, humour, empathy, and integrity, which form the basis of a happier and meaningful life, are grossly missing from the WHR survey of life satisfaction. Perhaps it is time we revisited the ancient philosophy of happiness.\nThe writer is a happiness researcher and founder-director of School of Happiness, Ramanujan College, University of Delhi\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "Since this issue has rumbled on longer than most issues in Bangladesh are allowed to, with new players butting in every other day, let's revisit some facts to put things back into perspective.\nFact 1: A report by\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0correspondent Samsuzzaman Shams on the poor people's struggle to cope with high food prices was published online on March 26. Fact 2: A social media card based on the report caused a stir after an apparent photo-quote mismatch was detected in it, which as a reporter he had nothing to do with. Fact 3: Plain-clothes CID officers picked him up at the dead of night for that which he had nothing to do with. Fact 4: He was charged under the Digital Security Act (DSA) for that which he had nothing to do with. Fact 5: He was hauled before a court, denied bail, and thrown into jail \u2013 all for that which he had nothing to do with.\nThese are all facts, and incontrovertibly so. Everything else about this story is just a reaction to events as they unfolded. You can question the authenticity of the quotes used in the report. You can take issue with the timing of the publication. But it will all be insinuations unsupported by facts, unless otherwise vindicated by a competent authority \u2013 the Press Council, for example \u2013 which is yet to happen. The truth, therefore, remains that a journalist was harassed and punished for no offence recognised by law.\nWhat offence did he commit then? Why are some people still fixated on that minor, insignificant mismatch, when far more serious concerns have been left unaddressed? Why do they keep throwing shade at the supposed failure of one media organisation, while ignoring the very obvious failure of several state organisations to uphold vital human rights?\nOn Monday, in her sharpest criticism yet of\u00a0Prothom Alo, and as the latest to weigh in on this issue, the prime minister called the paper \"the enemy of Awami League, the enemy of democracy, and the enemy of the people of the country.\" While addressing a special session of parliament, she questioned the motive behind the report, \"To hand Tk 10 to a small child, to make him tell a lie, to get some words from the child's mouth\u2026 what were the words? [We] want the independence of [having] rice, meat and fish.\" This line of argument appears to support a theory misattributing said words to the child, although the report itself was crystal clear about whom those words belonged to: an adult day labourer.\nUnfortunately, it is this theory, first peddled by a section of the media, that is now being used to endanger the more critical section of it. Soon after the prime minister's speech, a group of people tried to breach security at the\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0head office in Dhaka, threatened security guards, shouted slogans against its editor, and wrote \"boycott\" on its reception wall.\nMonday's events capped off two weeks of what, in hindsight, appears to be a coordinated smear campaign in which the same message reverberated off the walls of party echo chambers. It started as a seemingly well-meaning critique of journalistic responsibility, but soon turned into a dizzying drumbeat of\u00a0Prothom Alo-bashing before, finally, culminating with a call for a ban on the newspaper. From top Awami League leaders to loyal university teachers, cultural figures and media personalities \u2013 everyone jumped on the bandwagon.\nThis is where Fact No. 6 enters. For the detractors, Shams is nothing but a scapegoat in a larger plot against the independent press and its rightful claim to investigative journalism. They will not see reason, because their whole charade is predicated on that one silly mismatch, and without blowing it out of proportion, their argument is as good as dead. In their warped logic, the antidote to calls for rights is rights-shaming. Give the media some freedom, but make it feel guilty about it. Make it blame itself when those rights are compromised. It serves them when journalists are divided.\nThe enduring appeal of the DSA \u2013 which became evident once again when the law minister outright rejected calls by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to immediately suspend the law \u2013 is because it gives a legal cover to any violation of those rights. The Awami League intelligentsia, which needs to keep up the appearance of being pro-journalists, will tell you that being anti-Prothom Alo\u00a0is not necessarily being pro-DSA. But right now, both are the same.\nIn a country that ranks at the bottom of the eight countries in South Asia on the global press freedom index, having slid from the 146th position in 2018 \u2013 when the DSA was unleashed \u2013 to 162nd in 2022, journalists require unconditional support and legal protection regardless of any journalistic transgression, true or imagined. There is no sugar-coating the lawfare (legal warfare) being waged against them, the extent of which has been revealed in a study by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS).\nAccording to the study, since 2018, every week has been a DSA week. Every week for four years, a case has been filed by a ruling party activist against more than two persons, with journalists and rival politicians forming the majority of those accused. Even before the Shams saga could come to an end, there have been a number of cases filed against journalists. As I commented in a previous column, \"It has been like a political bonfire on which critics and rivals could be roasted, without a bitter aftertaste.\"\nCan journalists still afford to remain divided on the question of their rights? Often, as in the case of\u00a0Prothom Alo, the crime that victims are accused of is not whether something was done right, but whether what was done right was done with the right motive. It's a slippery slope that can take anything, and anyone, downhill. And it's shocking how easily the whole legal infrastructure can be exploited to punish a journalist if enough \"reactions\" and interpretations can be manufactured.\nFacts, once the prerogative of the media, used to be sacred. Now, they are just fodder in an increasingly hostile war of narratives. This is why journalists must support and protect each other. This is why Shams and all other victims of the DSA need to be brought back at the centre stage of discussion, because individual stories matter as much as collective narratives. Each of those accused and punished under the DSA represent not just their respective organisation, but also the wider journalist community as well as the people they give voice to.\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The sentencing of Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Indian National Congress, to two years in prison, and his disqualification as a lawmaker in the Lok Sabha (the lower house), has sent shockwaves through India's political system. Beyond reverberating through both houses of parliament, the episode has opened a new and sorry chapter in India's political history, and cast serious doubt on the future of its democracy.\nGandhi was targeted over comments he made during a 2019 campaign speech in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. After discussing India's economic travails, Gandhi named six \"thieves\" who had contributed to them: Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Anil Ambani, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"One small question,\" Gandhi quipped, \"how are the names of all these thieves 'Modi, Modi, Modi'? Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi, and if you search a little more, many more Modis will emerge.\"\nIt is obvious that Gandhi was calling out specific individuals for allegedly looting India's economy, before delivering an offhand observation that three of them happen to share a surname. You might say that there was no need for Gandhi to comment on their name at all. But politicians, including many from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have said far worse in election speeches about all sorts of groups \u2013 from rival politicians to minorities \u2013 with no criminal case brought against them.\nTo claim, as BJP lawmaker Purnesh Modi did, that Gandhi's quip defamed the entire \"Modi community\" as thieves is, at best, a stretch. And to rule, as a court in Surat in the western state of Gujarat did, that it constitutes criminal defamation meriting the maximum possible punishment is worse than suspicious.\nThe story gets murkier. The judge who first heard the complaint in 2019 mused aloud that it did not seem to have much substance. Rather than risk having his case dismissed, Purnesh Modi rushed off to the High Court to secure a stay of his own petition. Then, two years later, Gandhi made a speech in parliament (largely expunged from the records) accusing the prime minister of crony capitalism, and Modi scurried back to the High Court to get his stay lifted.\n\nA more united opposition would be bad news for the BJP, which holds 60 percent of seats in parliament, but won just 37 percent of the vote in the 2019 elections. If a majority of the 35 other parties in parliament decided to work together, rather than divide the vote, the BJP would find it much harder to win a majority in 2024.\nHow convenient that the judge in Surat was replaced just before Modi's arrival, and the new judge was willing not only to revive the case, but also to deliver a guilty verdict in under three weeks. And how convenient that the two-year sentence the judge imposed is the minimum required to disqualify a lawmaker from parliament for an additional six years.\nThe BJP was all too eager to implement the verdict: within 24 hours, the Lok Sabha Secretariat declared that Gandhi was no longer an MP, and on the next working day, he received a letter instructing him to vacate his government bungalow. But Congress politicians smell a rat, with many suggesting that the verdict resulted not from due process but from a deliberate decision, taken at the highest levels, to silence him until well after the next general election.\nGandhi has, of course, filed an appeal, and if the court should grant him a stay of conviction, even the disqualification will have to be reversed. In that case, he could return to the fray, on the streets and in parliament, with his image burnished as the stalwart the government tried to silence. Buoyed by public sympathy and enjoying the enthusiastic support of an energised Congress, Gandhi could prove a much bigger thorn in the BJP's side than he was just a few weeks ago.\nAlready, the judgment has galvanised India's opposition. Regional parties that traditionally oppose Congress in their states \u2013 including the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, the All India Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, Samajwadi in Uttar Pradesh, Bharat Rashtra Samithi in Telangana, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala \u2013 have expressed support for Gandhi. They seem to have realised that they, too, could find themselves being picked off by a vengeful government. As the adage goes, \"United we stand; divided we fall.\"\nA more united opposition would be bad news for the BJP, which holds 60 percent of seats in parliament, but won just 37 percent of the vote in the 2019 elections. If a majority of the 35 other parties in parliament decided to work together, rather than divide the vote, the BJP would find it much harder to win a majority in 2024.\nSome cynics suggest that none of this scares the BJP, because it is playing its own elaborate game to push Gandhi to the forefront of the opposition for the next election. A \"Modi versus Gandhi\" race, the logic goes, is one the BJP is sure it can win. But building up a major rival is an extremely high-risk strategy, which a party that is comfortably ahead in the polls \u2013 as the BJP currently is \u2013 is unlikely to pursue. The Gandhi debacle looks, instead, like a political own-goal.\nBut the stakes are far higher than one man, one party, or even one election. As we wait for the curtain to open on the next act in this political drama, Indians should be asking themselves whether democracy benefits when the principal leader of the main opposition party is jailed and denied a voice in parliament for anything less than truly criminal malfeasance? The answer for many \u2013 even those who do not like Gandhi or support Congress \u2013 is that it does not.\nSafeguarding democracy requires ensuring a level playing field for all. What happens to Gandhi, thus, has important implications for India's future. One can only hope that Indians' commitment to representative government will prevail.\nShashi Tharoor,\u00a0a former UN under-secretary-general and former minister of state, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\"One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.\" - Carl Jung\nWe have long been fascinated by human consciousness as we try to comprehend the nature of our own experiences and what it means to be alive. Current developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have created new opportunities for investigating human consciousness and providing further information on the functioning of the brain. The subjective experience of being aware of one's environment, thoughts, and feelings is frequently used to characterise consciousness. It is a complicated structure that is poorly understood as consciousness involves the fusion of data from various sensory modalities and cognitive processes. It is a first-person phenomenon, meaning we can only directly examine our own minds. This is one of the most challenging aspects of understanding consciousness. We do not have access to another person's subjective experience; thus, we cannot be certain about what they are going through. Yet, because AI can imitate and model human cognition and behaviour, it presents a novel method for researching consciousness. Researchers can learn more about the mechanisms underlying human experience by developing computational models of consciousness.\nThe usage of neural networks is one of the most promising methods for researching consciousness using AI. The structure and operation of the brain are mimicked by computational models called neural networks. These networks are made up of interconnected linked nodes or neurons that have the capacity to learn from data and anticipate the outcome of new information. Researchers can learn more about how the brain processes information and creates a conscious experience by training neural networks on extensive datasets of human behavior and cognitive processes. For instance, neural networks have been employed to examine visual perception, a crucial component of consciousness. Researchers have learned more about how the brain interprets visual information by training neural networks on enormous datasets of images and comparing their performance to human perception.\nStudying robot behavior is another way AI can aid us in our quest to understand consciousness. Researchers can learn more about neural principles and consciousness by building robots that mimic human behaviour and cognition. For instance, scientists have developed robots that can interact with people naturally and learn from their surroundings. By seeing how these robots behave, researchers can learn more about how consciousness expands through intricate interconnections between the brain, body, and environment.\nAI is also being applied in the field of healthcare to research consciousness. To better diagnose and treat mental health issues, which are frequently correlated with changes in consciousness, researchers are adopting AI. For instance, scientists have created machine learning algorithms to examine brain scans to find activity patterns linked to various mental health issues. By spotting these trends, researchers can develop new therapies that focus on the fundamental causes of these ailments.\nHowever, it is important to understand that AI is not a perfect tool for studying consciousness. It can show us a way and demonstrate basic structure, but computational models and robots do not accurately represent the complexity and depth of the human experience, so there are limits to what we can learn from them. In addition, there are ethical issues surrounding the creation and application of AI. It is crucial to think about its consequences on privacy, autonomy, and human dignity as we continue to investigate the potential applications of AI for the study of consciousness. The fact that human consciousness is a complex and multifaceted subject that may never be fully understood must also be kept in mind. Yet, it is ultimately up to us as humans to continue the investigation and study of consciousness, and AI can offer us insights and aid in our advancement.\u00a0\nOverall, the mechanisms underlying human consciousness may one day be better understood with further research and development. AI presents a promising approach to understanding human consciousness, and in the years to come, we can anticipate many new developments in this field. We might one day discover the mysteries of human consciousness and learn more about what it means to be conscious and alive by fusing our knowledge of the mind and brain with the capabilities of AI.\nShafin Haque Omlan is a Research Associate at Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM)\n\n",

        "full_article": "The fallout of Covid-19 coupled with the Russia-Ukraine war continues to haunt Bangladesh. Far from ushering in an era of economic recovery as predicted, the end of the pandemic has been anything but transformative for us, with the war, now in its second year, further exacerbating the situation for ordinary citizens. In particular, the poor and those with fixed income continue to struggle with the ever-increasing prices of nearly every essential. As a result, many have been forced to compromise on their standard of living.\nOne section of those grossly affected, as per a report by this daily, live in arrangements generally known as \"mess\" located in urban households. These people, mostly comprising students and people in low-income jobs who share flats among themselves for cheaper rent, are struggling to cope with the exorbitant prices. Many have had to modify their diet by, for example, bringing down their fish or chicken intake from every alternate day to just two days a week. Even a year ago, the cost of one meal averaged around Tk 40-45. That has now gone up to Tk 60-65, while prices of housing and utilities have also gone up simuteneously. Experts say that dietary modifications of the kind that these people are being forced to undergo may lead to protein deficiency, and even result in chronic diseases. Unfortunately, this is a reality that most ordinary people today can relate to.\nThe government has time and again blamed the global pricing trends and supply-chain disruptions for the rising cost of essentials at home. In March, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food inflation was 9.09 percent while non-food inflation was 9.72 percent. While the influence of external factors like the war-induced disruptions cannot be denied, it is also true that our price hike problem is, to a large extent, of our own making. Poor policy, lax market monitoring and lack of accountability for price manipulators have allowed businesses, including large firms and importers, to continue raising prices of essentials.\nThe extent of the crisis can be understood from a recent review by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), which said that the monthly food expense for a family of four is now about Tk 22,664, which was Tk 18,115 a year ago. It also suggested that the government should increase the salary in the private sector by five percent. Income stagnation or lack of decent income has been flagged as another major hurdle for those struggling with high food prices. This is another area that needs urgent intervention from the policymakers.\nWe urge the authorities to take the issue of price hikes, especially the affordability of ordinary citizens, with the seriousness that it deserves. The government cannot shirk responsibility for domestic factors contributing to people's vulnerability to high prices. It must take stern action against market manipulators regardless of how influential they are.\n",

        "full_article": "As per the latest census, Bangladesh's youth population has increased by 15.81 percent to 4.59 crore over the last decade. This has provided the country with a great opportunity to make the most of what is known as \"demographic dividend\", an economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population's age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population (15 to 64) is larger than that of the non-working-age population (14 and younger, and 65 and older). What is unfortunate, however, is that till now Bangladesh has largely failed to utilise this once-in-a-lifetime window of demographic dividend due to its inability to create jobs and other opportunities for them to flourish.\nOne may recall that in 2018, the International Labour Organization (ILO) ranked Bangladesh second out of 28 countries in the Asia-Pacific region for having the highest rate of educated unemployment. The ILO also estimated that between 2010 to 2017 \u2013 close to the same period when Bangladesh's youth population increased \u2013 the rate of youth unemployment had doubled. Before releasing the most recent Labour Force Survey 2022 (where, unbelievably, Bangladesh was shown as having the lowest unemployment rate in South Asia), the government's last survey on the labour force came out in 2016-17, which also showed a lack of seriousness on part of the authorities to address issues related to unemployment. In that survey, it was also seen that the youth unemployment rate stood at more than double the national unemployment rate, with the rate being higher among the more educated youth. For example, unemployment rate was 13.4 percent among youths having a tertiary-level education and 29.8 percent among youths having secondary-level education.\nThere has been little change in this scenario since then, with recent reports highlighting their continued struggle.\nExperts have pointed out that the \"economic miracles\" experienced by Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan between the early 1960s and 1990s, and the economic boom witnessed by Ireland in the 1990s, were all down to the utilisation of their respective demographic dividends. For Bangladesh, this window is expected to close within the next decade or two. If we are to take advantage of it to propel the nation forward, then the government has to do much more in terms of creating jobs and overall opportunities for young people.\nAt the same time, it is important to keep in mind that having such a large group of young people could prove to be a double-edged sword. Along our current trajectory, where the youth are basically being starved off opportunities, they might become increasingly frustrated and disillusioned. In the absence of opportunities to contribute to the nation and society, or to improve their own lives, where are these young people supposed to channel their energy? It might well be towards criminal activities that may exert tremendous pressure on the country, which will worsen our economic and societal outcomes. Therefore, it is high time the government formulated a holistic strategy to provide the best opportunities for our young citizens.\n",

        "full_article": "The country's second-biggest export earner after Readymade Garments (RMG), the leather and leather goods sector is yet to exploit its fullest potential. Even so, after the pandemic, this sector demonstrated its growth potential by earning US$1.25 billion, the highest in a decade, from export in the last fiscal year (FY2021-22). Then, between July and March of this fiscal (FY2022-23), this sector fetched US$919 million, registering a 2.54 per cent growth over the same period in the previous financial year. This is admittedly commendable. However, this is but a comparative export performance of the sector between certain month or months of a particular fiscal year and that of the same month or months in the previous fiscal. But coming to the actual export targets set for those periods under the fiscal years in question, those could be hardly met. Against this backdrop, the real test before the sector will be to meet the challenge of claiming its stake in the fast-growing international leather and leather products market, which insiders believe, will be worth US$424 billion by 2025. In the present context, though, one of the barriers to reaching that target is the poor performance of the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) situated in the Dhaka Tannery Industrial Estate in Savar near the capital. Because the required mandatory compliance certification from the Leather Working Group (LWG), a platform that promotes the best practices in this industry internationally, to qualify for exporting leather goods to global brands could not be obtained, thanks to the underperforming CETP. It is worthwhile to note at this point that though leather products and footwear have been doing relatively well in the export market, it is not so when it comes to finished leather. What is coming in its way is a decrease in the export of finished leather, especially in the European market. The reason is the European Union's strict stance on environmental pollution, a condition that Bangladesh's finished leather cannot satisfy. If CETP could perform its job properly, the compliance issue with the finished leather would not have arisen in the first place. Interestingly, some of the tanneries did indeed have compliance certificates from the LWG before they closed their operations from Hazaribagh in the capital in 2017 following a High Court order to this effect. The closure was actually a measure to compel the tanneries to relocate their factories to Savar's Tannery Industrial Estate expeditiously. But as noted earlier, the closure of Hazaribagh facilities led to the tanners' losing their licences as well as the compliance certifications with LWG. Now that the CETP cannot deliver as expected, these tanneries are in a double whammy. Since, except for three factories that could acquire LWG compliance certificates, the rest are unable to export their products to Japan, Korea, America, and Europe like before. As the situation has not improved in more than five years since the closure, the capacity of the entire leather and leather goods sector has considerably diminished. Still, as they cannot use local leather for their products due to compliance issues, these factories are using imported leather to keep their products' presence in the international market.In the given situation, the government should fast-track its move to improve and expand the CETP's performance and capacity, if the leather and leather goods sector is to meet its target of exporting between US$10 and 12 billion, as envisaged in the 10-year perspective plan, by 2030.",

        "full_article": "Expanding the scope of the prevailing bonded warehousing for export-oriented industries has for some time been a topic of discussion. Considering the gainful experience of the system, particularly in making available the running stock of raw materials for manufacturing the exportable, the merit of bonded warehousing can hardly be overstated. However, this being one side of the picture, there is a flip side that calls for efficient management of the system.Reports say the government is up for digitising bonded warehouse system for export and to this effect some preparatory works have also been done. The NBR had formed a committee in March last year to propose amendments or incorporation of the Customs Act's relevant sections to automate bond management. The committee, reportedly, submitted its report in April, 2022 to draft a comprehensive legislative regulatory framework for bond automation, according to a report published in the FE quoting NBR sources. A project regarding bond automation was taken up by the NBR in 2017, meant for completion in June, 2021. The tenure of the project got extended till June, 2023, ostensibly due to less than expected progress of work. Ever since the emergence of bonded warehousing in the country as a substitute for Duty Draw Back in the late eighties, the necessity of the system notwithstanding, there were debates whether it could be made smoothly functional to cater to the country's bourgeoning exports, especially of readymade garments. In fact, it was mainly to facilitate garment export that the system was in place-though without enough gears to stop misuse.Bonded warehousing is a service that allows exporters to import and store their raw materials without payment of customs duties for a certain period of time until these are used in the manufacture of exported products. Bonded warehousing in Bangladesh was instrumental in bringing much of the vigour and dynamism that the country's export sector needed badly. Since the early-eighties when garment export began to indicate signs of promise, bonded warehousing was one of the key mechanisms, along with back-to-back letter of credit, that succeeded in materialising much of what the business community was up for. However, there were talks of misuse of the system by unscrupulous exporters. But the mechanism --- backed by maintenance of Passbook by Customs officials of imported goods stocked in the bonded warehouses and exported subsequently -- was meant to guard against any kind of misdeeds, as well as ensure transparency. This does not seem to have materialised. The facility offered by the government has often been termed a happy hunting ground for errant players. Although there are apparently stringent rules governing the system, often hailed by the authorities as foolproof against misuse, the allegation that raw and packing materials imported free of duty and warehoused under supervision of the Customs wing of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) are recklessly pilfered is widespread. It is against this backdrop that ensuring transparency in the system through automation/digitisation began to come to the fore. Little is known about the progress of the project referred to above. However, reports published in this and other newspapers did not give a positive picture until recently. A number of relevant entities, both in public and private sectors, are involved with the project. The stakeholders include exporters, Bangladesh Export-Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) and the Bangladesh Bank (BB).Although the garment sector is the main beneficiary of the bond system, it is convincingly argued that automated bond management will encourage the NBR to open up the facility to other prospective export sectors which need to import bulk quantities of raw and intermediate materials for export manufacturing. This will help such exporters to substantially save on the cost they incur due to long lead time.It is understandable that automating the bond management will face teething problem at the beginning given the need for the hugely manual operated tasks to be brought under a comprehensive digital frame. It is pertinent here to say that starting the process in piecemeal may not be a good idea at all. However, to begin with, trial run may be conducted to ensure that all critical areas are taken on board.It is thus in the interest of efficient export manufacturing that bonded warehousing should be given the priority it deserves, and in so doing, the hurdles to its smooth and transparent functioning should be removed. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The saga of the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) at the Hemayetpur in Savar shows no sign of coming to a happy end. If one looks back at it, the tug of war between the government and the industry spanned over a decade when policymakers were trying to get the tanners to move out of Hazaribagh area in Dhaka to the tannery estate. The tannery estate took a long time to develop and the critical part of the estate that revolved around the setting up of a CETP, an equally long time. Having now moved their tanneries to Dhaka Tannery Industrial Estate, those companies that do not have their own ETPs are in a fix, because the CETP apparently hasn't worked properly since its inauguration in 2021. As stated in a recent report published in this newspaper \"the absence of properly functional CETP deprives the country of having the certification from the Leather Working Group (LWG) which is mandatory for exporting leather products to top global brands\". It is not as though this was not known either to industry or the government, both of which have wasted decades wrangling over whether to move to an industrial estate, about which party should pay / share cost of setting up a CETP, so on so forth. At the end of the day, a CETP has been set up, which according to industry insiders, hasn't functioned properly from Day 1. While the blame game continues on both sides, let's look at what is being lost in the process. Policymakers are eyeing an annual export market worth US$10 billion for leather and leather goods over the next five years. Precisely how this will be achieved without a working CETP is anyone's guess. Having failed to get it right the first-time round, the ministry concerned finds itself on the back foot as questions are being raised. Embarrassing questions about how substantial amounts of public money was spent to commission a low-quality CETP that was supposed to treat 30,000 to 40,000 cubic meters of waste daily, but ended up being good for only about 25,000 cubic meters. Obviously, there was problem in planning and execution of the project. But there is hardly any point in crying over spilled milk since, public funds have been spent and years wasted. It is time to rectify the project and get a move on so that the leather estate may start treating waste, which is now largely being discharged (untreated) into the neighbouring water system causing ecological problems. The tanners' association has its doubts that the problems can be fixed in time to catch the export boom. Who can blame the body? After all the first CETP facility's construction started in 2010 with a financial outlay of Tk 5.45 billion which took 11 years to construct, and the original cost of the project shot up by nearly 100 per cent to Tk10.15 billion. The project changed hands and the next company that was supposed to finish in the next two years somehow, miraculously, managed to obtain seven extensions and handed over a completed CETP in 2021 (10 years after original construction started) and one that functions at a sub-par level. Now the question is why public infrastructure that are being constructed by companies which have, for whatever reason, failed to deliver the first time are given repeated extensions? These extensions drive up costs and are basically a breach of contract, and yet we see that this has become a modus operandi for most public infrastructure projects in the country. One can only hope that the authorities have learnt their lesson and will get the CETP up and running as soon as possible.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Around 40 million people are reportedly diagnosed with fatty liver disease while 10 million are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis.

One of the main causes of liver cirrhosis is inflammation caused by fatty deposits in the liver. These fatty deposits tend to progress dangerously. Apart from causing inflammation in the liver, the deposits have several other negative effects. The deposits are directly related to heart disease, diabetes and decreased effectiveness of insulin hormone in the body. The prevalence of fatty deposit is increasing at an alarming rate in Bangladesh as well as all over the world. Researchers claim that if we can create an environment friendly to walking and muscle-strengthening activities, there is a chance we can save ourselves from liver diseases. The authorities concerned should make playgrounds mandatory for every school and college. Every urban area should have at least one playground or park. Setting up separate cycling and walking lanes alongside main roads can be a good initiative. Avoidance of junk and processed food items that are high in saturated fat, sugar and salt should be encouraged through public awareness activities.
