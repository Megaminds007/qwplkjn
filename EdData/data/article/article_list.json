        "full_article": "Forty years after holding that the mode of executing prisoners by hanging cannot be termed too cruel or barbaric, the Supreme Court of India has now ventured to find out if there is a more dignified and less painful method to carry out death sentences. The idea of finding an alternative mode of execution, one considered less painful and involves little cruelty, has been part of the wider debate on whether the death penalty should be abolished. Judicial and administrative thinking have leaned towards backing both the idea of capital punishment and the practice of hanging. The Bench has sought fresh data to substantiate the argument that a more humane means of execution can be found. There are two leading judgments on the issue \u2014 Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab (1980), which upheld the death penalty, but limited it to the \u2018rarest of rare cases\u2019, and Deena Dayal vs Union of India And Others (1983), which upheld the method by ruling that hanging is \u201cas painless as possible\u201d and \u201ccauses no greater pain than any other known method\u201d. The 35th Report of the Law Commission (1967) had noted that while electrocution, use of a gas chamber and lethal injection were considered by some to be less painful, it was not in a position to come to a conclusion. It refrained from recommending any change.Even though the Supreme Court has not favoured abolition, it has developed a robust and humane jurisprudence that has made it difficult for the executive to carry out death sentences. It has restricted its use to the \u2018rarest of rare cases\u2019, mandated a balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances before sending someone to the gallows, and allowed a post-appeal review hearing in open court. At the same time, it has evolved a clemency jurisprudence that makes decisions on mercy petitions justiciable and penalises undue delay in disposing of mercy pleas by commuting death sentences to life. The question now before the Court provides yet another opportunity to humanise its approach further. Empirical evidence suggests that hanging need not result in an early or painful death, while there is a body of proof that shows electrocution and lethal injection have their own forms of cruelty. The Union government contends that hanging should be retained, not only because it is not cruel or inhuman but also because it accounts for the least number of botched-up executions. The real issue, however, is that any form of execution is a fall from humaneness, offends human dignity and perpetrates cruelty. Debating the mode only deepens the moral dilemma of whether the taking of life is the best response to the taking of life. If eliminating cruelty and indignity is the aim, abolition is the answer.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ndeath penalty policies\n\n/\n\nprison",

        "full_article": "The influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made public its final \u2018Synthesis\u2019 report, which is part of the Sixth Assessment Cycle. Since 1990, when the IPCC began publicising its compilation of global scientific research linking greenhouse gas emissions with changes in weather and climate, the evidence that human actions are nudging the world closer to irreversible cataclysms has only grown stronger. The IPCC\u2019s various assessment cycles have played a significant role in it. There is little by way of new information in the latest report that was made public after weeklong deliberations at Interlaken, Switzerland. This is because it is a synthesis of reports that since 2018 have not only bolstered the human link in warming but also analysed, from multiple angles, the implications of not meeting the 2015 Paris Agreement, of endeavouring to keep temperatures from rising 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial times.The report stresses the need for finance to flow from developed countries to developing countries and the need to compensate countries that are poised to lose the most from climate change, to help them build resilience. In a summary for policymakers, the latest synthesis report says that the planet\u2019s best chance to keep temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C is to ensure greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to 48% of 2019 levels by 2030 and 99% by 2050. Currently, the policies declared by countries collectively, if implemented entirely, are poised to see temperatures rise 2.5\u00b0C to 3.2\u00b0C by 2100. The latest report may weigh in significantly at the next session of the Conference of Parties scheduled in Dubai in November where a Global Stocktake \u2014 countries laying out what they have so far done to achieve commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement \u2014 is likely to be the highlight of proceedings. The IPCC reports have generally been viewed as a portent of doom but the current report also talks about the falling cost of solar and wind power, and the expansion of electric vehicle fleets. However, Paris Agreement targets cannot be met without negative emissions, or carbon dioxide removal and would entail untested technologies that now appear to be impractically expensive. India has \u201cwelcomed\u201d the report and said that several sections underline its stated position: that the climate crisis is due to unequal contributions, and that climate justice must underlie mitigation and adaptation. However, India must also not ignore the other message that only a concerted effort, with countries stretching beyond their comfort zones, can give the planet a fighting chance to stave off the worst.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\nParis Climate Summit COP21\n\n/\n\ngreenhouse gases\n\n/\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n/\n\ntechnology (general)\n\n/\n\ncarbon emissions",

It seeks to know if \u201ctoday\u2019s science suggests this is the best method\u2026or is there another method more suitable to uphold human dignity\u201d. Many would argue there is no human dignity in the very idea of capital punishment. Others still insist that for unspeakably heinous crimes, death is the only \u201cjust\u201d punishment. The debate on capital punishment in India continues \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\nMeanwhile, in governance and courts, a remarkable divergence has happened. Many states have increased the scope of crimes punishable by death. In 2018, death penalty for sexual assault of girls under 12 was included in the penal code. Courts in MP, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Haryana were already sending rapists of children to death row. Over 50% of death sentences are for sexual crimes. In 2021, MP and Punjab included death penalty for sale or manufacture of spurious liquor; Maharashtra added the penalty for rape and gangrape. In 2022, courts around the country sentenced 165 people to death, the highest in 20 years. Included in this were 38 people sentenced by an Ahmedabad court in the 2008 serial blasts case.\nOn the other hand, for several years SC has narrowed the scope of application of death sentences. In the Bachan Singh case (1980), a five-judge SC bench upheld its constitutionality but limited its use, restricting it to \u201crarest of rare cases\u201d, where there were no mitigating circumstances, and with state-led evidence that reform was not possible. SC and high courts thereafter have routinely commuted to life many death sentences in appeal or, more remarkably, acquitted many death row convicts. In 2022, in 68 death row cases in high courts, over 40 prisoners were acquitted. HCs and SC have also been critical of prosecution and police for shoddy probes and process flaws.\nCases that exhaust all routes of appeal, including mercy pleas, await death by hanging, which the petitioner in SC argued can be slow and torturous. India also faces the issue of few trained and registered hangmen, largely a family \u201coccupation\u201d. As for options, the bench itself ruled out lethal injections, firing squad and electric chair. Talking about options to carry out an execution can sound unfeeling, but the SC\u2019s question is necessary and commendable.\n\n",

As it came after many states instituted their own health insurance schemes, the coverage by government-funded health insurance schemes in India is wider. It spans about 148 million families. In a state such as Rajasthan, the state government\u2019s health insurance coverage exceeds PMJAY \u2013 7.5 million of the 13.4 million insured families are covered wholly by the state government. Given this extent of insurance coverage, why did the Rajasthan assembly legislate a Right to Health Act this week?\nThe answer lies in the large quantum of out-of-pocket expenditure that characterises Indian healthcare spending. According to WHO, India\u2019s OOP in 2019 was about 55%, way above the global average of 18%. It\u2019s this gap in healthcare coverage that the state\u2019s health act seeks to address. It\u2019s pragmatic as it seeks to progressively reduce OOP. Consequently, the scope of legislation, which is limited to \u201cresidents\u201d of Rajasthan, covers even diagnostic tests. Private healthcare providers who fall within the scope of this legislation will be reimbursed by the state government. Bringing them within its ambit was essential given their spatial spread. However, many details of this scheme, including the reimbursement process, will be fleshed out in the rules the government is expected to introduce.\nDoctors in Rajasthan are unhappy with the law. But they don\u2019t have a convincing case. Through its iterations in the legislative process, the IMA has been given representation in the state health authority, which will function as a grievance redressal body. Eventually, timely reimbursement by the state will influence the efficacy of this law. On balance, it\u2019s a positive effort as healthcare shocks often push economically vulnerable families back into poverty. Implemented well, this law can check it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Pakistan is facing a severe economic crisis. Essential fuel, food and raw materials cannot be imported due to its foreign exchange crisis. Thousands of factories have been closed down and millions of workers have been laid off. Inflation stood at 31.55 percent in February 2023 \u2013 the highest ever. Prices of staple foods like wheat and sugar have skyrocketed. Queues to get wheat at subsidised prices are getting longer. As of March 2023, Pakistan's central bank reserves stand at $4.32 billion, sufficient to cover just around one month of imports.\nPakistan is in such a crisis because its forex expenditure is higher than its earnings, and the country is increasingly dependent on foreign loans to cover this deficit. In the 2021-22 fiscal year, Pakistan's export earnings were $32.47 billion and import expenditure was $72.15 billion \u2013 i.e. trade deficit was $39.68 billion. In the same year, Pakistan borrowed $16.25 billion and spent $12.99 billion on debt servicing. Remittances in FY2021-22 were $31.27 billion, which were not enough to cover the trade deficit and debt repayments.\nAccording to data provided by Topline Research, Pakistan's foreign debt doubled in seven years: from $65 billion in FY15 (24 percent of GDP) to $130 billion (40 percent of GDP) in FY22. Consequently, foreign debt repayment also increased \u2013 Pakistan's external debt repayment obligations are $73 billion in three years (FY23 to FY25). So, if Pakistan cannot restructure its debt and get new loans, it will go bankrupt.\nAccording to Topline Research's analysis, there has been a significant change in the pattern and composition of credit along with debt growth. Bilateral and commercial borrowing increased more than multilateral borrowing. As these bilateral and commercial loans are of short duration and higher interest, the debt repayment pressure is increasing every year. As of FY21, Pakistan's external debt was $99 billion, of which 42 percent was multilateral, 38 percent bilateral, and the remaining 20 percent was commercial debt. Of the bilateral loans, the loan from China was $23 billion. Of the commercial debt, too, the largest exposure was to Chinese banks, amounting to $6.7 billion. In total, about 30 percent of foreign loans were taken from China, which was only 9.3 percent in 2013. Another form of commercial debt is high-interest debt through Eurobonds and Sukuk bonds, which have grown from just $1.6 billion in 2013 to $11 billion in 2022.\nMost of the projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have a debt-to-equity ratio of around 80:20, or in some cases 75:25. And in most cases, the return on equity (ROE) is guaranteed at either 17 percent or 20 percent. The debt service terms are seven to eight percent with many of them pegged to six-month Libor (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate). According to an estimate published in the\u00a0Dawn, against a $19 billion investment which has 80 percent debt component, the size of the outflow as debt service and ROE would be $3.546 billion per year.\nNow, if the CPEC power plants cannot be utilised to increase export earnings, this annual outflow will create additional pressure on the forex reserves. This pressure is already evident from the fact that by September 2022, the Pakistan government owed at least 269 billion rupees to 12 Chinese IPPs. Pakistan agreed to pay 50 billion rupees to four CPEC IPPs to save them from default.\nPakistan's economy was already burdened with huge capacity payments to the existing IPPs. With the commercial operation of the newly installed CPEC IPPs, this burden increased even more. Due to the reserve crisis, Pakistan cannot import enough coal to run the imported coal-based power plants in full capacity. It is estimated that the capacity payments will be $10 billion by 2023, and Chinese companies will receive about half of that for CPEC power projects.\n\nPakistan is in such a crisis because its forex expenditure is higher than its earnings, and the country is increasingly dependent on foreign loans to cover this deficit. In the 2021-22 fiscal year, Pakistan's export earnings were $32.47 billion and import expenditure was $72.15 billion \u2013 i.e. trade deficit was $39.68 billion. In the same year, Pakistan borrowed $16.25 billion and spent $12.99 billion on debt servicing. Remittances in FY2021-22 were $31.27 billion, which were not enough to cover the trade deficit and debt repayments.\nAnother reason for the growing debt burden is the increase in programme (i.e. non-project) loans. If the loan taken for any economic project can be used to increase the country's forex earning capacity, it does not become a burden. But if a loan is taken only to solve the balance of payment crisis, then it just adds to the debt burden. According to an estimate, from 1980 to 2014, the World Bank provided 163 loans to Pakistan totalling $20 billion, of which only 29 percent were project loans and 71 percent were programme loans. Currently, Pakistan takes about 85 percent of its total foreign loans under \"non-project\" loans. Consequently, it will never be able to pay back these loans without taking new loans.\nWhile Pakistan's foreign debt was increasing, its export earning as a percentage of GDP was decreasing. According to the World Bank data, in 1992, export earnings were 17.3 percent of its GDP, which came down to just 9.1 percent in 2021.\nAt the same time, the pressure of debt servicing also increased, as a result of which an increasing part of export earnings was spent on debt servicing. In 2011, debt servicing as a percentage of exports was nine percent, which rose over 35 percent in 2021.\nThis is the circumstances under which Pakistan's economy has fallen in a vicious cycle of taking new loans to pay the old loans.\nAnother major reason for the forex crisis is the import dependency of Pakistan's power and energy sector. Its energy production consists of oil, natural gas and coal. However, insufficient investment in exploration and development activities has made the country heavily reliant on imports. Due to higher energy prices in the international market, the share of energy rose to a record high at 29 percent ($23.32 billion) in the overall imports worth $80 billion in FY22, compared to 20 percent ($11.38 billion) in the total imports of $56.38 billion in FY21.\nBangladesh, too, has a huge amount of trade deficit and import dependency in its power and energy sector. Also, Bangladesh's total external debt doubled in the last seven years \u2013 from $41.17 billion in FY16 to $95.23 billion in FY22. Exports are increasing, but not so much compared to the GDP growth. As a result, the share of export earnings in GDP is decreasing. According to the World Bank data, in 2012, export earnings were 20.2 percent of the GDP, which dropped to 10.7 percent in 2021.\nAlthough Bangladesh's annual debt servicing as a percentage of export earnings was just 11.4 percent in 2021, there is a serious concern among economists about the future when debt servicing for some of the largest megaprojects will begin. Bangladesh's external debt repayment obligation will double in the next three years. Looking at the crises of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, if Bangladesh does not change its course from building debt-dependent megaprojects, reduce import dependency in the power and energy sector, and fails to utilise the already built projects to generate foreign currency earnings, the very projects that are currently contributing to our GDP growth will become a huge burden for the economy.\n\u00a0\nKallol Mustafa\u00a0is an engineer and writer who focuses on power, energy, environment and development economics.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The 67th session of the Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), the largest global intergovernmental forum dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, successfully closed its two-week session (March 6-17) with the acknowledgment of the critical role of technology and innovation in achieving gender equality. This year's CSW provided a unique opportunity to have a dialogue on shaping a future where technology contributes to transforming harmful social norms, amplifying women's voices, pushing back against online harassment, promoting safe and equitable usage, and distributing the benefits of digitalisation equally to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nGlobal data shows that women are 18 percent less likely than men to own a smartphone and far less likely to access or use the internet. While girls perform equally well as boys in science in most countries, just 28 percent of engineering graduates and 22 percent of artificial intelligence (AI) workers worldwide are women. They hold fewer positions globally in the technology industry and are subject to a 21 percent wage disparity. Moreover, nearly half of all women in the IT industry have experienced workplace harassment.\nWith the converging crises of climate change, costs of living, conflicts, and the Covid pandemic, we are witnessing a reversal in gender equality gains. This has further magnified the unequal pace of digital transformation within and across countries, intensifying systemic barriers for women and girls, including the dangers they face online. As a result, the distance remaining to achieve SDG 5 is even longer.\nThe integration of a gender perspective in technology and innovation is crucial to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The UN secretary-general 's report on the priority theme \"Innovation and technological change, and education in the digital age for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls\" provides an analysis of how to harness technology and innovation for gender equality. It sheds light on four key issues related to Access, Ecosystems, Design, and Safety:\nAccess\u00a0\u2013 Taking an intersectional approach to ensure meaningful digital access and use that provides unique opportunities and life-long learning experiences that empower women; equal digital learning and skills that are technical as well as transferable; allowing women and girls to be both safe and empowered in their use of technology; and increased representation and leadership of women in STEM education that breaks societal stereotypes.\nEcosystems\u00a0\u2013 Shaping inclusive and transformative innovation ecosystems that require a multidimensional policy framework that considers gender aspects and targets across all dimensions; have targets in place to measure the digital transformation of economies and societies to develop evidence-based policies and programmes; have financial levers such as private sector investments; and a future of work that creates decent jobs that address skill gaps and stereotypes.\nDesign\u00a0\u2013 Embedding gender perspectives across innovation and technology design, development, and deployment through the assembly of gender-balanced cross-functional teams; adopting a human rights-based approach to prevent, address, and eliminate safety and security risks; and have ethical frameworks and new regulations in place to ensure transparency and accountability in efforts to address unregulated behaviours and standards in ICTs, including the potential harm of products and services and usage of data.\nSafety\u00a0\u2013 Preventing and eliminating technology-facilitated gender-based violence (GBV) that requires digital citizenship teaching to counter not only gendered disinformation and sexist hate speech, but also positive values of empathy and ethical use of digital media; improved coherence in policy actions that do not threaten freedom of expression, law enforcement coordination, and expansion and amendment of legal frameworks; and improved accountability of state and non-state actors that accounts for comprehensive data on the prevalence of tech-facilitated GBV and transparent regulatory approaches with regard to the safety of women and girls and digital product design.\nIn February, a national consultation organised by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) supported by UN Women Bangladesh brought together participants from 13 line ministries, civil society representatives, and development partners to provide inputs to the CSW67's draft agreed conclusions. Affirming gender equality to be a constitutional commitment for Bangladesh, Fazilatun Nessa Indira MP, the state minister for MoWCA, stated the government's commitment to increase women's participation in ICT by 30 percent by 2030 and 50 percent by 2041 at the CSW67 Ministerial Roundtable.\nFor technology and innovation to respond to the needs of women and girls and offer transformative digital solutions, the agreed conclusions endorsed by the member states have the following actionable recommendations that will help strengthen the Smart Bangladesh vision of a knowledge-based and digitally inclusive economy: 1) prioritising digital equity in policies to close the gender digital divide; 2) leveraging financing for inclusive digital transformation and innovation towards achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 3) fostering gender-responsive digital and science and technology education in the digital age; 4) promoting the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership as well as full employment of women in technology and innovation; 5) adopting gender-responsive technology design, development, and deployment; 6) strengthening fairness, transparency, and accountability in the digital age; 7) enhancing data science to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; and 8) preventing and eliminating all forms of violence, including gender-based violence, that occurs through or is amplified by the use of technologies.\nUN Women along with sister UN agencies stands ready to support the Government of Bangladesh and civil society organisations to bridge the gender digital divide, and as the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres recently highlighted, \"The math is simple: without the insights and creativity of half the world, science and technology will fulfil just half their potential.\"\nGitanjali Singh\u00a0is country representative of UN Women in Bangladesh.\n\n",

A survey by the Centre for Governance Studies, in partnership with the US-based Centre for International Private Enterprise, has found that 74 percent of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have been victims of various forms of corruption such as bribery, extortion and political influence.\nThe survey's sample size \u2013 800 SMEs \u2013 is compelling enough to come to the conclusion that most enterprises are faced with this artificial financial burden. As per the research, SMEs are being forced to pay bribes for important official clearances, such as trade licences, to get loans from banks, to pass inspections, etc. This gives them enough motivation to operate without adhering to regulations or paying taxes. It also makes official regulation meaningless, and deprives the government of tax revenue. Bribing for license renewal purposes was cited by most of the SMEs surveyed. A third of the respondents also said that the registration and licensing offices were the most corrupt of government departments, while 18 percent said law enforcement agencies were the most corrupt.\nUnder such circumstances, how can we expect our SMEs, which are the driving force of our economy, to survive, let alone thrive? If SMEs fail to cope with the cost of corruption and start collapsing, it will be a disastrous consequence for the country. The SMEs need support and incentives, not barriers frequently put in their way. It should be noted that most of the stimulus packages announced for SMEs during the pandemic have still not been disbursed because of the corruption related to accessing loans. Thus, whatever well-intentioned endeavours the government has made to support them have been totally thwarted by corruption. This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the government has done little to reduce this terrible malaise.\nThe US ambassador's cautionary statement during the launch of the survey \u2013 that American business leaders have said they will invest in countries with the lowest level of corruption, fewest bureaucratic obstacles, greatest respect for law, and best logistics infrastructure \u2013 should be taken seriously. Business leaders from other countries would also echo these sentiments. An administrative infrastructure that enables \"ease of doing business\" will not only help or attract foreign investors but local entrepreneurs as well.\nWe urge the government to consider the recommendations given by experts at the survey's launch ceremony. These include digitising the system of obtaining and renewing licences, which can reduce the scope for bribery, cutting the red tape, and making the anti-corruption mechanism more accessible so that citizens can file complaints and get redress easily. The government must undertake these reforms without delay.\n",

        "full_article": "As we observe World Water Day, it is unacceptable\u00a0that people's access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene in Bangladesh is in such a sorry state. Despite making some progress towards improving its water and sanitation infrastructure and services, Bangladesh is still miles away from achieving the targets of ensuring universal access to the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which is a part of the United Nations Sustainable Development (Goals SDG 6). According to 2022 data from water.org, 41 percent of the population in Bangladesh \u2013 around 68 million people \u2013 lacked access to a reliable, safely managed source of water. Around 61 percent of the population \u2013 a staggering 100 million people \u2013 lacked access to safely managed household sanitation facilities. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) study from 2021, 107 million people in Bangladesh did not have basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home.\nThe data clearly illustrate that the state of our water management is in dire straits. With so much hype around Bangladesh's graduation from the Least Developed Country category (LDC), the real scenario of millions of people not having access to basic water-related services is extremely concerning. What is the point of development that cannot even ensure people's access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities?\u00a0\nAs this newspaper reported exactly a year ago, Bangladesh ranks seventh out of 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region that extract the most groundwater, according to UN findings. Such quick depletion of groundwater not only puts at risk our access to safe drinking water, but could also lead to major problems for our agriculture and industries. Moreover, approximately 5-24 percent of the land area in Bangladesh is exposed to extremely high to high risks of elevated arsenic, salinity and groundwater depletion hazards. And this means that somewhere between 4.5 percent to 17 percent of our population are still being exposed to these health hazards, leading to enormous health problems for people. Yet, the emphasis put by the authorities on improving this situation over the years has been grossly inadequate.\nThe answer to solving the problem can be found in reducing our dependence on groundwater. As per the SDGs, 70 percent of our water consumption must come from surface water sources. But, as we know, our surface water is horribly polluted and its use will only be possible once the government ensures enough water recycling and purifying plants.\nAt the same time, the government also needs to protect whatever surface water is available from further contamination. In that regard, the government has to make the use of effluent treatment plants mandatory for\u00a0all\u00a0factories. The lax enforcement of laws is the biggest problem we have when it comes to water management in the country \u2013 leading to the widespread pollution of our rivers, for example. And the onus is on the authorities to change that.\n",

        "full_article": "With the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan tomorrow, the Muslims of Bangladesh join the followers of Islam the world over in observing a highly introspective religious obligation as ordained by the sacred book. Outwardly, the observance is fasting for the month but deep down the ritual is the realisation and practice of abnegation and unselfishness. Through self-denial, human beings try to understand how it feels not to be blessed with the numerous gifts the supreme being has bestowed on them for their material comfort and physical and mental well-being. They surrender to Almighty Allah and express their gratitude for all that He has granted for them. Thus they get connected to the creator spiritually and at the same time discover their inalienable relations to the fellow beings, particularly those who are not fortunate enough to enjoy the many worldly rewards that make life worth living. Unfortunately, not many adherents of Islam today follow the spirit of siam that teaches one to voluntarily withdraw from all forms of self-indulgence. The affluent class of society in particular turn it into a month-long of opulent feast. When some iftari items (with which devotees break fast) are named like 'Borobaperpolaikhai' (meaning only the affluent fathers' sons consume), it smacks of profanity from the religious point of view. But who cares, the sellers of the item also take pride, while they announce their special dish, in becoming a part of trade in this exclusive item! But prophet Muhammad (Sm) used to break his fast with just three dates before his prayer. Even people of modest means try to include food items they usually would not think of buying unless a special occasion demands of them the incumbency. But this also is a special occasion on the reverse side where the optimal restraint is the ultimate virtue.So, the prophet's teaching has fallen on deaf ears of many of his modern-day disciples in more ways than one. They may maintain the ritual but not the due process of cleansing their soul. The businesspeople of this country in particular, in total contrast to their counterparts in the Middle-east countries and even in the Western countries, who have offered extensive discounts on various commodities ahead of the holy month, are known for their rapacious profiteering. The soaring prices of commodities, particularly some of the edibles following the Ukraine war, have now started galloping further. This has been happening every year. Where is the value and spirit of self-denial and feeling for the fellow followers of the tenet that prides in equal standing of each individual? There is nothing wrong with the tenet of Islam, it is the distortion and violation of its ideals and doctrines by the privileged and affluent. Even from the ethical and legal point of view, they are breaching norms and laws of the land. Thus they stand accused in the court of this world and the court of the world after. Millions of fasting people will suffer more than they were supposed to if the market were not manipulated to be as volatile as it is now. If Ramadan's fundamental teaching fails to awaken the self-purifying energy and spirit within, the holy month is not to blame -- only the pretending practitioners become all the more loser.",

        "full_article": "Twenty years ago President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair sent in their forces, along with those of their allies, into Iraq. It was an invasion based on the false premise that Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, was in possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that could endanger global security. Tony Blair trotted out the lie that the WMDs could be fired from Iraq within 45 minutes, meaning that Baghdad was in a position to strike its enemies in that brief span of time and so cause widespread destruction in the world.The invasion of Iraq took place against a background of Hans Blix and his fellow UN inspectors informing the world that there was no evidence of Iraq being in possession of WMDs. The neo-cons in Washington and their friends in London paid no heed. No United Nations sanction was there for any move to be undertaken against the Saddam Hussein regime, for there was little reason to believe that the Iraqi leader was actually a threat to global order. In the days and weeks preceding the invasion, Bush and Blair deliberated on the means by which Saddam Hussein could be removed from power and Iraq could be 'liberated'.The invasion began on 20 March and by the earlier part of April Iraq was a broken country, its leader toppled. The 'liberation' of Iraq quickly led to a situation where the country swiftly fragmented, with mobs deluded into thinking that democracy, per courtesy of the foreign occupiers, had come into their lives going on a rampage in Baghdad and elsewhere. Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled amidst cheers. His soldiers were on the run, having been unable to mount any credible resistance to the invaders. Collaborators like Ahmed Chalabi, long funded by the likes of Dick Cheney and cheered by the arrival of the American and British forces, began to believe Iraq was now theirs to mould and reshape. They were soon to be elbowed aside, with American officials taking control of the country in the way the victors in the Second World War took charge of defeated Germany and vanquished Japan. The Iraqi army was disbanded, the consequence being that all Iraqi soldiers went off to join elements that would soon plunge Iraq in sectarian conflict.The invasion of Iraq was in contravention of the rules of war. It was an unabashed violation of international law, for it was a well-planned assault on a sovereign country by forces who had framed the lie, first, that Saddam Hussein had been linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and, second, that he had those weapons to push the world into conflagration. Tony Blair had the British parliament push through his plans for the invasion. At the UN, men like Colin Powell, who later regretted his role, mischievously laid out for the world what they saw as the specific points along which Iraq's leader would fire his missiles into the air and against Iraq's enemies. In those darkening times, it was arrogance shaped on the anvil of neo-imperialism the world was treated to. Once the invasion was complete and Iraq had been reduced to a shambles, George W. Bush loudly proclaimed that America's mission had been accomplished. It had indeed been accomplished, for an independent and secular Iraq had been ruined and sectarian forces, in the presence of the invading troops, were quickly fanning out to destroy whatever remained of the country. In time, the destruction of Iraq would have grave ramifications, fomenting as it did the rise of such crude Islamist groups as ISIL. No one would ever take the neo-cons in Washington and the Blairites in London to task over their brutalisation of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would be hunted down and tried in conditions that were a travesty of the law, any law, an insult to civilised behaviour. His execution was the final hint that Iraq as it used to be did not exist anymore. Inexplicably, some people in the West, admiring of the Bush-Blair axis, would propose that the US President and the British Prime Minister be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. It did not occur to these men that these heroes of theirs had imposed the peace of the grave on Iraq.A million Iraqi deaths later, the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant of arrest against Russian President Vladimir Putin over his country's conduct in Ukraine. Ironically, President Joe Biden, whose country has steadfastly been opposed to the ICC and has argued that it does not recognise the court and that the ICC will never be permitted to prosecute American transgressions in international conflict, has been cheered by the warrant against Putin.The ICC is thus in the headlines, for Putin is the enemy. It has little time to study the many ways in which the United States, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have encouraged a proliferation of the Ukraine conflict through consistently arming Kyiv. Away in the Middle East, the ICC has never called forth the courage to serve warrants of indictment or arrest against Israeli leaders who have systematically presided over the building of illegal Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land. The ICC has not had the inclination to call to account any Israeli political leader or military officer on the issue of the murder of the journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh.The ICC has been quick to go after African leaders and warlords accused of atrocities against their people and other people. But it has carefully chosen to look away from the crimes committed in Iraq. No step has ever been taken to have Bush, Blair and their associates compelled to appear before the ICC in The Hague and answer for the destruction they wrought in Iraq.No law has touched the men who put Iraq to the torch in March-April 2003. Paul Bremer, with pretensions of being a latter-day Douglas MacArthur, as the administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority of Iraq decreed a ban on the Baath Party and the Iraqi army. On his watch, tens of thousands of Iraqis perished, Iraq degenerated into bloodletting, libraries and other institutions in Iraq were destroyed. But nothing was done to haul Bremer before the ICC.Two decades after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq, it is time to remember the country that once was, to remember the bastion of secular stability Saddam Hussein and his regime built in their years in power, to remember the men and women, dead and alive, whose pride was being citizens of Iraq.The men who have ruined Iraq may never be tried for their crimes. But their legacy will be one of being remembered with contempt by people who have consistently believed in the law and decency, have always marched on the streets in defence of peace, have never let aggressors sleep in peace in their beds.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, going by this year's World Happiness Report, brought out by the United Nations, we in Bangladesh are not a happy nation. On a list of 137 countries, Bangladesh has ranked 118th, dropping 24 notches from what it was in 2022. This makes the country rank among the top 20 unhappiest countries in the world. Bangladesh performed much lower than even war-torn Ukraine. Measuring happiness is not easy. But the world happiness report, published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ranks countries on happiness based on six key factors. Those are: social support, income, health, freedom, generosity, and the absence of corruption. According to the report, the happiness is measured by asking a nationally representative group of people how satisfied they are with their lives these days. If anyone living in Dhaka city is asked how happy they are with their income, they are sure to give us a negative reply. Price hike has taken an alarming turn lately and it is an issue that cannot be taken lightly. High price inflation has increased the cost of livelihood which is beyond the tolerance of the common people. With this, Bangladesh's unemployment rate, which is above six per cent nowadays, indicates that our economic growth has not been enough to create jobs for the youth. Unemployed youths depend on their parents' hard-earned money. And out of frustration some of them even commit or attempt suicide. According to the world happiness index, people of countries with effective democratic institutions and good governance are much happier than those having deficiency. This shows us that democracy, good governance and strong rule of law can lead to an improved quality of life and increase happiness of people. Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and most of the countries in the top ten of world happiness index have good governance. These countries value human rights and have very low level of corruption. Now think about Bangladesh. Do we have democracy or good governance in our social institutions? Corruption is everywhere in our life. Bangladesh has recently ranked 147th out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in 2022, according to a list compiled by anti-graft watchdog, Transparency International Bangladesh. Health, especially mental health, along with quality of work and family got priority for the countries that ranked higher in the World Happiness Report in 2023. It seems to be a luxury to get proper mental health treatment in Bangladesh where doctor-patient ratio is only 5.26 per 10,000 people. It is not that happy moments never come in our life. But the ever-present problems like traffic jam, corruption, scarcity of work, inflation, lack of healthcare facilities must be addressed as best as possible. Improvement is always possible. Nepal, with all the challenges that it face like Bangladesh, has been ranked the happiest country in South Asia with its 78th place on the list. What is possible for Nepal should also be possible for our country. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

According to the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment, around 13 million Bangladeshi workers are now working in different countries all over the world. However, quality labour migration is yet to be ensured since most of the outgoing workers are unskilled or low-skilled. They are still limited to traditional sectors like construction, plantation, manufacturing, etc. These jobs are not highly paid. As a result, a migrant worker cannot get back the money he/she spent to go abroad even after working for three to five years. We must remember that only skilled workers are able to fetch more remittance for us. Although we have a large number of migrant workers employed abroad, we are not getting enough remittance. On the contrary, Sri Lanka with fewer migrant workers is earning more than us since its workers are involved in diversified sectors. The huge population we have in Bangladesh can be a boon for our economy if they are properly trained. It would be wise on the part of the government to set up a modern training centre to provide different skills development training to these workers such as on computer and communication skills. \nRafid AlamDhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
