The free trade pact is a tacit acknowledgment that India needs to strengthen its trade ties with existing partners by lowering tariff walls and obtaining more favourable access for its exports in order to boost trade and economic output. With the COVID-19 pandemic having thrown into sharp relief the public health and economic vulnerabilities of an increasingly interconnected world, a reflexive urge to turn inward was evident in the last two years as nations imposed tight travel and entry restrictions in a bid to protect their populations. And ironically, even as India sought to promote atmanirbharta or self-reliance, the pandemic also depressed domestic consumption demand, dragging down overall economic output. Exports on the other hand have rebounded strongly, with growth outpacing even the pre-pandemic levels. It is in this backdrop that the Government\u2019s renewed push to negotiate its bilateral free trade agreements is a welcome change in tack and signals that India is keener to strengthen trade ties with individual partner countries on equitable terms rather than be tied into multilateral pacts that do not necessarily address its key concerns.That the accord was finalised in less than six months\u2019 time, from the start of negotiations in September, is a testimony to the strength of the bilateral ties and the recognition that there is more to gain from a deepening of the relationship. The UAE is already India\u2019s third-largest trading partner with bilateral trade in 2019-20 valued at $59 billion. While India\u2019s exports amounted to about $29 billion in the pre-pandemic fiscal year ended March 2020, the UAE supplied India with $10.9 billion worth of crude oil in that period and counts New Delhi as its second-largest trading partner. The two partners now aim to leverage the free trade deal to lift bilateral merchandise trade to $100 billion over the next five years. While the fine print of the tariff concessions on both sides is yet to be spelt out, India has made it clear that a range of exports including textiles and jewellery are set to benefit from a zero-duty regime once the accord is formally operationalised by May. Two-way investment flows and remittances \u2014 a major source of foreign exchange earnings for India given the large Indian workforce in the UAE \u2014 are also expected to receive a fillip. With multiple other FTAs in the pipeline, India has a fresh opportunity to reset its trade ties with the international community, one accord at a time.",

Though the Opposition was splintered, the string of successes is an endorsement of the governance in the last nine months. Party president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin meticulously planned the AIADMK\u2019s decimation, wanting to avenge the DMK\u2019s humiliation in the western region nine months ago when no DMK candidate made it to the Assembly from Coimbatore and Dharmapuri. Apart from governmental attention to the region, Mr. Stalin deputed two Ministers to Coimbatore and Salem to prepare the political pitch. The DMK has captured local bodies in the backyards of former Chief Ministers Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam. As Mr. Stalin impressed upon the newly elected representatives, it is important to deliver on the ground. As a former Chennai Mayor, he is cognisant that missteps by councillors, the last mile connectors with the people, could tarnish the ruling party\u2019s image, and he will need to monitor their work constantly.\rThe AIADMK cannot wish away the rout on the scale of its 1996 debacle, blaming it on money power, misuse of government machinery or propounding it is natural for the Opposition to lose civic elections. Its two leaders can no longer confine operational bases to their respective caste-fortified political comfort zones and expect to ride on the approval by a coterie populated in the party\u2019s high-level committees. Their vote pulling capacity is based on the strength of the organisation built by M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. Hence, they must reach out to ground functionaries and undertake course correction. There could be patch up calls with Jayalalithaa\u2019s confidante V.K. Sasikala and the breakaway Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam. Since the separation has not helped either party, there will be pressure to enter into mutual adjustments. The party would do well not to fight shy of criticising the central government when it comes to issues affecting the people. The BJP, which has created a perception that it is no longer a pushover in the Dravidian heartland, has had no qualms attacking the AIADMK or poaching its steering committee member. Irrespective of poll statistics, the BJP has indeed scored victories in newer territories. A section of voters chose BJP candidates over the Naam Tamilar Katchi and the Makkal Needhi Maiam, though the party did not make much of an impact in what is still a bipolar polity. Given that past alternatives to the Dravidian majors faded after one or two stunning shows, it is too early to conclude that the BJP would stay the course as a political alternative. Meanwhile, Mr. Stalin, who described the victory as people\u2019s endorsement for the \u201cDravidian model\u201d of governance, must continue to focus on development, and livelihood issues of the people, and not be distracted by petty politics.",

Regrettably, it will be done as before\u2014in secrecy. We will never know (unless the president decides otherwise and sets a new precedent, and we hope he does) the 10 names they recommended, and only learn about the five the president will choose in consultation with the prime minister.\nWe write today to put on record a few things. Unlike the previous search committees, whose terms of reference were determined by the president, the present committee has been formed under a new law that spells out how it will be formed and function. This is a significant departure from the past, putting the committee's stature and prestige at a much higher level, but at the same time making its activities far more accountable than before.\nOf the six members of the search committee, two\u2014the chair and another member\u2014are directly nominated by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh. This means that through these two nominations, the office and the person of the Chief Justice, who stands as the apex of our judiciary and is seen as the epitome of public confidence in our judicial system, has become linked with the performance of this committee. The way they discharge their functions will reflect on the Chief Justice himself, especially because he nominated the chair.\nWe, of course, expect and express our confidence that these two honourable judges will act with the highest standards of judicial tradition. Still, we thought of bringing this fact to their attention.\nThe law specifies, under Section 3(2), that the search committee will decide its own procedure of work. Therefore, when the search committee decided not to disclose the names of their final nominees to the president, they did so on their own, not under any compulsion or obligation or legal necessity. It is the committee's own decision, and as such, they are responsible for all the consequences that will emanate from this action of secrecy.\nAccording to media reports, the chief of the search committee said that revealing names was \"the domain of the president. After submission to the president, if he wants to reveal the names, then the names will be revealed.\" With the highest respect to the learned judge, there is nothing in the law that prevents the committee from revealing the names of its nominees. This is something that the committee has imposed on itself, ignoring the demands of all the political parties who sent their recommendations and individuals whom they invited for the dialogue. Why opt for the \"restrictive option\" when the \"transparency option\" exists and is demanded by most political parties, the principal actors in any election? Isn't it one of the most famous judicial dictums that \"justice is not only to be done, but also seen to be done\"?\nThe significant point that is being missed here is that revealing the names of the 10 nominees would have greatly added to the process of transparency and significantly increased public confidence, which is of vital importance in anything that has to do with elections. It is more so than usual because of the controversies that surround the past two elections.\nEarlier, we had written about the moral role of the search committee, which along with their legal role made their work so vital. The point we stressed was gaining public confidence for their decisions. We tried to draw the bigger picture of the democratic future of our country\u2014along with it the prestige and credibility of the country in the international arena.\nWhile we question the decision not to reveal the names, we still hope that, considering all the points raised, the search committee will be fully conscious of the supreme importance of their task, and rise up to the public expectation of the moment and give us a courageous and competent Election Commission that we deserve and, more importantly, desperately need.\n\u00a0\n(This commentary was published online earlier.)\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "In case you have felt the shivers recently, or sweated profusely, know that climate is not the only earthly element that has undergone change. In tandem with erratic rising temperatures and dipping mercury, the favourite pastime of millions (in most languages, it is decried as politics) has gone through momentous transformation for the worst, and in some very unlikely places.\nThere was a time not so many years ago when some (economically) interested developed country would employ every resource at home and abroad to first criticise, begin policing, then mobilise international media support, create a band of local bootlickers, and finally usurp a head of state of a developing country\u2014someone who was not to their (fiscal) taste.\nTo help fulfil the unpleasant agenda of the leaders of these developed countries, there were indeed vile, unpopular rulers scattered around the world, who hung on to their \"throne\" (elected or inherited) by aborting the constitutions, living in lies and, as a last resort, ordering troops to fire on unarmed citizens to quell any uprising.\nEven observers on the fence would tell you that Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, and now Syria's Bashar al-Assad, North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko and such held on to power by guile and gun, though a few are known for their benevolence.\nIn contrast, the self-assuming darogas of the world were the apparent good guys, upholding the heraldry of democracy. They made it their business to interfere with the internal affairs of another country\u2014all under the pretext of rescuing a people (not theirs) from their avowed tyrannical despot. Often, such tactics in a Western country earned points on the political front.\nUnbelievably, actions, trials and even executions in one country are believed to affect elections in another country. If that is what the expression \"global village\" means, then we are living as rudimentarily as the cave people.\nThere are examples galore, but a couple of samplers will bring home the argument. The New Yorker in 1996 called him \"omnipotent, benevolent, and everlasting President.\" Captured by the US in 2003, Saddam Hussein was found guilty by Iraqi judges for his violent campaign against the Kurds and the Shias, as well as for crimes against humanity. Rights groups and the United Nations at the time were concerned because Saddam's trial did not meet international standards of fairness. The Iraqi supremo was hanged in 2006.\nAfter leading a military coup in 1969 against the Libyan monarchy, Muammar Gaddafi headed a two-faced Revolutionary Command Council\u2014benevolent towards his people who gained prosperity, but repressive against political opponents. He befriended Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro, Yasser Arafat, and the Provisional Irish Republican Army. His dream of a common currency for Africa was making headway. In October 2011, the National Transitional Council, backed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) forces, unseated Gaddafi, captured him, and beat him to death. Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch termed his killing a violation of international law.\nIf you flip through the pages of photo albums, there could be cuddly images of the leader of a rich democracy and that of a moneywise poorer nation, all smiles, never differentiable by the quality of their clothing. They seemingly fell a world apart due to some not-so-unseen disputes\u2014oil, water, land or trade. But such unscrupulous, power-hungry leadership was no longer the prerogative of only the less developed countries.\nIn a world-changing scenario, there is little difference today between the leaders of the economically developed and the less developed countries. No one wants to let go of power, even if that means death of democracy. In the poorer countries, such greed has often led to hunger, economic hardship, and sectoral violence.\nIn at least two of the world's most respected and longstanding democracies, desperate measures to hang on to power by some protagonists have surprised many.\nTill it happened in early 2021, no one could have imagined that the US politics would be the cause of political violence. Unlike any of his predecessors, Donald Trump began his acceptance speech long before the elections. Reading his psyche and his encrypted garbled pomposity, the media repeatedly asked him whether he would accept the results. His response every time was feigned efforts to confuse the public\u2014millions loved that.\nAfter the verdict went decisively in favour of Joe Biden by a margin of 306 to 232 electoral votes and 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast\u2014a difference of over seven million\u2014Trump turned his supporters against his chosen running mate, then Vice-President Michael Pence. Trump counted on Republican lawmakers to make one last doomed attempt to reverse the results when Congress met to confirm the Electoral College vote. He called up governors to twist facts and hand him the state votes. When they did not, he made their life hell with threats and mob violence.\nThen, on the infamous January 6, a desperate Trump did what was below the ethics of 44 POTUS before him. A rowdy mob of Trump supporters besieged the seat of the US Congress in Washington, DC, seeking to overturn his defeat. No American president had tried so hard to damage the value of democracy and undermine the people's mandate before, and Trump's cult following did not help.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is another \"change-maker\" without remorse\u2014an inherent leadership quality among many of his predecessors. Police are investigating reports that he and about 30 others were partying at 10 Downing Street when indoor gatherings were banned, and only groups of up to six people were permitted to meet outside under the Covid restrictions in the UK. Singing was prohibited, but they sang to wish him a happy birthday. The leading lawmaker who had made that law broken it.\nBoris was brave to say \"sorry\" in parliament, but indicated he would not resign, which many observers thought was a foregone conclusion, given the country's history of political integrity. Boris was not taught by my Jhenaidah Cadet College teacher, who often reprimanded us with, \"Sorry is a cheap word in the dictionary.\"\nBoth Trump and Johnson lost high ground. Yet, neither are willing to drop the towel. No one else had remained in contention for a possible second crack at the presidency after so many antiques as Trump. No UK premier has survived lies in the past, but the climate has changed.\nThey may win back the mandate of the people by hook or by crook, but the future doesn't justify their past.\n\u00a0\nDr Nizamuddin Ahmed\u00a0is an architect and a professor, a Commonwealth scholar and a fellow, Woodbadger scout leader, Baden-Powell fellow, and a Major Donor Rotarian.\n",

        "full_article": "In a recent press briefing, Justice Obaidul Hassan, chair of the Search Committee for the Election Commission (EC), confirmed their decision not to disclose the names of the 10 individuals they will recommend to the president to constitute the new EC. This is deeply disappointing, and we are afraid that the pervasive crisis of confidence, which already exists in many citizens' minds regarding this whole process, will not be alleviated.\nThere is a widespread perception that the search committee does not really search for competent people for appointment to important institutions. The committee is believed to be normally confining its search to a list of individuals given by the government, and basically rubber stamping the names preferred by the authorities. A recent interview of former Justice Abdul Matin, who chaired and served on several such search committees, reinforces this perception (Prothom Alo, January 23, 2022).\nThe experience of appointing the KM Nurul Huda commission adds further currency to such belief. A Prothom Alo report (February 8, 2022) indicated that in 2017, the ruling party pre-selected four people\u2014KM Nurul Huda, Rafiqul Islam, Kabita Khanam, and Brig Gen (retd) Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury\u2014for appointment to the Election Commission and adopted a strategy to have those names repeatedly proposed by their coalition partners and allies. According to an interview given by Prof Manzoorul Islam to Prothom Alo (February 12, 2017), Nurul Huda's name for the position of chief election commissioner (CEC) was proposed by seven or eight parties, while Ali Imam Majumder's name was proposed by two. The search committee appeared to have tallied the names suggested by the political parties and recommended to the president the names proposed the most.\nThe search committee did not appear to have exercised due diligence in preparing the final panel for recommendation to the president. According to Black's Law Dictionary, due diligence means \"such a measure of prudence, activity, or assiduity, as is properly to be expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under the particular circumstances; not measured by any absolute standard, but depending on the relative facts of the special case.\" By not exercising due diligence, the previous search committee appeared to have largely played the role of a post office.\nIf the search committee had exercised due diligence, they would have found out that Nurul Huda was a BCS officer from the special '73 batch, and he had been sent to forced retirement as a joint secretary by the BNP government in the early 2000s. After a court battle, he got his job back and retired as a secretary in 2006, and he did not seem to have served as a secretary even for a single day. There were also serious allegations of partisan behaviour during his career as a civil servant, and he was a victim of the BNP and a beneficiary of the Awami League. Given such a history, it would have been difficult to recommend Nurul Huda for the CEC position, had the process been transparent and the search committee exercised due diligence.\nAccording to Section 4(1) of the Appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Act, 2022, the search committee \"shall act in accordance with the principles of transparency and neutrality and shall make recommendations to the President for appointment to the posts of Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioner, taking into consideration the qualifications, disqualifications, experience, honesty and reputation of the individuals, as described in this Act.\"\nClearly, the law mandates the search committee to act neutrally and transparently to find honest, competent, and reputed individuals to recommend to the president for EC constitution. Acting transparently will mean doing everything openly and not hiding anything; it will mean full, not partial disclosures. Thus, the search committee is obliged to disclose not only the names of the people proposed for its consideration, but also the names of those who proposed said names, as we requested on behalf of SHUJAN.\nThe law's requirement of recommending reputed individuals for EC appointment also requires disclosure of the names of the people being considered by the search committee, as there is no yardstick for measuring reputation other than public perception. Thus, only if the names are made public, and the citizens are given the opportunity to express their opinion, the committee will have a good idea as to whether the individuals they are considering have anything hidden in their closet. Only with full disclosure and allowing the citizens to share their views can the search committee act transparently\u2014as well as be seen to have acted transparently.\nIt is argued that disclosing the names of those in the short list of 20 or the final list of 10, and their nominators, will create controversies and character assassinations. The disclosure is intended to get the truth out, not to assassinate anyone's character. In addition, if there is any controversy about anyone, it should come out before their names are recommended to the president, rather than after being appointed to the EC.\nThe Right to Information Act, 2009, too, makes it obligatory for the search committee to make public the proposed names for EC appointment, and the names of those who proposed said names. In \"Badiul Alam Majumdar and others vs the state\" case, a divisional bench of the High Court ruled that all information that the \"authorities\" have, even from the third parties, are public information\u2014not secret or confidential\u2014and are subject to disclosure.\nArticle 48(3) of our constitution requires the president to act on the prime minister's advice, except in the cases of appointing the chief Justice and the prime minister. If the search committee discloses the proposed names for the EC, along with a report justifying their recommendations, only then will we know whether the president's appointment came out of the committee's recommendation.\nWe strongly feel that the search committee's decision not to disclose the names of the panel it will propose to the president and of those who proposed those names is ill-conceived and will serve no public interest. We, therefore, respectfully request the committee to reconsider its decision. Otherwise, the pervasive crisis of confidence will continue to persist in the public psyche, which will not be in anyone's best interest.\n\u00a0\nDr Badiul Alam Majumdar\u00a0is the secretary of SHUJAN: Citizens for Good Governance.\n",

This time, the victim was a poor man named Wazir Mia, who had been picked up along with two others on February 10, 2022 on charges of stealing cows. The two other arrestees recently gave a horrific account of torture inflicted on Wazir while in custody inside Shantiganj police station in Sunamganj, which ultimately led to his death. When policemen hang an accused person upside down from the ceiling and beat him mercilessly, we can't help but wonder: What could embolden them to go to such lengths? Why such wrathful treatment to a citizen on prima facie charges of theft? Or is there a more sinister story behind, which needs to be uncovered?\nThe truth will come out if a neutral body undertakes a proper investigation. Meanwhile, the people of Wazir's village are not convinced with the police account of the entire episode. They want justice and have gone out to block the Sunamganj-Sylhet road at Pagla Bazar, demanding punishment for the responsible cops.\nDeath of an accused in police custody is an extreme form of violation of human rights and dignity. The custodians of law must not turn into law-breakers under any pretext, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Unfortunately, such stories of torture and death are not uncommon, although victims rarely get justice. One may recall the custodial death of Ishtiaque Hossain Jonny in 2014. Six years after Jonny was murdered, a Dhaka court gave the country's first-ever verdict in a lawsuit filed under the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act\u2014in which it sentenced three of the accused policemen to life imprisonment and two others to seven years in jail. The enormity of the crime was aptly summarised in a single word of the presiding judge: \"heinous.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nEvidently, such crimes are still taking place. For example, several rights organisations in their presentation to the UN's Committee against Torture alleged that 348 prisoners died in custody in Bangladesh since the anti-torture and custodial death law was enacted in 2013. This heinous trend must stop. We often hear the higher authorities say that they want the law enforcers to act as people's friends. Police and the higher authorities both must strive to make this a reality, and build a mechanism to prevent such extrajudicial undertakings.\n",

After being denied twice, he took it up with the Information Commission where, on January 11, 2022, a legal representative of the police said that the information was \"highly sensitive\" and sharing it could \"obstruct the enforcement of law,\" citing an exemption clause of the RTI Act.

And at a hearing on February 22, the commission instructed the police to verify his background by going to his present and permanent addresses.\u00a0\nThis unexpected turn of events\u2014turning the spotlight from a public interest disclosure to an investigation of the person requesting said disclosure\u2014is noteworthy as it shows how far off the target we are in terms of ensuring access to public information, despite there being a law precisely for that purpose. It also makes us wonder: What is so sensitive about the number of DSA lawsuits, accused and arrestees? It's already a part of public records and should be accessible for anyone. It's also unclear in what scenario could it lead to obstruction of law enforcement. Even if we buy into the claims that the data is \"highly sensitive,\" we must admit that it's one thing to interpret the possible outcome of a disclosure, and another thing to try and discredit a citizen by casting doubts on his motive and identity. This doesn't sit well with the police's claim of transparency either.\nWe're equally baffled by the response of the Information Commission. As an RTI expert said in a column in The Daily Star, \"information-seekers find themselves in a quandary when the Information Commission itself concurs with the denial of information by the authorities concerned.\" Some of the exemption clauses under Section 7 of the RTI Act have been questioned for the wide latitude they give to government agencies to disregard information requests. The commission should know that the harmonisation of the citizens' right to know and the government's right to protect public interest is a key part of its job, which it must do in a manner so that the citizens are not discouraged from using the RTI law.\nBy now, there should be no doubt about the devastating effects of the DSA and how it has been frequently abused to target dissenting voices. Any attempt to disclose information illustrating the actual situation should be welcomed, instead of allowing the scope for further abuse. We urge the commission to ensure that everyone using the RTI law is protected and empowered.\u00a0\n",
