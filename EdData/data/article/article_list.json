Delhi Lieutenant Governor V.K. Saxena, who had accorded sanction in October 2023 to prosecute the Booker Prize-winning writer and the former Kashmir University professor, respectively, for allegedly divisive speeches and imputations against national unity, has now given his nod for invoking Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for the same set of speeches. The earlier sanction order was in his capacity as the appropriate authority on behalf of the Delhi government under Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The recent one is, presumably, on behalf of the Central government, the appropriate authority to sanction prosecution for offences under Chapter III of the UAPA, under which Section 13 falls. The resurrection of this old case is an unfortunate instance of ill-motivated prosecution. The only possible explanation for the revival of this case, registered on a magistrate court\u2019s order in 2010, is that the present regime has found it expedient only now to do so, as part of its continuing crackdown on dissenters and outspoken critics. The eight-month gap between the two sanction orders is inexplicable, as the same material would have been placed before the sanctioning authority. The regime at the Centre then did not deem it appropriate to prosecute the speakers at the conference held in Delhi in October 2010. Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party, then in the opposition, pressed for it, the Delhi police did not consider the speeches seditious. Its reluctance was possibly because the Centre did not want to jeopardise efforts to find a solution to the Kashmir problem through designated interlocutors. When a complaint was filed before a Magistrate, the court asked for a police report, but the Delhi police did not think the speeches warranted prosecution for sedition. However, on November 27, 2010, the Metropolitan Magistrate rejected the police stand and directed registration of a First Information Report. The FIR included Section 13 of UAPA, which seeks to punish \u201cunlawful activities\u201d. Speeches made at the conference may have contained imputations about the status of Kashmir, but it is doubtful if a mere speech, in the absence of a call to arms or instigation of violence, would amount to \u201cunlawful activity\u201d under UAPA. In any case, much has changed in the ground situation, especially in the aftermath of the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status in 2019 and its division into two Union Territories. The new coalition regime should move away from the earlier era\u2019s obsession with stamping out dissenting views and put an end to its propensity to criminalise speeches.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nhate crimes\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\npolice\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\ncivil unrest",

        "full_article": "Gender parity may be climbing upwards worldwide with the global gender gap standing at 68.5% closed in 2024, but the glacial pace of change \u2014 it was 68.4% in 2023 \u2014 is a grim statistic. At this rate, it will take 134 years to reach full parity, the Global Gender Gap report released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) last week pointed out, \u201croughly five generations beyond the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target\u201d. Iceland maintains its number 1 rank (93.5%), and is also the only economy to have closed over 90% of its gender gap. India has slipped two places to 129 out of 146 countries. Last year, it was ranked 127, after having jumped eight places from 135 in 2022. India has closed 64.1% of its gender gap in 2024, the report noted, leaving policy-makers with a huge window of opportunity to do better. The \u201cslight regression,\u201d according to the report, is mainly due to \u201csmall declines\u201d in the spheres of education and political empowerment. With a population of over 140 crore, even two steps back mean staggering numbers. Though India, it pointed out, had shown a slight improvement in economic participation and opportunity for the last few years, it would need 6.2 percentage points more to match its 2012 score of 46%. One way of achieving the objective will be through bridging gender gaps in, say, the labour force participation rate (45.9%). To do that, a slew of measures must be in place, from ensuring that girls do not drop out of higher education, providing them job skills, ensuring safety at the workplace, and helping them keep a job after marriage by sharing responsibility for chores at home. In education, the gap between men and women\u2019s literacy rate is 17.2 percentage points wide, leaving India ranked 124th on this indicator. India has fared better in the political empowerment index, but women\u2019s representation in Parliament continues to be low. For confirmation, look no further than the newly elected Lok Sabha. Close to 800 women contestants were in the fray, but the number of women Members of Parliament has dipped to 74 from 78 (2019) of 543 members, which is 13.6% of the total. These numbers are not a good sign in the backdrop of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, 2023, yet to come into effect, which aims to reserve one-third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and State legislative Assemblies for women. All under-performing countries, including India, must heed WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi\u2019s words, calling for \u201cGovernments to strengthen the framework conditions needed for business and civil society to work together to make gender parity an economic imperative\u201d. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIceland\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ngender\n\n/\n\nhigher education\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nReservation",

        "full_article": "In a world that often focuses on maternal love, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the profound and indispensable role of fathers, writes SUMIT PAUL\n\u201cI always wondered why God was supposed to be a father,\u201d she whispers. Fathers always want you to measure up to something. Mothers are the ones who love you unconditionally, don\u2019t you think?\n\u2014 Jodi Picoult\nNothing moves a loving father\u2019s soul quite like his child\u2019s cry. When the mother\u2019s sugary affection gels with the father\u2019s stern love, the all-round development of children becomes easier and better. Children require love as well as discipline for balanced growth. They get love from their mother and are disciplined by their father. There is no teacher equal to a mother, and there\u2019s nothing more contagious than the dignity of a father. To quote Urdu poet Munavvar Rana, \u201cAmmi se milti hai nikhalis muhabbat/Abba se mil jaati hai kabhi daant bhi\u201d \u2014 pure love is received from mothers/fathers, at times, rebuke their children. But this so-called scolding has a profound meaning. What we become depends on what our dads teach us at odd moments, even when they are not trying to teach us anything at all. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom. A dad will teach his children the ways of life so that they can face challenges and vicissitudes with equanimity and equipoise. But he does this sans fanfare. What he faces in life and learns, he passes it on to his offspring. He\u2019s a living and walking school for his children and embodies all that is wise, profound, and sacred.\n\nThe Padma Purana states, \u201cSarvadevmayh Pita\u201d \u2014 father is the embodiment of all devtas, gods. That\u2019s why Hindu scriptures say, Pita dharmah, pita swargah, pita hi parmam tapah/ Pitri preetimapanne preeyante sarva devtah \u2014 a father is as sacred as dharma, as divine as the heavens and is one of the greatest symbols of austerity in this world. The gods are pleased if one can make one\u2019s father happy.\nA father is never a draconian taskmaster. In other words, he\u2019s not a martinet. He loves, albeit dispassionately. Ralph Waldo Emerson says, \u201cFather\u2019s love is understood only in retrospect. When you grow old and become a father, you understand and appreciate your dad, whom you may not have liked much while growing up.\u201d\n\nA father\u2019s role may appear marginalised initially in a family setup, but it\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s central and crucial to the growth and development of not just children but the entire unit. A father who is responsible for his family has to don the mantle of seriousness.\nLike the headmaster in a school, a dad is the principal in a family. He has to be calm, cool, collected, and also calculated; his heart is pure sterling. Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost rightly said, \u201cThe heart of a father is the masterpiece of nature.\u201d\nThe Taittiriya Upanishad exhorts, Pitradevo Bhava \u2013 your father is like a god on earth. Whether he\u2019s a deity or an angel is inconsequential. Your dad is a human endowed with humane attributes such as love, emotion, affection and intimacy. A dad needs nothing more than a smile. Let\u2019s send our love to all dads on Father\u2019s Day with a note of gratitude from Robert Southey\u2019s immortal poem, \u2018My cheeks have often been bedewed/With tears of thoughtful gratitude.\u2019 Take a bow, all dads.\n\n",

        "full_article": "One of the immediate challenges before the new govt is the ongoing NEET fiasco. Inflated marks, allocation of grace marks, an unusually high number of perfect scores, allegations of paper leak, and calls for a retest have created stress for students, parents, and even the govt. This is not an isolated incident and, regrettably, will not be the last. Conducting such a massive exam for over 2.3 million students in 13 languages across 4,500 centres in India and 14 countries abroad is a Herculean task. Similar challenges plague the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) for undergraduate admissions, and the JEE Mains exam, both of which are taken by over a million students. These exams have now become behemoths that need better handling.\nCurrently, gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in India is around 26%. The goal is to increase this to over 50% in the next decade, which implies that the number of candidates appearing for entrance exams will double. This raises two critical questions. First, is it necessary to have such single exams, which are nearly impossible to administer, on such a large scale? Second, if these exams are indeed necessary, can we adopt better practices from countries like the US and China, which have successfully navigated similar challenges by evolving systems that suit their needs?\n\nSat example: US model of multiple test dates can ease pressure on students\nGiven that admissions to govt institutions in India rely heavily on a single test score, these exams bear an immense burden to accurately assess a student\u2019s overall scholastic ability and aptitude. One significant downside of standardising school education through uniform national boards and common entrance exams is the homogenisation of higher education intake, which can stifle creativity and diversity of thought. Additionally, this standardisation inadvertently fuels the coaching industry.\nTherefore, the design of these exams must prioritise flexibility, transparency, diversity, scalability, accessibility of materials, and availability of language options. Here are three possible steps that can create a more equitable and effective exam system\u2026\n1. Learn from the world: US, home to many top-ranking institutions, follows a diversified admissions model. SAT and ACT are the primary standardised tests for college admissions, taken by around 2 million students each year. In contrast, China\u2019s \u2018gaokao\u2019 is one of the largest exams globally in terms of participation, with a record 13.4 million students taking it in 2024. It is a high-stakes, highly standardised exam lasting approximately nine hours over two to three days, depending on the provincial administrative regions. It\u2019s also a very secure process with teachers being secluded and armed guards escorting the vehicles transporting exam papers.\nThe US model is potentially more suitable for India as it offers flexibility with multiple test dates throughout the year. It reduces stress by spreading the risk over an extended period rather than concentrating it in a single event.\nIn India, private players now offer the IT and physical infrastructure to conduct secure online computer-based tests for over 200,000 candidates at a time. Establishing a large question bank with questions of varying difficulty levels, randomly picked by an algorithm for each candidate, along with real-time adaptation and immediate provision of raw scores after the test, could effectively address the challenges of scaling up exams. This approach could combine the flexibility and efficiency of the US model with the rigorous standards necessary for high-stakes exams in India.\n2. Constitutional status for NTA: To address transparency issues, it\u2019s crucial to grant the National Testing Agency (NTA) constitutional status similar to the UPSC. Adopting the UPSC structure, with leading academics managing the exam process, and involving top institutions in the conduct of exams, can enhance credibility. The primary reason for the smooth conduct of JEE Advanced and GATE exams year after year is because of the significant involvement of IIT faculty at every stage of the exam. Whether it\u2019s NEET, JEE Mains or CUET, it\u2019s important to involve a set of our top institutions in the conduct of these exams jointly with NTA.\n3. Holistic admission policies: While inclusive and holistic admission policies work well in some private institutions in India and many leading institutions abroad, there are challenges in implementing such metrics for admission in govt-run institutions. There is a fear of external influences derailing the process. Diversity in admissions can, however, be managed by giving seats to state and central board toppers, Olympiad winners, etc.\nMajor reforms in the admission process are essential to build a resilient, inclusive, and effective pathway for our aspiring students, ensuring that our higher education system nurtures talent and produces the best professionals for the future. Exams like GATE and JEE Advanced conducted by IITs are globally unique for their quality and diversity of question papers. By leveraging IT companies and startups, and following global best practices, India can internationalise these exams, allowing other countries to use them for admissions and certification purposes. This approach could elevate India to its much-desired vishwaguru status.\nProf Rao is vice-chancellor of BITS Pilani group of institutions and former director, IIT Delhi\n\n",

But the Kuwait fire that took 45 Indian lives is a reminder that such networks can also have a dark side.\nTrust and betrayal |\u00a0News that the building in which the deaths took place was a fire hazard waiting to explode \u2013 from cardboard and plastic being used to partition workers into cramped rooms to doors to the rooftop being locked \u2013 was painful enough. A subsequent revelation that an Indian managed the building and also employed most of those who died, somehow felt \u2018worse\u2019. It\u2019s obvious why. Because this now becomes a case where not only was workplace safety not provided in a foreign country, an Indian employer also thought Indians didn\u2019t deserve better. Separately, there is the vexed issue of illegal migration, where trusted stories and agents play an even more fraught role. Indians btw have become the third largest unauthorised immigrant population in US.\nHome and abroad |\u00a0Networks on which Keralites, Gujaratis, Punjabis and others have relied to make legal homes across the world, are an invaluable social and economic resource for India. The Kuwait fire reminds us that even these are not without tales of desertion, betrayal, fraud. Or milder letdowns. Say, students who are happy to have Indian student associations helping them with the commute, housing etc upon landing on foreign campuses, then find these to be oppressively parochial. A public policy that tries to even out all the dingy kinks of human nature will be pointless. Still, GOI should increase its efforts to ensure safe working conditions for migrant Indian workers, whose numbers are bound to keep going up. Experts suggest a national-level migration database will be useful in this direction.\n\n",

The most powerful politician in EU right now, she has been reduced to a blonde stereotype, wink-wink nudge-nudge. Like other women in high offices, Meloni is being seen through a male prism \u2013 hot or not? A few years ago, at talks between Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon, the tabloids compared the bodies of the two politicians, asking: \u2018Never mind Brexit, who won legs-it?\u2019 No matter how influential she is, no matter what she knows or becomes, a woman can always be subjected to such demeaning framing. Her power is almost a red rag, an invitation to take her down.\nOur images of public authority are inevitably male and larger than life. In our power structures, man is the norm and women are seen as aberrations who \u2018broke barriers\u2019 to get there. Because men see women as either sexual objects or nurturers, women who aspire to high office have to actively live down these ideas, or exploit them, by playing the parts to their own benefit. Ignoring these stereotypes is not easy, nor is pretending to be a man. Hillary Clinton was cast as a scary emasculator for being openly ambitious.

        "full_article": "As we prepare to celebrate this year's Eid-ul-Azha, it is crucial to reflect on the deeper meanings behind its rituals: sacrifice, sharing, and unity. We cannot overstate the significance of these values at a time when our nation is going through multiple challenges, ranging from economic turmoil and rising inflation to democratic decline and environmental degradation.\nFirstly, the spirit of sacrifice is more relevant than ever. Our nation has faced significant trials recently. Many of our fellow citizens have been severely affected by the rising prices of essentials, making it difficult for them to afford basic necessities. Prices have gone further up in the week leading up to Eid\u2014which is not unusual during festivals\u2014but for a people seeing the average inflation rate hover above 9 percent for the past two years, it means more painful adjustments. Moreover, many in the coastal regions are yet to recover from the devastating effects of Cyclone Remal and recent floods. In such times, it is crucial to extend our hands to those in need\u2014a burden shared is really a burden halved. This is, however, not to take away from the responsibilities of the government which must roll out special measures to help the most vulnerable.\n\nSpeaking of sharing, it is also vital to remember our workforce, particularly those in the garment and textile industries, where the issue of unpaid wages and bonuses continues to be persistent. Reportedly, some factories have not yet fulfilled their financial obligations to workers. Ensuring that workers receive their rightful earnings not only upholds justice but also allows them to celebrate Eid with their loved ones.\n\nThe movement of home-bound people across the country also demands continued monitoring. With millions traveling to their home districts, it is essential to ensure their safety on the roads. We have seen too many tragic incidents mar the festivities in previous years. Already, we have had reports of some accidents and also of a surge in bus fares, which speaks to the lack of regulations in transport sector. Many have also suffered on major highways and at exit points in the capital due to traffic congestions. Therefore, the authorities must take all necessary measures to manage traffic, ensure compliance of traffic/transport rules, and prevent accidents throughout the holiday period.\n\nWe also feel obligated to highlight the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, especially considering the risks of dengue as rainfall events become more frequent. Both citizens and the municipal/local authorities must ensure prompt and proper disposal of animal waste following the sacrificial rites. We also urge on-duty law enforcement officials to ensure that the festive atmosphere is not marred by any untoward incidents. Together, through sharing and caring, we can all make this Eid an enriching experience for everyone.\n",

        "full_article": "This is a memoir written by an author perceived as a \"difficult woman\" pressured to leave the World Bank quietly for making hard but compelling choices in dealing with conflict ridden Myanmar. The book is about how Ellen Goldstein navigated her three years tenure from June 2017 onwards as the country director of the WB in Myanmar. A tenure that brought the end of Ellen's 35 years of dedicated service to the WB. A tenure when Myanmar slipped back from a nascent democracy to a brutal autocracy spearheaded on the civilian side by none other than the winner of Nobel Peace Prize and an icon of human rights Aung San Suu Kyi, known as The Lady.\nThe book has a broad compass with the role of the WB in dealing with all the repercussions of the Rohingya crisis at the center. The style of her writing is a mixture of ambition, discipline and meticulousness. She exhibits an extraordinary stamina for detail. In narrating how she performed her role as the face of the WB in Myanmar, Ellen connects with the reader on a variety of subjects. A self-described \"undiplomatic diplomat\", a child raised on Holocaust history, she speaks her mind on how she grew up, what made her relate to the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas, how she thought she failed as a mother, her moments of fallibility, her disappointments with the erosion of democratic values in America and how geopolitics is prioritised over human rights by the very nations and institutions who pride themselves as human rights advocates and protectors.\nThe novelty of the book is evident from its very organisation. It has 66, yes sixty-six, chapters plus an epilogue totaling 354 pages. Every chapter is crisp and petite with a catchy title and no subsections. They are like separate file tabs, each storing methodically sequenced memories of her stormy assignment in Myanmar. The military junta -- called Tatmadaw -- raged against the Rohingyas two months after Ellen joined amidst great expectations of a resurgent democracy and development in a country isolated from the rest of the world since 1962.\n\"Excitement was so high and expectations so elevated that Myanmar became the fastest-growing World Bank program in the world\", notes Ellen. She was the first WB director in Myanmar, an upgrade to the WB presence reflecting the importance attached to Myanmar's progress in political and economic transition.\nIt will not be an overstatement to describe Ellen as the ambassador of the Samaritan's dilemma of a kind James Buchanan -- who coined the idea -- never imagined. This is not a story of fomenting aid dependence. Nor is it a story about triage. It is a story of not knowing how to aid.\nYou want to do good because that is what international bureaucrats are paid to do. But you are caught between your principal who do not necessarily see what you see as a foot soldier and a client mercilessly annihilating a section of the downtrodden. The intent to do good is challenged by the lack of a bridge to cross over the water muddled by these forces.\nEllen provides a lucid personal account of how she dedicated herself to build that illusive bridge between the WB wallet and the vast number of poor including the remaining Rohingyas who are not even recognised as an ethnic minority. \"The government, ethnic Rakhine people, and most of the Myanmar public call them Bengalis. This is pejorative, like using the N-word to discuss race in America\", observes Ellen.\nIn finding ways to help Myanmar stay on an inclusive development path, Ellen had to \"jump\" off the cliff before she was \"pushed\". She literally lost her job because she refused to play by the bureaucratic playbook in which the optics count more than the real thing. She held her ground until the ground morphed into quick sands. Largely because she was unable to act above and beyond her pay grade to move the needle on the human rights situation at a time when the international community at the top failed to coalesce with The Lady.\nEllen could have been disillusioned more considering where The Lady came from. Suu Kyi was \"denied her family, denied a normal life, yet she never wavered from her devotion to the cause of democracy for her people.\" She embodied everything the development community strived to do in Myanmar. Yet the civilian government she led abetted military coverup and denial while propagating false narratives. Even the limited power the military granted her was not used to promote democracy and protect human rights. She stooped to the lowest of the low in her testimony to the International Court of Justice dismissing the incontrovertible evidence on the crimes committed in Rakhine, expressing no sympathy for the plight of the Rohingya and defending the actions of the Tatmadaw who kept her under house arrest for decades.\nIronically, the Myanmar public did not see Suu Kyi as the villain. Thousands in the streets lined to cheer her ICJ testimony when she returned from Hague almost like a hagiographic character in a novel. \"In their telling, Aung San Suu Kyi is a brilliant political strategist playing the long game for the good of a truly democratic Myanmar. She is a grateful and diminutive figure with a backbone of steel trading today's indignities on the global stage for tomorrow's democratic victory at home,\" observes Ellen. She sleepwalked herself into a situation where the sycophants did not want her to know the real situation assuming she wanted to know.\nYet at the end of the day what did Suu Kyi get? \"Her Faustian bargain with the Tatmadaw has been brought full circle. They brought her to power, and they took it away when their own power was threatened.\" Ellen goes on to ask, \"Why did we ever think it would be different?\" May I add why did Suu Kyi ever think it would be different? She was destined to be at the short side of what she might have perceived as her prescient, long game when she made excuses \"that stand in the way of truth and accountability.\"\nThe aid organisations faced a conundrum. They had to step out of the box, but their feet were frozen in risk averse domain. Even where the intent was above reproach, they struggled to figure out how to help without doing harm. The civilian and military in the government being accustomed to operating in isolation obliterated the firepower of sanctions. It crippled the WB influence because it has no other but only financial tool. It used the tool, nonetheless. From WB alone the \"Rohingya crisis cost Myanmar well over a billion dollars in foregone assistance\", reports Ellen.\nThe potency of the UN's political clout was not only limited by divided views amongst the veto powers in the Security Council but also by transactional motives. Ellen's following metaphor encapsulates the dynamic: \"The relationship between Myanmar and the United Nations is like an old married couple. They bicker constantly yet are deeply dependent on one another.\"\nThe geopolitics could not have been more complex. \"The US administration avoided declaring genocide to ensure we could all stay engaged. The Chinese wanted us to promote stability in Rakhine and Myanmar as a whole. The Japanese favored positive encouragement to prevent a turn toward China.\" The Australians and the Europeans wanted progress towards democracy and global integration. The Saudis and other Muslim majority countries wanted protecting the Rohingya and other Muslim minorities. The ASEAN members of Southeast Asia wanted partnering with the WB to influence the Myanmar government.\nA tall and conflicting agenda in a country where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs functions as a Ministry \"to ward of foreigners, not a ministry to implement foreign policy.\" Military propaganda in five decades inculcated the belief \"that outsiders are intent on destroying an independent Myanmar,\" a belief shared not just by the common people but also Suu Kyi.\nEllen quotes from her conversation with Ben Rhodes, former US President Obama's Deputy National Security Adviser: \"Suu Kyi's fall from grace offers a lesson about resting all our hopes in one individual -- the weight of a country is too heavy to place on one person's shoulders... It speaks to a failure of many of us in the West, who are guilty of sometimes viewing political dilemmas in complicated countries as simple morality plays with a single star at the center.\" Amen!\nThe UN agencies continued to prioritise development goals, humanitarian access and quiet diplomacy. This failed. But they wouldn't admit it. Instead, they would find scapegoats among workers on the ground, current and just past. Advocating to do the right things is far easier than making it happen \"in an environment where neither the government nor public opinion favors it.\" Ellen's predicament was no different. The WB did change its assistance strategy to incorporate inclusion and peace as filters while stopping budget support that could be seen as supporting the military. She risked death by a thousand cuts in trying to stay engaged.\nAt the end, Ellen herself was disengaged. Read the book to find out how and why. Damned if you do indeed. Ellen learnt it the hard way. Her memoir is a \"story of trying to do good and do right in complex moral circumstances.\" The jury is still out on how much difference her legacy has or will make to directly help remaining Rohingya and facilitate the return of the million plus in Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "Police officers are often one of the first responders to an emergency. The public places a high social value and trust in their police as they have an obligation to protect. But the acts of gross police misconduct provoke fundamental questions: what if we need to be protected from the supposed protector? Do police officers serve the interest of the public? The issue of police brutality has gained more global traction in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet many communities deem the issues of police violence to be a fringe issue that does not affect them directly. When injustice is part and parcel of the system, it is inevitable that it will manifest on our doorsteps and in our homes. Police force is ultimately an expression of state power and coercion.\nThe police killings of Win Rozario and Sayed Faisal, Bangladeshi American youth, have been devastating for the diaspora. In both incidents, killing came as a response to a mental health crisis. Both Faisal and Win were shot as a response to non-criminal calls, when they needed help. The instances of non-criminal domestic disturbance calls ending in police killings are numerous. The American Public Health Association posits that police violence limits the minority community's ability to achieve good health outcomes. The rampant and poignant crisis of police killings is a case of double jeopardy for the Bangladeshi American community: the Bangladeshi community's help seeking behaviour is limited as mental health and help seeking are generally discouraged and stigmatised in a system that is disinclined to provide social support and health services particularly to communities living on the margins.\nShahana Hanif, the first Bangladeshi American member of New York City Council and a leading progressive voice in the community, mentioned how there are many Bangladeshis serving the law enforcement establishment at different levels and before police killed Win, there was a dearth of critical discourse on police violence on minority communities. She mentioned that police officers are trained to de-escalate but they continue to harm communities of colour. The crisis for the community is intensified further when the city continues to cut funding for social services and go above and beyond to fund the police.\nBangladeshi Americans make up one of the fastest growing low-income communities in cities like New York. The long history of documented immigration of Bangladeshis go way back but the recent profile of the Bangladeshi migrant community is defined by the migration pattern starting in during the third wave of Bangladeshi immigration post 1981, when more working class Bangladeshis started migrating to major urban centres. This community experiences acute health disparities and neglect, coupled with high rates of discrimination and low social support\u2014added to the stressors of being in a recently settled immigrant household. Lack of meaningful access to resources also derails help seeking in the community. Win's and Faisal's deaths should not be moments of reckoning for the Bangladeshi community only, but for the whole of America as the processes that led to these heartbreaking outcomes sit on matrix of systemic bias, neglect, discrimination, inequality, and model minority mindset where \"positive\" stereotypes of Asians as hardworking, docile and apolitical migrants pushes the South Asian and Bangladeshi diaspora in the United States to excel at the expense of meeting their needs.\nThe negative verdict on Faisal's case is not surprising: a Massachusetts judge found that the officer was justified in shooting Faisal. Oftentimes the rationale of self-defence, police being responsive to their training rules, overvaluation of police witness and narrative over non-police witness play pivotal roles in decision making. Bringing a criminal charge resulting in an ultimate criminal conviction in cases of police killings is an uphill battle\u2014with bottlenecks on every step of the legal system that confirm systemic bias and provide broad impunity to the police. Standards of criminal law dictating use of lethal force by police are ambiguous and tilt towards favouring the law enforcement establishment. Prosecutors and district attorneys are usually disinclined to charge or convict their own police officers and place more faith on the police narrative as they are reliant on the police for their work.\u00a0\nPolice also receive privilege under criminal law as they have special justification for use of deadly force. There are also broader political and cultural issues around law enforcement, guns and safety advanced by special interest groups, police unions and politicians that need to be considered to comprehend the intricacies around police violence. If the police officer \"reasonably\" believes that use of lethal force must be used to prevent harm to self or others, then that is seen as enough of a justification for violence resulting in death. The cost of police killing is not as well documented, but it is mainly borne by the victim's family and the health care system, in some cases the city government if the case reaches a settlement\u2014very small percentage of claims ever reach settlement. Killing comes at a minimal cost to the police department as many cases are squashed in the administrative reviews and procedures. The officers responsible for killing are usually put on paid administrative leave or modified duty and are eventually reassigned. If there are any sanctions on the police officer, they are usually recorded as disciplinary expenditure on the police department budget\u2014not categorised as cost related to the use of lethal force. Regardless, police departments continue to get funded without much promise for change. Only a handful of major US cities have signed consent decrees\u2014a legally binding performance improvement plan.\nLaw enforcement officers can only use life-threatening force when responding to a threat or use of deadly force. Win had a pair of scissors and Faisal had a knife. Would holding a knife or a pair of scissors in the presence of police officers armed with high calibre weapons count as using deadly force? What relative capacity of harm do these weapons possess compared to a gun used by a trained police officer with far more capacity for harm and damage? Knife is considered to be a weapon of deadly force under the twenty-one-foot rule which posits that the holder of a knife can cover a distance of 21 feet in the time it takes to fire two shots. All such minute technicalities and rules stand in favour of the police officer who decides to use force. Did Win and Faisal's reaction, triggered through unaddressed mental health issues, constitute grave danger for the police? Did the victims substantially provoke police's use of lethal force?\nPointing a weapon or something that reasonably looks like a weapon is seen as one of the most common triggers for the police to use their firearm. One detail about police misconduct is important to note: any police misconduct is counted as a single act of applying deadly force\u2014if the first shot from the police's gun is seen as justified, then that covers all subsequent shots and use of force and justifies any additional aggression. Liam McMahon shot Faisal a total of six times\u2014and regardless of how many times the police would shoot, if the first shot is concluded as a justified shot, so are all the shots, even though death rate is much higher in cases where multiple shots are fired. Number of gunshots has a predictive value for death. Therefore, there is no disincentive for the police officer to use additional force or shoot additional times that lead to deaths.\nRecent innovations in monitoring police conduct are only making incremental and gradual changes. In my conversation with Tanvir Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Association of New England, he mentioned how pleading for justice for Faisal pushed the Cambridge police to improve their policies, wear body cameras and led the city to consider alternate social service for emergency response. Regardless of minor innovations, issues of poor governance remain unaddressed, and the police continue to have major control over visual evidence. Public who film violence also put themselves at risk of being subjected to police misconduct\u2014ultimately undermining non-police public witness narrative.\nAccording to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, the main reasons for the police wearing body cameras is to improve officer safety and reduce liability of police departments. However, small scale experimental studies have shown that the use of body cameras has the potential to improve police conduct. Video evidence has been pivotal for garnering public reaction, but it does not guarantee ease in bringing criminal charges or prosecution. Evidence would also not weigh in as much in instances where there are irregularities in disclosure. The bone chilling last moment of Win's life has been recorded; the public can hear his mother repeatedly pleading to the police not to shoot her son. It is yet to be seen how public reaction and the video evidence of violence shapes the investigation and verdict in Win's case, but it has the potential to boost and prolong the campaign for justice. It was only in 2020 that Section 50-a of New York City's Civil Rights Law, which kept disciplinary records of police officers hidden from the public, was repealed after almost a decade-long fight. Any change is hard-won. While the avenue for criminal prosecution might be exhausted with the ruling in Faisal's case, Tanvir sees possibilities in civil litigation. The way Faisal was portrayed in the media in the aftermath of his undue death, caused his family severe distress. It is critical to pursue justice in the face of this gridlock to continue to honour and humanise our people.\nShould the police be left out of the public safety plan then? Officers receiving training in de-escalation are quick to resort to lethal force, would calling the police for help entail an inevitable deadly outcome? Police violence, brushed off as a non-issue for the Asian and Bangladeshi community in America, has hit hard and hit home this time. For now, the only promise of change can be found in Win and Faisal's families and communities that continue to fight for justice.\nSarzah Yeasmin\u00a0is a Boston-based Bangladeshi writer.
