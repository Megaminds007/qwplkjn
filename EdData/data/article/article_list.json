The State has gained a particular notoriety for its politicians brazenly switching sides in utter disregard for the people\u2019s verdict. BJP Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has succeeded in splitting the Goa Congress twice in three years. In the previous Assembly, 15 of the 17 Congress MLAs left the party, a majority of them for the BJP. In the February Assembly election, the Congress fielded a large number of newcomers. All 37 of its candidates had twice taken a \u2018loyalty pledge,\u2019 once with leader Rahul Gandhi, in a temple, a church and a dargah, and signed affidavits vowing not to defect. All the gods could do little to prick the conscience of these MLAs who betrayed the mandate. If anything, all that drama only made this latest episode of the curse that much more of a mockery of democracy. It is not that Goa is the only place where this happens \u2014 in Bihar, the recent realignment in which the JD(U) replaced the BJP with the RJD as its partner amounted to dishonouring the popular verdict. Bihar was a rare instance of the BJP being at the receiving end of its own strategy.The party has swung back, and in style, in Goa, though it did not need any more MLAs to be in power. In the 40-member strong Assembly, it had 20 MLAs of its own and support from three independents and two MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP). With the merger of eight Congress MLAs, the government now has the support of 33. The Congress has lost its capacity to be an effective opposition. This was in the making for months now, and the Congress had tried to avert it. As soon as it got wind of the move, the Congress removed Michael Lobo from the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Digambar Kamat from his position of being a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC). While both Mr. Lobo and Mr. Kamat have cited disaffection with the Congress high command as reasons, the true reasons are all too transparent. Despite serving as a Congress CM, Mr. Kamat, a seven-time MLA from Margao, has a history of being with the BJP as he was one of the four BJP MLAs who won in 1994. In 2014, the BJP had linked him with a multi-crore mining scam case, whose probe is still hanging over his head. BJP Minister Viswajit Rane had called for an investigation into Mr. Lobo\u2019s assets. Mr. Lobo and his wife Delilah are among the richest MLAs in the coastal State. With the defections of Aleixo Sequeira and Rodolfo Fernandes, the BJP now has a strong foothold in the Catholic-dominated South Goa. Mr. Kamat has said he went back to the temple and got the god\u2019s permission to renege on his pledge of loyalty to the Congress. The people of Goa, meanwhile, are left wondering whether their vote makes any difference.",

        "full_article": "A Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India U.U. Lalit is now examining the validity of the 103rd Constitutional Amendment, which provides for 10% reservation to the economically weaker sections (EWS), excluding Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who already have reservation in higher education institutions and government jobs. The Bench has finalised three issues for hearing \u2014 whether the amendment has breached the Constitution\u2019s basic structure by permitting the state to make special provisions; whether it does so in relation to admissions to private unaided institutions and, lastly, if the exclusion of OBC/SC/ST communities from the scope of the quota tramples on the basic structure. These are valid questions and it could be argued that the legislation of the reservation in 2019 was done hastily without due diligence of the criteria adopted. For example, the setting of an annual family income of \u20b98 lakh as a ceiling to determine if someone belongs to the EWS is clearly problematic. If available consumer expenditure surveys such as the NSSO report, \u2018Key Indicators of Household Consumer Expenditure, 2011-12\u2019, are relied on, a large chunk of the population will be eligible for reservations in the \u201cbelow Rs. 8 lakh\u201d EWS category and not just the truly deserving sections of the poor. A government-appointed committee submitted that this ceiling was reasonable, but it could not adequately explain how the income criterion was \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the one for the OBC creamy layer. Also, the \u20b98 lakh figure did not correspond to any data on the estimated number of EWS persons in the population with incomes related to it.Petitioners have also argued that the net effect of the exclusion of Backward Classes and SC/ST aspirants from the EWS has been that they are now denied an opportunity to compete in the general category to the extent of 10%, in effect, limiting the quota to the \u201cforward classes\u201d. This is a valid argument. Even if the Court agrees to maintain that reservations can be provided on economic basis \u2014 something that has been explicitly denied so far with only social and educational backwardness being mentioned in the Constitution and reiterated in several judgments \u2014 excluding people of certain communities from this benefit despite their belonging to the EWS renders the legislation discriminatory. In recent recruitment and entrance examinations such as the UPSC and JEE, marks cut-offs for admissions were lower for the EWS quota than that of the OBCs. In essence, if an income criterion for identifying the economically weaker sections has to be the basis, it must arrive at a clearly determined figure for the limit unlike the \u20b98 lakh figure, and all sections of society, irrespective of caste, should be eligible to avail of reservation under this category.",

The formal agenda includes stock-taking of SCO\u2019s two-decade journey and talks on ways to enhance cooperation in future. Of greater significance are the bilateral meetings on the summit\u2019s sidelines. Modi\u2019s departure statement said that he would meet some of the attendees including President S Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan. SCO, dominated by China, India and Russia, accounts for 40% of the global population and about 30% of its GDP, giving it heft among inter-government groupings.\nA majority of SCO\u2019s membership has a pronounced anti-Western position. Yet, India\u2019s participation in SCO makes sense as it\u2019s in sync with its approach of strategic autonomy. Geopolitics today is in flux and India has done well to pursue a path of enlightened self-interest and seize opportunities. To illustrate, India didn\u2019t import crude oil from either Russia or the US in the April-June 2021 quarter. In April-June 2022, in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, crude imports from Russia and the US were $6.2 billion and $2.6 billion respectively, propelling both into India\u2019s top five sources of crude imports. Given this context, a bilateral meeting between Modi and Putin, if it happens, will be crucial.\nStill, likely gains from SCO will be limited on account of China. Modi and Xi have not had a face-to-face meeting since the PLA\u2019s aggression in eastern Ladakh in 2020. Also present at the summit is Pakistan\u2019s new PM Sharif. Given the structural nature of disputes India has with both China and Pakistan, bilateral meetings on summit sidelines are inadequate to make meaningful progress.\nSCO is a reminder of the need to be pragmatic in diplomacy as even adversaries cannot decouple economically. For instance, Japan and Australia, members of the Quad, have chosen tighter economic integration with China through the RCEP FTA. Given this backdrop, India\u2019s pursuit of strategic autonomy and investing in areas where there is an overlap of interests between countries is a wise course in a fluid geopolitical situation. The more groups you are part of, the wider your options.\n\n",

These additions don\u2019t always go smoothly, and they are also piling up. Hattees\u2019 demand for ST status in HP is resented by Dalits in the region. Gujjars in Rajasthan agitated for ST status, driven by the grouse that Meenas benefited from it. Now they are slotted as MBCs in a 5% bracket. Meanwhile, Maharashtra\u2019s OBC quota in local body elections has been ratified by SC after the state satisfied the triple test laid down by the court to grant reservation. In the south, Tamil Nadu has mastered this dubious game.\nFrom the earlier formulation of reservation as an exception to the norm, the exception has begun to dwarf the norm. EWS quota, currently before a constitution bench, tips central reservations well over the 50% line. And it\u2019s not just that 77% of Jharkhand\u2019s government jobs will now be in the reserved pool, many states are similarly inching towards the 100% mark, leaving little for merit.\nMany see quotas as avenues easing their access to higher education, employment and official schemes. That\u2019s true in a limited sense \u2013 because the number of government jobs, seats in government education institutions and even welfare schemes face hard budget constraints, and relative to demand their availability is going down. So, more and more castes end up fighting for a shrinking pie \u2013 while the one big truth about India\u2019s socio-economic change in the last three decades is that reforms have pulled millions out of poverty. In fact, an IMF study recently estimated that absolute poverty is history in India. Yes, there are pockets of relative deprivation and there is a persistent jobs problem at the lower end of the labour market. Neither are there enough seats in higher education. But reservations solve none of this. Social groups that agitate for quotas must understand this basic fact.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In about two months, on the second Tuesday of November, as is the tradition, mid-term national elections in the United States will be held \u2013 mid-term because the current Presidential term will run up to January 20, 2025. The November poll will be observed intently across the globe because it will determine if the two houses of the US Congress \u2013 as well as all 50 state legislatures, at least 36 state governorships, and other important state level offices \u2013 will be controlled by President Joe Biden's Democratic Party or the Republican Party, in which former President Donald Trump wields great influence.\nThe contrasting stance and postures of two dominant parties in the US have global consequences for international economy, trade, security, super-power relationships, climate change issues and the future of democracy.\nThe conventional wisdom is that, in the mid-term polls, the incumbent president's party is at a disadvantage. The expectation is that the current razor-thin margin for the Democrats in the Senate and a stronger majority in the House would be lost to the Republicans. But a recent Supreme Court Ruling issued by Trump-appointed conservative Justices that seriously limits abortion rights established half-century ago in 1973 has energised opposition to the Republican Party.\nThe revelations of the Congressional enquiry of January 6, 2020 invasion of the Capitol building by protestors and Trump's role in it as the sitting president brought home again to many non-partisan citizens the threat to democracy that Trump supporters posed. They persist in justifying the insurrectionists' cause of over-turning the 2020 presidential election. The FBI raid in August on Trump's Mar-a-Lago ocean-front resort in Palm Beach, Florida to retrieve hundreds of secret and sensitive state documents that Trump squirreled away in the basement added to the sordid drama.\nDemocrats, therefore, have picked up some momentum this election cycle. Opinion polls suggest that the possibility of Democrats holding on to their narrow majority in the two houses of Congress and improving their position in the states cannot be ruled out.\nPresident Biden, on September 1, delivered an unusual prime-time nationally televised speech from the steps of the Independence Hall in Philadelphia (where the debate on framing the American Constitution was held two and a half centuries ago). He declared that MAGA Republican extremism and its influence throughout the country were a threat to democracy in the US. MAGA stands for Make America Great Again, the jingoist rallying cry of Trump and his followers.\n\"I believe America is at an inflection point,\" Biden said, \"One of those moments that determine the shape of everything that's to come after. And now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards.\" If the President's message reaches a large enough number of citizens and they turn up at the November polls, there may be a push back on the assault on democracy and democratic institutions in the country.\nI wrote earlier on July 4, on the independence anniversary of the US, about democracy being on life support around the world \u2013 in the US, South Asia, and Bangladesh. To stick to the metaphor, we may say that intensive care for democracy has to continue.\nBiden's \"inflection point\" applies to Bangladesh, too, as the preparation and strategising by the ruling party and the opposition begin for the 12th parliamentary election in about 16 months.\nI had written that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, thinking about her legacy for the next generation, can consider four steps, including nominating candidates for their honesty, competence, popularity and record of public service, rather than the money and muscle power; shunning the use of\u00a0mastaans, muscle power, intimidation and violence by the ruling party and its candidates; supporting the Election Commission to conduct a free and fair election; and strongly discouraging factional, communal, sectarian, and religious divisions for political gains and reclaiming the liberation ideals of justice, inclusion and human dignity for all. These steps would lead to Bangladesh being a model of liberal democracy in the region and also secure election victory for the ruling party. But it has to prove its bona fides through action, not just words.\nThe signs do not look promising. PM Hasina at the BCL event on August 31 complained about the media blowing out of proportion any infraction of the student wing of the ruling party. It is reported that BCL is set to establish its presence in private universities, so far protected from partisan politics. This would be a recipe for disaster, further aggravating the already looming crisis in higher education in the country.\nThe Election Commission has not shown any indication so far of taking a firm stance against potential transgressions of fair election practices. One example is its equivocal position on the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) without a paper trail, thus subjecting it to undetected manipulation.\nPolice and law-enforcing agencies have continued suppressing opposition gatherings and protests, leading to injuries and fatalities, despite government undertaking to the contrary.\nWe must not miss the opportunity to halt the slide down the slippery slope of oligopoly and authoritarianism before it is too late. Nurturing democracy in good faith is the only way to secure a future for the nation to be marked by genuine progress and peace.\nDr Manzoor Ahmed\u00a0is professor emeritus at Brac University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The road network of rural Bangladesh offers fascinating insights into the state of rural economy and social life. I recently had a very helpful experience of visiting several villages in the Jashore-Kushtia region and seeing the roads that connect them to what have been dubbed \"growth centres,\" zila, upazila, and union headquarters, as well as national and regional highways.\nBangladesh's total road network covers nearly 3,80,000 km, of which a whopping 94 percent are rural roads. Out of the country's 87,223 villages, more than 70,000 villages are considered well connected through a web of rural roads. According to a 2018 survey, the Rural Access Indicator (RAI)\u2013 the percentage of the rural populace living within 2 km of all-weather roads\u2013 was estimated at 83.5 percent. Nobody would dispute that rural connectivity is central to not only rural advancement but also the nation's progressive agenda. The quality and improvement of rural roads determine the quality of economic and social life of over 60 percent of the country's total population that reside in rural areas.\nMy observation during the recent trip was that the first-generation of rural roads played a crucial role in what I would like to call Rural Transformation 1.0 in Bangladesh during the decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. But those roads have become inadequate during what could be called Rural Transformation 2.0, taking place between 2000 and 2020, during which economic, social, and cultural lives in rural Bangladesh changed dramatically due to a diverse range of catalysts.\nI would like to argue that, for the next generation of rural transformation, we need the next generation of \"smart\" rural roads to be in sync with the imagination of and strategy for an equitable Bangladesh built on the twin foundations of social justice and environmental adaptability. Social justice in road construction includes road safety for all users, including rural pedestrians, bicyclists, and livestock. Environmental adaptability in this case implies that rural roads should be able to withstand the vagaries of climate change, flooding, disasters, and seasonal impacts.\nBut, first, let us explore a brief history of rural roads in Bangladesh. The early 1960s rural development programmes \u2013 broadly known as the \"Comilla Model\" \u2013 emphasised the construction of rural roads as part of a modernisation philosophy. The Comilla Model was conceived by the Government during the Pakistan-era \"decade of development\" (1958-1968) as a policy tool for providing support for increased agricultural productivity. Then, in 1984, the Government of Bangladesh initiated a strategy for Rural Development Projects seeking to improve the quality of life in rural areas.\nThe first of these projects was building physical infrastructures including roads, storage, and markets. Established in 1992, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), under the Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives, was responsible for the construction and maintenance of the upazila roads, union roads, and village roads. The legendary role of Engineer Quamrul Islam Siddique (a BUET alumnus) in establishing LGED and spearheading the construction of rural roads during the 1990s has become an essential narrative of Bangladesh's development trajectory.\nLater, in 1996, the Government of Bangladesh and the World Bank developed the Bangladesh Rural Infrastructure Strategy Study, reemphasising the integration of zila, upazila, and union headquarters and growth centres into a comprehensive rural communication network. Well-connected villages began to yield an expanding rural economy, comprising both farm and non-farm activities.\nYet, the prevailing idea of rural roads fell short of a sustainable (and socially just) notion of infrastructure that would both be sympathetic to the traditional ways of rural life and meet the needs of rural modernisation. For example, LGED's overarching consideration for rural roads has been motorised mobility, while the traditional practice of the walking peasant, fisherman, and other village entrepreneurs has been ignored. Even today, inter-village and intra-village movements in Bangladesh occur predominantly by walking and, more recently, biking. When a leguna or a truck passes by on the village road, the pedestrian villager must stop and step aside precariously since there is almost no space between the road and the adjacent agricultural fields three or four feet below.\nDuring Rural Transformation 2.0, the rural pedestrian and other non-motorised locomotion continued to be ignored in road construction and improvement. The 2004 Gazette of the Government did not determine the width of village roads. The 2010 Gazette set it at 10 feet at a 5 percent increased cost. Under the Seventh Five Year Plan (7FYP, 2016-2020), LGED's exclusive focus on motorised mobility, road width, and improvement failed to acknowledge how pedestrian villagers traditionally move around in their daily lives and their road safety.\nThe strategic priorities for the rural road network in the Eighth Five Year Plan (8FYP, 2020-2025) state: \"LGED will upgrade and maintain the rural road network in the master plan. The road network will be developed in a way to withstand floods and disasters, which will connect the growth centre/markets, villages and upazila roads. The upazila road network will connect with the economic zones, special economic zones, export processing zones, industries, land ports, river ports, seaports, and railway stations.\" Here, motorised mobility and economic connectivity take precedence over rural liveability. Pedestrian road safety is overlooked, giving rise to a policy question on social inclusivity. While inter-village and intra-village connectivity has been emphasised, the quality of movement on village roads remains uncertain.\nWhat I noticed during my visit to villages in the Jashore-Kushtia region, Narsingdi district, and Anwara Upazila in southern Chattogram, was a wide range of motorised vehicles plying on village roads. From bhotbhoti and nosimon to private cars and construction trucks whiz by at an ever-increasing frequency, a stark contrast to our entrenched mental image of the tranquil Bengal village.\nI saw school children walking inches away from speeding poultry-feed trucks. The sight of school children walking to their schools in groups is one of the most uplifting scenes in rural areas. But how concerned are we about their safety on village roads? Understanding the new reality of rural Bangladesh must be freed from a singular focus on economic progress. The humanistic rurality of\u00a0Pather Panchali\u00a0does not exist anymore. There is a New Rural, inspiring, complex, and contradictory all at the same time. Researching the New Rural would require a multidisciplinary approach.\nWhile vehicular movement at a higher frequency certainly means a burgeoning rural economy, village roads also reveal that our rural road master planning, unfortunately, replicates the same lack of concern for pedestrian safety that plagues our city streets. The magnitude of fatal and non-fatal road traffic injuries (RTI) among the country's rural communities has been on a sharp rise. Rural Bangladesh needs the next generation of streets that value the safety and wellbeing of all those who use rural roads, while facilitating efficient connectivity between different administrative headquarters and growth centres.\nAdnan Zillur Morshed\u00a0is a professor of architecture and planning at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, and Executive Director of the Centre for Inclusive Architecture and Urbanism at BRAC University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\"I put in more than 10 years of service and believed that my company was my world. I have never been sick before. In 2015 when I fell ill and was hospitalised, my employer refused to cover the costs. My work associates pooled resources for my treatment and family had to sell land to pay for my hospital bills. I never thought my employer would do this to me.\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Atiq Mia, 34, Tangail, worked in a southeast-Asian country.\n\"We didn't have health cards and thus could not go to the hospital when we fell sick. We simply took medicines that some of us had carried along from home, hoping we would get well.\"\u2013\u00a0Masum Billah, 31, Cumilla, worked in a Gulf state.\n\"There were restrictions on how much water we could use.\"\u2013\u00a0Mamun Sheikh, 28, worked in a Gulf state.\nThe above statements of three returnee migrant workers capture and convey the stark insecurity of the healthcare needs of migrant workers in the Gulf states and even elsewhere. The health vulnerability of this cohort of workers has thus far received scant attention in policy discourses of the countries of origin (CoO) and destination (CoD).\nWhile the origin states' primary focus remains national security and the workers' immigration and employment status, it is the workers' remittance flow that dominates the policy agenda of the origin states with dissemination of information on safe and regular migration, skills development and remittance utilisation patterns gradually creeping up in the policy agenda. With their focus on none-the-lesser issues such as information dissemination, financial literacy, access to justice and the like, the non-governmental sector's engagement with migrants' health issues in the CoOs is also minimal and almost non-existent in the CoDs. Likewise, the matter is yet to gain traction in the celebrated regional and global processes such as the Global Forum on Migration Development, the Colombo Process, and the Abu Dhabi Dialogue.\nThe experiences of short-term migrant workers after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic have clearly brought to light the precarious nature of healthcare structures that exist for this group of workers, who build and maintain the edifice of national economies for many host states. The pandemic also exposed that their access to healthcare remains severely restricted, even if it is acknowledged on paper.\nAs a necessary condition of their employment, short-term contract workers are subjected to a formal health check-up before they can secure their work visa. In most instances, they are required to undergo such tests at diagnostic centres that are approved by the embassy concerned. The young men and women can only fly abroad for work if they are assessed as being medically fit. However, instances are replete in which migrants are sent back home for failing the second health screening that is conducted after their arrival in the CoD. The question therefore arises: Should not the destination countries be liable for the consequence, as the primary test was done in facilities that they had authorised?\nA pertinent question arises as to why a section of motivated young men and women, who had successfully passed medical tests in both CoOs and CoDs, would suffer from various ailments (that are not generally associated with their age group) and require medical services.\nThe answer perhaps lies in the long working hours, absence of rest periods during extended shifts, exposure to heat, unsafe work conditions, etc. Workplace accidents, inadequate health and safety measures, and lack of safety gear and training are also important contributing factors. Unhygienic living conditions, often in crammed dormitories, lead to infections. Ill and degrading treatment including physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, not being placed in promised jobs, non-payment or irregular payment of wages and other entitlements, and lack of access to any redress mechanism subject our workers to mental harm and are likely to a take toll on their physical wellbeing as well.\nThe health vulnerability of female domestic workers is particularly acute. Restrictions imposed on their movement make it difficult for them to secure medical services and products such as sanitary materials. Many suffer from a feeling of isolation. Lack of privacy exacerbates their feeling of insecurity. It is the migrants in irregular status who suffer the most. In addition to their limited financial capacity to pay for medical services, the fear of getting reported by the hospital authorities precludes them from securing such services from formal institutions even in life-threatening conditions.\nIn the ongoing Vital Signs-RMMRU study on migrant workers' access to healthcare services, it was found that: (a) Migrant workers have little knowledge about the availability and entitlement of healthcare services in destination countries; (b) Most migrant workers are not covered by insurance and thus are constrained when accessing healthcare services; (c) There is a palpable absence of employers taking responsibility if workers fall sick; (d) Absence of medical coverage may lead to situations in which migrant workers have to sell property at home to clear medical bills in the CoDs; (e) The missions have little capacity to ensure employers bear the responsibility of workers' health needs or render any form of support or advise in this regard; (g) There is a propensity of migrant workers to self-medicate by taking medicine they or their peers have brought along from home.\nA recent RMMRU dialogue on the healthcare needs of migrant workers, the participants underscored that the CoOs should insist that the CoDs enter into bilateral agreements containing provisions for protection of migrant workers, including those on accessing healthcare. Such provisions should ensure that workers in the CoDs are employed in decent work (including eight-hour workdays with adequate rest, leisure, and a safe workplace) and living conditions (with hygienic facilities and access to adequate water). It should also stipulate that employers are responsible for meeting the healthcare needs of the migrant workers they employ and that the work contracts should include adequate (not only nominal) insurance coverage.\nProvisions should be kept so that employers do not abuse the illness of workers as an excuse to terminate their contacts. The CoOs should also empower and strengthen the offices of labour wings for their missions to monitor compliance with these provisions. The missions should also actively ensure that companies that are at the top of the global supply chain engaging migrant workers are responsible for the actions of all, including that of labour supply companies.\nOne of the key challenges identified has been the pervasive nature of \"free visa\" that facilitates migrant workers' engagement in undefined, insecure, and exploitative employment relationships \u2013 without any entitlements, including that of healthcare coverage. It was felt that, while \"free visas\" shore up the flow of workers, they also account for many of the ills that beset workers in the destination countries. Such a situation calls for providing incentive and support to the registered recruiting agents to help them procure company visas for skill-based labour markets and ensure fair and ethical recruitment.\nThe issue of high charges that migrants are subjected to for their pre-departure health check-up at embassy-approved medical facilities also figured in the dialogue. Concerns were expressed about the quality of equipment used for such tests (that may partly explain the variation in test results at two ends) and the unethical practices of many of these centres in which results are tampered to overcharge the service recipients.\nDuring the workers' pre-departure orientation and also in the countries of destination, migrants should be adequately briefed on having a balanced diet of nutritious food, adequate sleep, regular hydration, wearing safety gear while working in hazardous conditions, etc. The CoOs must consider setting up a separate fund and disbursement system to meet the needs of sick, abused, and traumatised migrant workers, who often return with health and mental conditions that demand immediate attention.\nMany CoDs are currently pursuing reform agendas that will impact their migrant workforce. The abolition of the Kafala (sponsorship) system by some states has been a welcome development. While those states rightly celebrate their successes in addressing the healthcare needs of their nationals, it's time they pay due attention to large deficits that exist in the healthcare services for their migrant workforce. Such a move will not only portray them to be caring destination countries for migrant workers, but will also help meet their obligations and commitments under the ILO labour standards, the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, and the Global Compact for Migration.\nThe author acknowledges the insights drawn from the RMMRU organised Obhibashon Alochona on Labour Migrants' Health on August 8, 2022 that was attended by senior state functionaries, researchers, civil society activists, media representatives and medical practitioners.\nDr C R Abrar\u00a0is an academic and human rights expert.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The journey of public-private partnership (PPP) in Bangladesh began officially in 2010 through the formulation of the PPP policy guidelines, which was followed by the Public-Private Partnership Act, 2015. Subsequently, this policy framework, led by favourable political leadership, oversaw an upsurge in PPP projects, particularly in energy and infrastructure.\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, the same has not happened. So far, only eight health projects have been conceived under PPP, and only two have reached operational stages. While PPP can be an effective tool to plug the gaps in healthcare infrastructure, as examples from different countries demonstrate, PPP projects can be tricky because success depends on a holistic policy framework that can address all aspects of healthcare. Different countries, including those from low to middle-income groups, have used PPP in healthcare, and their experiences can give us insight to how it can be utilised in Bangladesh as well.\nTake, for example, the Lesotho national referral hospital, where a Public Private Integrated Partnership (PPIP) was established for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa, or in a lower income country. In 2011, a private consortium of hospital operators and partners was contracted to design, build and construct a 425-bed hospital and attached gateway clinics, and then provide all clinical and non-clinical services for 18 years. Of the USD 160 million budget, approximately 40 percent came from the government, a lion's share from development groups, and a small equity portion from private partners. But, with this facility, the government greatly expanded the scope, quality and volume of healthcare services in target areas.\nPeru is a more recent entrant into healthcare PPP, but is the first country in South America to include primary care within the scope of a PPP. Two projects involved the building and operation of new hospitals in Lima, the capital of Peru, each with corresponding primary and urgent care centres. A third project was commissioned to renovate an abandoned building into an ambulatory care center. All three projects follow the DBOD (Design, Build, Operate and Deriver) scheme.\nPublic-private partnerships also had positive impacts in Brazil, where the first PPP in health dramatically improved emergency hospital services for one million people in one of the most underserved districts of Salvador. The hospital was a new 298-bed facility opened in 2010. A consortium of local and foreign companies specialising in facilities management was selected to equip, maintain and operate the hospital services for 10 years, but the responsibility of delivering healthcare to the patients remains with the government.\nFinally, India as a PPP case study demands additional attention, as its healthcare landscape most closely resembles that of our own. Some of the different PPP models and project types tried in India include offering land at subsidised prices for setting-up hospitals, where a part of hospital capacity is reserved for low-income patients; private parties taking over management of primary health care centres (PHCs) as well as rural hospitals; and outsourcing non-clinical services of public hospitals such as, dietary needs, laundry, etc. Specialised departments, such as diagnostics, gastroenterology, etc have also been outsourced in certain areas, as well as social marketing of contraceptives, which were outsourced to professional social marketing NGOs.\nPPP in healthcare can be of different models \u2013 with DBOD and DBOT (Design, Build, Operate and Transfer) being the preferred ones in acute care/hospital projects. Other models also abound, from concessions in the form of subsidised land for hospitals to outsourcing of non-critical hospital services, as well as specialised treatment and testing to private partners.\nWhen designing PPP projects, governments must consider the enhanced socio-economic benefits for target constituents as part of its success criteria and not focus on financial return alone. Private partners must be able to help the public sector in bringing health services to infrastructure-poor localities at affordable prices through expertise in healthcare management and/or access to capital.\nThere are a number of ways that we can engage in more public-private partnerships in healthcare. One is to set up a separate and dedicated government body that deals with healthcare PPP projects only, and update the PPP policy framework to address healthcare projects specifically. This should include details about their financing, services pricing, social imperatives, annual unitary payments, concession terms, etc.\nHigh-end tests or therapies (MRI, PET CT, radiation therapy, etc) and specialty procedures (cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, neurosurgery, etc) can also be referred from public hospitals to private ones, where a portion of the fees are subsidised and investments in costly set-ups are avoided.\nDuring winter, a large portion of private hospitals' capacity remain idle. The government can take advantage of this usable capacity by deferring or scheduling non-emergency patients and procedures from public hospitals to these private facilities. Once again, a portion of the cost can be subsidised, making the services affordable for lower income patients. It also gives the government control over pricing and standards of services in private facilities. Outsourcing non-critical activities (laundry, dietary needs, etc) of large public hospitals to specialised private companies can also bring much needed efficiency and higher quality to existing services.\nAnother way forward is to redesign existing PPP heath projects in the pipeline. Instead of rent seeking, we should focus on securing capacity for low-income patients. Thus, the private partner is also incentivised and does not need to worry about capacity utilisation. The government can also offer subsidised land in tier two cities (as health specialisations are now concentrated in the metros) to proven healthcare operators to build and manage hospitals. Again, it can continue to participate in the service mix by offering subsidies to low-income patients in order to ensure equitable access.\nThis can even be expanded by allowing healthcare operators to run primary/community health centres. The government can still appoint doctors/health professionals (nurse, medical assistant, etc) who will be stationed at the centres, thus boosting the quality of services and also generating employment for trained health professionals.\nFinally, we should also tag national identity cards (NIDs) to individual clinical records (EMR), thus fostering referral from primary care to secondary/tertiary hospitals, and also, from public hospitals to private facilities for more complex or resource-intensive treatments. The NID system can help to identify the target population for subsidies, making sure the benefits reach the deserving ones.\nCurrently, 65 percent of healthcare is provided by the private sector in Bangladesh, but to ensure optimum level of care for all, a joint approach between the public and private sectors, utilising both of their strengths, is essential for developing an equitable and accessible healthcare sector in the country.\nDr A M Shamim\u00a0is managing director at Labaid Group.\n",

        "full_article": "The contrast between what the government promised opposition political parties and its actions on the ground couldn't be starker, as a rundown on the 22 days of BNP's ongoing countrywide protest programme shows. What the government promised them was \u2013 peaceful assembly and freedom of speech. What they are actually having is \u2013 violent assembly and fear of speech/reprisals. While this turnabout is politics 101 in Bangladesh, it also begs the question: was the promise of fair play, and the congeniality expressed in the PM's \"Will offer BNP leaders tea if they come to besiege my office\" comment, at all meant to be taken seriously?\nA report by Prothom Alo shows that between August 22 and September 13, violent attacks and clashes were reported in 48 events of BNP organised as part of a countrywide protest programme against the price hikes of fuel and daily essentials and also the deaths of two of its activists in police shooting in Bhola. Multiple people were injured so far, with BNP claiming to have lost three of its activists as of September 4. In 25 places, houses, vehicles and business establishments of its leaders and activists were vandalised, many of them having since left their neighbourhoods in fear of further reprisals. And in 17 places, section 144 was issued because of Awami League events overlapping with BNP's. Finally, 46 cases were filed in 18 districts.\n\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections.\nBizarrely, though, the official line puts the blame for violence on BNP itself, as if the party brought this all on itself in some sick display of self-loathing or to discredit itself. The truth is, it is the police that stands discredited, firstly because of its partisan role in handling the protests, and secondly, because of its heavy-handed and rather collusive legal response. As a breakdown of the 46 clash-related cases illustrates, 29 were filed by the police and 17 by the leaders of Awami League and affiliated organisations, mostly against their rivals in BNP and affiliated organisations. The total number of accused are 21,709. Of them, 2,777 were named and the rest unnamed \u2013 a classic formula to allow for more names to be added later. More damningly, however, the abovementioned report says that a number of accused were sick, old or overseas, meaning they were nowhere near the protest sites.\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political\u00a0space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections. This, it goes without saying, is not amenable to creating the level playing field so essential for a fair, safe, and participatory election. As things stand, the ruling camp, despite what it said officially and despite demands by independent parties to protect people's right\u00a0to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, appears totally unwilling to allow the opposition to reach the ears of the masses.\nThis is totally unacceptable. We urge the authorities, including the Election Commission, to ensure the opposition is allowed to protest and prepare for the upcoming election. The ruling party must discipline its activists and the police and keep them from infringing upon these inalienable rights of the opposition.\n",

Their wait, unfortunately, is far from over.\nAccording to a report in this daily, a visiting US delegation was dissatisfied with the level of security at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, and their report to the effect may delay Biman's ongoing efforts to resume direct flights between Dhaka and New York. By the foreign minister's own admission \u2013 during a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs on August 8 \u2013 the US delegation gave a negative report because the airport security staff \"barely carry out any checks on foreigners\".\n\nGiven the desperation with which Bangladesh has been pursuing this agenda and the promises of progress made over the past few years, we fail to understand why our authorities did not take the necessary steps to capacitate our security staff and develop and implement an effective safety oversight system.\nThe US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (Caab) in Category 2 after finding irregularities in its operational activities in an investigation in 2006, leading to\u00a0additional restrictions on Bangladesh's airlines flying to the US, including resumption of the sole direct route between the nations.\u00a0According to FAA findings, Bangladesh's aviation regulator runs short of technically qualified personnel. The Bangladesh government has been lobbying for a long time to attain a Category 1 status (which essentially means a state meets the International Civil Aviation Organisation's minimum safety standards) and restore Biman's Dhaka-New York flight. We are disappointed that the talks \u2013 to say nothing of the investment of Bangladesh Biman, which has reportedly already purchased a number of Boeing aircrafts for the flight \u2013 did not materialise in concrete improvements at Dhaka airport.\nOne does not need to be an expert to observe the dire state of security at the airport, which runs on mismanagement, chaos and inefficiency. However, given the desperation with which Bangladesh has been pursuing this agenda and the promises of progress made over the past few years, we fail to understand why our authorities did not take the necessary steps to capacitate our security staff and develop and implement an effective safety oversight system. Gross safety oversights aren't just a concern for US officials \u2013 it's a threat for all passengers boarding planes from the Dhaka airport and also a matter of national security.\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, there were around 208,000 Bangladeshis living in the United States as of 2019, and Bangladeshi Americans were among the fastest-growing origin groups, with their number surging 263 percent over the past two decades. In addition to those living in the diaspora, a large number of people fly to the US regularly for higher studies, or for business or tourism purposes. For Bangladeshis living here and abroad to truly reap the benefits of an increasingly globalised world, air travel must be made faster, cheaper and more convenient. Our airports, which have consistently let us down, need an urgent overhaul, beginning with complying with international safety standards.\n",

        "full_article": "The food minister's announcement to set up food testing labs in all eight divisions of the country may not have drawn the attention of many amid the hullaballoo of food crisis. However, looking at the country's food situation for both domestic consumption and export, the announcement does carry an important message to address the problems and limitations in ensuring food safety. Food security must, of necessity, be followed by safety of foods. The food minister's announcement came at the inauguration of the Food and Chemical Lab Expo 2022 in the capital last week. Organised by the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, the event, first of its kind in the country, highlighted the need for lab testing of primary and processed foods. Pointing out the sheer inadequacy of testing labs, the minister informed that a contract was signed with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to set up international standard testing labs. Besides the labs, eight mobile van labs will also be introduced to complement the task.All for the awful state of the country's food sector! Unsafe food, an unrelenting reality for most varieties of foods in the country, is reportedly comprising the nation's diet. There are occasional drives in kitchen markets, restaurants and super-markets --- mostly in big cities. Fines are imposed, sometimes heftily; even criminal proceedings are also resorted to. But these do not appear to have brought about any change. Incidents of adulteration, observers hold, is a broad-based, perhaps a country-wide network that devious business people find highly profit-driven. Fining big stores or restaurants or kitchen markets does not help much. Worse, it provides undesirable leverage to those in charge of calling the shots. While contamination of food can be due to negligence, deliberate adulteration by toxic chemicals or radioactive materials for long shelf life of products and increasing the volume in size and weight, among the many crooked methods, is so rampant that it is difficult to find anyone who has not encountered an unpleasant moment of food-borne illness at least once in the past years. While some illnesses may be self-limiting, some can be very serious and even life-threatening. Taking care of the situation thus calls for initiatives to discipline the sector. In advanced countries this involves producing, handling, storing and preparing foods in such a way as to prevent infection and contamination in the entire chain. However, in situations such as in this country, it is not merely about maintaining a clean chain but also putting in place strong deterrents so that disorderliness in the business could be largely stopped. Setting up several food testing labs, as announced, may be a step in the right direction.Absence of standard food labs is well recognised as a major bottleneck for accessing export markets of potential food products, especially processed foods. Most countries these days follow strict food testing protocols while importing, and it is here that Bangladeshi exporters, even those capable of supplying quality products, are held back. Well-equipped food labs, as announced by the food minister, will hopefully meet the requirement for export, while also improving the quality of local food market.",

        "full_article": "The past week's rainfalls had all the making of a monsoon although this year's monsoon proper was, reportedly, the driest ever. In fact, for the past seven years now the rainy season has remained drier than before. Intriguingly, the autumn and the monsoon appear to have conspired to interchange their roles and positions. Well, it is not quite uncharacteristic of the month of Bhadra or Aswin to have loads of rains triggered by lows and sweeping gales in the Bay. But what is particularly remarkable about the past few days' rains is their cent per cent monsoon-like characteristic with light drizzles coming from nowhere and vanishing in no time only to return back and these continued like a game of hide and seek. So far, it has not come as a threat to the major parts of Bangladesh. But the coastal areas in the south have been bearing the brunt, showing how vulnerable they are to the turbulent and rising sea. Coastal protection dams have given in at several points ---and not for the first time this year ---to allow onrushing waters inundate village after village and their croplands. It presents a typical image of the cataclysmic loss of vast coastal areas to the rising sea in the future. The threat now looks real and awfully ominous. In this context, the multi-agency UN climate science report released on Tuesday last has set the alarm bell ringing. The report points accusing fingers at governments for not matching up their actions with the pledges they made at the Paris climate conference and by default inviting the climate catastrophe perhaps well before the time earlier anticipated. Studying several factors responsible for climate change such as CO2 emission, global temperature rises, climate predictions, 'tipping points', urban climate change, extreme weather impacts and early warning systems, researchers under the \"Uniting in Science\" coordinated by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have concluded that the world is 'heading in the wrong direction'. Far from doing the groundwork for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, the ultimate of which is to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial levels, people across the world are generally doing exactly the opposite. Not quite unaware that they are running out of time to put their acts together for restoring the planet's health, they are all the same causing the gravest harm to the only place known for fostering lives. Currently greenhouse gas concentration is piling up to record high and fossil fuel emissions are at levels higher than that of the pre-pandemic time. But hardly policymakers anywhere in the world have been assigned to seriously take forward the programmes for an early switchover to green or eco-friendly energy technology. Given the lapses and failure to comply with Paris Agreements, greenhouse gas reduction needs to be beefed up seven times higher, climate scientists now estimate. Clearly, the prospect of its materialisation looks bleak at a time when the world leaders are concerned with issues other than this one so vital for human race's survival. One important issue not usually taken note of by many other than the scientists concerned is the ocean current that is responsible for shifting heat from the tropics to the northern hemisphere. Alarmingly, the ocean current is at its slowest in 1,000 years ---a fact decisive enough to disrupt the planet's weather pattern. This finding by the UN Environment Programme and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction certainly brings a new dimension to climate change and may potentially indicate areas to be addressed for stemming the environmental deterioration.When so much is at stake, scientists have done their ground work in order to alert the political leaderships but unless the latter respond to the emergency promptly, even the scientists will have no means to arrest the fast failing health of the planet. If the warning sounded by scientists is missed by political leaderships and policymakers in the world's capitals, the colossal changes taking place in the lifelines and vital natural resources should have brought them back to their senses. Unfortunately, no amount of environmental turmoil has prompted them to collectively go for something radical equal to the problem.They fall short of reacting properly to a few unprecedented environmental developments of catastrophic proportion signalling the cataclysmic devastation waiting to unfold in the days to come. Right now Pakistan is struggling with an unprecedented flood and some European countries including Britain and France had to endure the test of never-before-experienced heat waves. Only a year before America's north and Canada lost more than 800 lives to what is called heat domes. Melting of polar ice cap and Himalayan glacier may be distant phenomena but when sources of rivers in their backyards run dry or lose streams, they cannot and should not turn a blind eye to the disastrous developments. Politics, unfortunately, has other priorities as demonstrated by the choice of the Conservative Party leadership in the UK.Apart from curbing fossil fuel use significantly, where the world can gain most is in bringing about a radical change in the current style of prolific consumerism. This poses a direct threat to free market economy that thrives on spurring unnecessary and superfluous consumerism. Already there is a movement in the West that promotes the virtue of minimalism but it is still a marginal force yet to gather steam. Like it or not, the survivability of the human race largely depends on a radically scaled-down pattern of living standard and avoidance of excessive comfort and luxuries. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has reportedly moved to take action against some merchant banks for their role in getting some non-performing companies listed on the country's bourses. The relevant merchant banks have acted as issue managers and provided due diligence certificates in favour of companies wanting to float initial public offerings (IPOs). The merchant banks certified that information furnished by the companies was true, fair and adequate. Now that the performance of the companies in question is not in conformity with what has been stated in their prospectuses, the BSEC is out to seek an explanation from the relevant merchant banks. The move on the part of the securities regulator though well-directed is bound to raise a few questions. A merchant bank that acts as an issue manager is only one player in the entire process of approving the IPOs. There are others also. The BSEC itself plays a very important role. Then, the role of the audit firms that certify the financials of the firms seeking to go public cannot be sidetracked. That some companies perform poorly soon after their listing is nothing new. It had happened in the past. A good number of companies melted into thin air within months after mopping up investors' money using the IPO as a tool. Their financials submitted along with the application for listing had painted all the rosy pictures, and none cared to go through those in detail. In the months before the crash of the market in 1996, taking advantage of the investors' euphoria to gobble up what came their way, a good number of companies got listed, some with hefty premium value. Following the collapse of the market, it was found that most documents submitted by these companies were either fake or forged. Some listed manufacturing companies even did not have any physical existence. Mark Shoes and Wonderland Toys were among those infamous companies. The market crash of 1996 was an eye-opener for both investors and others, including the securities regulator. Many had expected that all concerned would learn from their mistakes. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The 2010 bubble burst is a pointer to that fact. The IPO approval mechanism also did not improve much. Before approving any company seeking to float IPO, it is important to examine in detail its financials by experts at the BSEC. It has been observed that the profit earnings by companies seeking to go public abruptly soar in the years preceding the submission of their IPO applications. But soon after listing, profits go dry. Audit firms concerned do have a role in preparing the doctored financials. It is not known whether the BSEC has referred this issue to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Bangladesh (ICAB) or the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).  More importantly, there should be physical verification to see that the firms/ industries wanting to go public exist physically. This job should be done, first, by the merchant banks working as issue managers. The BSEC, on its part, should also make the necessary checks. Holding the merchant banks alone responsible for the folly of non-performing newly-listed companies will not do. The BSEC and the relevant other regulatory bodies will also have to shoulder responsibilities. Most investors here bother least about scrutinising the IPO details, as they are more concerned about quick gains. In such a situation, the regulator/s will have to walk the extra mile to protect the investors from being cheated by dodgy entrepreneurs. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
