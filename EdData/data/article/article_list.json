The Government\u2019s keenness to expedite the roll-out was framed by Ms. Sitharaman as being propelled by an appreciation of the latest generation telecommunication technology\u2019s ability to serve as an enabler of economic growth and job creation. Commenting on the Budget announcement, Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said TRAI was expected to submit its recommendations on the spectrum to be set aside for 5G by March, adding that the auction for the airwaves would be held soon after. While last week\u2019s flurry of announcements have raised the possibility that the next auction of telecom spectrum may be held within the next few months, there is little clarity on the approach the Government plans to take with regard to the crucial issues surrounding the introduction of 5G services. Foremost are questions around the particular frequencies the regulator is likely to recommend, the Government\u2019s plans on pricing the spectrum, and most crucially, the very viability of the new technology, both for the telecom companies and the economy as a whole. With the financially stressed private telecom service provider industry now reduced to a near duopoly, as Vodafone Idea continues to bleed losses and subscribers and even plans to convert some of its outstanding interest dues to the DoT into an equity stake that will make the Union government the largest shareholder, the sector\u2019s appetite for the highly capital intensive 5G technology is unlikely to be substantial at the moment.That 5G represents an exponential leap in technology is beyond doubt. However, most countries that have commercialised 5G so far largely find the technology still predominantly deployed as an upgraded replacement for 4G in terms of end use, with the industrial and public utility applications envisaged still at least a few years away. Also, for the new technology to work at its optimum potential the Government would need to not only offer the key operational frequencies including the below 1 GHz, the C-Band frequencies around 3.5 GHz, and the higher 26 GHz but also crucially enable the transport or backhaul of signals between the base stations and telecom operator\u2019s core network by offering no- to low-cost E-Band airwaves. With the COVID-19 pandemic having shown up the existing mobile networks\u2019 inadequacies in terms of reach, especially in enabling the delivery of education to remote and rural students, it may make the most sense to delay the introduction of 5G until policymakers are sure its economic payoff will outweigh the high cost.",

        "full_article": "The death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the leader of the Islamic State (IS), has come at a time when the terrorist outfit has been trying to revive its fortunes in Iraq and Syria, its core region. A few weeks earlier, IS militants had carried out an ambitious attack \u2014 their largest since the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, IS founder, in 2019 \u2014 on a prison in northeastern Syria\u2019s Hasakah, to free thousands of jihadists. But it was a failure as American soldiers joined the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish militia, to push back the militants. Qurayshi blew himself up along with his family, like his predecessor did three years ago, when U.S. special forces approached his hideout in Idlib, the province controlled by jihadists linked with al Qaeda. When he became the IS chief, the entity had transformed itself from a \u2018Caliphate\u2019, with control over some key cities in Iraq and Syria, into an underground insurgency with global branches. Under Qurayshi, the IS continued to operate like a loose confederation of autonomous networks. Its Afghan and West African branches expanded operations, while in Iraq and Syria, it staged occasional attacks \u2014 a reminder that it is only the physical Caliphate that has been destroyed.It is more than a coincidence that both Baghdadi and Qurayshi were hiding in Syria\u2019s Idlib. The Syrian government\u2019s efforts to recapture the territory have not been successful as there is strong regional opposition, especially from Turkey which fears another refugee influx. The province is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a globally designated terrorist outfit that was formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. Idlib is now run by Abu Mohammad al-Joulani, the al Qaeda militant who was sent to Syria by Baghdadi in 2013, in the early stages of the civil war, to open a branch of his outfit. If a lasting solution to the jihadist control of Idlib is not found, the future Baghdadis and Qurayshis would also take refuge in this region. Another important lesson the IS\u2019s recent attacks provides is that the Syrian Kurds remain a key ally in the fight against the IS, as the Hasakah incident has shown. The U.S. should not throw them at the mercy of Turkey \u2014 like the Trump administration once did \u2014 once the IS threat is minimised. They should be incorporated into a larger regional counter-terror strategy. Lastly, the IS has learned how to survive these occasional setbacks. It has lost its Caliphate and its top commanders but there are thousands of foot soldiers spread across Iraq and Syria, waiting to strike. The still open wounds of the civil war in Syria and the lingering sectarian sentiments in Iraq have let them survive so far. As long as these geopolitical and sectarian faultlines remain in Iraq and Syria, the IS threat will not vanish.",

        "full_article": "People around the world are grappling with inflationary pressure. Many have lost their jobs or are earning a lower income. Prices of daily essentials and fuel have spiralled, further draining people's purses. Businesses have also been affected, particularly small businesses, who are yet to recover from pandemic-induced shocks. Though countries are on the path to recovery, the emergence of Omicron coupled with the high inflationary pressure might slow down their recovery in the short term. Meanwhile, since global economy is recovering, demand has gone up while supply could not match the demand.\nBangladesh has been in the recovery trajectory, too. However, like other countries, high inflation has been a major concern for Bangladesh. The inflationary pressure on Bangladesh's economy started around June 2020 following the outbreak of the pandemic. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), point-to-point inflation rose to 6.05 percent in December 2021 compared to 5.29 percent in December 2020. Food inflation went up to 5.46 percent in December 2021, as opposed to 5.34 percent in December 2020.\nThe price hike in Bangladesh is often linked with the global price hike. Bangladesh is a net importer of fuel oil. It also imports edible oil, food, sugar, intermediate goods and raw materials for production. Therefore, any price increase in the global market is felt in Bangladesh almost immediately. This is a regular phenomenon and has been the case for decades. During periods of crisis, it becomes even more prominent. It may be recalled that during 2000-2008, increasing global fuel and food prices were transmitted into Bangladesh economy. The inflationary pressure started to ease following a global meltdown towards the end of 2008 and in 2009, which caused prices of major commodities to fall. However, inflation started to rise once the global economy started to turn around towards the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010. In the following decade, till the outbreak of the pandemic, the inflationary trend fluctuated.\nIn 2011, the global food price index increased significantly. After a decade, food prices are alarmingly high again. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the FAO Food Price Index in 2021 was 28.1 percent higher than in 2020.\nGlobally, the cost of logistics such as shipping and airlines as well as fuel prices have led to high prices of crops, even though global crop production has been as high as 2.8 billion\u2014a record production. This high cost of rice, wheat, soybean oil and other commodities is then passed onto the end users. People in the low-income countries such as Bangladesh are the most affected in this regard.\nOn the domestic front, supply shortage is one of the reasons for high prices. A key component of high inflation in Bangladesh is high food inflation in the domestic market. Since food comprises about 60 percent of the total Consumer Price Index in Bangladesh, higher domestic food price is a dominant factor for high inflation both in urban and rural areas. Lower production is a key reason for the high price. Before the harvesting season, there is a lean period when supply is relatively low. This is a time when prices tend to go up. However, often markets do not follow the rule of demand and supply. For example, vegetable prices continued to be high even after the winter supply came in. The impact of higher supply was not reflected in prices. The cost of transportation and other logistics also contributed to this. For non-perishable commodities, there are market manipulators, hoarders, and syndicates\u2014all of them take advantage of moments of crisis.\u00a0\nThe global prediction for agriculture production is not promising in view of the impact of climate change, which is manifested not only through flood and cyclones but also through drought and wildfire. In the absence of high growth and good agricultural production, the inflationary pressure will continue to prevail. Indeed, due to uncertain climatic conditions, high input costs and the ongoing pandemic, the FAO sees little hope for food market stability in 2022. This is a warning for the food importing countries. During a crisis, food producing and exporting countries would give priority to domestic demand and tend to impose ban on export of food grains. The importing countries will not be able to import from the global market, as it happened in the past. Even if they can, they will have to pay an exorbitant price.\nTherefore, Bangladesh needs to take measures well in advance. As a climate vulnerable country, it faces a high risk in terms of production disruption. On the other hand, the demand for rice and other food items is increasing. Hence, to have a proper market signal and price stability, a correct demand estimation for rice is needed. It is also essential to monitor the role of market players, including rice millers and importers, who control prices by manipulation.\nInflationary pressure always has an adverse impact on the consumers through reduction of their purchasing power and income erosion. High inflation, particularly high food inflation, affects the poor and people in the fixed income group. They are yet to absorb the burden of diesel price hike in November 2021. Now, with the continuous price hike of essential commodities, they find it difficult to live a decent life. The government's support measures in the form of direct cash transfer to the poor, social protection to low-income families as well as stimulus for the small businesses, can provide some respite in the short term. In the medium term, higher production through higher investment will help create jobs and income, which is crucial for absorbing price shocks.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).

        "full_article": "Myanmar authorities appear to be getting away with their crimes as global attention is focused on the pandemic and, more recently, the Ukraine crisis. February 1, 2022 marked the first anniversary of the brazen coup in which the ruthless military junta seized power and deposed the democratically elected government headed by the National League for Democracy (NLD). Citizens observed the day with a \"silent strike\" in Yangon, and demonstrated across the country to register their resentment over the junta's hostilities and the global community's inaction.\nSince the coup, the Tatmadaw has unleashed a reign of terror on Myanmar's people, killing 1,400 and jailing 11,000, according to the nonprofit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The security forces have been indiscriminate in their behaviour, targeting elected members of parliament, journalists, workers and ordinary people protesting against the coup.\nAll along, the world's attention seesawed between a soft approach through ASEAN leaders to get some sense into the rulers, and relatively harsher measures like imposing economic sanctions and blacklisting individual members of the ruling elite.\nMeanwhile, the solution to the Rohingya crisis, which has been festering since 2017, has not moved an inch. The internal situation in Myanmar\u2014economic, political and humanitarian\u2014has gotten worse, as the ruling clique finds itself almost unscathed while managing to flout all international and democratic norms. And it seems to be succeeding in its diabolical scheme to stay in power, while keeping its guns trained on unarmed civilians. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the country's democracy movement, was tried behind closed doors.\nSo how does the military keep on functioning so boldly?\nAccording to sources, Myanmar has been economically almost unharmed by foreign sanctions and diplomatic pressures. Businesses controlled by the army are using their rich natural resources to tighten its grip on the country, and slaughter freedom-loving citizens in the Kachin, Karin, Shan, and Rakhine states. The army, local businesses controlled by the dominant ethnic group, and foreign investors have teamed up to provide a lifeline to the various operations of the regime. This unholy alliance is using the oil and gas, gemstones, and timber industries to support the economy and provide foreign exchange to the military for equipment and supplies, and to defray the cost of maintaining the supply chain feeding the military-industrial-mining complex.\nMost of the extractive industry revenue in Myanmar comes from four big offshore projects producing natural gas. It is estimated that gas extraction is the source of about 50 percent of Myanmar's foreign exchange. Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is a state-owned company that operates with international partners such as Chevron and Total to channel billions of dollars into the pocket of the military. MOGE's purse is totally controlled by the military junta. The Myanmar Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry has forecasted that MOGE will earn USD 1.5 billion in 2021-2022 from offshore and pipeline projects.\nUnder international pressure, America's Chevron and France's Total repeatedly promised to wind down their operations in Myanmar. TotalEnergies is the largest shareholder and operator of Myanmar's biggest natural gas project, an offshore field called Yadana, providing energy for domestic use and export. Following the Yadana project, the USD-700-million Yetagun (\"flag of victory\") project was the second largest natural gas offshore project in Myanmar. Along with MOGE, the gas fields are jointly owned by Thai, Malaysian, and Japanese companies.\nIt is clear that enforcement of existing sanctions imposed on Myanmar is very weak. There is also no mechanism to take action against those who continue to do business with Myanmar in defiance of sanctions. Though TotalEnergies and Chevron, on January 21, finally announced plans to withdraw from Myanmar, it needs to be seen who steps in next to keep these gas fields operational.\nAccording to the UN, the Tatmadaw had been able to \"insulate itself from accountability and oversight\" through a network of conglomerate-owned businesses and affiliates. Two organisations\u2014Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL)\u2014have increasingly become key sources of wealth for the Tatmadaw, with stakes in everything from banking and mining to tobacco and tourism.\nAn Amnesty International (AI) report showed how MEHL and Myanmar's military units are linked. This information has implications for MEHL's many foreign and local business partners. \"By doing business with the conglomerate, they too are linked to these crimes and violations,\" according to AI. \"Because MEHL has shown no willingness to engage transparently with its business partners or reform its structure,\" AI urged these companies to disengage \"responsibly\" from MEHL.\nThe junta recently organised a \"Global Mini Gems Emporium\" in Naypyidaw to showcase the country's pearl and precious stones industry. Coloured stones from Myanmar have been prized in the West despite repeated sanctions by the US and other countries. Besides rubies, other precious stones include sapphire, jade, and spinel. Thailand, China, and Cambodia\u2014which are all authoritarian regimes\u2014have gone out of their way to provide moral and economic support to the junta ensconced in Naypyidaw.\nThe financial flows to the business entities in Myanmar have continued unhindered and unabated, and calls for asset-freezing, expulsion from SWIFT, and other economic sanctions have gone unheeded.\nHeidi Hautala, vice-president of the European Parliament, recently called on all EU members to extend sanctions to MOGE. There have been repeated appeals to other companies in the sector to take immediate steps to stop all payments to the junta by whatever means possible. For the US, UK, EU and the UN, it is now high time to step up their game and contain the bad actors in Naypyidaw using broader diplomatic pressure, tighter sanctions, intensified efforts to block arms shipment, and deployment of effective countermeasures.\n\u00a0\nDr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and serves as Senior Research Fellow at the US-based International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI).\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "In Bangladesh's RMG industry, we view ourselves as fighting for a position as the world's second-most important garment sourcing hub. We are neck-and-neck with Vietnam and also forged ahead of our nearest competitor this year after we posted record garment export receipts. Of course, both Bangladesh and Vietnam lag behind China, a textile powerhouse which will take some considerable time to catch up to because of the huge investments it has made in technology and innovation.\nSo, it was quite sobering to read a recent UN-World Trade Organization report which appears to place Bangladesh in a tier below Vietnam (and China) in terms of apparel sourcing. I have to say, my eyes did a double-take when I read this report, which claims that executives ranked Vietnam higher in 10 out of 12 indices. These covered such issues as production quality, lead time, innovation, vertical integration and sustainability.\nThe only two areas where Bangladesh was ahead of Vietnam were price and tariff advantages. The latter of these is hardly anything to shout about, while the former simply confirms the idea that Bangladesh is where executives go for cheap prices.\nThe findings led the authors to conclude that Bangladesh, along with other Least Developed Countries (LDCs) such as Cambodia, are \"part of [fashion's] diverse sourcing base... Overall, China and Vietnam are regarded as more critical sourcing bases.\"\n\"However, these LDC countries are not regarded as competitive in terms of speed to market, flexibility of order quantity, or innovation and ability to develop products. There are also concerns about the relatively high social and environmental compliance risks when sourcing from such significant suppliers as Bangladesh and Cambodia,\" the report states.\nI would not be so presumptuous as to question the findings of a report by two organisations as prestigious as the UN and the WTO. These findings are also based on a survey of representatives from fashion brands and retailers, therefore, the UN/WTO would argue that they are only reporting back what they have been told.\nEven so, to see that brands have concerns about relatively high social and environmental compliance risks in Bangladesh comes as a real surprise. It cannot be repeated enough that Bangladesh has undertaken the largest safety overhaul of any industry on record in recent years, thanks to the pioneering work of the Bangladesh Accord and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker\u00a0 Safety. This work is ongoing, and Bangladesh remains a global leader in this area.\u00a0\nOn the issue of environment, while we are not perfect, let us remember that we now have 155 LEED-certified green factories\u2014the highest number of green garment factories in the world. What more can we do to show our credentials and efforts in this area?\nOther areas where the report says Bangladesh scores less than Vietnam include production quality, ability to create value-added products, innovation, efficiency, lead time, flexibility of order quantity, and financial/political stability. While it is a concern that those surveyed ranked Vietnam higher than Bangladesh in all these areas, I am confident we are making sufficient progress in each one that we will soon completely close the gap, and may even have done so already.\nI am inclined to think that in some sense, old perceptions die hard where Bangladesh RMG is concerned. The message of us being low-cost and not much else has been repeated so often that perhaps people are now incapable of looking beyond this idea.\nTo go through the above criteria one by one, I would firstly dispute the issue of production quality. Quality is very high from Bangladesh, and I struggle to believe how we are behind Vietnam in this area. The only issue one might raise is that we are producing different garment types in many cases, so perhaps we are comparing apples with oranges.\nIn terms of the ability to produce value-added products, yes, that is an area where we trail Vietnam (and some other textile sourcing hubs), although we are making progress. We have invested heavily in areas such as outerwear and are looking more into technical textiles presently. Watch this space.\nTwo other areas mentioned\u2014innovation and efficiency\u2014are very general and hard to quantify. The only thing to say on these is that our productivity levels are historically lower than those of Vietnam and this serves to reinforce the need to invest in skills, training and leadership. On lead time, there is always room for improvement. The BGMEA is constantly lobbying on this issue to improve our logistics, roads, rail to port and so on. We must move urgently on this area.\nI would question the report's finding around flexibility of order quantity. Our industry is very flexible in this area and has successfully pivoted towards shorter runs during the pandemic.\nFinally, to the issues of political and financial stability. The latter of these will always be a challenge for Bangladesh until we shift towards more specialised, high value-added products, a process which is thankfully underway. As for the former, well, Vietnam may be more stable politically than Bangladesh but it is a communist country\u2014this, some might argue, brings its own challenges.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is managing director of Denim Expert Limited, and founder and CEO of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange (BAE) and Bangladesh Denim Expo.\n",

        "full_article": "For the government, the timing of the Sinha murder verdict on January 31 couldn't have been worse, with increasing global scrutiny following a US sanction on RAB over allegations of human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings. Yet, soon after the verdict, which handed death sentence\u00a0to two police officers, a top leader of the ruling Awami League said, \"It proves that the Sheikh Hasina government believes in the rule of law.\" He said so despite the verdict having blown up the entire story arc built by state officials around instances of extrajudicial killing, or any mislabelling thereof (shootout, crossfire, gunfire).\nThat's politics 101\u2014you control the narrative regardless of what happens. You stick to it until it becomes the \"truth\", and you use that \"truth\" as a crutch in the face of any future allegation. So, before the Sinha verdict too gets sucked into this political vortex, it's important that we take control of the narrative and critically examine why this verdict is significant, but also why its place in history may not be as assured as many think.\nWhat's in the verdict? Besides sentencing Teknaf's suspended OC Pradeep Kumar Das and inspector Liaqat Ali to death for the \"pure and simple murder\" of Sinha Rashed Khan, the court also sentenced six others\u2014including three cops\u2014to life while acquitting seven other police personnel. To be honest, capital punishment is not something we can ethically stand behind. But at least now, we have the comfort of knowing these people are being held to account for a murder planned in cold blood.\nThe verdict also marks a couple of firsts: it is the first time any law enforcement officers in the country have been brought to book for staging a shootout. It is also the first judicial acknowledgment of how a shootout/crossfire story is cooked up. Through its minute-by-minute description of the July 31, 2020 event, the court has essentially taken the lid off all the variations of this story produced over the years. In short, what all of them have in common is how the law enforcers encounter a \"threat\" from a \"criminal\" or his associates, and how they are \"forced\" to respond (read: fatally shoot) in self-defence. By exposing this farce, the verdict has shown that all shootout/crossfire incidents are basically premeditated.\nHowever, being a first may be a source of comfort, but not necessarily a badge of honour. Pradeep and Co. did something horrible for which, we hope, they will pay soon enough. But Pradeep's record shows he had done that to many other people too. He has killed 204 people in crossfires, according to an investigation report cited by the prosecution. In a video clip, Pradeep was apparently seen advocating killing suspected drug traders during a public meeting. Could Sinha's murder, or that of all other victims, be avoided if he had been stopped sooner? Should we be happy that Sinha got justice, or sad that others before him did not?\nThis is not merely a rhetorical question. Sinha's murder may have been \"pure and simple\", but for a broader context, we need to de-simplify the circumstances under which the case progressed, gaining unprecedented momentum along the way. One may recall the muted standoff between the police and military establishments after the retired major's murder, and their shared determination to get to the bottom of it. What chance does a victim without such powerful backing have of getting justice in a similarly speedy manner?\u00a0\nUnfortunately, a crossfire victim's family can rarely file a case, according to Nur Khan Liton, secretary general of Ain o Salish Kendra. Police do not want to record such cases. Even when they do, it is hastily binned or somehow falls through midway, which explains why there's\u00a0been a zero conviction rate until now. For example, Sinha's may have been the first case to get a guilty verdict but it wasn't the first to go on trial. In that first trial in 2010, the lower court in Kushtia ruled in favour of the cops, even though the victim's family insisted that the former had picked him up before \"staging\" the shootout.\nSo while we are glad that a guilty verdict has been reached finally, and so fast, we doubt this will be the norm going forward. So far, there has been no official apology issued from the home ministry. We have heard of no internal investigations or judicial inquiries into the other shootout cases that Pradeep and Co. were a part of. No political demand for eliminating the culture of extrajudicial executions. No official censure of lawmakers who previously supported this culture, even in parliament. No re-evaluation of the violence-as-a-first-resort strategy of our security forces. And certainly no explanation as to why this is the first verdict, and not the 100th or the 500th, hypothetically speaking.\nIt's as if the Sinha case was an embarrassment, and the sooner it goes away, the better.\u00a0\nFor the government, however, this particular embarrassment may last longer than expected. While there has been a dip in the number of extrajudicial executions of late, it is unlikely to restore its image after the US sanctions on RAB. The verdict, far from being an affirmation of the rule of law, will instead be used as a reference point to further validate claims of state violence and torture. As image-conscious as this government may be, it doesn't seem to understand that the solution is really not to ignore or cover up crimes and failures\u2014because nothing stays hidden for long in this age\u2014but to own up to them and show sincere action to ensure they never happen again.\nAfter the Sinha verdict, we are being told to be hopeful, to look ahead. But we cannot do so without also looking back. The verdict is a painful reminder that countless other victims\u2014victims without powerful backing or those whose moment of tragedy wasn't immortalised in a viral photo or video clip\u2014didn't get justice. Torture or staged executions by state officials reached a point that the identity of victims no longer mattered. Can we move ahead without critically questioning this failure of \"the rule of law\" and doing something about it?\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is an Assistant Editor, The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "We are deeply concerned about the escalating tensions between NATO and Russia over Ukraine. While the current crisis has been building up for years\u2014some say even decades, since the USSR broke up in 1991 and Ukraine began leaning towards the West\u2014it now seems to have reached a boiling point. The US claims that Russia is gearing up to launch an attack on Ukraine and that it has already assembled at least 70 percent of the military firepower it likely intends to have in place by mid-February. Though Ukraine only receives US and allied military support and training as of yet, it does wish to be a NATO member\u2014something that Russia, especially President Putin, has been firmly against since long. But the biggest concern is how the safety of Ukrainian citizens is now hanging in the balance between Russia's wish to not let NATO get any closer to itself (via Ukraine) and the West's reading of Russia's behaviour as a threat to pro-West Ukraine.\nSeveral questions arise here: Why has Russia reportedly amassed 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border? And is the US correct in seeing this as an imminent threat to Ukraine and its NATO neighbours? While Russia's routine exercise of strategic nuclear forces may be one explanation for the gathering of its troops, the US may be right to wonder why it was shifted to be held from mid-February to March instead of in the Fall, as is usual. But if Russia was adamant before about NATO not taking Ukraine under its wing, this demand has become an ultimatum now\u2014something which the West will never bow to. Russia's concern that NATO may be getting closer to itself by eventually taking in Ukraine is also not something that can be brushed aside. After all, will the West gain much in terms of security if Ukraine is made a NATO member?\nThis may all seem a faraway issue for Bangladesh, as it is happening between countries we are not regionally connected to and over issues that do not, at first glance, concern us directly. However, being ever-committed to world peace, and having first-hand awareness of the dire consequences of war, we would like to call upon NATO members (especially the US) and Russia to engage in diplomatic dialogue and make efforts to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine immediately. If the current situation is allowed to fester, it will only lead to more war-mongering and trading of arms and weapons. That may set precedence for existing conflicts between other regions to worsen as well. War cannot be an option.\n",

        "full_article": "It is disheartening that the Department of Environment (DoE) has completely failed to comply with a High Court directive to stop the use of single-use plastic in hotels, motels, and restaurants in the coastal areas. Reportedly, the HC gave the order in January 2020, asking the DoE to put an end to such plastic use by 2021. Already, two years have passed with no visible progress made to contain its use. Moreover, the department is yet to submit a compliance report in this regard to the HC.\nWhat has it done in these two years then? Apparently, it undertook a project to stop the use of throwaway plastics in 12 coastal districts last year, and held one meeting with the hotel-motel owners in Cox's Bazar. That's it. Now, if a government department responsible for saving our environment shows a lacklustre attitude towards such a serious problem, can we blame the owners of the hotels, motels and restaurants for not complying with the order (since using throwaway plastics is convenient for them anyway)?\nEnvironmentalists believe that there is no reason why the DoE cannot do all that is required to stop the use of single-use plastics. With the support of law enforcers, they can easily monitor the situation on the ground and take action against those not complying with the order.\nMeanwhile, plastic usage in the country has been increasing at an alarming rate. Bangladesh has already become one of the top plastic polluting countries in the world. According to a 2020 World Bank report, the per capita plastic use in the country has increased to 9kg in 2020 from 3kg in 2005. A majority of the plastics used eventually end up in the oceans, threatening the very existence of marine life. The situation calls for stronger commitment and greater action from the authorities concerned. However, we must also remember that, in order for the hotel, motel and restaurant owners to stop using throwaway plastics, there should be better and sustainable alternatives.\nThe government has a big role to play here. They need to come forward to support the scientists who have already invented biodegradable alternatives to plastics, such as jute molymer and biodegradable packaging materials from corn, etc. Popularising the use of traditional jute bags can also help beat the use of plastic bags. Needless to say, the DoE has to lead the way. Since they, in cooperation with the World Bank, have prepared a roadmap to stop the use of single-use plastic in our coastal regions, and also undertook a three-year project, they must now focus on implementing their plans and projects and bring us some results.\n",
