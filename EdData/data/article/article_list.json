Around 8,000 delegates will vote on October 17 to elect a new chief for the party. It was the refusal of Rahul Gandhi to return to hold the formal reins of the party that set the ball rolling in this direction. Mr. Gandhi also made it clear that his mother Sonia Gandhi could not continue as president, and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra cannot contest. Leaving the road clear for a relatively open contest for the top post which is reserved for a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family whenever one of them claimed it, Mr. Gandhi set out on a walk from the southern tip of the country towards the north. His Bharat Jodo Yatra has also struck a chord with people in the areas it has touched so far. Mrs. Gandhi had wanted Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to contest, and he appeared to be agreeable, initially. But the efforts to effect a transition in the State ended in chaos, grounding the plans for his candidacy. MLAs in Rajasthan want Mr. Gehlot to continue in office. The Rajasthan episode was badly managed by the party, showing itself and a loyal veteran in a bad light. It was avoidable.The contest is actually for the second most important position in the Congress. It is clear that Mr. Gandhi will remain the final authority in the party, while the elected president will be tasked with the running of the organisation. The BJP has had supreme leaders above party presidents \u2014 A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani at one point and Narendra Modi and Amit Shah now. There is a valid perception that the family is tilting the scales in favour of one contestant \u2014 Mallikarjun Kharge \u2014 against Shashi Tharoor, which needs to be dispelled. The Nehru-Gandhi family\u2019s moral authority over the party stems from its neutrality and fairness in internal tussles. That authority is often exercised through representatives who at times fail to maintain neutrality. Recent episodes in Punjab and Rajasthan \u2014 the promotion of Navjot Singh Sidhu and the pressure on Mr. Gehlot, respectively \u2014 have weakened the authority of the family. Being a neutral arbiter is the right thing to do, and apart from that, self preservation demands that Mr. Gandhi enables popular leaders to emerge stronger in the party. Mr. Kharge or Mr. Tharoor, the truly popular should be able to to win. Mr. Gandhi will only reinforce his authority by making it public that the family has no candidate.",

Monetary policymakers were left with little choice but to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, as a bout of extreme volatility in international financial markets combines with persistently high domestic retail inflation to threaten macroeconomic stability, globally and in India. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das cited the \u2018aggressive monetary policy actions and even more aggressive communication from advanced economy central banks\u2019 as a third shock -- following the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 which he said had thrust the \u2018global economy into the eye of a new storm\u2019. \u201cEmerging market economies, in particular, are confronted with challenges of slowing global growth, elevated food and energy prices, spillovers from advanced economy policy normalisation... and sharp currency depreciations,\u201d Mr. Das explained, elaborating on the external challenges confronting emerging economies, including India. The rupee too has been under pressure, weakening by more than 7% against the dollar since the start of the current fiscal year in April. And this has added upward pressure to price stability by way of imported inflation. The RBI\u2019s September issue of the Monetary Policy Report in fact pertinently observes that the \u2018second-round effects of low growth and high inflation globally could keep domestic inflation at elevated levels even beyond eight quarters, necessitating appropriate monetary actions to anchor inflation expectations\u2019.The central bank\u2019s own projections, in fact, do not anticipate a slowing in India\u2019s retail inflation below its upper tolerance threshold of 6% till the January-March quarter. And Mr. Das was right to point out the multiple factors that could upend the RBI\u2019s inflation outlook. These include the likelihood of higher pass-through of input costs by service providers on increased demand, as well as upside risks to food prices from both the lower kharif output of rice and pulses, and the unseasonably excess spells of rainfall in some regions that have pushed up the prices of vegetables. The surfeit of liquidity or cash in the banking system, which is expected to be buoyed by enhanced government spending in the coming months, could also threaten price stability and the RBI Governor was at pains to note that the policy stance of a calibrated \u2018withdrawal of accommodation\u2019 had become an imperative. Specifically, he pointed out that \u2018even as the nominal policy repo rate had been raised by 190 basis points since May, the rate adjusted for inflation still trailed the 2019 levels\u2019. With the RBI\u2019s latest surveys of households\u2019 inflation expectations and consumer confidence too signalling that price pressures will continue to restrain consumption, inflation control will have to remain the top policy priority.",

Airtel has launched its non-standalone 5G network (in this mode, 5G is offered on existing 4G networks) in eight cities while Jio\u2019s standalone 5G network (a new network for 5G) is coming this Diwali in four metros. Vi hasn\u2019t revealed a timeline. Tariffs remain unclear and pan-India rollout could stretch into 2024.\nGreat changes have happened in the six-year-long 4G reign, none more striking than the ubiquity of video in our lives. 5G\u2019s promise of fast download speeds, low latency (network delay) and immersive experiences will feed into big data applications like autonomous devices, robots, virtual and augmented reality and cloud-based healthcare services. Though these technologies are still far from mass adoption, like 4G it could be a case of cometh the speed, cometh the usage. Just as Jio\u2019s entry expedited the struggling telecom sector\u2019s 4G transition while keeping tariffs affordable, 5G\u2019s trajectory could be similar. By now telecom companies know there\u2019s a huge market for high-speed data, provided tariffs are reasonable.\n5G transition has happened in stages across countries. Most operators begin with non-standalone 5G and then transition to standalone 5G. Only 18 countries had 5G standalone networks until July. There\u2019s also the question of what mix of 5G options will work best for service providers and consumers, including businesses. Three broad frequency bands with different characteristics are being deployed: low-band (600Mhz-1GHz) spectrum with speeds and range closer to 4G requires fewer cell towers; the mid-band (in-and-around 3300Mhz) offering 100-500Mbps speed is most in demand now; and Millimetre-Wave (24-47GHz) that delivers the greatest speeds but needs cell towers every few 100 metres. The last is seeing limited adoption, starting off as private networks for enterprise use.\nThe US saw one operator T-Mobile race to the lead in 5G transition with spectrum in lower bands but rivals AT&T and Verizon are foraying big in the mid-band this year. Jio\u2019s strategy of purchasing large quantities of low-band spectrum and Airtel\u2019s to catch up with Jio in 5G rollout by adopting cheaper non-standalone 5G tech suggest an intense race for customers. 5G promises new opportunities in big tech for the Indian economy by intensifying digitalisation. Ahead lies the theoretical promise of 5G speed-powered better deployment of technologies like AI, which in turn can induce domestic innovations in this field.\n\n",

Right now we are getting into a joyful stride with the festive season. Our spirits as well as our economy really need these celebrations after two years of going without. But why not celebrate smartly?\nAs the Centre\u2019s 75-day window for free precaution doses for those aged between 18-59 years closed on Friday, less than 20% of eligible persons had been boosted. Public messaging about the programme never really picked up, with many Indians unclear why they need another vaccine shot for a disease that has waned all around them. At around 25% of the population, India also has the world\u2019s highest number of unvaccinated persons.

        "full_article": "There are many ways a nation's history can be understood, for it has many points, opinions, and arguments depending on the sources one can reach. To comprehend history, scholars have recently started turning to memories in their efforts to make sense of the past. On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2, we can take the opportunity to examine the memories of his visit to Noakhali to remember the \"champion of non-violence.\"\nMemories are being used as a tool to reconstruct the past, as much it was imagined as it transpired. This article is aimed at seeing Gandhi's visit through recollection, commemoration, and social manners and mores. It is a repertoire of interests, and collective mentality about the local history of India's partition. Gandhi's Noakhali visit in 1946 was rarely examined directly through collective memory, neglected as just a case study that fails to reveal the long-lasting legacy Gandhi left behind, as can be found in the oral recollections of the villagers in Noakhali.\nGandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali, aiming to set an example for the rest of India of how Hindus and Muslims can get along. However, while relevant, the focus of this piece is not the political agenda of the time, but rather the local history of Noakhali during Gandhi's visit, and how he was mainly seen from the Muslim perspective and is still remembered in the community by people who had no political affiliations and ambitions.\nHindu-Muslim relationships in Noakhali in late 1930s\n\nBefore delving into the memories of Gandhi's visit to Noakhali, let us have an overview of the Hindu-Muslim relationships in the area the decade before. The relationship took a hit when Khitish Babu, a schoolteacher in Lamchar, Noakhali, who happened to be Hindu, called his Class 7 student, who was Muslim, haramjada (bastard). This was an offensive to Muslims, especially coming from someone who was Hindu. Following that, a large meeting was called by Golam Sarwar, the local MLA and a Muslim political leader, in Lamchar on April 12, 1939. Sarwar protested this incident and was agitated about how Hindus dared rebuke a Mohammedan student with this filthy language. He asked for an apology from the school authorities and said he would go on a strike at the school otherwise. He further threatened the teacher by dragging him round the street with shoes around his neck \u2013 an unimaginable insult for a teacher.\nA Congress leader from the Hindu community at the time, Monoranjan Chowdhury, wrote a letter to Gandhi regarding this communal propaganda spread by Sarwar, and requested him to take immediate steps. He was angry that Hindus in Noakhali were switching from Congress to Hindu Mahasabha. What wasn't mentioned in the letter was that the Congress leader had also made references and an allegation of Bengal Muslim leaders failing to check the communal tensions, which was featured in the local newspaper. One particular point the newspaper addressed was about Sandwip, Noakhali, where, for 12 years, an agreement was in place between the two communities. This agreement stated that Hindu processions could pass in front of mosques, playing music, except during prayer hours. In 1939, on the Bijaya Dashami Day, the local Hindus employed the agreement. But the sub-deputy collector and circle officer-in-charge wrote to Babu Rajendralal Nag, BL on October 21, 1939, \"I consider it my duty to let you know and you are probably aware that a civil tumult may arise if music is played near the mosque at any hour on the Dashera Day.\"\n\n\"There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth.\"\nThere was an allegation about Krishak Samitis as well. Hindu leaders demanded for the appointment of a committee of inquiry to look into the cases of communal tensions and violence. In response, the then Home Minister Sir Nazimuddin insinuated that there was no precedent condition to such inquiry. He said all the issues they lamented about were false, baseless, and malicious \u2013 an attempt was made to malign this government without any reason whatsoever. He claimed that it was a ploy of Hindu zamindars and mahajans, whose illegal exactions had been checked by the Krishak Samitis of the district. No immediate response from Gandhi was found in 1939 concerning the problem, making it more difficult to assume whether he took time to go over the letters sent from Noakhali. However, he responded by visiting the district in 1946, indicating that he was aware of the situation and the growing differences between the two groups. To bring the community together during the riots and before partition, Gandhi travelled to Noakhali with his \"peace mission,\" an idea that can be used interchangeably with non-violence.\nRemembering Gandhi\n\nMemories endure only within the social context that they were created in, with communities largely defining the conceptual structures that individuals use to recall information. The socially acquired understanding of the past is a patchwork of personal reminiscences constructed and pieced together within this social dimension (Hayden White: 1987). Thus,\u00a0the relationship between memory and an understanding of history through social context is one of mutual influence, both parts greatly effecting and relying upon the other. Regarding the individual memories of Gandhi, I took oral interviews in the places Gandhi visited in 1946. The attempt was to retrieve individual perspectives on Gandhi, which coalesced into an image. One of the people that I interviewed, Motalleb Patwary, who is now 88 years old with a round wrinkled face and a goatee, shared, \"There were no places left untouched by the rioters in Chandpur. While the whole place was aflame, there were no human casualties. Immediately after the riots, the Gurkha Army first came to our area. Then, Gandhi arrived with his two granddaughters, and his message was calming and noble. Gandhi spoke to the mass people in a comforting tone. Nothing was out of order. He tried to make the communities understand that we, Hindus and Muslims, were brothers. There was no point of fighting each other. We were trying to drive out the British rulers; while they were leaving, they made us fight one another.\" Patwary and his maternal cousin joined Gandhi's prayer meetings. He also added that there was no one in the village who did not attend the meetings; everyone, young and old, was there.\nAs the interview went on, Patwary also mentioned, \"Everyone was waiting for him to come. There was a whole sea of people.\" Despite the issue of riots which was what Gandhi was trying to address, Gandhi the individual became a hot topic in the community. Because of the poor communication system back then, the roads Gandhi travelled were renovated by filling ditches, and bridges were made where needed. An air of festivity had settled in the area. The news of his visit led to the resolution of a lot of issues. People who were forcefully converted to Islam became Hindu again. More importantly, the perpetrators of the riots went into hiding, while many of them went to apologise to the Hindus. Patwary's experience resonates with Tofael Ahamad, who was, then, a student at Chatkhil Panchgaon Government High School. He wrote in his book, \"'Let's go see Gandhi,'saying this, we ran\" [Mahatma Gandhi in Bangladesh (East Bengal), Dhaka: Panchgaon Prokashoni, 1992, P. 1-5]. He further described that it was not more than a quarter of a mile from his house where Gandhi came \u2013 a 10-minute walking distance. His aura was powerful, and it seemed like Ahmad needed to see him and attend his meeting. Even though he didn't like who Gandhi was and why he came, he still felt an urge to see him.\n\nGandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali.\nNoni Bala Bonik was protected by her Muslim neighbours. She was 90 at the time of the interview, but had sharp and detailed memories on Gandhi. She recalled, \"Gandhi came like a messenger and set up some temporary camps. I attended his prayer meetings twice and received chocolates.\" For Noni Bala and other Hindus, Gandhi appeared like a saviour after the riots, as everyone assumed that since he was around, nobody would have the courage to unleash violence again. After Gandhi's assassination, Noni Bala and her family members lived in anxiety for days fearing that riots may break out again. But nothing happened.\nWhatever the Hindu or Muslim positions were in Noakhali seven decades ago, Gandhi was able to bring the community together. Sumit Sarkar defined it as Gandh's \"finest hour.\" The principal of Chaumani College, Tafazzal Husain, equated Gandhi with a prophet. Gandhi wrote a letter to Husain and shared his emotion. \"There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth. I shall stick to this job till I die, or someone kills me (Smritikana (Bits of Memory) (Dhaka: 1978), P. 83)\" His statement revealed the internal conflict he had been going through before the partition. He wanted to return to Noakhali after the partition and spend the rest of his life with the Muslim community. More importantly, he compared riots with cancer, which needed to heal before it spread to the whole body of Indian polity. He said prevention was better than cure. Noakhali gave him the opportunity to set an example of communal harmony for the entire Indian subcontinent.\nGandhi's monument\n\nThe Gandhi Ashram Trust, a philanthropic organisation in Noakhali, built a monument to convey Mahatma Gandhi's legacy and memories to the next generation. One can see the 20-foot, white stone sculpture of Gandhi standing upon a plinth and welcoming visitors. He is shown holding a walking stick in one hand, his other hand gently at his side. The statue is surrounded by a gorgeous garden of all sorts of trees and foliage. The image is simple and inviting, while still conveying the power of Gandhi's presence. It was built to commemorate Gandhi and the history of riots in Noakhali. This monument connects us to the history and power of resistance to violence as well as a willingness to reject riots. It always sparks a conversation among people and a broader public image which unites the community.\nA monument is the embodiment of memories, a place bridging different generations. It helps us rethink the past that it perpetuates. Moreover, it is a constant dialogue between past and present, based upon which we can make decisions for the future. Gandhi's monument in Noakhali reveals the past to which we belong and how to learn from it. It also speaks to the community's crisis, trauma, and grief. Gandhi's legacy will continue in Noakhali through his monument, and let people understand the flag of peace he sailed with on his journey throughout Noakhali.\nParvez Rahaman is a PhD candidate at Middle Tennessee State University in the US.

        "full_article": "To monitor the progress and success of the unfinished agenda in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is necessary to improve the availability and quality of data on population and development. Understanding progress related to population requires that the latest, high-quality, accurate, and reliable information be available, disaggregated by factors such as income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location, and other relevant characteristics.\nIn Bangladesh, there is a lack of disaggregated population data for development. Almost one-third of all indicators (32.11 percent) to monitor the 17 SDGs are currently unavailable (out of 248 indicators), 31.3 percent of the indicators are in progress, and 37.4 percent are updated or readily available, according to the SDG tracker of the Bangladesh government. A few of the SDG goals are more critical in this regard. For example, Goal 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns), Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts), and Goal 14 (conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources), which have more than 50 percent of indicators, have no data. More than 30 percent of indicators have no data for Goal 5 (achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls), Goal 10 (reduce inequality within and among countries), Goal 11 (make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, and resilient), and Goal 15 (protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss).\nFor Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), out of 28 indicators, 18 are updated (62.07 percent), whereas six are in progress (20.69 percent), and four have no data (13.79 percent). In the case of Goal 4 (ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all), out of 12 indicators, six are in progress (50 percent), and one has no data (8.33 percent). For Goal 6 (ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), 21.43 percent of the indicators have updated data, whereas 28.57 percent are in progress, and 28.57 percent have no data.\nThe primary population data sources to monitor population and development planning in Bangladesh are the Bangladesh Population and Housing Census, Bangladesh Sample Vital Statistics under the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), Labour Force Survey (LFS), Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), Multiple Cluster Indicator Survey (MICS), Bangladesh Maternal and Healthcare Survey (BMHS), Bangladesh Urban Health Survey (BUHS), Violence Against Women (VAW) Survey, Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), and others. None of these data sources are updated, except the preliminary report of the Sixth Population and Housing Census 2022. The post-enumeration check (PEC) of the census, which was conducted in June, is still in progress. The BBS has not conducted adequate studies on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the population either. Most of the latest surveys on population and development are pretty outdated. For example, the last Child Labour Survey was done in 2013, VAW survey was in 2015, LFS in 2016-2017, and Sample Vital Statistics in 2020. As far as I know, the HIES 2022 is ongoing. We do not know how long it will take to see the final HIES report and when the complete data will be available to the researchers.\nIn Bangladesh, the quality of the available data does not always meet expectations, and data is not always made readily available to researchers. Moreover, considerable delays in releasing detailed analytical reports may disrupt the timely production of indicators and statistical information, as well as hamper evidence-based policymaking. Hence, improving data availability and quality is necessary in the country. A systematic assessment of the population and development planning database is needed. The government should work more intensively to support capacity-building to collect the administrative data used for SDG monitoring and reporting. Data authentication, conversion to official statistics, and setting targets every five years to measure improvement are needed.\nFor that, the government should encourage the UN agencies that concentrate many efforts on marginalised and vulnerable groups across the country. Some of the critical challenges in monitoring SDG progress and national policies include: (i) lack of disaggregated data by age, sex, disability, and at the subnational level; (ii) conceptual, definitional, and methodological challenges concerning international homogeneity; (iii)) lack of technical support for regular monitoring; (v) difficulty in data collection and immediate dissemination; and (vi) lack of funding from different sources, i.e. private sector, public sector, public-private partnership, NGOs, and external financing.\nWe are just seven years away from the SDG deadline. It is urgent now to improve data availability and quality for population and development planning. Following the principle that no one should be left behind in the 2030 development agenda, various UN agencies can accelerate their efforts across the country. Once we get the latest information on the status of population and development indicators, it will be possible to explore how they are linked to SDG monitoring and what needs to be done to strengthen said monitoring, and what factors might assist this strengthening process. Realistically, planning is difficult without a solid database and a body of researchers who utilise and assess said database.\nDr Mohammad Mainul Islam\u00a0is a professor and former chairman of the Department of Population Sciences at Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In director Syed Ahmed Shawki's critically acclaimed first season of the prison thriller\u00a0Karagar, there is a scene where a leader of the inmates, a follower of the mystery man known as Gazi Peer, tells fellow inmates that they are living in relative comfort but lack one crucial element in their life. \"What do we not have here?\" he asks, and then, prompted by a lackey, answers, \"We don't have a guardian we can call our own\" \u2013 a vacuum, he goes on to suggest, Gazi Peer could fill.\nI bring this up in an op-ed on forests merely to show \u2013 in as whimsical a way as all problems in Bangladesh seem to be connected \u2013 the absurdity of a recent case involving prisons and forests, and to suggest that prisons can cause this feeling of a lack of guardianship not just within their cells but outside as well. The central characters in this case are two departments of the government, prison and forest, who should have nothing to do with each other ordinarily. Yet, in this land of precious little land, the two traded metaphorical blows over a piece of forest recently, after the prison authorities started a bid to build an \"open prison\" there.\nAccording to a report by\u00a0The Daily Star, the problem began after the 160 acres of forestland in Ukhiya, Cox's Bazar was allotted to the prison department by the land ministry, after which the former placed demarcation flags around it. But then the forest department removed those flags since no prior clearance was taken from them. This is where things get tricky. Forest officials say the land is part of a protected forest. Prison officials, however, say it is\u00a0khas\u00a0land. It can be both and yet retain its distinct character. The question is: can the prison department get out of the obligation to obtain permission on a technicality? Can they approach protected forestland the same way they would any unforested\u00a0khas\u00a0land? And why would the land ministry even allow for the destruction of a natural resource of which we have evidently so little?\nIt is ironic to think that any sense of a lack of guardianship with regard to our fast-depleting forests would come from having too many guardians. It can only mean having no real guardian at all. This is as true for our forests as it is for our hills and rivers. The latter, despite being granted a \"living entity\" status by the High Court and having the National River Protection Commission assigned as their \"legal guardian,\" continue to be in dire straits. With protectors like these, who needs predators?\nThe forest department may appear to be on the right side of things for once, but its history is equally tainted. Note its line of argument in case of the Ukhiya incident. When approached for comments over the conflict, a forest officer said they had \"no issues\" with the prison authorities; all they ask is for them to \"go through proper procedure.\" As if that would have justified clearing a forest.\nNot long ago, after the government allowed the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to build a residential training facility on 20 acres of land in a reserved forest in Ramu, Cox's Bazar, the minister of environment, forest and climate change supported handing over the land. He claimed that there was \"no alternative\" to it and that \"we will make sure that any harm to the forestland is kept to a minimum.\" That's a BIG minimum, as revealed by an internal estimate, which said that 30,000 trees will have to be felled for the construction of the centre. Last year, the land ministry, a frequent violator of forest conservation rules and directives, also allotted 700 acres of a forest adjacent to the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive to the public administration ministry to build a civil service academy there.\nCould these projects be taken elsewhere? Certainly. Could we get back a forest if ravaged? Certainly not. You can't simply wish a forest into existence or have it magically regrown elsewhere. The last two forests in question are designated Ecologically Critical Areas (ECAs), which makes them extremely important to conserve.\nBut forget the criminality of using forests for non-forest purposes. What we are witnessing here is an environmental free-fall with forests being encroached by the very people/agencies whose responsibility it is to prevent it. This is being done mostly through what we can call\u00a0illegally legal\u00a0means, such as \"de-reserving\" part of a reserved forest, keeping the option for decriminalising a takeover through \"proper procedure,\" leasing out forestland, etc. And it's happening at a time when the reserved forests in Cox's Bazar have been facing a great onslaught, with more than 7,000 acres of forestland already razed to the ground by refugees in Ukhiya and Teknaf. Not to be outdone by their official counterparts, illegal encroachers also sliced away more than 50,000 acres of a total of 186,457 acres of reserved forests across the coastal region.\nThere are precious few forests left in Bangladesh. I'm not going into details, nor are details what move our policy goalposts. If it did, Bangladesh's commitment at the COP26 summit last year to stop deforestation \u2013 and increase forestland by 25 percent \u2013 by 2030 would have translated into drastic action given the short window of time. Instead, we are putting everything we hold dear at the altar of development. We're driving away indigenous communities who traditionally protected these lands. And we're continuously encouraging official encroachment under various pretexts through various wings of the administration, when they should be on hyper-alert to stave off such attempts.\nWhat they \u2013 and, frankly, all of us \u2013 need urgently is a renewed sense of ownership and guardianship of what little forest coverage we still have left,\u00a0a paltry 11 percent or so,\u00a0and to try to protect and build upon it. Change is possible only if we realise how critical forests or wildlife are to our existence.\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n\n",

Initially we saw global lockdowns which impacted our major markets in the US and European Union. But then came the vaccines and as they were being rolled out, business slowly started returning to normal and we even had a backlog of orders at one point.\nThe worry, at present, is that it is hard to see an end in sight as far as the energy crisis is concerned, which continues to hamper productivity in our garment industry. This crisis is causing sleepless nights for all of us with a vested interest in the success of our most important industry.\nRecent estimates suggest various global issues which have led to gas shortages have hit garment production levels by up to half.\nLack of adequate gas pressure combined with soaring fuel costs means that many factories are now running at significantly lower capacity. Some factories have closed and others may follow if the situation does not ease soon. Some factories are only running during the evening when gas pressure is consistent.\nThese issues all have knock-on effects, impacting the ability of factory owners to pay bank loans, salaries, rents, and so on.\nAs well as energy challenges, factory owners are also suffering from a lack of orders. Orders have been falling since spring and, many claim, ever since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. The question is, why are we facing such a situation and when will it all end?\nI spoke to many friends in Europe and the US to try and find some answers to these questions. Here is what I discovered.\nFirstly, let's go back to early spring and the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war, which has had such a profound knock-on effect around the globe.\nI do not want to get too much into the politics of the war so I will keep things simple. Nato is a defensive alliance of 30 countries from Europe and North America. While not a Nato member, Ukraine is a Nato partner.\nAccordingly, Nato has consistently condemned in the strongest terms Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and has been providing Ukraine with unprecedented levels of support, helping to uphold its right to self-defence. This has included weapons and arms.\nIn retaliation to this, Russia \u2013 a major exporter of oil, coal and gas \u2013 has weaponised these vital energy supplies. Many Nato members have had their oil and gas supplies cut off by Russia, meaning that Europeans have seen their energy prices skyrocket beyond anything they could have imagined. This, in turn, is impacting spending power in a key market of Bangladesh. With huge gas and electric bills to pay, customers are reducing discretionary spending in things such as fast fashion.\nMany American and security leaders have been telling Europe for years that they need to diversify their energy supplies and not be so dependent on Russian oil and gas. Sadly, they have not moved quickly enough and left themselves highly exposed to the energy supply squeeze being implemented by Russia.\nBecause supply is being squeezed, this is placing upward pressure on energy globally. This is because Russia is such an important player in the global energy market. Basic economics say if you restrict supply, prices will rise, and that is what we are continuing to see. It could be a long winter.\nThere is more. Many countries in the European Union have been attempting to transition away from oil and gas towards renewable energy resources. All of this has helped create the perfect storm whereby Russia has intermittently stopped the flow of natural gas to Europe, using its dominant market position to inflict pain and uncertainty on Europe. The European Union is dependent on Russia for 46 percent of its coal imports and nearly 30 percent of its oil imports according to latest estimates.\nWhere will this end and what can garment makers expect in the coming months? Business associates tell me the war between Russia and Ukraine is dragging on for longer than expected. There is no sign of a ceasefire and, like so many of these wars, this has become a long, protracted battle.\nThe implications of all these are profound. As long as this war is raging, and as long as Nato is not willing to cede to Russia's demands (Russia wants an agreement that Ukraine will not join Nato), then energy markets globally will continue to be impacted. The effects of this will be felt even more severely as winter kicks in.\nLike it or not, Bangladesh now operates in a globalised world. It is hard to see the energy challenges being experienced by our garment makers easing any time soon.\nAs garment makers, we need to prepare ourselves for the idea that these challenges will be here for many more months to come. The pandemic was tough but this is a different animal altogether.\nMostafiz Uddin is the Managing Director of Denim Expert Limited. He is also the Founder and CEO of Bangladesh Denim Expo and Bangladesh Apparel Exchange (BAE).\n\n",

        "full_article": "In August this year, the country experienced a searing heat wave where the average maximum temperature turned out to be a three-decade high. Now, a study published by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center has found that Dhaka is losing USD 6 billion worth of labour productivity each year due to heat stress from extreme temperatures. This amounts to over 8 percent of the city's annual labour output, and unless measures are taken to reduce global warming, this number could rise to 10 percent by 2050.\n\nWhile there are other cities that are more exposed to heat stress, Dhaka is especially vulnerable due to its labour-intensive economy and low rate of active cooling.\nOut of the 12 cities compared in the study, the situation in Dhaka is the worst. While there are other cities that are more exposed to heat stress, Dhaka is especially vulnerable due to its labour-intensive economy and low rate of active cooling. So, although climate change is making the already high temperatures and humidity in Dhaka substantially worse, it seems the city authorities have done little to alleviate the situation.\nAccording to experts, greenery and water bodies have an important impact on reducing heat stress in urban areas. However, another study recently found that Dhaka has lost around 56 percent of its green spaces over the last three decades. The circumstances are similar in terms of Dhaka's wetlands, 22 percent of which are estimated to have been lost over the span of nearly a decade. And it is not just rapid urbanisation and encroachment of natural spaces that are heating up the capital. Last month, we were reminded once again of the disturbingly high volumes of untreated waste that are flowing into the rivers of Dhaka and slowly killing them, right under the noses of the same authorities in charge of protecting them.\nEqually disturbing, but perhaps not surprising, is the fact that the poorest are the biggest victims of extreme temperatures. The new study found that in informal settlements where corrugated iron sheet are used on roofs, temperatures are typically 12 degree Celsius higher than the rest of Dhaka, since these trap heat during the day and do not radiate it fast enough at night. A lack of greenery and surrounding high-rise buildings blocking wind flow only add to their sufferings.\nThe highest worker productivity-related economic losses, too, are felt by the poor. The study found that in sectors such as garment manufacturing, transport, and retail trade, where wages can be lower than average, losses from heat stress already amount to around 10 percent of income. These are particularly high in industries where workers are in proximity to machinery or ovens, such as garment manufacturing or brick making. All the while, the glass buildings and constant use of air-conditioning of the urban rich and white-collar industries only continue to further heat up the city.\nThe situation is clearly untenable, and if urgent actions are not taken, it is not only the poor who will feel its impacts; our entire urban economy will be under stress. The unplanned urbanisation of Dhaka must be curbed by all means, and the authorities must demonstrate their commitment to creating a liveable city by taking concrete steps to reduce heat stress.\n",

        "full_article": "It's painful to see the manner in which the government's much-vaunted anti-drug campaign in Teknaf \u2013 which got Yaba traders to \"surrender\" promising not to go back to their ignoble business \u2013 has fallen flat on its face. As a report in this paper has revealed, most of these seasoned Yaba dealers (some of them godfathers) managed to get bail with their \"promises\" and went back to their old trade. Should we attribute this failure to the naivet\u00e9 demonstrated in taking a soft approach to rein in the big fish in the Yaba business, or was this just a contrived publicity stunt all along? Either way, it's evident that the cancerous spread of this trade in Teknaf and other areas of Cox's Bazar is not going to be contained any time soon.\n\nShould we attribute this failure to the naivet\u00e9 demonstrated in taking a soft approach to rein in the big fish in the Yaba business, or was this just a contrived publicity stunt all along?\nAccording to our report, around 123 top narcotics dealers surrendered to the police in 2019 after a countrywide crackdown against drugs. Among them were four brothers of a former lawmaker. Reportedly, one of the brothers, who was released on bail in 2020 on the condition that he would not return to the drug trade, was now back in the business and allegedly sheltering other drug smugglers. Another released Yaba dealer has become the chairman of Teknaf Union Parishad, but at the same time he is reportedly back in the business of drug trafficking as well. It is obvious that the involvement of politically influential individuals in the narcotics trade has made it impossible to curb, let alone end this dangerous trade.\nWhen drug dealers become local government representatives or are family members of lawmakers, how realistic is the idea of adopting a lenient attitude to handling them or curtailing this nefarious business? How do they even become elected councillors, union parishad members or union chairmen? It is frightening to know that many of these very godfathers, with a clean chit from the police, now play a leading role in law-and-order meetings. One can only imagine the state of law and order in these areas!\nAt least 299 individuals were reportedly killed in so-called \"gunfights\" during the drive against narcotics in Cox's Bazar. These deaths have not helped to stop Yaba from entering the border points or being sold all over the country or smuggled to another country. Meanwhile, the \"soft approach\" to haul in drug lords has also come to naught \u2013 which casts doubt on whether the authorities are at all serious about making Cox's Bazar and other districts free from the clutches of narcotics. If they are, then they must prove it through action and put an end to the political patronage of the trade. They must remove the loopholes that allow kingpins to get away with little punishment and come back stronger and more dangerous.\n",

        "full_article": "Either on the insistence of doctors, mostly at private hospitals and clinics, or in critical situations by the patients' own choice, the option for caesarean section has been on the rise in Bangladesh. The C-section delivery has witnessed a sharp rise in the country, the increase being 8-fold from 2004 to 2017-18. To elaborate, the practice of undergoing the C-section among Bangladeshi mothers in the country was found to be 3.99 per cent in 2004. It jumped to 33.22 per cent in 2017-18. As has been recommended by the WHO (World Health Organisation), the rate of C-section should not exceed 15 per cent of total births. These findings, normally not made public, were disclosed at a seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). The event has incisively proved it was time for conducting an in-depth study on C-section delivery against the backdrop of a section of doctors going straight for C-section. At the same time, it also deals with the misuse of 'aided delivery', the dearth of doctors with scruple and trained nurses. That a good number of obscure private clinics in both large and small cities are in business thanks to their sole dependence on C-section cases warrants urgent focus. The study presented by a BIDS Research Fellow has put in all-out efforts to encompass a number of issues tied to the C-section deliveries in Bangladesh. He comes up with a number of startling disclosures like the prevalence of C-section delivery at only 2.0 per cent in villages in 2004. The rate galloped to 29 per cent in 2017-18. To add to this, the study finds that although the C-section cases were high among the urban mothers, 12 per cent in 2004 and 44 per cent in 2017-18, those living in the rural areas also became desperate to utilise C-section services. It's worth mentioning that the overall 'out-of-pocket' cost of a C-section delivery during the study period was about Taka 20,000 in the country. The study findings have shown that the C-section delivery cases are higher at private hospitals and clinics, with 46.2 per cent in 2014 and 52 per cent in 2017-18 at these facilities. In comparison, the public ones had 12 per cent in 2014, and 10.6 per cent in 2017-18. As has been observed by the BIDS research fellow, there is no monitoring of the healthcare system in Bangladesh. When it comes to C-section deliveries, there are few reliable data on whether birth-related operations prior to the C-section were necessary, the study says. At times the would-be mothers and their relatives are made to agree to C-sections after being convinced that their patients' condition would be in jeopardy without operation, it adds. All these lacunae might prompt the critics against indiscriminate C-sections to call the practice a sheer extortion. There are few alternatives to normal delivery. But the patients' adverse health conditions at times warrant C-sections. They also become life-saving options. In a country with little or no facility for pre-pregnancy advocacy and awareness sessions for mothers, unnecessary and expensive C-sections can be forced on the expecting mothers. Moreover, the state of the mother-child bond after a natural birth and that developed after an assisted delivery has also to be kept in focus. It's the mothers who want to avoid the myth of acute labour pain and complications are found to opt for C-sections.",

        "full_article": "Every transaction has two wings - receipts and payments. This is the golden rule of bookkeeping. The same is applicable to cross border transactions. For instance, a buyer makes payments to a seller who receives money for the deal. On the other hand, an importer makes fund available to a bank for transferring the same to the supplier abroad. Thus transaction takes place. It is frequently said that hundi by-passes legal transactions. Formal channel can also facilitate illegitimate transactions through over-invoicing for imports and under-invoicing for exports to cover up money laundering. Cross border transactions can be executed without support from banking channels. These are effected through two channels - current transfers and capital or financial transfers. Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of the country defines current account transactions as receipts and payments such as - (i) receipts and payments due in connection with foreign trade, other current business including services, and normal short-term banking and credit facilities in ordinary course of business; (ii) receipts and payments due as interest on loans and as net income from investments; (iii) moderate amounts of amortisation of loans or for depreciation of direct investments, in the ordinary course of business; (iv) expenses in connection with foreign travel, education and medical care of self, parents, spouse and children; and (v) moderate remittances for family living expenses of parents, spouse and children resident abroad. Capital account transaction is defined as a transaction for the creation, modification, transfer or liquidation of a capital asset, including but not limited to, securities issued in capital and money markets, negotiable instruments, non-securitised claims, units of mutual fund or collective investment securities, commercial credits and loans, financial credits, sureties, guarantees, deposit account operations, life insurance, personal capital movements, real estate, foreign direct investment, portfolio and institutional investment.In theory, taka is freely convertible on current account transactions. It means that transactions on current accounts require no permission from regulator. But insiders have different views; banks are allowed to execute transactions within indicative limit under general authority. Exceeding the authorisation, permission from central bank is required. Contradictory views bring discord in business transactions, though ease of doing business is much talked about issue of the time.Transactions under capital account for inward investment like direct investment, portfolio investment are open. Other transactions require permission from the authorities. As Taka is not convertible for outward remittances on capital account transactions, every transaction under current account is under monitoring system of the central bank. Every import payment is subject to documentary proof by the entry of relative goods; each shipment of export needs to be matched by inward remittances. Every outward remittance is subject to report to the central bank. All these are meant to ensure that capital transfers do not take place in disguise of current payments. Whether the monitoring system brings effective results is debatable. It is assumed that Taka is fully convertible on capital account transactions. In that situation, whether monitoring framework is necessary is a question. Central banks of the countries under convertible capital account framework do not follow such monitoring mechanism. They simply collect information to generate different macroeconomic reports. If current account transactions were fully convertible in the true sense, and capital account in part, the demand for transactions under shadow paths would have waned. As such, monitoring framework for cross border transactions would have been redundant. To transfer money under the garb of current accounts through banking channel or shadow channels, there is need for foreign currency inflows. Balance of payments shows inflows and outflows. Of the total inflows, export constitutes more than 50 per cent followed by wage remittances. Exporters are required to put regulatory declaration regarding their exports of goods, payments of which are to be repatriated within four months from the date of shipments. No repatriation can lead exporters to face regulatory actions in addition to being deprived of policy supports like cash incentives, bond facilities, low-cost loans, etc. Auto-piloting works in repatriation of proceeds in export trade. In addition to export of physical goods, cross border service delivery as per mode 1 of GATS is treated as service exports. Examples include consultancy, legal, engineering, accounting, information technology, and many more. Service is a potential sector, for which central bank allows service exporters to retain major parts of inward receipts in foreign currency for meeting expenses. Despite, the sector is yet to present significant position in cross-border transactions. There is a complaint that service exporters do not repatriate payments properly. The underlying reasons, as per insiders, are that service exporters need outward remittances for which required tax payments results in extra cost burden. Remittances sent by Bangladeshi expatriates are the second highest source of external income. It is not mandatory for non-residents to send the income generated abroad. Non-residents can use the income where they reside. We all know that most of the people living in mega cities like Dhaka are from rural and urban areas. There are professions like - white collar, blue collar, red collar, etc. People under white category usually save money and invest in capital goods like real estate purchases. They send money to village home occasionally. Other people frequently send money. But income generated in mega cities is not bound to go to the origins of its earners. The same is true for non-residents, whose size of inward remittances is small. Only blue collar workers regularly send back money. Demand for cross-border transactions through dubious channels creates alternative foreign exchange markets. Foreign exchange rate for inward remittances has been set at higher level than that of export receipts. Higher rate for wage receipts is an indication that the remittances are traded otherwise for transfer. Now there comes a question which fund is routed abroad by adjustment of wage remittances. Definitely restrictions on outward remittances and relevant formalities pose problems which result in shadow markets. Such payments are not generally permissible for which specific concurrence is required. It is true that market is created where there is a demand. If the demand is eradicated, the market will disappear. Open market economy is run by regulatory rule-book under which economic actors work. In case of non-compliance, regulators rectify but do not control. Smooth paths for cross-border transactions can meet demand. This can dissolve shadow market to a large extent and widen formal market with increment of inward receipts from external sources. Hence, shadow channels should not be by-products of policy framework. Revisiting cross-border transactions through formal channels is warranted.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Ever since the usurpation of power from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), the junta government has mercilessly steamrollered its opposition forces in Myanmar. With the resistance getting consolidated and backlash coming from rebel groups such as the Arakan Army, the Karen National Liberation Army and the National Unity Government's armed wing People's Defence Force, the government forces are now feeling the heat. The military rulers in Napayidaw are not only becoming more and more desperate but also acting insanely to have repercussion beyond its border. Mortar shells fired from across the border have landed on Bangladesh territory on a number of occasions and bullets whizzed past the border between the two neighbours. At Ghumdhum in Bandarban several mortars fired from the Myanmar side exploded, killing one Rohingya youth along with injuring six others. Its war planes have also crossed the border several times. The rogue state is violating international rules with impunity. Bangladesh government's protests have fallen on deaf ears so far. In fact, Bangladesh has not been in the best of relations with Myanmar even when it was known as Burma because of its internal conflicts that spilled over to this side of the border. The saga of Rohingya eviction from their homes began as early as 1977 followed by a mass exodus in 2009 and the greatest of all in 2017 when 750,000 Rohingya from the Rakhine state crossed over to Bangladesh. Since then Bangladesh has been sheltering more than a million of those refugees at a huge economic, social and environmental cost. The prospect of repatriation of the Rohingya people fades into distant horizon with the internal conflicts in Myanmar intensifying. Now that the military rulers are facing resistance and reprisals, their army on the battlefront has gone berserk. On top of this, there is ample provocation and unless the Bangladesh government had demonstrated maximum restraint, a war would have flared between the two countries. Myanmar under the junta rule has caused the nation on this side of the Naf river bleed. That its pogrom of the Rohingya people has imposed an economic burden on Bangladesh is none of its concern. Myanmar also stands accused of its despicable role in random supply of drugs, yaba in particular. It has allowed proliferation of yaba-producing factories on its soil close to the border. Now its military operations in border areas have crossed all limits. Its aggression has to be repulsed before it poses a serious threat to Bangladesh's sovereignty. Now Bangladesh finds itself in a delicate situation because its primary concern is the repatriation of more than 1.0 million Rohingya refugees from its soil. Border skirmishes between the military of the Junta government and the Arakan Army have posed a serious threat to repatriation. Bangladesh cannot and must not be at the receiving end perpetually. Its aim is to settle the issue peacefully. But the junta government's postures and actions are proving too much for the country hosting a huge number of Rohingya refugees. World's big players know very well how the military rulers have gone crazy to unleash oppression on their own people and are also posing a threat to its neighbours. But they won't exert enough pressure on the military high commands in Napayidaw only because they have economic and commercial interests in that country with vast natural resources. This is exactly why the defenders of democracy are turning a blind eye to the atrocities, pogroms and violation of international rules and laws. But this cannot go on for the eternity. The illegal power seizers there must be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

But at least some roads should be free of heavy traffic. Dhaka Airport Road should lead the pack. Air passengers from across the country use this crucial road to reach Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport so that they can catch their scheduled flights on time. However, many of them miss their domestic and international flights due to traffic jam on this road. Some lanes on the road to the Dhaka airport are currently closed to traffic due to ongoing work on the bus rapid transit project. This has led to heavy congestion on a regular basis. But the authorities concerned have not yet taken any effective measures for the air passengers to take alternative roads to reach the airport. So, we urge the authorities to look into the issue sincerely and do the needful to resolve this problem as soon as possible.\nBadsha Faysal, Dania, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
