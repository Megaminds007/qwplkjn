The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on the defensive in 58 seats in western Uttar Pradesh; 11 districts vote in the first phase. In 2017, the party had won 51 of these seats (later 52). The challenge to the BJP\u2019s dominance comes primarily from the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal (SP-RLD) alliance in this potato and sugarcane belt but also in the fray are the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress alongside recent entrants, the Aam Aadmi Party and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. The region, abutting the national capital of Delhi, was a hotspot of the farmers\u2019 agitation against the Central government last year. The SP-RLD alliance draws its evident energy from the resentment against the BJP among Jats, a farming community that had aligned with the party\u2019s Hindutva agenda in recent years. The BJP has put forth a plank of suraksha (security) and samman (dignity). Taken aback by the momentum of the SP-RLD alliance, it is trying to polarise the elections so that Jat farmers who constitute an estimated 17% of the population in the region and who voted overwhelmingly for the party in the last elections do not unite with Muslims who constitute 26% of the population (in the region). The BJP\u2019s behaviour signals that it will leave no stone unturned to consolidate the Hindu votes and override caste tensions, across the State.The BJP is also trying to create a narrative that the SP scores poorly on law and order, and the Yogi Adityanath government has been tough on crime in the last five years. The law and order pitch of the party is communally tinged, however. The party is highlighting government investment in highways, airports and medical colleges; and free vaccine and ration during the pandemic. The SP-RLD alliance is targeting the ruling government on the farm crisis in light of the farmers\u2019 agitation and is trying to build on the brotherhood among farmers across caste and religious barriers. Apart from Jats and Yadavs, it is expected to wean a chunk of Gurjars, another agrarian community, away from the BJP. It is raising issues of inflation, particularly high electricity tariffs, unemployment and stray cattle, an outcome of the emotive cow protection drive. Consolidating its vote bank in the name of Hindutva, cultural nationalism, the Ram temple and Article 370, the BJP is also keen to make a dent in the BSP\u2019s Dalit vote bank to get over the losses made because of farmers\u2019 agitation. Dalit leader and former Chief Minister Mayawati (BSP) has made a strong comeback with a rally in Agra, and hopes to win enough seats in the region to influence government formation.",

        "full_article": "It is time the Union government took a categorical stand on the issue of treating marital rape as a criminal offence. It informed the Delhi High Court earlier this week that it was having a relook at its position spelt out over five years ago. In 2017, the Government had opposed the removal of the statutory exception in Section 375 of the IPC for rape committed by a man on his wife, if she is not below 18 years of age. The remarks of the Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Smriti Irani, in Parliament also do not throw much light on the matter. She merely said the Government was engaged in a process to introduce comprehensive amendments to criminal law, indicating perhaps that the criminalising of marital rape is unlikely to be taken up in isolation. At the same time, she observed that it would not be advisable to condemn every marriage as a violent one, and every man a rapist. One can only interpret this as a sign that the Government is quite wary of agreeing with the body of opinion that favours recognising rape as something that could happen within a marriage too. In 2016, the Government had rejected the concept of marital rape, saying it \u201ccannot be applied to the Indian context due to various factors like level of education/illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs and the mindset of the society to treat marriage as a sacrament\u201d.There is no indication as to the sort of departure from this formulation, if any, that the proposed reconsideration will lead to. However, the question no longer brooks responses marked by ambivalence or tending towards buying time. One cannot expect the courts to delay indefinitely a ruling on the constitutionality of the existing exception in rape law. The conventional arguments against criminalising rape within marriage \u2014 that the institution of marriage will be ruined and that it is liable to misuse \u2014 no longer hold good. The country has adopted a domestic violence law that enables complaints against physical and sexual abuse. The IPC also holds cruelty to be an offence in a domestic context. Therefore, making marital rape a criminal offence is unlikely to ruin the institution of marriage any more than a complaint of domestic violence or cruelty would. The exception given to marital rape harks back, as the report by the Justice J.S. Verma committee noted while recommending its removal, to an outdated notion of marriage that treated the wife as the husband\u2019s property. The notion of \u2018implied consent\u2019 within marriage is also reflected in marriage laws that allow for \u201crestitution of conjugal rights\u201d, a remedy that either party to a marriage may avail of. Looking at marriage through the anachronistic lens of \u2018coverture\u2019 \u2014 the view that the wife is under the husband\u2019s authority always \u2014 should not be allowed to override the autonomy of married women over their person.",

        "full_article": "Beijing may be 6,500km from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, but the geopolitical stakes for China in the escalating crisis over Ukraine's fate could not be higher. If Russia invades Ukraine and precipitates a drawn-out conflict with the US and its Western allies (though a direct military confrontation is unlikely), China obviously stands to benefit. America will need to divert strategic resources to confront Russia, and its European allies will be even more reluctant to heed US entreaties to join its anti-China coalition.\nBut if US President Joe Biden defuses the crisis by acceding to some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands, China will likely end up worse off strategically. While Putin will reap the benefits of his coercive diplomacy, and Biden will avoid a potential quagmire in Eastern Europe, China will find itself the sole focus of US national security strategy. Worse still, after Putin has skilfully exploited the US obsession with China to re-establish Russia's sphere of influence, the strategic value of his China card may depreciate significantly.\nFor Putin, capitalising on Biden's fear of being dragged into a conflict with a secondary adversary (Russia) in order to extract critical security concessions is a risky but smart move. But ordering an invasion of Ukraine\u2014and thus effectively volunteering to be the US' primary geopolitical adversary, at least in the short to medium term\u2014is hardly in the Kremlin's interest. Crippling Western sanctions and the high costs of fighting an insurgency in Ukraine would almost certainly weaken Russia significantly, and make Putin himself both domestically unpopular and more dependent on Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nIntriguingly, despite the high stakes for China in the Ukraine crisis, the Chinese government has been extremely careful about showing its hand. While the heightened tensions dominate Western media headlines, Ukraine receives scant coverage in the official Chinese press. Between December 15, 2021, when Putin and Xi held a virtual summit, and January 24, 2022, The People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China, carried only one article about the crisis\u2014on the inconclusive talks in mid-January between Russia and the US and its NATO allies. Editorials or commentaries voicing Chinese support for Russia are also notable by their absence.\nEven more intriguingly, the summary of the Putin-Xi summit released by the Kremlin claimed that Xi supported Putin's demand for Western security guarantees precluding NATO's further eastward expansion, but the Chinese version, published by the official Xinhua news agency, contained no such reference. Instead of explicitly endorsing Putin's position, Xi's statement was vague and general pabulum about \"providing firm mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests.\"\nThe pattern continued when Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on January 27. Western media characterised Wang's statement on Ukraine as an expression of support for Putin. In fact, Wang planted China's diplomatic stake squarely on the sidelines, only saying that \"Russia's reasonable security concerns should be stressed and resolved.\"\nChinese reticence on Ukraine suggests that Xi is carefully hedging his bets. To be sure, Putin's aggressive diplomacy is serving Chinese interests\u2014at least for now. Should he decide to invade Ukraine and divert the US strategic focus away from China, so much the better.\nBut, assuming that Xi does not know the Kremlin's real intentions vis-a-vis Ukraine, he is prudent not to show his own cards either. Any expression of unequivocal Chinese support for Putin's demands could leave China with little wiggle room. At worst, goading Putin down the path of war could be construed in some circles in Moscow as a diabolical Chinese plot to use Russia as a strategic pawn in the Sino-American cold war. Alternatively, should Putin choose to pocket face-saving gains in order to avoid a potential disaster, China would look foolish for having backed the Kremlin's unattainable demands.\nChina's leaders are realists and know that they can do little to influence the outcome of the current crisis in Ukraine\u2014even if they choose to intervene publicly. With Putin holding most of the cards in the ongoing stand-off, China's diplomatic support is unlikely to alter the strategic calculus of the principal protagonists in Washington, Brussels, or even Moscow. Its influence will increase dramatically only if Putin rolls the dice and invades Ukraine, because he will then need Chinese economic support to lessen the impact of Western sanctions.\nBut for now, all this is speculative as far as Xi is concerned. Although a superpower, China is temporarily reduced to being an onlooker, watching both anxiously and hopefully on the sidelines as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\u00a0\nMinxin Pei,\u00a0professor at Claremont McKenna College, is a non-resident senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n",

        "full_article": "\"The police should always recognise the need for strict adherence to police-executive functions, and to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary of authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.\"\u2014Sir Robert Peel\n\u00a0\nA young female is reported missing. The police find a dead body. The relatives identify the body. The police make an arrest and question the suspect. His full identity is revealed. The police hold a well-publicised press conference and announce that the offender (the term suspect is no longer used) has confessed to the murder. They disclose his motive, and incriminating items they found are displayed for all to see. Everything is stated as a fact, not as untested raw information. The court allows further time for questioning. In the next few days, the media frantically updates the public, citing police sources. The detained person is then paraded before the media, flanked by police officers. The bulk of the police investigation finishes there, as the suspect is sent to prison until he appears before a trial judge. Meanwhile, although still innocent in the eyes of the law, a de facto trial, firmly establishing the guilt of the accused in public mind, has already taken place.\nThe above is an illustration of the way many serious criminal investigations are handled by the various branches of the police services in Bangladesh. The higher judiciary has repeatedly expressed concerns about this growing trend. In a published decision in August 2019, the High Court bench of Justice M Enayetur Rahim and Justice Md Mostafizur Rahman warned that an investigating officer cannot step into the shoes of the trial judge. In the same month, while delivering their decision on a bail petition, the same bench observed that parading suspects in front of the media even before their first court appearance was unconstitutional and unacceptable.\nRecently, the same judges, while reportedly considering a writ petition, expressed deep concerns about the way the police were communicating their investigation findings to the public, and articulated the necessity for binding regulations to stem this disturbing trend. Moreover, a number of prominent legal experts have voiced disquiet about the detrimental impact of such practices on the country's criminal justice system. In this respect, this article simply repeats a platitude. In the words of Andre Gide, \"Everything has been said already, but no one has listened. So, it must be said again.\"\nCriminal investigation is a major function of the police services in all common law countries, including Bangladesh. Such investigations are carried out for the sole purpose of enabling the court system to utilise, evaluate and scrutinise the resultant evidence from the investigation, in order to deliver justice. But the due process of law is liable to be undermined in two significant respects when the police embark on sharing their investigation results prematurely with the public. Firstly, the police, in communicating their impression of a suspect's guilt, largely rely on the confession secured through their interrogation and their own opinion. But under the Code of Criminal Procedure of Bangladesh, neither a confession made to the police nor the opinion of the police about a suspect's guilt is admissible in court. Therefore, it is perfectly possible for a court, after considering the admissible evidence and following the due process, to make a decision about a suspect that is in sharp conflict with the impression the police give to the public beforehand. This brings the judiciary into disrepute.\nSecondly, police's duty to collect evidence continues until a suspect appears before a trial court. However, when the police prematurely communicate their opinion of the suspect's guilt to the people, any subsequent evidence pointing against that would be difficult for them to submit to the court, as that would discredit them in the public eyes. Yet, non-disclosure of any subsequent evidence to the court would create grounds for the miscarriage of justice.\nParading an arrested person before the media is of equal concern. Sometimes, such spectacles take place even without any admission or confession of an offence. The police appear to be content to allow the media to publish their views of the individual's involvement in a crime, masquerading as tested facts. Such practices not only breach that individual's constitutional rights\u2014as observed by the High Court bench\u2014but also have potentially serious implications for the police services in Bangladesh. It is not inconceivable that such an individual, especially if they are subsequently found not guilty by the court, could bring a civil defamation action for damages against the police services. Indeed, a floodgate of such proceedings could ensue if police practices remain unregulated in this regard.\nPolice in many common law countries with exemplary criminal justice systems, such as England, Australia and Singapore, also communicate directly with the general public. An investigating officer in those countries may appear before the media to ask people to help with information if they have witnessed a particular crime. The investigation results are never disclosed directly to the public in order to maintain the integrity of the evidence. However, once the court has found a person guilty, the police then may disclose information about how the evidence was secured against the suspect, if the nature of the case generates public interest. This way, the due process of law is upheld while enhancing the image of the judiciary and the police alike. The police services in Bangladesh should aspire to emulate this process.\nBangladesh's new chief justice was sworn in on December 31, 2021. On the eve of his appointment, the prime minister urged the judiciary to ensure complete justice for all. The chief justice has since declared his determination to work towards such goals. It is suggested that the chief justice may consider that the Supreme Court urgently needs to assist and bind the police services in regulating its investigative process, in order to serve the interests of justice in the country. Such efforts by the chief justice would be a tangible stride towards his declared goals.\n",

        "full_article": "Using symbolic images to represent sexual crimes is very common in news media. Vague stock images that visually represent sexual crimes or gender-based violence are widely used. Still, even these faceless images manage to reflect the hold our society's patriarchy has on the media's portrayal of sexual crimes.\nMost commonly, the victim is found at the centre of the image, either covering her face with her hands or with a \"strong\" hand gagging her from behind, or even shadows of menacing hands reaching for her from a corner. The background of these images is usually filled with dark colours, and the victim is shown to be completely helpless when such a crime is taking place. She is always portrayed as being inactive, sad, scared and perplexed. In some cases, the constructed image of the victim is presented as being naked, having wounded skin with scratch marks on her. Sometimes, the creators of these images go the extra mile and paint the victim's nails red, perhaps to highlight her \"femininity.\" The victim portrayed is always apparently young and slim\u2014as if sexual violence only happens to young girls of a certain body type. These images are generally victim-focused, but the perpetrators are always in the shadows or \"anonymous.\"\nSo, why are these representational images of sexual violence created to portray the survivor as having an \"ideal\" body type? Why are inaction and passivity imposed on her? Why is she shown covering her face instead of fighting back\u2014as most survivors do? And why is the perpetrator always missing from these images?\nIn a patriarchal society, all eyes are focused on the victims of gender-based violence. Whenever such a crime occurs, our society obsesses over the details of the victim: Where is she from? Why was she out at so-and-so hour? What was she doing there? What was she wearing? Was she really innocent? The list of such questions is endless. While they do not hesitate to blame the victim for the crime, they show little interest in knowing the particulars of the accused. The media, while covering incidents of sexual crimes, also reflect this patriarchal ideology of its audience. News houses often sensationalise such events so that people click on their content more. The symbolic images discussed above help serve that purpose, too: attracting viewers to click on a news piece and bring in more profits for the media house. But by portraying survivors as being helpless and weak, the media is essentially commodifying their sufferings.\nLegendary feminist scholar Laura Mulvey provided an explanation for why the media is so focused on creating the female structure on-screen. In her article \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,\" she explains how the patriarchal unconscious controls the creation and consumption of visual content. She argues that women are represented in the media to give visual pleasure to the audience. According to the documentary, \"Miss Representation,\" only 16 percent of content creators in the media are female.\u00a0 Hence, the 84 percent male creators present women according to how they see, or want to see, women on the screen.\nThe way in which the media portrays rape and rape victims is vastly harmful for women. They are recreating the same patriarchal horror in these images, and indirectly putting the blame and shame on the women while also holding them hostage to the audience's visual pleasure. At the same time, the media often fails to capture the stories of victims fighting back against sexual crimes. Given their tremendous power over the masses, their inability to confront or move past patriarchal discourses mean they are also furthering the structures of oppression that create the conditions of women's systemic subjugation.\nThe media needs to re-evaluate these symbolic images and find better alternatives. The focus should be on the perpetrator, not the victim. The shame, therefore, needs to be transferred from victim to the perpetrator\u2014that is, to the one committing the crime. The resilience of the survivors and their fight for justice need to be highlighted, instead of portraying them as being passive, inactive, or helpless. The media must be more responsible when reporting and investigating the crimes of sexual abuse, rape, and gender-based violence. Symbolic images of women fighting against gender-based violence should be used so that we can get closer towards the end of survivors being victimised twice\u2014first, when they suffer a sexual crime and second, when the media portrays their abusers as being anonymous while putting them at the forefront of the crime.\n\u00a0\nMst Nasrin Akter\u00a0is assistant professor of journalism, communication and media studies at the State University of Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "Of the 48 current vice-chancellors (VC) in the public universities across Bangladesh, 39 are former office-bearers of some pro-government teachers' bodies. Of the rest, five are known to be associated with the ruling party. A report by this daily has found that if one is a member of the Blue panel\u2014a pro-Awami League group of teachers\u2014at Dhaka University, his or her chances of being appointed VC at any public university increases exponentially. The message is very clear: if you are a part of the government party or belong to its various wings, or can outshine others as a \"big drummer\" in the government bandwagon, your future is made in the academic hierarchy of public universities.\nSo, have these VCs, appointed clearly on partisan lines, served the ruling party's interests? Have they, in any way, raised the intellectual profile of the Awami League? Have these VCs been able to prove that the Awami League is truly committed to improving the academic quality and atmosphere in public universities? Has any VC of a public university been able to improve relations with their students? If the answer is an emphatic no in each case, then shouldn't the ruling party review its policy of appointing such VCs?\nA ruling party's proclivity to reward those who help them come to power is nothing new. Practically every government does it. So why should we take issue when our government does the same? Well, the answer is simple. In choosing our VC candidates, we usually lose sight of the academic qualifications necessary and the overall image and public stature of the individuals concerned. Over the years, political loyalty has overtaken academic status. What serves as the personal reputation of academics has practically nothing to do with their accomplishments as teachers, writers, authors, but more to do with how vociferously they have been able to uphold the party line, regardless of its impact on their respective institutions or the time-honoured profession of teaching.\nWhy can't the present government appoint VCs who are from the party and have, if not impeccable, then at least highly regarded academic credentials? Why do the choices veer to the bottom, particularly when we all know that there are plenty of highly qualified teachers within the ruling party?\nOf course, the government has certain expectations from the people they appoint as VCs. But how unethically low they have stoop to preserve their chairs is the question. VCs appointed on partisan considerations are a part of a complex web of privileges and favouritism, which does not allow them much freedom to run their respective institutions on the basis of their better judgement. They are, in fact, prisoners of all sorts of forces within the campus that have nothing to do with the goals and purposes of a university.\nFirst of all, a partisan VC will have to take care of all teachers who belong to the same party\u2014starting from their appointments, promotions, placement in various positions of power and leverage, to granting study leaves, foreign scholarships, allocations of living quarters, etc. In time, factions develop within their supporters based on how much benefit each of them received. This necessitates more benefits to be dished out to keep the VC's support base intact. This pushes them further towards arbitrary actions, making them more controversial. And the cycle goes on.\nThen comes the more difficult task of keeping the ruling party's student wing in line. From the admission of party honchos who will be later used to intimidate and force non-partisan students to fall in line, to distribution of hall seats, to allowing them to pass class tests and annual examinations, to protecting them from police when involved in criminal activities, to giving them various financial deals including construction contracts\u2014the management of the student wing drags a VC more and more into the quagmire of malpractice and irregularities. Such a VC is unable to take any disciplinary action against any student who may have the ruling party tag. This drastically compromises the VC's moral standing among their students, assuming it was there in the first place.\nThe question we want to raise is: Do partisan appointments actually serve the interests of the ruling party? Take the case of the former VC of Rajshahi University, who made 138 appointments of teachers and staff on the very last day of his tenure and bent university rules to appoint his daughter and son-in-law as teachers. What sort of a person does such a thing? What level of common sense\u2014or lack thereof\u2014and what utter disregard for the law, regulations, system or practice could make a VC stoop to such malpractice? Another case is of Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah, the former VC of Begum Rokeya University. Throughout his tenure of 1,447 days, he was absent from the campus for a total of 1,207 days\u2014more than three years out of four. What weird mentality could have led him to such behaviour? If he was so loath to go to the campus, why did he take the job? Did the Awami League gain anything by such appointments?\nIn a recent comment to this daily, Professor Emeritus of Dhaka University Serajul Islam Chowdhury said, \"Only those who have sound academic background and can play the role of a guardian should be appointed as VCs\u2026 The main job of a VC should be to create an enabling environment on the campus in which all bodies, including student unions, are functional, and cultural activities and critical thinking can flourish.\"\nTime has come for the government to ask a fundamental question: Do we want our public universities to become centres of academic excellence? Do we want these institutions to produce scholars of global stature, who can make us active participants in the international intellectual scene? Do we want to keep pace with the knowledge revolution that marks the 21st century?\nOr do we want our public universities to produce nothing more than slogan-chanting BA or MA degree holders, most of whom may be able to increase the muscle power that maintains the ruling party's physical control of the campuses, but can do very little to increase our brain power that will ultimately determine whether Bangladesh becomes a knowledge producer or remain its consumer only?\nThe answer to this simple but vital question will determine the future of our public universities. The global and regional rankings of Bangladesh's public universities speak volumes of what we have done to the once famous universities of ours.\nHere, a mention needs to be made and tribute paid to the teachers and students who, in spite of all the shortcomings and partisanship, keep the flame of knowledge burning. It is because of their tireless efforts that we still have whatever little academic atmosphere that still remains in our public universities.\nThe way our public universities are currently run is not in tune with either the goals of Digital Bangladesh, nor the needs of the 4th Industrial Revolution, much less the technological transformations that most forward-looking countries are preparing for.\nThe most tragic reality is that our country's total intellectual environment is anti-creative, which is most likely strikingly exemplified by our lack of investment in research and support to our scholars. In fact, scholarship is trivialised and partisanship eulogised in considering most of the things academic. The fundamental freedoms\u2014of thought and expression\u2014that are keys to an academic environment remain elusive in ours. In fact, these freedoms marked the golden days of Dhaka and other public universities in the past.\nThis reality must change if we are to become a developing nation where a nation is judged not only by its physical infrastructure, but also by its intellectual infrastructure, of which public universities are a crucial element.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

It was then hoped that this would take us one step closer to our vision of an inclusive Bangladesh, with equal rights and privileges shared by all communities. However, five years on, it seems the project is falling through due to a lack of administrative initiatives.\nAs this daily reported on February 1, 2022, students at many schools in Sreemangal upazila, with a majority of them belonging to indigenous communities, are being taught in Bangla because they never get enough sets of books in other languages. One headteacher alleged that in 2021, they had only received teachers' copies of two textbooks to teach students of the Tripura community. In 2022, they received none.\nMore concerningly, teachers in areas with a large indigenous population are not trained nearly well enough to teach children to read and write in their respective mother languages. A report from 2020 states how, since 2017, only 38.6 percent of the 4,204 ethnic community teachers in the three hill districts had attended a 14-day training programme on indigenous languages. This begs the question: What use is having textbooks in ethnic languages if they don't reach their intended recipients? Even if or when those books are made available, how can a teacher be expected to educate students properly if they themselves have not received the training to do so? And what are the higher authorities doing about it? Not much, going by the conclusion of our report. Surely, this was a plan that was meant to be followed through for years to come, and not just a \"show of inclusivity\"?\nWe believe the government needs to re-evaluate its indigenous textbook plan to make it effective. Teachers must be given extensive training in reading, writing, and usage of these languages that they can impart upon their students. Textbooks in indigenous languages must also be distributed for all subjects, and in the quantities required, on a priority basis. The government needs to follow through with its own plan so that children of ethnic communities are not deprived of the opportunity to study in their own languages.\n",

Although the number of cancer patients is increasing every year, diagnosis and treatment remain inaccessible to a vast majority of the population\u2014particularly those from low-income groups and rural areas\u2014as a result of overwhelming treatment costs, scarcity of trained professionals, and unavailability of crucial equipment. To cite just a few depressing examples: among the 36 government medical college hospitals, only 14 have oncology departments (which are understaffed and underequipped); radiotherapy machines of Dhaka and Mymensingh medical college hospitals have been out of order for years; and there are no radiotherapy machines available to people living in Khulna, Rangpur, and Barishal divisions. The list, unfortunately, goes on and on.\nDespite such gaping holes in the provision of cancer care in the country, we are yet to adopt a national cancer control strategy, action plan and programme. Reportedly, patients in Bangladesh are being treated following the cancer protocol developed by the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for their own citizens, even though our healthcare systems are nowhere near comparable.\nAccording to a latest report by World Health Organization (WHO), there are around 1.5 million cancer patients in Bangladesh, and at least 150,000 deaths every year. About 200,000 new patients are diagnosed each year. However, there is no database to preserve detailed information on the actual number of patients in the country, the most common causes of cancer, and district-wise prevalence, without which it's impossible to prepare a cancer prevention and treatment strategy. In comparison, our neighbour India has 30 such databases which are centrally coordinated. Why, in 50 years, have we failed to simply initiate a database for cancer patients? There is no conceivable answer.\nWhile early diagnosis and screening have proven to improve a patient's chances of survival and reduce the cost significantly, the government is yet to take effective strategies to integrate early detection in its national health system. Massive awareness is needed, especially in rural areas, to ensure early detection, as well as provision of screening services at the upazila level across the country. Meanwhile, the state of palliative care here is even more deplorable, with a majority of cancer patients suffering from immense pain in silence.\nThere are only 20-22 cancer service centres for a population of over 165 million, but according to WHO, there should be one for every one million, which underscores just how far behind we are in ensuring accessible care.\nWe urge the government to develop a national protocol for cancer diagnosis, treatment and care, and initiate a population-based cancer registry without any more delay.\n",
