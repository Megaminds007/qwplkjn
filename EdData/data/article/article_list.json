While the election-focused first quarter hit public capital spending, the second quarter (Q2) was marred by weak demand and still underwhelming public capex, dragging GDP growth to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%. The Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which were projecting that India would log a fourth year of 7%-plus growth, had pared their hopes to \u2018about 6.5%\u2019 and 6.6%, respectively. This was predicated on a bump-up of about 7% in the second half of the year to offset the first half\u2019s 6% rise. The NSO, slightly less sanguine, expects GDP to grow at a four-year low pace of 6.4%, from 8.2% in 2023-24, with just agriculture seen rising significantly faster than last year. Manufacturing and mining growth may virtually halve, and though services sectors seem relatively better off, there is some concern of momentum loss. Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indices averaged lower than Q2 through Q3, for both manufacturing and services. The NSO expects private consumption to rebound 7.3% this year from just 4% last year. But Q3 trends do not indicate a significant lift-off in urban demand. So, this could be a tad optimistic despite inflation easing slightly since October.The Finance Ministry has sought to link the demand slowdown to a \u201ccombination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank\u201d. Slow wage growth has also been blamed for cramped household demand. The NSO\u2019s projection of gross fixed capital formation growth slipping to 6.4% this year from 9% in 2023-24 indicates that private capex \u2014 that is contingent on domestic and global demand \u2014 remains weak while public capex goals are unlikely to be met. Of course, these early NSO projections are largely conjured up for informing the Union Budget formulation, and some upgrades may happen later, but most economists see significant downside risks for now. Nomura economists, for instance, who have been arguing that India is in the grip of a cyclical slowdown for a while, reckon growth will end up around 6%, implying a flat-lined second half. With the global outlook also shrouded in uncertainty, winter seems to be here for India\u2019s economy. How far behind spring lags will depend on policymakers\u2019 actions, and inactions. The Union Budget 2025-26 needs to move from incremental tinkering to tailoring reforms and fiscal actions that can bring India\u2019s growth back to the 7% mark, if not 8%, at the earliest. If that entails some hard calls such as slashing income, fuel and consumption taxes, along with import tariffs, so be it. Just pining for interest rate cuts will not suffice anymore.

        "full_article": "Nearly two decades after the passage of the Right to Information Act, it is quite apparent that governments, at least sections of it, are uncomfortable with the idea of transparency and empowerment associated with it. Amendments to dilute its efficacy and attempts to defeat it by delaying or denying information have been quite common for years. Another way to scuttle the law is to cripple the functioning of information commissions at the central and State levels. The issue has surfaced again, with the Supreme Court of India questioning the large number of vacancies in the central and some State Information Commissions. These commissions hear appeals from members of the public who have been denied access to information or have failed to elicit a response from designated information officers in various departments and institutions. A Division Bench has taken note of the fact that there are eight vacancies in the posts of Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission (CIC), while 23,000 appeals are pending before it. In fact, some State-level Information Commissions are almost defunct for want of members to hear the public. Any court is bound to ask, as the Court has now done, how an institution can be of any use if it does not have persons to perform the required duties under the law.The Court has sought to impart some urgency to the matter by directing the Department of Personnel and Training to spell out in two weeks the timelines for completing the selection process and notifying the appointments of the eight Information Commissioners in the CIC. It has also asked for details about the search committee and the list of applicants for the posts. Similarly, States that have initiated the appointment process but without any definite timeline have been asked to complete the process within a specified time. However, this may not be enough to bring about a revival in the fulfilment of the original purpose of the Act. Besides filling up vacancies, not all governments have complied with a Court verdict of 2019 that called for proactive efforts to fill up vacancies in time by advertising them early. The CIC\u2019s post was stripped of its autonomy some years ago when the government removed the fixed five-year tenure and made it open-ended. Not much has been done to appoint candidates from various walks of life, as retired civil servants continue to be chosen, a point noted by the Bench in the latest hearing. It is inevitable that a large number of vacancies will result in a huge backlog and ultimately discourage the people from seeking information. It is difficult not to conclude that this is what those in power want.

        "full_article": "Death toll of illegal mines, which are also environmental hazards, keeps rising as govts look the other way\nOne miner had died and at least eight others were feared trapped in a \u2018rat-hole\u2019 coal mine \u2013 a narrow, deep and illegal mine with no safety measures \u2013 in Assam until Wednesday evening. When the rescue operation is over, the bodies won\u2019t figure in official statistics because India\u2019s Directorate General of Mines Safety only counts accidents in the formal sector. It claims coal mines have become safer over the years. Fatal accidents in coal mines declined from 143 in 1997 to 24 in 2022, it says. That\u2019s good, but what about the thousands of men, women and children \u2013 smaller bodies are an asset in these claustrophobic pits \u2013 risking life and limb every day? Rat-hole mines become big news every few years, but casualties are far more frequent. It\u2019s only when the toll mounts that news seeps out to the national level. Fifteen rat-hole miners died in an accident in July 2012, 15 again in Dec 2018, five in May 2021, six in Jan 2024, and these were just the too-big-to-ignore cases. Nobody really knows what goes on in Meghalaya\u2019s 26,000-odd rat-hole mines that never shut down despite an NGT order in 2014, or the hundreds more in Assam.\nThere\u2019s illegal sand mining too that\u2019s destroying rivers across the country. One study claimed 95 people drowned in sand pits dug in riverbeds by the mining mafia between Jan 2019 and Nov 2020. In 2018, a CAG report flagged the illegal extraction of almost 100L tonnes of minerals \u2013 copper, lead and zinc among them \u2013 over five years in just five Rajasthan districts. This is problematic on several counts. First, the obvious revenue loss to the state. Second, illegal mines never adhere to environmental regulations. Third and most important, they don\u2019t care about the lives of miners, as we are seeing now in Assam.\n\n",

LOL. Trump demanded it. Zuck agreed. Trump\u2019s response all but confirmed it. Is there any debate on how harmful online disinformation can be? Aside from giving a free rein to truly dangerous loonies, it can directly impact public welfare. Recall the flood of misinformation around Covid. Recall posts that have stoked rioting in various countries. Fact-checkers spot speculation or rumour \u2013 regardless of whether the disinformation is floated out of ignorance or intended with malice. Dodgy online posts can be deployed to disrupt institutional structures or influence voter/citizen/consumer behaviours \u2013 whatever its intent, it needs to be stopped at the gate. Therefore, fact-checks have nothing to do with \u2018freedom of speech\u2019, but with facts alone. There are irrefutable facts that even the current trend, pronounced in parts of the world, of rewriting history can barely \u2018unwrite\u2019. For example, facts backed by scientific evidence, which is irrefutable. But Zuck knows all of this. He played for one side when Trump lost, and is playing for the other side now.\nX preceded Facebook in removing fact-checks. So, Big Tech\u2019s accountability is all but zero now. Despite global subscribers the size of a big nation, social media companies have long dodged responsibility for what\u2019s on offer on their platforms. It is tireless citizen-advocacy that ensured \u2018fact-checks\u2019 are institutionalised \u2013 Facebook at one time worked with almost 80 organisations globally on its platform, WhatsApp and Instagram. Now, it will likely all unravel. But just because Trump/Musk wants it so can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t make all other govts helpless. In Europe and Asia, govts must double down on efforts to make social media accountable, hopefully without restricting genuine freedom of speech.\nIt\u2019s also necessary to restate the fundamental difference between mainstream news media, especially established newspapers such as TOI, and social media. Fact-checks had to be introduced to online platforms. But fact-checks are journalism\u2019s foundational principle. Newspapers, whether print or digital, have multiple gate-keepers not because govts ask them to do so. But because that\u2019s how journalism works. Big Tech platforms fight against being called \u2018publishers\u2019 to shy away from accountability as well as to profit from news-gathering a news company invests in. Citizens everywhere should know that much of what they are reading on their social media feed can be plain wrong \u2013 and some of it dangerously so.\n\n",

Its celebration will create a force field of spiritual energy that can alter the mental environment of participants and those who fall into the range of its energy field.\nCelestial bodies are believed to have a bearing on human affairs and terrestrial events. In the Sanatan tradition, an auspicious time for every important venture is determined by relating planetary movements to life on Earth. The foremost planet that fixes the time of Kumbh is Brihaspati, Jupiter, which is associated with learning and wisdom. Since Brihaspati moves through one zodiac sign in one year, it returns to the same sign after 12 years.\nKumbh Melas are held on the banks of sacred rivers, Ganga in Haridwar, Shipra in Ujjain, Godavari in Nashik, Maharashtra, and Triveni Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and invisible Saraswati in Prayagraj. These are places where, according to Puranic lore, the divine ambrosia spilt from the celestial Kumbh pitcher, discovered during the churning of the ocean, during a fight between gods and demons for its possession.\nMahakumbh 2025 is being held at Prayagraj after a cycle of 12 kumbhs, 144 years. It has heightened significance in view of its range, scale, and govt facilities that surpass normal kumbhs held once every three years, Ardh Kumbhs held every six years, and Purn Kumbhs held every 12 years at auspicious locations.\n\nMetaphorically, Kumbh typifies the human body that contains the nectar of wisdom. \u2018All the deities are enshrined in him, as cows in a cow shed,\u2019 says Atharvaveda, XI.8.32. So, it must be purified since it is the means to fulfil one\u2019s dharma, assigned duties, in life.\nHindus do not regard rivers as just sheets of water but as embodying the primeval element of nature that purifies and vitalises everything. Water is regarded as a cleanser for the body and the mind and is a witness to man\u2019s activities.\nRigveda, X.98 invokes the blessings of water thus:\n\u2018Whatever sin is found in me\nWhatever wrong I may have done\nIf I have lied or falsely sworn\nWaters, remove it far from me.\u2019\nA holy dip undertaken with faith during an auspicious planetary occurrence, along with mantra-jap, chanting of a holy syllable or prayer, is said to brush off negative energy, exonerate sins, fulfil wishes, and render salvation.\nShuchita, purity, of the mind, intellect and soul, is essential for spiritual growth. While the body is cleansed by water, the mind and intellect by true knowledge and positive thoughts, the soul is uplifted by satsang, true company, bhajan-kirtan,chanting of the Divine Name, seva,selfless service, dhyan, meditation, and darshan, a glimpse of holy men. Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj provides an ideal ambience for antahkarana shuddhi, purification of conscience.\nMahakumbh exemplifies the Vedic ideal of unity in diversity by bringing together proponents of different Sanatan traditions, who showcase their uniqueness, prowess and authenticity through presentations, discourses and debates. It is Parliament of Sanatan Dharma that offers multiple perspectives on religion, culture, and spirituality.\n\n",

This simultaneously reflects Bangladesh authorities' lack of initiative in pursuing justice as well as the Indian authorities' refusal to ensure accountability, both of which have contributed to a culture of impunity enabling such border killings to persist.\nOn January 7, 2011, 15-year-old Felani was shot dead by a member of the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) while attempting to cross the barbed-wire fence near Kurigram and West Bengal's Koch Bihar. As she climbed down a makeshift ladder, her dress became entangled in the fence. While stuck, she was spotted by BSF personnel, and constable Amiya Ghosh shot her. According to Kirity Roy, secretary of a West Bengal-based rights organisation, the BSF could have apprehended Felani without using lethal force and presented her in court for breaking the law. Instead, she was shot and left hanging on the fence for hours, bleeding to death. Even after shooting her, the BSF could have rescued her and provided medical attention, but they chose not to.\n\nThe death toll at the India-Bangladesh border starkly contrasts with the far fewer fatalities along the India-Pakistan border, despite the latter's hostile relationship. When a so-called \"friendly\" neighbour causes such loss of life, how can this relationship be viewed as genuine friendship?\nDespite this inhumane act, a BSF court acquitted Amiya Ghosh of any wrongdoing, with a subsequent BSF court also upholding the verdict. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of India, set to hear final arguments in this case on January 8, postponed the hearing for unspecified reasons. Will Felani's family ever get justice? After 14 years, Indian authorities seem to have little interest in this regard. This impunity\u2014and the evident disregard for Bangladeshi lives\u2014has allowed such killings to continue unabated. The most recent casualty is Zahur Ali who, earlier this week, was allegedly beaten to death by BSF members and Indian citizens along the border.\nAccording to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), 31 Bangladeshis were killed by BSF in 2023, 23 in 2022, and 18 in 2021. Thus, at least 522 deaths of Bangladeshis were recorded between 2009 and 2020. One cannot help but ask: why is the number of casualties so high despite India's repeated promises to reduce them to zero? How should Bangladesh respond to such killings and to India's claim of being a \"close friend\"? The death toll at the India-Bangladesh border starkly contrasts with the far fewer fatalities along the India-Pakistan border, despite the latter's hostile relationship. When a so-called \"friendly\" neighbour causes such loss of life, how can this relationship be viewed as genuine friendship?\nThe interim government must prioritise justice for all Bangladeshi victims of BSF violence, starting with Felani Khatun. It must also demand an immediate end to these killings. If Indian authorities remain uncooperative, Bangladesh should consider taking the issue to international courts and actively raising it on global platforms, as the Jatiya Nagorik Committee recently suggested. It is time for Bangladesh to adopt a firm stance against the BSF's callous treatment of our citizens and India's persistent failure to address this grave issue. Impunity must end, and justice must prevail.\n",

        "full_article": "At the break of dawn, when crows start cawing and people are out for a new working day, we usually see some unprivileged people sleeping on foot overbridges or footpaths. Every night, they dream of having a roof over their heads and wake up in a reality instead, where they struggle to manage the bare minimum essentials for themselves and their family. Luxurious items are far from their thoughts as their days are spent with the challenge of meeting the basic needs of every day.\nIt is often said that a person is as great as their dreams. Since dreams and desires are often related to income, they grow as people's income increases. So desires changes with a person's social classes. For instance, the aspirations of the middle class aren't limited to just having a roof over their heads or leading a simple life. They yearn for well-furnished homes, healthy and balanced diets, a touch of luxury and the comfort of a better standard of living. On the other hand, the dreams of the upper class are more ambitious. They constantly seek to elevate their lifestyles to unprecedented heights.\nWhile the saying goes \"money makes the world go round,\" it's more accurate to say that desire is the engine that fuels the economic machine. Our wants and needs create demand for goods and services, and unchecked desire can also be a root cause of inflation. The upper-class people tend to have a desire for luxury goods and the market of such goods thrives on their desire for exclusivity and status. Their spending habits create a ripple effect. Their lifestyles and use of exclusive items fuel a desire for similar consumption among their peers. The affluent people's ability and willingness to spend significantly impact the market demand. Factories scramble to keep up as demand explodes beyond their capacity. This demand-pull inflation is a classic desire in action. With everyone chasing a limited supply, sellers can raise prices as buyers are willing to pay more to satisfy their needs.\nThe extravagant purchases of the affluent\u2014luxury cars, designer clothing, exclusive vacations\u2014create an influence on others to emulate their lifestyle, and consequently, push up prices in these sectors, impacting everyone, not just the elite. Eventually, this creates a significant burden for ordinary citizens, particularly those struggling to meet their basic needs. The middle class, who may have previously been able to afford a comfortable standard of living, might find themselves squeezed as necessities become costlier. It not only widens the gap between the rich and the poor but also makes it harder for everyone to maintain a decent quality of life. A striking example of this phenomenon can be seen in Bangladesh's wedding culture, which has become a symbol of social status. Affluent families compete to host grand ceremonies featuring lavish decorations, designer outfits, and multi-day events at upscale venues. The \"desire trap\" here stems from societal pressure and social media influence, pushing middle-class families to take loans or exhaust savings to meet these rising standards.\nOur desires can also indirectly cause inflation by impacting the cost of production. Let's consider the rising global coffee obsession. This drives up the demand for coffee beans, pushing their price higher. To maintain profit margins, coffee roasters might have to raise their prices. This cost-push inflation highlights how our wants can ripple through the production chain, ultimately affecting what we pay at the store.\nHowever, it is important to remember desire is a powerful force in economics, shaping both inflation and innovation. Our insatiable curiosity and desire for improvement have driven innovation throughout history. The craving for faster communication led us to the Internet, and the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle fuelled the fitness craze.\nStriking a balance between ambition and the risks of unchecked greed is crucial. Without mindful management of desires and consumption habits, even the most well-crafted monetary policies or global strategies to reduce class gaps will remain ineffective. Central banks must act prudently, and society must rethink values around wealth and status to ensure stability, fostering policies that balance sustainable growth with humanity's drive for improvement.\nSamira Tasnim is research associate at the Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM).

        "full_article": "The war between Russia and Ukraine has become a major geopolitical crisis of the 21st century. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, numerous countries, including the US, UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan, have imposed over 19,535 sanctions against Russia. Their primary focus has been on Russia's financial resources. Approximately half of its total reserves\u2014amounting to $350 billion\u2014were frozen, impacting its foreign currency reserves. According to the EU, approximately 70 percent of the assets of Russian banks were frozen by a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has undoubtedly influenced the relationship between Moscow and its allies. Following the imposition of sanctions on Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant swing towards China, signing a series of agreements. The impact of this war was not only on Western and Russian relations but also on Russia's close allies. In this regard, Central Asian countries are now forced to strike a difficult balance between their long-standing relations with Russia and other large powers. While the region has historically relied on Russia for economic and security relationships, the protracted conflict has produced new challenges and possibilities, prompting these countries to pursue a more assertive but cautious foreign policy. At the same time, this upheaval and Russia's dependence on China create a golden opportunity for China to strengthen its ties with Central Asia.\nThough, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five Central Asian countries have gained more political and economic independence. Historically, the Central Asian Republics (CARs)\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014have always viewed Russia as a guarantor of security for internal stability and protection against foreign threats. Since their independence from the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have faced a difficult transition from a common Soviet history to divergent nation-building and economic liberalisation pathways. The five Central Asian states are part of one or more Russian-led organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union. These institutions provide forums for regional security and economic partnership with Russia, allowing Russia to maintain a substantial influence in Central Asia's geopolitical landscape. For example, in 2021, when the Taliban reclaimed control in Afghanistan, Russia stationed military equipment on the Tajik-Afghan border as part of the CSTO and conducted joint military drills with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan within 20 kilometres from the Afghan border. This exhibition aims to demonstrate Russia's military readiness in its own backyard in the event of an attack on Central Asia by the Taliban or other terrorist outfits. Similarly, in January 2022, Moscow dispatched soldiers from the CSTO to quash unrest in Kazakhstan.\nEconomically, Central Asia also depended on Russia. Moscow's energy and trade participation in the region was intended to lock the governments into a vital dependency, giving the Kremlin control over their internal and foreign policy decisions. For example, Kazakhstan exports 80 percent of its oil through the Caspian oil pipeline, which passes through Russian territory. The number of economic migrants who go to Russia for work is relatively high compared to other migrant workers worldwide. For example, approximately nine million Central Asians live and work in Russia, and practically every major city relies on their labour. According to a June 2022 report by the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM), remittances from Russia to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan accounted for 31 percent and 27 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2020. The majority of this money is expected to come from their employees in Russia. In 2021, remittances from Russia accounted for 55 percent of total transfers to Uzbekistan and 51 percent to Kazakhstan.\nHowever, the CARs' internal unrest, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and growing concerns about sovereignty have forced Central Asian nations to look for new allies for long-term security cooperation and are diversifying their foreign policy in an effort to reduce Moscow's influence. Furthermore, Western sanctions on Russia led the CARs to seek alternate channels to sell commodities to the world market. Therefore, CARs have responded to the altering geopolitical landscape in a variety of ways, including preserving economic links with Russia, avoiding outright criticism of Moscow, and increasing partnerships with other global powers such as China, the West, and Turkey.\nSince the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine war, Central Asian leaders have also been at the forefront of the so-called \"multi-vector\" foreign policy approach, aiming for balanced relations with Russia as well as other countries such as China, the West, and Turkey. The states of the region refused to accept Russia's recently seized areas in Ukraine, and some issued public declarations in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity in the early days of the 2022 war.\nNonetheless, these powers did not openly condemn Vladimir Putin and his \"special military operation.\" Various factors are at play here, including economic reliance, Central Asian immigration, and membership in Russia-led institutions.\nMoreover, according to polls, the majority of Central Asians\u201470 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 55 percent in Kazakhstan, and 30 percent in Uzbekistan\u2014ascribe the regions current economic difficulties to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The popularity of the Russian language is declining, entertainment venues are refusing to host Russian performers, and there have been multiple anti-war protests in Almaty and Bishkek. Russia has blocked Central Asian media sites for attempting to provide unbiased coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. The public conversation has returned to the topic of decolonisation.\nOn the other hand, Central Asia is a strategically important region for China due to its abundant resources, transit links, and shared border, which are vital for China's security. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) underscores its interest in the region, leveraging growing unease and Russia's focus on Ukraine. Central Asian nations increasingly rely on China for both security and economic resources, potentially challenging Russian dominance and jeopardising Moscow's security interests. Despite a recent decline in historical hostility between the two sides, Russia believes that China's increasing economy might soon enable it to contest Moscow's geopolitical sway in Central Asia.\nNotably, China is assisting the CARs in strengthening their security and law enforcement capabilities by capitalising on their worries about Russia. During his visit to Central Asia in September 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that he supported Kazakhstan's territorial integrity in light of these exceptional circumstances. When Xi called the China-Central Asia Summit to order in Xi'an in May 2023, he emphasised the significance of the security, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the CARs. In the midst of the intensifying powerplay among the world's strongest nations, Beijing is taking big measures to expand its regional influence in order to counter the US's encirclement of China.\nChina is still dedicated to its long-standing regional objectives. With over half of China's trade and investment going to Kazakhstan, Beijing sees the country as its main economic partner in Central Asia. China's economic interests are further supported by the transportation opportunities that have emerged since Russia's invasion.\nBeijing is becoming increasingly interested in playing the role of a security supplier in the region due to its rising concerns about the unrest in Afghanistan and Central Asia. This development may cause future difficulties with Moscow. China-Central Asia's security cooperation has already been strengthened by BRI efforts. More robust security allies like China could undermine Russia's position as the principal security guarantor. China's growing influence in Central Asia after the invasion presents a challenge to Moscow's dominance, potentially altering the dynamics of security cooperation and posing future complications for Moscow.\nMd Tariqul Islam Tanvir\u00a0is Erasmus scholar in the International Master in Central & East European, Russian & Eurasian Studies programme at the University of Glasgow.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.
