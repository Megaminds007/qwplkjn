With the BJP having suffered reverses in the general election in the face of a concerted Opposition campaign that spotlighted issues agitating young voters such as a palpable lack of jobs, the Minister was keen to redress matters ahead of the slew of State elections later this year. Asserting that the poor, women, youth and farmers were the four \u2018castes\u2019 that this government was focused on serving, Ms. Sitharaman stressed that this year\u2019s Budget laid particular emphasis on \u201cemployment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class\u201d. As a part of this effort, a package of five schemes and initiatives have been proposed with a view to facilitating employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over a five-year period with a central outlay of \u20b92 lakh crore. The centrepiece is a scheme to provide a month\u2019s wage as subsidy to all persons newly entering the workforce in a formal sector job, which would entail the employer registering the employee at the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). The direct benefit transfer of one-month salary, subject to a cap of \u20b915,000, would be made in three instalments to first-time employees. The key caveat is that the employer would have to refund the subsidy if the first-timer\u2019s employment ended within 12 months of hiring. Other schemes are an incentive support for job creation in the manufacturing sector, one offering direct support to employers who boost the number of jobs registered with the EPFO, and another, a skilling programme in concert with States, and the private sector that leverages the existing network of ITIs to boost the employability of the youth. The fifth in this quiver of schemes, predictably credited as being under the aegis of the Prime Minister, is an interesting move to facilitate internship opportunities to the youth in 500 top companies. The scheme, which appears to mirror a similar proposal contained in the Congress manifesto, entails the interns being paid a monthly allowance of \u20b95,000 and a one-time assistance of \u20b96,000, with the participating corporates expected to bear the training cost for the 12-month period as well as 10% of the internship allowance from CSR funds. Targeted at unemployed persons aged between 21 and 24 who are not engaged in full-time education at the time of applying, the Minister said this scheme would, over a five-year period, potentially provide one crore youth with a chance to gain exposure to a real-life business environment and varied professions. All these schemes will, however, need to be weighed against the backdrop of the fact that India needs to, on average, generate 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030, as the Chief Economic Adviser highlighted in his Economic Survey, largely to absorb the workforce exiting agriculture.In yet another acknowledgment of the primacy of the political economy in policy making, Ms. Sitharaman has sought to quell the strident Opposition charge of being too cosy with large corporates by making a concerted bid to address some of the challenges faced by the lynchpin MSME sector. Beginning with a credit guarantee scheme to help MSMEs in the manufacturing sector obtain loans to finance their purchases of machinery and equipment without collateral or a third-party guarantee, the Budget\u2019s proposals for the key employment-providing sector have been tailored to ease their access not only to debt financing and working capital, but also to business opportunities as potential suppliers to a wider pool of central public sector enterprises and large corporates. MSMEs, however, may wait to see the outcome of yet another Budget assurance by the Minister \u2014 that the government will work to further simplify the GST regime and rationalise the tax structure \u2014 before cheering, given the difficulties they encounter with the indirect tax system. For the middle-class, Ms. Sitharaman\u2019s menu of offerings is focused almost entirely on tax relief for the salaried. In a bid to entice more taxpayers to wholeheartedly embrace the new Income-Tax regime, the standard deduction has been raised and the tax slabs with their relevant tax rates revised so as to leave a little more money in the hands of the salaried, post taxes. Pensioners are also set to benefit by a marginal increase of \u20b910,000 in the deduction allowed on family pensions.Ms. Sitharaman\u2019s Budget for 2024-25 yet again sticks to the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation path, with the Fiscal Deficit proposed to be pared to 4.9% of GDP. To achieve this fiscal goal, the Minister has quietly set about paring spending on several social sectors including school and higher education that saw cuts in their shares of Budget outlays. The most egregious reduction though must be the cut in share of spending on the rural job guarantee scheme \u2014 MGNREGA \u2014 with the Budget Estimate pegging the spending on the scheme at a nine-year low share of 1.78% of overall outlay, down from 1.92% in the Revised Estimates for 2023-24. Subsidies too across the board, from fertilizers to food and petroleum have been pared. And glaring in its absence in Ms. Sitharaman\u2019s speech was any mention whatsoever of what was once the country\u2019s single-largest employer, the Indian Railways. Political compulsions, as expected, resulted in significant allocations for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, the States with the BJP\u2019s crucial allies in power. All told, Ms. Sitharaman seems to have balanced the political and fiscal compulsions to some extent.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\nNational Democratic Alliance\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\ndemography\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nsubsidy\n\n/\n\ntechnology (general)\n\n/\n\nemployee\n\n/\n\nemployee benefits\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\ntaxes and duties\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\nschool\n\n/\n\nhigher education\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nfertiliser\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\noil and gas - upstream activities\n\n/\n\nindian railways\n\n/\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n/\n\nmanufacturing and engineering\n\n/\n\nloans",

        "full_article": "With less than four months to go before the 2024 U.S. election and less than one month ahead of the Democratic Party\u2019s Convention, incumbent and expected nominee of his party, President Joe Biden (81), has quit the race and in doing so has endorsed his running mate, Vice-President Kamala Harris, for the presidential ticket. Mr. Biden\u2019s exit comes after months of Democrats calling for him to step down after public gaffes and fumbles, thought to be linked to his age. His withdrawal caught many, including some within the Democratic Party, off-guard, given that his campaign chair, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, had said, \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d This resolute stance is said to have baffled senior party lawmakers, who, especially after Mr. Biden\u2019s disastrous performance when he went toe-to-toe with Republican rival and former President Donald Trump, are said to have privately conveyed to the President that he ought to make way for a stronger candidate if the Democrats were to have a reasonable chance in the polls.While the final tally of delegates at the Democratic Convention will determine which candidate ultimately wins the party\u2019s nomination for the election, the odds look increasingly strong for Ms. Harris to make history as the U.S.\u2019s first ever Indian-origin and person(woman)-of-colour nominee for President, and the second woman, following Hillary Clinton\u2019s run against Mr. Trump in 2016. In terms of the factors favouring Ms. Harris, she is anyway next in line under the U.S. Constitution in terms of official succession; and she would likely gain access to close to $100 million in campaign funds. On the flip side, she is a relatively less known figure nationally, and Republicans have been quick to label her the custodian of left-wing political values, such as her espousal of reproductive freedom in the face of the Supreme Court ruling against the constitutional right to abortion. Further, surveys suggest that public opinion places her approval at roughly the same level as Mr. Biden\u2019s and that would put her a few rungs below Mr. Trump. Nevertheless, the expected response from the Democratic quarter \u2014 if they wish to avoid the risky scenario of factional infighting at the Convention \u2014 would be for them to unite around Ms. Harris and her running mate \u2014 frontrunners include Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Even in this best-case scenario for Democrats, the Republicans under Mr. Trump appear to be on a far firmer footing to win over independent voters in swing States, the key to overall victory in any U.S. presidential election.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nUS PRESIDENTIAL POLLS\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nabortion\n\n/\n\nvoting",

        "full_article": "When politics changes, so does budget-making. But can employer incentives create enough jobs?\nThe budget is the first clear proof that BJP has understood the election message. Not only are its numbers down in LS, there are assembly elections coming up in three states, where, too, the party has vulnerabilities. So, while investment in infra and welfare benefits were the cornerstone of its economic policy in its first two terms, this budget has seen a new turn. This time, FM\u2019s focus has been on employment and skilling and MSMEs, which are usually labour-intensive. The great discontent is on the jobs and livelihood front, and even if political speeches deny this reality, the budget accepts it front and centre.\nWill jobs happen? | The big question is whether incentives for employers to take on more people and a govt-supported internship programme in big companies are enough to make a dent on unemployment. Congress, too, had a manifesto promise on internships. Doubts expressed for that idea apply to the budget\u2019s proposal as well. Even if 1cr young Indians get paid internships over 5 years in 500 top companies, and even if such internships help these young people get job experience, will they (a) become more employable and (b) even if they do, will there be jobs for them? The real challenge is that private investment in labour-intensive sectors is not picking up. And private investment in industries like autos and machine goods is being guided by increasing levels of automation. So, while the budget identifies the problem, it has probably not identified the best solution.\nSingle no more | Running a single party govt means you can pretty much do what you want in budgets. But running a govt with help from moody allies, as BJP has to do now, means your friends will have to get benefits. JDU and TDP both made plenty of noises pre-budget. It\u2019s a credit to BJP that it still resisted the special status demand made by both allies. But it had to apportion a goodish portion of the budget\u2019s infra spend on Bihar and Andhra. This is a better way to help allies, as it allocates resources to specific deliverables, via projects. However, this robs Nitish and Naidu of the room to spend extra cash as they wish. Both seem happy for now. If both stay happy, this bit of the budget will be a win-win for BJP.\nGot money? Pay more | The budget\u2019s political economy becomes clearer when one considers that low-income salaried people get some tax relief but the wealthy, investing classes see a jump in their tax burden. Capital gains taxes are up. Stock markets weren\u2019t thrilled about it. But GOI has clearly decided now\u2019s the time to pay attention to people who, GOI had thought, were happy only with a raft of welfare measures.\n\n",

Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s victory in Wimbledon and the unexpected success of the Spanish squad at the Euros were something more than a breath of fresh air.

        "full_article": "By Vijay Vancheswar\n\u00a0The core teaching of Ramana Maharshi focuses on dissolving one\u2019s sense of individual volition or doership, kartitvain Sanskrit. The sage mentions that the biggest mental tapas is to subsume one\u2019s sense of control and doership. This can be sought either through the path of bhakti, an unconditional acceptance of the will of a higher power, or through the path of jnan, a persistent inquiry into the source of one\u2019s thoughts to identify who we are \u2013 the query \u2018Who am I?\u2019 According to the sage, all other spiritual paths lead and end only in this quest. The saying \u2018Not a leaf moves except by His will\u2019 expresses this and finds resonance in all faiths. \u2018Thy Will Be Done\u2019 in Christianity and the Urdu phrase \u2018Manzur-e-Khuda\u2019in Islam imply that acceptance of the will of the Divine is an essential prerequisite for one\u2019s peace and spiritual progress.\nWhat we all unconsciously seek in life is peace. Conflict arises from not meeting our expected outcomes. The singular cause of this distress is our sense of control and volition. The Bhagwad Gita provides a solution: we have the right to actions but not the results. Outcomes are never in our control. Sometimes, great efforts do not produce expected outcomes; at other times, surprisingly pleasing outcomes are attained unexpectedly. However, our persistent and innate nature triggers us to ascribe all our successes primarily to our efforts. In his book The Tyranny of Merit, Michael Sandel points out that for all our striving, we are not self-made and self-sufficient.\nA lively sense of the contingency of our lot can inspire a certain humility, enabling us to accept that, \u2018There, but for the grace of God, or the accident of birth, or the mystery of fate, go I\u2019. The wisdom of this understanding humbles us and changes our attitude to life for the better.\nFar from advocating inaction, an absence of doership promotes non-action, a positive trait that focuses on being in the moment. Ramana Maharshi explains this by distinguishing freedom from free will and ego from egoism. Freedom, as Ramana says, is our birthright. We are ever free, more so as we persevere to associate with our true nature or Self. Our sense of illusory free will provokes disharmony, more so when outcomes and expectations are not met. Ramana also distinguishes ego and egoism. A sage\u2019s ego resembles that of a burnt rope, appearing to be independent but incapable of assigning volition to itself, exuding peace and divinity. He likens this to the state of \u2018wakeful sleep\u2019, meaning awake to what happens but without a sense of involvement. Children until around three years old are in this blissful state, with the difference that they are unaware of their innate divinity. Translating this from an intellectual understanding to living by it daily demands reflection and validation of events we experience. As we reflect on the everyday events and actions that we experience and ascribe ownership to, we realise that in almost all cases, our actions involve a thought, a call or an accidental meeting, over none of which we exercise control. Acknowledging this will, over time, help us reduce our entanglement with the sense of doership.\n\n",

        "full_article": "There is no shame in admitting that in the last few days many of us have cried helplessly, over the senseless deaths of students\u2014teenagers or in their early twenties\u2014the same age or close to the ages of our children. The first time we saw the video of Abu Sayed, one of the coordinators of the movement in Rangpur, being shot to death as he spread out his hands in surrender, our hearts broke at the ruthlessness of a law enforcer, repeatedly shooting at a young man who was practically unarmed. But our hearts filled with awe at the bravery of this young man who was so steadfast in a cause that demanded equal opportunity for young people to compete for government jobs.\nAmidst the anguish and despair, this is what stands out the most\u2014the spirit and courage of our young people. Our young students have proved to us once again that they are a conscious generation\u2014contrary to common perception of them. They are well aware of the reality they are surrounded by and do not live in a bubble. We got a glimpse of this clarity of purpose during the 2018 Road Safety Movement by school students after a few of their fellow students were crushed by a raging bus at a bus stop. Their outrage took a positive form as they organised themselves into monitoring groups and started checking vehicles for their fitness, licenses etc. They were doing the job the traffic police were supposed to be doing and trying to implement basic road safety rules that should have been enforced by the government a long time ago. They showed us what their state had failed to do, which was to keep people safe from the road crashes we have become notorious for. On the streets, we saw uniformed school kids stopping vehicles\u2014even VIP cars going the wrong direction were turned back\u2014and checking documents. What we saw in those young faces was hope, belief in a better future, a saner world where people do not have to worry whether they will come home alive, every time they step into the streets. Their selflessness, determination and immense courage, gave us an optimism we had forgotten how to feel anymore. Sadly, their movement was nipped in the bud with violence and intimidation, though it didn't erase the fact that they had made history during those days and shown the country their worth as leaders.\nThe anti-discrimination protests for quota reform started the same year and was considered successful as it led to the government to abolish the quota system altogether. This move, however, done in haste and possibly in a huff, proved to be controversial when the High Court ruled in July 2024, that it was unconstitutional and had to be scrapped leading to the second anti-quota protests. As we know, the anti-discrimination movement was never one to abolish all quotas but to come up with a logical, fair percentage for the various marginalised groups.\nThe young leaders of the current movement\u2014Students' Movement against Discrimination\u2014from what we saw through clips of videos aired by the media (before the internet blackout), seemed to have a much more determined and organised plan. Their agenda was the same as before\u2014to have a reasonable quota system that would give more opportunity for regular, non-quota BCS candidates a chance to compete for government positions. They were challenging the system that gave 30 percent quota to freedom fighters, their children and grandchildren, a quota which, even many freedom fighters feel, is outdated and unnecessary after 53 years of independence.\nThe peaceful demonstrations started to spread all over the country, and were joined not only by students of public universities but private universities, colleges and even schools\u2014young people who joined in out of solidarity for their brothers and sisters. This fraternity of students was something so beautiful to witness that we, the grownups, could not help but feel proud despite the inconvenience of prolonged traffic jams and restrictions on movement. The cause they were demonstrating for in the heat and rain, for hours on end, was justified and there seemed no reason for the government not to endorse it with open arms.\nBut what happened in the following days is a painful reminder of the disconnect between our leaders and their young population. The government decided to \"nip it in the bud\" yet again but this time their strategy backfired badly. The students refused to back down, even after they were beaten mercilessly by ruling party goons, even when the pellets from police shotguns pierced their young bodies and blinded their eyes, even when live bullets went through their hearts. The more force and brutality were inflicted on them, the more their numbers swelled in the demonstrations, the more resolute they became. It is this fearlessness that has shown us what these young people are made of.\nWhile the movement was derailed by the government's disproportionate use of force that took the lives of at least 146 people, many of them students and innocent bystanders, which gave the scope for political and extremist elements to carry out vandalism and arson attacks, the steadfastness of the\u00a0 student protesters of the current quota reform movement remained. While we can never reconcile ourselves with this unprecedented level of violence and deaths, we will never forget those bright young faces, their fiery speeches and articulate understanding of the realities they live in. Those heroes who literally took the bullet to bring about change will be remembered as crucial figures of a tipping point in history.\n",

        "full_article": "It is a special kind of horror to see the semi-abstract theories you studied for your semi-abstract major come to life, and begin to apply to events 20 minutes away from you. I came across the term necropolitics as a student in the last year of my bachelor's. A play on biopolitics, this specific rendition spoke to a new form of sovereignty, one where the state pushes to death certain lives deemed unworthy of keeping alive. It's the word that has been ringing in my mind since the start of the whole affair that cracked open the consciousness of the whole nation. It has been the only word that I can use to make sense of the violence that has ruptured across the lives of the young protesting for a fair chance at a decent future.\nIt is a fact well known that wordless horror brings with it a gnawing kind of pain that doesn't subside. But what of the pain that has a name but we are forbidden from saying it? What of the people who have questions, and even corresponding answers, but are not allowed to voice them? At the apex of the conflict, before the internet shutdown, things that must not be said were being stated on countless social media accounts. My Facebook app showing the same 20 posts that had loaded before the blackout all consisted of people fearlessly sharing information to assist the students, or revealing in fear and desperation the violence unleashed upon them.\u00a0\nIn a near surreal turn of events, the BGB and were deployed along with the police to reign in a largely defenseless body of students demanding what is wholly allowed by our constitution. In the empty roads outside my house, bombs and guns were heard because of the fighting on the main road. For the past few days, a helicopter has been flying over our house and flocks of birds have intermittently flown off at the sudden sporadic loud sounds emanating from a place out of our view. The quiet and the unquiet moments have caused an equal amount of trepidation, all exacerbated by the sudden cutoff of information.\nA dome has been placed upon us, and we have been feeling its presence since the day it descended. The atmosphere outside Bangladesh and the atmosphere inside it have been separated cleanly as if by surgical cut, severing us not just from the rest of the world, but even each other.\nI try to imagine and then try to forget how frightened the kids must have been as they ran from the pellets fired from trained and armed personnel, how they rushed themselves and their friends to hospitals to tend to wounds they should have never gotten in the first place. All this systemic violence for a demand they had every right to make.\nWhen the classes will begin, I will be forced to ensure normalcy, even when I know that of the over 100 students I am teaching, at least one may have lost a friend, or seen a kind of brutalisation that I personally can only justify if it were carried out in self-defence. We know from one of the most enduring images of the resurgent movement that not all the shootings were carried out for that reason.\nIn the days since the shutdown, I have felt the full slowness of each day. Throughout, it feels as if the time is not passing. Perhaps, however, it shouldn't pass, and the knot we feel in our chests should remain until a semblance of justice is achieved. Perhaps it is only right that I find myself sweating at the thought that a student may have died in the educational institution I have begun to teach in, because when I asked myself how to comfort the students, I came to the thought that perhaps comfort should be kept at bay for the time being. I have felt time and again since July 15 that we not only be allowed to keep grieving, but that we need to keep grieving. Perhaps the refusal to return to the previous state of normalcy will be the beginning of a quieter resistance, one tempered by the bone chilling fear of weapons on the land and sky far surpassing the collective will of people who want and believe in similar things, but still present even if in a dimmed capacity. Maybe we will find answers in the everyday acts of assistance toward a community that has been, and in many ways will continue to be segregated, not just by class, but by prejudice and unbacked assumptions.\nIn the long drawn out days since the lines of communication were shattered, I have thought of what the long term impact will be of such a violent reaction to a justified demand, from a segment of the population who know their rights precisely because they are intelligent and educated. What will be the effect of this crackdown on civil society? Will we slowly fold in and become smaller to accommodate powers we feel we should never question? What will happen to the many qualified people unable to find suitable employment that allows them to assist their families? Where will their frustrations go if they feel that their demands will be shut down with violence over and over again? What will it say about us if we stay silent? For the time being, the least we can do is make sure we remember, both the demands made, and the lives lost, because there is no discussion, acquiescence or reform that will bring them back.\n",

        "full_article": "The verdict is in. The Appellate Division through its observations has recommended that quotas be restricted to seven percent: five percent for freedom fighters' descendants, one percent for ethnic minorities, and one percent for people with disabilities.\nFor all practical purposes, it is a win for the protesters. Or so it would have been, had the morgues not been brimming with dead bodies, hospitals inundated with those critically injured, and public establishments set on fire around the country. Everyone is anxious, afraid, angry, and agitated\u2014a state of despair exacerbated manifold by the internet blackout imposed by the government to control the free flow of information. How many will be picked up, how many tortured, how many killed, how many maimed for life before all this is over?\nEach new day has brought with it ever-more shocking revelations of the cruelty of state apparatuses. The events of Tuesday (when BCL cadres viciously attacked protesters) and Wednesday (when law enforcement agencies stormed the public universities to drive off students from the campuses) already seem like distant memories. And talk as we must about the brutality in the days since, it's worth revisiting why law enforcers would have the right or the audacity to march into campuses of autonomous institutions, firing shotguns and sound grenades aimed at students in their late teens and early 20s. What does it say about our university authorities, VCs and provosts, except what we have known all along\u2014that they are mere puppets to the whims of the ruling party? What mockery they have all made of the sanctity of the university campus(es), whose walls are witness to some of the biggest uprisings against injustice in our history! If the students are now asking for the resignation of the VCs and provosts, it is the least they can demand for being betrayed time and time again.\u00a0\nThen came Thursday, which brought with it state-sponsored violence, the scale of which none of us were prepared for, despite living through the brutal squashing of the road safety movement in 2018 and every dissenting movement since. Areas in Dhaka turned into zones of unimaginable violence, with law enforcers charging upon and firing on students armed at most with sticks and brickbats, without provocation in most cases. The clips shared by countless students on social media, followed by eye-witness reports in the media, provide chilling accounts of the atrocities conducted by the police and BGB in the name of maintaining law and order. What law and whose order can justify the use of lethal weapons to disperse protesters, some not even old enough to vote? At least 25 people were killed, 11 of them students, including a 17-year-old, and over 3,000 were injured\u2014that we know of. Predictably, the government's heavy-handedness only served to amplify the anger of the masses, and we began to see protesters\u2014or motivated elements infiltrating the movement\u2014turn to increasingly destructive measures to resist.\u00a0\nWhat did the government really think\u2014that they could shoot the young students into submission after their trusted helmet bahini had failed to get the job done? That they could dangle the carrot of dialogue and concession, all the while opening fire upon the students, including those from private universities who had taken to the streets simply to express solidarity with their public university counterparts? The movement might have started on the issue of the reform of quota system, but underneath simmered discontent accumulated over the years about the culture of repression, conduct of law enforcement and actions of the ruling party's student wing. The outpouring on the streets over the past week is the manifestation of a long and deeply felt sense of injustice that has only been fanned by virulent rhetoric and violent tactics of the powers that be. By resorting to its tried-and-tested strategy, the government once again proved that it is too arrogant to listen to citizens' legitimate and peaceful demands for policy reforms. And in the process, it has done itself the biggest disservice.\nNow, the country is in the throes of chaos. From toll booths to offices of Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority (BTRA) offices, from flyovers to metro rail stations, numerous public establishments have been set ablaze or vandalised over the past few days. As per a report in this daily, miscreants wreaked havoc inside the Mirpur 10 and Kazipara metro rail stations, smashing vending machines, ticket counters, close circuit cameras and everything else on sight. We condemn such mindless destruction in no uncertain terms. And while the government can blame third party political elements all it wants now for the anarchy that we have witnessed over the past few days, it cannot evade responsibility for creating the conditions under which such chaos could breed and spread.\u00a0\nIf it could declare redistribution of quotas on Thursday night, and the hearing of the Appellate Division could be fast-tracked to Sunday, why could it not do so the week before? Why did it insist that its hands were tied, when the court itself had clarified that should the government want, it could simply issue a new circular? Why did government high-ups vilify the protesters and resort to their age-old strategy of \"othering\" to justify unlawful attacks by the student wing? Why did it unleash the BCL on protesting students, and then, when the protesters fought back and drove them out of the campuses, close down all educational institutions and halls? And most infuriatingly, why did it pour fuel in the fire by shooting young students and civilians? Why did it fail so miserably at containing the situation without resorting to lethal means? Why did it serve chaos on a platter for the so-called durbrittokaris to take advantage of?\u00a0\nThe death toll has continued to rise, with at least 66 killed on Friday alone\u2014that we could confirm\u2014and at least 21 on Saturday, even amid a curfew. In only four days, the death toll has crossed 127, as per data collected directly from the hospitals as of Saturday (the real count could be much higher), and includes law enforcers, journalists, pedestrians, rickshaw pullers and even children. It is truly inconceivable that so many lives have needlessly been lost, simply because the government was too obstinate to \"give in\" to the students' demands. And that political elements are now trying to create anarchy using the momentum of the movement will only endanger further the lives of ordinary students who are fighting for their dignity. The last thing we want is for the students to become pawns in a wider battle for power.\u00a0\nEven if the protests are ultimately called off, what lies ahead for those who engaged in the protests, particularly those who were in leadership positions? Nahid Islam, a key organiser of the anti-discrimination student movement, was picked up by \"plainclothes persons\" in the early morning yesterday, allegedly because he refused to agree with the government's proposal for a dialogue ahead of the Supreme Court's hearing. Nahid has since been found by his family and taken to the hospital to tend to injuries allegedly inflicted during the hours he was \"missing.\" After the quota reform and road safety movements of 2018, we saw how students were tracked down, detained, arrested, surveilled upon and threatened, and their lives irrevocably altered, with the state showing no mercy for those who had dared challenge it.\u00a0\nThe verdict may be in, but the bloodshed cannot be so easily erased from public memory. At the very least, the government should declare a general amnesty for student protesters as a gesture of goodwill. It should restore internet connection, which will bring some semblance of normalcy back to the country and help assuage people's anxieties and dispel the rumours going around. If the government is capable of learning any lesson at all, it should be that it can no longer afford to be so arrogant, so impervious to people's simmering frustrations and so ruthless in their handling of mass movements. After all, there is nothing more dangerous than a people who have nothing left to lose.\n",

        "full_article": " It has been a week of total disruption of the communications system and the supply chain since July 17 when agitating anti-quota students called a nationwide shutdown. The indefinite curfew that the government enforced to combat the ensuing violence across the nation, only made matters worse. Then came the phase of total isolation, when the internet service was totally disrupted, a situation that can be likened to the condition of a human body with its central nervous system gone dysfunctional. In consequence, the losses to the domestic as well as the external sectors of business and economy have been colossal.Thus the government suffered immensely, if only for the loss of revenue that it earns from business activities within the country. Though the actual revenue loss to the government exchequer cannot be assessed until normality returns in the country, one can at least make an intelligent guess about it. A report carried by this paper in its July 22 issue did come up with such an estimate of the lost revenue, which was to the tune of Tk8.73 billion on a daily basis. Consider the cumulative value of such losses suffered during the last week and what it would come to in case the dislocation continues indefinitely. One can only imagine what the overall revenue loss would come to if the accounts of different customs points at the land ports and seaports of the country are taken.The post-assessment release of the imported goods at the border custom points is reportedly being greatly hampered due to the loss of internet connectivity. Against this backdrop, to facilitate early release of at least the perishable goods, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is learnt to have ordered all the customs houses of the country to allow assessments of those goods to be done manually like it was done in time when there was no computer or internet. Though inefficient and tardy, it is the only possible solution to bank on at the moment, if only to avoid backlogs and damage to imported perishable items. Chattogram port, for instance, the hub of the country's external trade, has over the last one week, seen only two container ships, one of those being empty, leaving the port.The cumulative loss suffered by the garment sector alone during the last seven days will be staggering as it usually exports goods worth US$150 million through the port every day. So, the longer the stalemate is, the bigger the loss for businesses. Clearly, the garments sector that earns the highest amount of forex along with remittance sent by expatriate workers has been the worst victim of the communications disruption. So has the government been in terms of uncollected revenues.Counting the government's revenue losses will be a meaningless exercise, unless urgent measures are taken to restore order and connectivity at the same time, both internally and externally. To the external world, Bangladesh at the moment is a terra incognito, if only for the loss of communication with it. This is sending a wrong signal to the external business partners and potential investors. The crisis the nation going through at the moment is obviously a manmade one. So, it is up to the government to go to the bottom of the crisis and resolve it as soon as possible since the stakes are too high to allow the current state of socio-economic disorder to continue and fester.",

        "full_article": " By now it is clear that following LDC graduation in less than two years, Bangladesh is poised to face many fresh challenges due to its elevated country status. A good deal of these relates to preferential benefits in the realm of trade and commerce the country so long enjoyed and is still enjoying as an LDC. One such challenge is the new EU Generalised System of Preferences-plus (GSP-plus) scheme. The existing EU-GSP has been crucial in enabling Bangladesh to access the EU market by providing zero tariffs on exports. The revision of the scheme renamed GSP+ has added some strict prerequisites to qualify for preferential treatment under the scheme. GSP-plus is a remodelling of the duty preference structure that focuses on, among others, a number of International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions related to labour standards. GSP+ is a special incentive package for sustainable development and good governance of vulnerable developing countries, subject to their ratification of 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and climate change, and good governance. Vulnerable countries refer to those suffering from lack of export diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system. GSP+ grants full removal of tariffs on over 66 per cent of EU tariff lines. Upholding the GSP+ status, especially for effective implementation and compliance with reporting obligations of the 27 conventions, is managed by EU monitoring. The EU engages in a dialogue with authorities and stakeholders in beneficiary countries and arranges frequent monitoring missions to GSP+ beneficiary countries. The 'zero-duty access' to the EU under the existing GSP scheme will continue for three years after the official announcement of Bangladesh as a developing country in 2026. If the existing preferences are not available after the transition time, exports from Bangladesh would face 8.7 per cent duty on an average. As a result, it is estimated that shipments would drop at a rate of 5.7 per cent per year.  Given that continuation of tariff benefit under GSP-plus is tied to fulfilment of the conditions after LDC graduation, Bangladesh pledged to comply with the ILO conventions on labour and human rights along with few other issues. The key question now-how far has the country progressed in materialising its pledges, or is it in a position to fulfil the pledges within the timeframe? The National Action Plan (NAP) formulated by the government to expedite progress on the matter is still not believed to have advanced satisfactorily. The NAP covers broadly nine issues, including framing Bangladesh Labour Law in compliance with the ILO standards on freedom of association and collective bargaining, and elimination of child labour in all its forms by 2025. According to an FE report, a high-level European Commission monitoring mission is expected to visit Bangladesh on November 12-16 to review the full status of progress made so far. Meanwhile, the EU commission and the ILO are repeatedly urging upon the government about the importance of fulfilling the requirements in the NAP. The ILO has requested Bangladesh to bring about much-needed reforms to the Labour Law as a matter of priority through further consultations in line with the country's commitment. The latest request came after the Governing Body of the ILO concluded its 350th meeting at its headquarters in Geneva. At the session that took place between March 4 and 14, the member states made a series of decisions on living wages and initiatives to strengthen social justice. In line with the ILO's supervisory procedures, the members examined several country reports, including that of Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bangladesh. Speaking about Bangladesh, ILO said its governing body took note of the report on the progress made for implementation of the roadmap of actions and was mindful of its 2021-26 timeline for the labour sector reform, as well as of the results yet to be achieved. The Body noted the commitment made by Bangladesh to engage in further tripartite consultations to address the outstanding issues linked to Article 26, which deals with the ILO's complaint lodging procedure concerning alleged non-observance of conventions 81, 87 and 98. Convention 81 deals with the labour inspection at industrial units, Convention 87 refers to the freedom of association, and Convention 98 is related to collective bargaining rights.The ILO also called on Bangladesh and the social partners to pursue their tripartite consultations in a constructive manner with a view to bringing about all necessary reforms as a matter of priority. The government communicated the process of amending the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 and the Bangladesh Labour Rules. It also cited the reforming of a tripartite standing committee to work on the amendment proposals concerning the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Labour Act, 2019. The increase in the number of registered trade unions and active labour inspectors and the continuous recruitment of more inspectors as well as the enhancement of the capacity of the legal unit of the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE) were mentioned in the report. The ILO governing body urged Bangladesh to report on further progress in the implementation of the roadmap to address all the outstanding issues concerning Article 26 at the 352nd Session, which will be held in November 2024.In the light of the foregoing, Bangladesh has no choice but to take all necessary measures to qualify for the GSP+ in order to retain its export competitiveness in the EU market. In other words, continuation of tariff preference after LDC graduation is extremely vital for the sustenance of the country's export sector. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "\nWith the internet blackout and nationwide shutdown comes a host of problems for internal revenue generation. According to a report published in this newspaper on July 22: \"State exchequer counts an estimated domestic revenue loss of Tk 8.73 billion daily as production, trade and services falter for the ongoing nationwide quota-protest shutdown coupled with internet blackout.\" The domino effect on production, trade and services due to the cumulative loss of internet access, production and distribution of products and the halting of digital services is contributing to this loss in revenue.The stakes could not be higher for the economy right now. The volatility on city streets and in various districts around the country will hopefully see some respite as the Appellate Division has delivered its verdict on the quota situation. The gazette publication of the same should take place as soon as possible, and then the question will come whether this will lead to a negotiated settlement with protesters. Leaving that aside, the current situation has brought economic activity down to a trickle. As stated by revenue officials, a large portion of revenue generation comes from value-added-tax (VAT) on products and services. The internet blackout has hit revenue hard since millions of people use digital services, both on cell phones and broadband. Financial institutions have by and large gone online with their services, as have utility services (gas, water, electricity). Hence, there are serious financial implications to shutting down internet services in the country.Since VAT collection forms a cornerstone of direct revenue for the National Board of Revenue (NBR), there is simply no way to take this matter lightly. The hospitality industry with its thousands of restaurants, hotels and inns, vacation resorts all depends on daily sales of services. These have taken a serious hit because an increasing percentage of consumers depend on credit / debit card facilities to make payment. With the onset of curfews, few people are venturing out and most commercial establishments have shuttered their shops, not simply due to the fact that there are few people coming, but there are serious security concerns. The relative security enjoyed by the diplomatic enclave is not enjoyed by the rest of Dhaka residents, and why on earth would establishment owners bother to keep their respective shops open when there is serious supply chain disruption? Moving on, Chattogram Customs House (CCH) ordinarily collects Tk 1.86 billion per day. Indeed, CCH's annual revenue collection in the just-concluded financial year was Tk 680 billion. According to an analysis by this newspaper, the revenue board may suffer a loss up to Tk 3.19 trillion - a mammoth loss! Of course this is not the final tally. With disruption of digital services, customs officials have instructed stations across the country to accept any bank document on releasing perishable items and this makes sense. It is essential at this time to keep the supply chain for foodstuffs flowing because the main wholesale markets in the city, including Kawran Bazaar which serve as a hub for other retail markets in the city, have been suffering from intermittent supply of various items including vegetables. Indeed, price per kilogram of green chilli (a wholly domestically produced essential food) has shot up to Tk 600/kg. Better it is to forget about revenue loss and keep the goods flowing. This is a national priority. Stock taking on the revenue part can be done later. Imports of raw materials (including food and industrial inputs) need to clear customs on a war-footing so that essentials can get to people and factories can keep operating.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

To tackle students' movement, the government closed all educational institutions across the country, leaving the students in great uncertainty.In our government-run universities (both public universities and colleges under national university), the issue of session jam is widespread. The ongoing closure of universities will further aggravate the situation. Most students at public universities come from poor or middle-class families with the hope of shouldering the responsibility of their families after completing their university education. Having studied at a reputable public university, I have experienced the horrors of session jam. I know a senior to me whose life has been profoundly impacted by session jam. The effects of both the COVID-19 pandemic and session jam have robbed him of precious years of his life. By the end of his education, he had no time to prepare for a job. Of late, thanks to the dedicated efforts of some teachers, many departments are free from session jam. They have demonstrated that the goodwill of teachers can rescue students' academic lives from session jam.Since the government offered a solution to the quota issue, which I think students would happily accept, immediate steps should be taken to reopen universities and all other educational institutions.\nMohammad Sohel RanaStudent, BBAChattogram University",
