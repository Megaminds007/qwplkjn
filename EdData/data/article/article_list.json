        "full_article": "The much-awaited Tokyo Olympics 2020 began on July 23, 2021, with few if any spectators from home and abroad due to the Covid related \"new normal\".\nEarlier, the Games were postponed in 2020 because of the global pandemic of Covid-19. A recent poll in the leading Daily Asahi Shimbun suggests that more than\u00a080 percent of the Japanese population want the Games either to be cancelled or postponed. Japan's continuing struggle with the pandemic is the root cause of their concern.\nMany of the Japanese big business circles including the SoftBank and Rakuten voiced their concerns about the government's decision to hold the Tokyo Summer Olympics. Even some of the Japanese companies who usually sponsor the Olympics\u00a0called\u00a0for the games to be postponed till autumn. We know that Japan's medical infrastructure, at any definition, is of global standard. Even though the high infection rates, especially in Tokyo and Osaka, keep the Japanese epidemiologists on alert. The vaccination programmes are in action, and it is expected that all Japanese willing to be vaccinated will have access to vaccines by the end of October 2021.\nDespite public opinion against the Olympics, and growing concerns from health experts, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) remains committed to hold the Games.\nFrom the very beginning the Japanese government has been pushing the ball into the court of the IOC to cancel or postpone the Games.\nNow under tremendous pressure from the public, the government has decided that no spectators will cheer on the athletes in the Tokyo Olympics. Why Japan is determined to hold the Tokyo Olympics amidst the grave concerns about the pandemic is a million-dollar question.\nAfter winning the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, since 2013, has spent a substantial amount of money, around more than $18 billion (including private companies) on the Olympics and Paralympic Games.\nObservers opine that Japan's determination to hold the Olympics is something more than just hosting the summer games. Many in Japan consider the Olympics as soft power dividends for Japan. We recall that the Beijing Olympics 2008 marked the graduation of China to great power status.\nMoreover, the next Games on the global calendar are the Winter Games to be hosted again by China -- Japan's regional rival -- in Beijing in February 2022. Experts think that by cancelling the Summer Olympics 2020, Japan won't be ready to be outshined by China.\nIn addition to that, this mega event would also help Japan repair its relationship with neighbours such as China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia; and strengthen relationships with other participating countries throughout the globe.\nThe last time Japan hosted a Summer Olympics was in 1964. The Tokyo Olympics 1964 was the first ever Olympics to be held in Asia. Previously, Tokyo was supposed to host the 1940 Summer Olympics. They were, however, cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II and the Games did not resume till the 1948 London Olympics.\nBy that time Japan faced crushing defeats in the War and had been occupied by the Allied powers led by the United States.\nTherefore, hosting the 1964 Olympics was immensely significant for Japan as it helped the country return to the global stage as a peaceful, economically well-to-do and self-confident nation.\nFor Japan, the themes of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics were to project to the world Japan's rehabilitation and rebuilding process after World War II, its technological ability, capability to recover from enormous difficulties, and above all its warm hospitality.\nIt is important to mention here that nine days before the opening ceremony of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Japan inaugurated the world's fastest bullet trains -- the Shinkansen -- linking Tokyo and Osaka at speeds of up to 210 kilometres an hour on October 1, 1964.\nIt is widely believed that the 1964 Tokyo Olympics marked the end of Japan's post-war exile status and its return to the international arena, boosting its global posture and prestige.\nSimilarly, the Tokyo Olympics 2020 also has a symbolic significance for Japan. Since the 1990s bubble burst, Japan had experienced a long economic stagnation. It had to face the strongest ever tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\nTherefore, Japan considers the 2020 Summer Olympics as a symbol to showcase a new, revitalised Japan. Apparently, Japan is determined to hold the Olympics to exhibit its obvious prestige, virtues and strengths globally.\nPerhaps Tokyo 2020 cannot reinvigorate an \"Olympic Economy\" for Japan due to Covid-19, but it can demonstrate to the world the preparedness of Japan to host such a great sporting event. We wish a happy and secure Olympics for Japan.\nSM Ali Reza, PhD (Japan) is a Professor of Political Science, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. He can be reached at reza.namirah@du.ac.bd\n",

        "full_article": "There is a rush hour traffic out there. People after spending a short Eid escapade are frantically returning to the capital as the lockdown tolls the knell of a parting holiday. Conversely, there is an outgoing traffic of people who are desperately rushing out of Dhaka beefing that they do not have anything to do in the city during yet another shutdown. Such a flow of traffic through the veins with Dhaka at its centre makes me wonder of the different connotations of the heart.\u00a0\nNot only is the shape and location of Dhaka analogous to that of a heart, but also the circulatory function played by the city is a reminder of an organ made up with involuntary muscles. Dhaka is the central administrative organ that delivers sustenance to every part of its territorial body. It receives people who come to the centre with many issues that need to be resolved before being sent back to their respective cells. Some stay back clogging the system, putting additional pressure on the related organs; e.g. the lung cries with air pollution, and kidney with the sewage blockage. In order for the heart to stay healthy and functional, the systemic flow is a must. Then again, the involuntary nature of the heart muscles suggest that there is a complete lack of control over the mechanical process unless the head has a role to play. For instance, those who had to wait four hours to travel 10 km from Mahakhali to Abdullahpur before Eid day will tell you how the heart had a near thrombosis. The holiday policy and the lockdown relaxation allowed the heart to feel the unimaginable pressure.\nOn the other hand, the heart as a metaphor has a mind of its own. It listens to its own instincts. The scaremongering with which the government tried to control the flow to deal with the scourge has shown little or no effect. Notwithstanding 200 plus deaths and 38 percent positive detection rate a day, people literally go out of their houses to see the lockdown circus the way death is voyeuristically viewed during the Halloween in the west. It takes a lot of heart to ignore death with such a carefree attitude. The courage or foolishness debate behind such acts can only be surmised by the adage: where angels fear to tread, fools rush in!\nIn the last 18 months, people have somewhat become ambivalent towards this pandemic. They have learned to live with disease and its consequent death. Their indifference to death ironically both highlights and celebrates life. I was listening to a mother who was interviewed by a TV journalist on the deck of a ferryboat during the last holiday onrush. \"What good is my job in Dhaka if I cannot see my child during this holiday once a year?\" Try using your fear tactic to negate the logic of a mother who must go home despite all hurdles thrown at her like in a video game. You can't. At the end of the day, here is a mother who will do anything in her power to see her child. She has saved up her savings to perhaps buy a new dress or a toy. You cannot stop her from going home saying that, listen, you are a potential vector; the gift that you are carrying is a gift of disease and even death. For her, love is immediate and real; death is deferred and denied.\nLast week, I was sitting at the waiting lounge before a Covid-19 ICU of a city hospital. There was no fear among most of the attendants, staff or doctors. I guess, compared to last year, the mortality rate has gone down because patients are not abandoned to die and treated as pariahs. There are more people willing to express their love for the sick and the dead. Maybe by now we are a bit more informed about the nature of this virus. Then again, to pretend that this disease is defeated can be the greatest folly that one can think of, and to deny the multifaceted implications of the disease will be fatal.\nSeeing dead bodies coming out of the ICU, seeing the difficulties the attendants find in paying up the hospital charges, seeing the manipulation of emotion of the relatives by the medical professionals who prolong the treatment, seeing the orchestration of supply of medicine, oxygen and other essentials, I was forced to think of the heart metaphor all over again. I wondered has this city got any heart at all!\nWe had to buy one ampule of injection to stop the spread of lung infection of our patient paying Tk 2.5 lakh. The original price is Tk 40,000. This more than six times hike is manipulated through an artificial market shortage. Everyone knows it! This is true for every little item associated with this pandemic. Have you noticed that the price of your ordinary liquid soap has doubled in the last one year? Oh, they are simply marketing it in a new packet. Even the price of your daily food supplements has gone up. You wonder how do these greedy individuals who profit from the misfortune of others sleep at night? Do they have any heart at all?\nPerhaps we need to address the heart of the matter. Instead of simply saying wear masks and maintain social distancing, we need a different flow of information. It's all in the flow. We need a free-flow of information about the pros-and-cons of a lockdown. Instead of simply imposing it, we need to create public opinion through logic. In epidemiological terms, the virus has an incubation period of 14 days, and another week is needed for the residual infection to die out. For the lockdown to be effective, everyone needs to be in quarantine for 21 days. But how effective was the lockdown with its seven-day relaxed clause, allowing people to rush out of and rush into the city? What signals are the head of government giving to the hearts of the people? Can we really blame the people for such half-hearted compliance with the lockdown measures?\nIn order to make the gravity of the situation heartfelt, there has to be a concerted flow of information. If you ask a bus driver not to ply, he must see how his sacrifice counts. If he sees that there are makeshift arrangements for transporting people and a new group are benefitting from his temporary absence from the business, he will be reluctant to follow health protocols when his chance to drive is available. His frustration and anger will be part of his coping mechanism.\nFaced with the pandemic, too many of us are shifting to denial mode. Few of us have managed to find altruistic and subliminal functions to convert the negative energy into something positive by helping others or doing something productive. However, most other psychotic responses, as is evident through the mob behaviour during this lockdown lift, have been immature. Understandably, many of these people are anxious over their financial condition; they are frustrated over the lack of mobility; they are depressed over how things are affecting their lives; they are angry over the economic divide created by this mostly technology driven solution to the crisis. Their toxicity is affecting the blood (read passion) that flows in and out of the social heart.\nWhy don't we make a factsheet for a change: how much money is needed to treat a coronavirus patient? How much will one save by not becoming a patient? What will happen to the dependents if the life of a Covid-19 patient is lost? Is it worth taking the risk to buy a dress or a toy for a child? Is it worth to keep the businesses open to buy a big cow as a display of one's id? We need to talk sense. We need to deal with the heart of the matter. We need to make sure that people understand that heart matters. Once it stops, the heart will have no reason, no information fluid to process. We can have the fools rushing in to clog the system and kill it. Now the question is: how is the head protecting the heart?\n\u00a0\nShamsad Mortuza is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), and a professor of English at Dhaka University (on leave).\n",

        "full_article": "August 15, 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of US President Nixon delinking the US dollar from gold. Instead of a crisis, the ensuing half century marked the pre-eminence of the US financial system to global dominance.\nIn 2017, US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin commissioned four major studies on the US financial system that reviewed its efficiency, resilience, innovation and regulation. These surveys highlighted the US dominance in all four areas of banking, capital markets, asset management and financial technology. To quote: \"The US banking system is the strongest in the world\u2026The US capital markets are the largest, deepest, and most vibrant in the world\u2026(that) include the USD 29 trillion equity market, the USD 14 trillion market for US Treasury securities, the USD 8.5 trillion corporate bond market, and USD 200 trillion (notional amount) derivatives market.\" \"Nine of the top 10 largest global asset managers are headquartered in the United States.\" In the area of financial technology, \"US firms accounted for nearly half of the USD 117 billion in cumulative global investments from 2010 to 2017.\"\nUnder-pinning the US financial system's success is of course the US dollar's dominant currency pricing role. The dollar accounted for 88 percent in paired foreign exchange currency trading in 2019 and 59 percent of official foreign exchange holdings. It is widely used in trade invoicing in manufacturing but less so in services trade. As a major IMF study has shown, this pricing role impacts on emerging market economy (EME) exchange rate policies, as their devaluation would have only limited positive impact on their exports, but amplifies their import contraction. Furthermore, because EME debt is largely denominated in dollars, any dollar appreciation would have an overall contractionary impact on EME liquidity and growth. This is why US interest rate increases are feared not just by the US Treasury, but also almost all EME economies.\nSeveral factors combined to create the recent seismic shift in the global financial landscape. First, financial technology has eroded the dominant share of the banking system. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) 2020 report on non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) revealed that as of end-2019, they accounted for 49.5 percent of global financial assets of USD 404 trillion, compared with 38.5 percent for the banks. Indeed, total NBFI lending now exceed bank lending, partly because of tighter bank regulations and higher bank capital and liquidity costs.\nSecond, financial technology has enabled new arrivals in the financial sector comprising not new fintech startups, but also Big Tech platforms that are using Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, apps and their dominance of cloud computing to provide more convenient, speedy and customer-oriented finance for individuals and businesses. This month, a major BIS study on the implications of fintech and digitisation on financial market structure showed how Big Tech has muscled into traditional banking services, especially in payment services, lending and even asset management.\u00a0\nTaking the growth of NBFIs and Big Tech together, the traditional bank regulators and supervisors find that they regulate less and less of the financial system, but central banks are responsible for overall financial stability! Regulating the complex financial eco-system is like trying to tie down a huge elephant by a bunch of specialists each trapped in their own silos. And politically, no one wants to give a super-regulator power to rule them all.\nThird, the financial landscape entered new minefields because of intense geopolitical rivalry. If global supply chains are going to be decoupled by different standards, and we arrive at a Splinternet of different technology standards, how should finance respond? As the US applies pressure on Chinese companies and individuals through new sanctions and legislation, financial institutions and companies struggle to deal with shifting goal posts and game changes. The Ant Finance and Didi events are more a reflection of regulatory concerns whether large domestic Big Data platforms should be subject to foreign legislation with national security implications. Will India, for example, continue to allow foreign Big Tech to own all their client data?\nFourth, the regulatory trend towards \"open financial data\" in which banks would open up their client databases to allow new players to access customer accounts and data will provide new products and services. But this means also severe concerns on client privacy and data security. No country has yet figured out how to manage competition fairly in the fintech world when five firms (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle) dominate 70 percent of cloud-related infrastructure services.\u00a0\u00a0\nFifth, blockchain technology, cyber-currencies and central bank digital currencies are now increasingly coming on-stream, making possible payments and transactions that rely less on official currencies and also outside the purview of regulation. In short, the official regulators are responsible for system stability, but may not have access to what is really going on in blockchain space. That is an accident waiting to happen.\nAll these suggest that the global financial system has grown faster, more complex and entangled than any single nation to manage on its own. If the largest financial systems are caught in increasingly acrimonious geopolitical rivalry, what are the risks of financial accidents that can easily escalate to financial crises? In the 2008 global financial crisis, G20 stood together to execute a whole range of responses. This time round, there is no unity as the US continues to apply financial sanctions against her enemies and rivals, amounting to 4,283 cases as of January 2021, of which 246 and 8 respectively were against Chinese and Hong Kong entities.\u00a0\nThe bubble in fintech valuation that has fuelled rising stock markets and investments in technology is fundamentally driven by central bank loose monetary policy. Central bank assets have grown faster on an average of 8.4 percent per annum between 2013-2018, than banks (3.8 percent) or NBFIs (5.9 percent) to reach 7.5 percent of global financial assets. Does this mean that financial markets can assume that central banks will continue to underwrite their prosperity?\u00a0\nAs inflation rears its head, central banks will have to reverse their loose monetary stance, thus putting the global financial system under stress. The global financial system has structural and regulatory cracks, but they can only be fixed by having some political understanding amongst the big players. Without this, expect a messy outcome.\n\u00a0\nAndrew Sheng from Malaysia is Adjunct Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing and University of Malaya.

        "full_article": "The world is abuzz with the news reports by several major international news outlets that have revealed how people among 45 countries have been spied upon with the help of Pegasus spyware. Created by Israeli company NSO Group, this spyware has the most invasive techniques to get information on any person with a mobile phone. It can harvest data, turn on the microphone and camera of any smartphone without even the user doing anything, track location and record conversations and even initiate downloads without the user knowing it. So far, according to reports, rights activists, journalists, politicians and jurists in the 45 countries have been targeted including French president Emmanuelle Macron, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan and Indian politician Rahul Gandhi.\nThe Washington Post has documented Pegasus infections in 45 locations and this includes Bangladesh though the paper has added that infected phones do not necessarily mean that a country's government is a client.\nSo far the Bangladesh government has totally rejected such a possibility. The Post and Telecommunications Minister has said that neither the telecommunications division nor the ICT division purchased such spyware. The director (media and legal wing) of Rapid Action Battalion, has also denied buying or using the spyware.\nWe applaud the 17 news organisations in 10 countries that launched the Pegasus Project, an investigative reporting consortium, following the leak. If it was not for these intense investigative efforts we would never have known the extent to which our privacy is being invaded.\nThough Bangladesh has officially denied acquiring this spyware, the fact that the probe has found Bangladesh to be one of the locations where phones have been infected is cause for alarm. We have already seen the way private conversations, confidential documents are leaked in social media that serve to benefit certain quarters and malign or discredit others. Phone-tapping has been practiced in this country for many years so the existence of such surveillance software would not be surprising. Unfortunately we the general public cannot feel confident that various kinds of technology will not be used to invade our privacy and the data used to hurt us. The way the Digital Security Act is being abused, for instance, to intimidate and incarcerate any kind of dissenting voice or just purely to settle personal scores gives us little confidence regarding how such spyware could be used if the state is using it.\nWe sincerely hope that the official denials of acquiring such spyware can be trusted. But the fact that a leading international news outlet has identified Bangladesh as one of the locations where Pegasus exists should prompt the government to vigorously find out who the clients of this spyware are. Fortunately the investigating media outlets have said that they will gradually publish the names of the clients of NSO Group so we will all be able to know. Surveillance of citizens with such techniques are a blatant violation of our privacy and contradictory to democratic values. We hope Bangladesh will put an end to all speculations and find out whether this spyware is being used and if so, against whom.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "A recent report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) revealed that different types of emergency response equipment bought under a Tk 746.05 crore project funded by the World Bank, are collecting dust sitting in warehouses and satellite control rooms across Dhaka city. The report found that there was no allocation for the maintenance of these machinery, some of which are sensitive and may decay if left to be like this.\nThe equipment was bought as part of the sub-project being conducted by the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) in a bid to improve the country's capacity for emergency response, including fire incidents and earthquakes. Between July 2015 and April 2020, the project had had a progress of 80 percent but the deadline was extended by a year until June 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the authorities then sought further extension of the project timeline until April 2022 and a cost increase to Tk 805.90 crore. This revision is currently pending approval by the Planning Commission.\nBut what of the equipment which is already here in several warehouses and satellite rooms? For one, the three turntable ladders (brought from Germany), which could be used to douse fire in high-rise buildings, were not found in a useable state by the IMED team in May. While one was found to be operational, another was being repaired by foreign experts, and the third had its side plate damaged during transport. Many ICT equipment were also still in their boxes. The team observed equipment, ambulances, and furniture to be covered in dust in the warehouses and satellite control rooms in Kallyanpur, Mirpur 10, Mohakhali, Azimpur, and Karwan Bazar areas.\nUpon visiting the Karwan Bazar warehouse on July 8, reporters of this daily found from nearby construction workers that it had last been opened during Ramadan. Though the executive engineer of area-3 of the DNCC suggested the reporters contact project officials for further queries, the project director said the control rooms and warehouses had been handed over to the zonal executive offices of the DNCC around two years ago. The explanations given by project officials regarding why the turntable ladders were not being fixed are flimsy and shows indifference towards the maintenance of such crucial equipment.\u00a0\u00a0 The horrible Narayanganj factory fire and other such devastating disasters remind us of the crying need for such emergency response equipment. If the revision is approved and the April 2022 deadline is accepted, we would urge authorities to ensure that the project is seen through by that time and also that all the equipment procured under it is maintained and used as necessary.\n",

        "full_article": "We are appalled how the river Boral has been allowed to die leading to the destruction of such a crucial water body as Chalan Beel, becoming the victim of years of encroachment, pollution and ill-planned sluice gates and dams built at various points. Our correspondent back from Natore found an entire housing society that has occupied a large chunk of the Boral river\u2014built under the noses of the local administration. It is all the more shocking that it is not just private individuals who are guilty of this blatant grabbing of river land\u2014several government projects and offices have set up buildings on this river land. Why a well-intentioned project to build houses for the extreme poor should be built on river land is beyond our comprehension.\nFurther investigation has revealed that the river land has been grabbed for cultivating crops while indiscriminate dumping of household and industrial waste from these districts have polluted and clogged the river further. It is hardly surprising to know that river experts have said that the reckless grabbing and pollution has cost the Boral river's natural course. Disruption in the natural flow of water has also been caused by building sluice gates at a point in the river in the 80s leading to many areas of the river drying up.\nAccording to a chief engineer of the Water Development Board, because of the sluice gates water released from the Padma during the dry season has gone down drastically. Dams have also been built dividing the river into several parts adding to the disruption of flow of water all year round. These areas are virtually arid except during the monsoons.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The water resource ministry did a feasibility study in 2018 on the impact of these activities and came up with important recommendations. We urge the government to treat this as an emergency and execute these recommendations. They include removing illegal structures to free the river, increase the flow of water by reconstructing the sluice gates, dredging the river if needed, making sure untreated sewage is not dumped into the river. In addition we believe that stocktaking is crucial to find out how this continuous grabbing of the river land has taken place. Those who have been responsible for occupying the land and selling the plots must be held accountable with the names of all illegal occupiers disclosed to the public. The government must remove all structures belonging to it that are in the river land. The incomprehensible apathy towards such continuous killing of our rivers and other waterbodies must stop and the government must show its commitment to save them and to protect the environment.\n",
