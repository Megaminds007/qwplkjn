From stuffy, closed-door meetings peopled by bureaucrats and technocrats, they have morphed into a carnival. Officialdom has of course grown, with the UN climate secretariat bursting at the seams with reams of subsidiary bodies, \u2018working groups\u2019 and intricately convoluted agenda items. But this has been accompanied by the burgeoning of activist groups, indigenous groups, big and small business, consultancies, traders and a vast media presence. It is on the one hand fair to conclude that this is a welcome development and due to the growing awareness of how anthropogenic climate change, amplified by centuries of industrialisation, poses an existential threat to humanity. Climate denialists, vociferous and significant in power corridors even until a decade ago, are now relegated to the obscurity of the darknet, along with Flat Earthers, and their ranks filled by parvenus and the pivoting merchants of the fossil fuel era who see opportunity in the messianic espousal of renewable energy. There is no country today that will not publicly affirm its faith in the scientific assessment \u2014 that greenhouse gas emissions must be contained drastically to cap the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C \u2014 and yet it has never inspired any sense of urgency to cut fossil fuel use, the dominant source of GHGs.That it has taken nearly three decades for COP to acknowledge this fact, as laid out in the Dubai Consensus, suggests that political expediency and strategic second-guessing has unfortunately weaponised even climate science. Thus, countries responsible for most of the human-emitted carbon point to record temperatures and their links to rising emissions when arguing for reining in emissions from developing countries. However, they are loathe to accept this link when developing and island nations demand funds as reparations for devastations already wreaked by climate change. The Loss and Damage Fund, which received commitments worth $750 million, and therefore cheered as a COP28-success, has only been approved on the condition that it not be considered as compensation for historical carbon pollution. Related to this is the larger concern that COP meetings are deemed as \u2018historic\u2019 only when they insert new verb phrases \u2014 phase out, phase down, transition \u2014 on cutting emissions but are banal when they consider how little money and technology have been channelled for fossil fuel de-addiction. It is time that future meetings use the science to promote justice and equity and strengthen faith in what is now one of the few working multilateral processes.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Nations (climate change)\n\n/\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\ncarbon emissions\n\n/\n\nUnited Arab Emirates",

        "full_article": "Two months after Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza residents in retaliation for the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas began, India joined its voice to the global call to stop the bombing, voting in favour of a resolution at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) along with 152 other nations. The resolution demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, an observance of international humanitarian law, the unconditional release of all hostages, as well as \u201censuring humanitarian access\u201d. India\u2019s vote was a shift from its previous vote at the last such UNGA resolution on October 27, when despite the death of 8,000 Gazans, India had decided to abstain from voting for a resolution that called for a ceasefire. The government and the MEA explained this to be a matter of principle, as part of India\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach towards terrorism, as the earlier resolution did not contain an \u201cexplicit condemnation\u201d of the October 7 attacks. However, while the UNGA resolution passed on December 12 bears no direct mention of the terror attacks, India has voted in favour. Although the government has yet to detail the rationale, there could be several reasons: casualty figures have risen relentlessly, with 18,000 dead and the highest such toll of nearly 90 journalists. More than 80% of the entire population is homeless. Even the U.S., Israel\u2019s biggest ally, estimates that nearly half of the 29,000 air-to-ground munitions deployed by Israel thus far are \u201cunguided\u201d or indiscriminate missiles. Second, Israeli Defence Forces have gone far beyond their original mandate of eliminating Hamas capacity and freeing the hostages to a large-scale flattening of Gaza and forced occupation of more territory. More than 100 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas custody. Third, global opinion, including Indian public opinion, has moved decidedly from sympathy with Israel, to horror at the unfolding aftermath, and New Delhi could not have been immune to entreaties by Palestine and the Gulf States to take a relook at its vote, even as India stood isolated in South Asia and the Global South for its previous abstention.It may be too early to see India\u2019s UNGA vote as a reversal of its earlier position and a reversion to its original position in the conflict, where it has traditionally called for peace. Much will depend on the role India chooses for itself in ensuring the ceasefire is effected and holds, given that Israel has already rejected the UNGA resolution. Having proven its credentials as a friend to Israel following the terror attacks, as well as the odium of enabling the civilian deaths, the Modi government must be more vocal in helping the Netanyahu government out of the strategic cul de sac it has bombarded its way into, one which could cause regional instability and insecurity for decades. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "By Jug Suraiya\nLoneliness and solitude. Two words which are often interchanged, though they are not just divergent in meaning but diametrically opposed.\nLoneliness is often associated with remote, unpeopled places. But, counterintuitively, the condition of feeling alone is most acutely felt in the clamour of overcrowded cities and urban spaces.\nWith increased urbanisation and the population shift from rural regions to cities, there is a spreading sense of being depersonalised in the midst of faceless crowds.\nIn her memoir, The Lonely City, Olivia Lange has written about her move to New York City, \u201cthat teeming island of gneiss and concrete and glass\u201d:\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be lonely? How do we live if we are not intimately engaged with another human being? How do we connect with other people\u2026Is technology helping, does it draw us closer together or trap us behind screens?\u201d\nMaria Popova, who edits the online journal, The Marginalian, has likened loneliness to \u201ca suffocating penitentiary in which one\u2019s inner scream becomes deafening, deadening, severing any thread of connection to other lives.\u201d A description which vividly evokes Edvard Munch\u2019s famous painting of a face, mouth agape in a silent howl of isolated anguish.\nLoneliness is seen as a serious health issue, and both Japan and the UK have a minister whose portfolio is to devise means to help people to deal with it. According to the US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, as much as half the adult population of the country suffers from this mental malaise, which he says can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\nIn 2020, an NGO survey in Mumbai found that 75% of the elderly respondents felt alone, even though they lived in family households. Only too often physical proximity instead of bridging the gulf of emotional and psychological separateness widens it, emphasising the lack of human contact.\nThe opposite of the solitary confinement of loneliness is solitude. Loneliness is passive, imposed; solitude is elective, and awards agency to those who choose it.\nSages, poets, artists, have long chosen what psychoanalyst Adam Phillips calls \u2018fertile solitude\u2019. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Hemingway made the frequently quoted statement that solitude is essential for creativity.\nThe 19th century French artist, Eugene Delacroix, noted in his diary at age 26, \u201cPoor fellow! How can you do great work when you\u2019re always having to rub shoulders with everything that is vulgar\u2026Nou rish yourself with grand and austere ideas that feed the soul\u2026Seek solitude.\u201d\nEchoing this antidote to the prosaic and pedestrian, the mystical poet, William Blake, wrote, \u201cGreat things are done when men and mountains meet; this is not done by jostling in the street.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t have to be poets, artists, sages, hermits in the Himalayas, to seek the punctuation of solitude, as a form of detoxing of mind and spirit from the distractions and concerns of the commonplace. Organisations like Vipassana conduct courses in meditation during which participants are enjoined to maintain silence and seclude themselves from any communication with the outside world.\nThat chosen solitude can help liberate the mind from the unitary self to encompass the commonality of all consciousness. Such seclusion is the opposite of aloneness; it is the discovery of misremembered oneness, that underlying plurality which is us.\n\n",

Earlier, in August, it had introduced the three bills, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, which were examined by a parliamentary committee.\n\nGOI did well\nThe government disagreed with the parliamentary committee\u2019s retrograde suggestion to criminalise adultery to \u201csafeguard\u201d the sanctity of marriage. That some MPs still think adultery is a criminal act is worrying.\nMissed opportunities\nGOI had said that it had to reintroduce the bills to accommodate the parliamentary committee\u2019s suggestions.\nBut as in the August version, clauses in BNS that mirror sedition in IPC have been retained. Once again, marital rape has been explicitly ruled out under the provisions of rape.\nUndertrial problems may not end\nIndia\u2019s prisons are overcrowded, a prison population of 5.73 lakh at the end of 2022 was 131% of the holding capacity. Three out of four prisoners are undertrials, of whom about half are in the age bracket of 18-30. BNSS Bill retains a provision that said the 15-day police custody need not be contiguous. It runs the risk of prolonging custody of vulnerable people who haven\u2019t been convicted.\n\nEconomic security gets emphasis\nOne aspect that stands out in the reintroduced BNS Bill is the emphasis on \u201ceconomic security\u201d in the provision dealing with terror. There\u2019s a lot more emphasis on economic dimensions of terrorist activity as damage to monetary stability has been brought under its purview.\nFacial recognition is missing\nFacial recognition is fast emerging globally as a new form of evidence. Delhi police has used it for both investigation and evidence in riots cases. However, the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill fails to account for this form of evidence. It leaves a wide gap between the proposed law and the advances on the ground, which doesn\u2019t help the criminal justice system.\nThe three new bills could have significantly changed India\u2019s criminal justice system. That they didn\u2019t is a loss for the justice system.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a significant policy shift, the government is poised to allow investments in the establishment of refineries and marketing of refined oil products, both for domestic consumption and export. A recent gazette notification has unlocked the previously restricted industry sector for private investment, albeit with certain preconditions that have evoked a mixed reaction among concerned stakeholders. The draft policy states that annual capacity of a refinery has to be at least 1.50 million tonnes. Private refineries will have to sell a minimum of 60 per cent of the total fuel oil output---diesel, octane, petrol, jet fuel, furnace oil and by-products---to the state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) at a government-determined price during the initial three years from starting operation. The remaining 40 per cent of the fuel oil can be sold through their own marketing network. The three-year gestation period over, they will be allowed to market up to half of their output for subsequent two years. After five years of operations, overall performance of the refiners will be reviewed to determine the quantity of oil products to be purchased by the BPC. An interested private enterprise must have a minimum annual turnover of Tk 50 billion and possess jetty facility to qualify for the big-budget venture. The private refineries can export refined output under their own arrangement on obtaining no-objection certificate (NOC) from the BPC, unless the corporation buys their products. Following the final approval of the refinery setup, a private entrepreneur is required to provide a bank guarantee of Tk 250 crore in favour of the BPC as security deposit before commencing commercial activities.Currently, Bangladesh imports approximately 1.50 million metric tonnes of crude oils annually to be refined at the country's lone oil refinery, the Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL), a subsidiary of the BPC. However, ERL can only meet 20 per cent of the country's overall demand. In addition, the BPC separately imports around 7.5 million tonnes of refined oil products including diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, octane, and marine fuel. Considering the overall situation, along with fluctuating international prices and supply chain challenges, private refineries, together with the ERL, hold the promise of significantly increasing the availability of refined petroleum products while saving a substantial amount of foreign exchange.Reactions from concerned quarters have primarily focused on the financial preconditions stipulated in the policy draft. Industry insiders have expressed concerns that the mandatory production capacity of 15 lakh tonnes per year will impose serious pressure on interested entrepreneurs. However, experts suggest that these stringent financial requirements may stem from protective and precautionary concerns and it is anticipated that these issues will be addressed before finalising the policy. What appears encouraging is the dismantling of public sector's monopoly over fuel oil, marking the opening up of market economy in the energy sector. However, caution must be exercised to prevent the emergence of a monopoly among major investors.",

        "full_article": "The Indian reality or game show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' hosted by celebrated actor Amitabh Baccchan had its premiere in 2000 giving contestants the opportunity to win Rs 1.0 crore or 10 million in 96 minutes at the latest or even earlier. This amount was raised to Rs 7.5 crore in the season 14 from Rs 7.0 crore (70 million) in season 13 when two brothers from Delhi hit the jackpot. Few ordinary people except the world's superrich have such an opportunity to earn in so short a time such fabulous amounts of money. Wealth creation in Bangladesh has been at a break-neck speed for many over the past few years. At a time when more people have joined the rank of the poor due to the economic slump induced by post-Covid time shock followed by the supply chain disruption on account of the Russia-Ukraine war, the number of crorepatis has seen a phenomenal increase. On the eve of the Victory Day, this exponential growth of crorepatis could indeed be a cause for celebration but for the reverse picture at the bottom rung of society. With the trickle-down benefit drying up, it exposes a raw sore to society. The Bangladesh Bank comes up with a comprehensive list of the crorepatis --- bank accounts of 10 million or above--- account holders in the country. In the past year, the number of bank accounts with deposits of Tk 10 million or above has increased by 7,066 to 113,586. The net worth of these accounts is Tk725,550 crore (Tk7,255.50 billion) which is 42.35 per cent of the total savings of bank accounts amounting to Tk1713,134 crore (17131.34 billion). The BB also presents the number of account holders with bank deposit amounting to Tk 1.0-5.0 crore and with a break-up slab of 5.0 crore until Tk 50 crore. Between Tk 40-50 crore, the number of account holders is 747 but the number of account holders with deposits amounting to more than Tk 50 crore or 500 million is 1,778. Notably, all of these are not individual account holders. There are corporate account holders as well as accounts of government institutes and organisations. Also, there may be a number of personal or collective accounts on behalf of individuals and organisations. Yet there is no doubt that the number of crorepatis is on the rise, rather phenomenally. Now contrast this with the early days of Bangladesh. In the year 1972, the number of bank accounts with deposits of Tk 1.0 crore or above was only five (5.0) which rose to 47 in 1975. Now that the men and women running for the January, 7 national election, almost without exception, have reported accretion of wealth at accelerated rates ---in some cases reportedly by 20 times to 200 times, according to the affidavits they submitted to the Election Commission (EC). Did all the contestants have a magic wand to accumulate wealth so fast? Interestingly, politicians who were not in the ruling party also saw their wealth soaring. The leverage enjoyed from their previous stints with power could have helped them do the trick. Overall, politics is too lucrative to be resisted. Not that all involved with politics or willing to contest in parliamentary polls are direct beneficiaries of power connections. But they knew how to exploit the advantage from their adversarial positions. Or, there is no explanation of the fairy-tale like rise of the nouveau riche or according to bitter critics, upstarts. It is, therefore, not unusual to feel perturbed on the eve of yet another Victory Day about the yawning income inequality in a country that had its stated goal to establish as equalitarian a society as possible. To make the country free of exploitation and socio-economic disparities, the nation had to make sacrifices few nations ever did in human history. The central bank's list of crorepatis and the affidavit submitted by candidates for the national polls only confirm that the privileged had taken undue advantages in accumulating wealth at the expense of the large majority not so fortunate by any count. Yet the bank deposits of crorepatis and the candidates' fortunes do not quite present a complete picture of wealth accumulation by means fair or foul. Business sharks and swindlers of public money deposited with banks and financial institutes have bled the country by laundering billions or maybe, trillions of takas out of the country. Big wilful loan defaulters are some of the money launderers who evade punishment and even enjoy rescheduling of their loans while farmers are arrested for non-payment of a paltry sum ranging up to Tk 5,000 and maltreated in public with a rope tied around their waists. A High Court bench once castigated lawyers for defending the big loan defaulters while not fighting the case for small farmers. If socio-economic justice is trampled in an independent country that had to come through so much trial and tribulation, who are to blame? Certainly not those people who find themselves at the receiving end. It is the educated, privileged, powerful and, of course, crafty and intriguing who have thrown moral values and ethical norms in tatters. No wonder, society today is unstable, politics bankrupt and human values banished because of the failure of the upper crust of society.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The slaughter of the consumers centring around prices of onion, the pungent bulb, is over. The noise over onion prices has been rather short-lived, as the price of the item has scaled down to the previous level at almost identical speed. The price of onion shot up by more than 70 per cent on Saturday last, following the extension of the export ban by India until March next year.Relevant government agencies plunged into action on the following day and imposed fines on a few onion traders in Dhaka and Chattogram. Consumers have been witnessing similar actions, particularly by the officials of the national consumers' rights protection directorate in the recent past. But those have failed to produce any tangible outcome. Did it work this time? Possibly, not.Something unusual came to the rescue of the consumers. Onion growers' rush to reap the maximum gain has largely contributed to the fast cooling of an overheated onion market. Many growers in major onion producing areas have harvested the immature onion (murikata piaz) and scrambled for the market with their produce. The traders too have released their stock of onions fearing further slide in prices, which is very much possible as fresh onions would soon start arriving in the market. These two developments have pulled the prices of onions down to their previous level. The ruckus, however, has brought to the fore a few issues that deserve the attention of the policymakers and need to be followed up by appropriate actions. The first and foremost of those is the production-related data mismatch. For instance, the Agriculture Marketing Directorate's data showed the domestic production of onion in 20220-21 at 3.36 million tonnes. The country imported another 0.55 million tonnes in that year. Thus, nearly 4.0 million tonnes of onion were available in 2020-21 as against the estimated annual consumption of 2.62 million tonnes. However, the data compiled by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) puts the domestic onion production at 2.27 million tonnes in the year in question. Then again, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, the country had a bumper harvest of onion (3.45 million tonnes) in 2022-23. If all the Agriculture Marketing's statistics are right, the country is self-sufficient in onion production and it should not be worried about India's decision to impose a ban on the export of the item. But the fact remains otherwise. It is now quite clear that there exist certain flaws in the compilation of data concerning domestic production or consumption of onion. The problem with production or consumption statistics is not only relevant to onion. This is true in the case of other crops, cash or otherwise. Take the case of rice. In 2020-21, Bangladesh produced nearly 38 million tonnes of rice, 3.0 million tonnes more than its annual consumption requirement. Yet the country imported 1.35 million tonnes of rice during that year. The government usually maintains a buffer stock of between 1.0 million and 1.5 million tonnes of rice through domestic and external procurement. All these figures do point to major statistical errors. Policymakers in the recent past have confronted this problem very often. No corrective measures, however, are in place. No plan is perfect without credible data. This is equally true for the import programmes that the government undertakes for cereals or other food items. The lack of credible data remains a sore point for planners at all levels. There has not been any serious move to improve the situation. Hopefully, there will be a change for the better soon. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

The cold winds during the winter nights pierce their skin, but they have hardly anything to protect themselves.

Sometimes, they even wrap their body in sacks. As they cannot sleep properly in winter nights, they sleep throughout the day, which impedes their daily meagre earnings. The number of street children in Bangladesh is more than five million. Their miseries know no bounds in winter. Getting sick due to cold is an everyday phenomenon for these children.
