The verdict, which has been hailed by the Opposition and Pakistan\u2019s media as the defeat of Mr. Khan\u2019s \u2018assault on democracy\u2019, has had the slightly unusual impact of reinstating PM Khan after he had voluntarily resigned, and resurrecting the National Assembly, which had been dissolved the same day by Pakistani President Arif Alvi, as he called for fresh elections. Parliamentarians will now, on Saturday, re-enact their actions, and convene again for the no-confidence motion vote. However, it will not all be \u201cdeja vu\u201d, as the Speaker has been ordered by the court on how to proceed: by holding the no-confidence vote and then an adjournment only if Mr. Khan is able to win the vote. If he loses, as is likely, the session can be adjourned after a new Prime Minister is voted in. The Supreme Court has also ended Mr. Khan\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d. After it became clear that the combined Opposition, including members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, and many of his coalition partners, had the numbers to instal Pakistan Muslim League (N) chief Shehbaz Sharif in his place, he raised the \u201cforeign conspiracy\u201d bogey. He ensured the confidence vote was cancelled, and before the Opposition could gather its thoughts, raced through his resignation and recommendation to President Alvi for fresh elections. The pace and purpose of the actions of the former cricket captain were to ensure that none of the decisions could be reversed, and willy-nilly, the country would be pushed into elections a year earlier than when the Assembly\u2019s tenure ends.It is clear that Mr. Khan overestimated his ability to manage the denouement of the drama played out this week. He has also made some formidable opponents apart from the political Opposition, including Pakistan\u2019s all-powerful military establishment, which he has openly challenged, the U.S., which has consistently avoided engaging with him, and which he has named for \u201cthreatening\u201d him, and the judiciary itself, which his cabinet colleagues have accused of carrying out a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d against him. While Saturday\u2019s events may finally draw the curtains on the political thriller and usher in a new government, the final verdict on Mr. Khan\u2019s seemingly reckless and unprecedented actions will probably only be sounded when the country next goes to the polls. If Mr. Khan is voted out, he will strengthen and reinforce the precedent in one respect: no Pakistani Prime Minister since 1947 has yet completed the full five-year term of the National Assembly in office.",

        "full_article": "The suspension of Russia from the UN Human Rights Council has turned the global spotlight on the civilian killings in Ukraine. The U.S.-sponsored resolution in the UN General Assembly was approved by 93 votes against 24, with 58 abstentions that included India. Russia has faced immense criticism after bodies were found in the streets of Bucha, a northern Ukrainian town, from where Russian troops withdrew following the Istanbul talks. Russia claims it to be \u201cstaged events and fakes\u201d. While the truth should be established in an independent UN-monitored probe, there is no doubt that civilians were targeted. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 1,611 civilians have been killed and 2,227 injured in Ukraine since the war began. Russia cannot evade its responsibility for these losses. When Russia began the invasion, President Vladimir Putin had said the main objectives of what he called the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d were the \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d of Ukraine. Considering the three-front war Russia launched, it was evident that Moscow wanted to meet its real objectives \u2014 whatever they were \u2014 quickly. But Ukraine\u2019s fierce resistance, especially in the north, has changed the course of the conflict, which now looks like a war of attrition, focusing on Ukraine\u2019s east.Now, both Ukraine and Russia are in difficult situations. The Ukrainians, with military and financial aid from the West, have pushed back in the north, but lost territories in the east and the south. Given the power imbalance, it is unlikely that Ukraine can regain the lost territories. Russia now seems to have been bogged down in the battlefield, with international criticism mounting on its war conduct. What is in the best interest of all parties is a cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic solution. The Istanbul talks had opened a path towards peace. According to the Ukrainian proposals, President Zelensky has agreed to accept neutrality in return for multilateral security assurances. He is also ready for a consultation period of 15 years for Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and discuss the status of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics in a summit with Mr. Putin. It was after these proposals that the Russians announced their pull back from the north. But the Bucha killings appear to have clouded the peace process. The investigation into the civilian killings should go on in parallel and not derail the diplomatic process. Russia should follow up on its words with more demonstrable actions to end the hostilities. The war has damaged its economy and its reputation as a great power, while causing unspeakable losses and destruction in Ukraine. The most important message from the UN body to Moscow is that it should cease the fire and take the path of diplomacy immediately.",

        "full_article": "The draft Mass Media Employees (Services Conditions) Bill, placed in parliament on April 1, 2022, is a long-overdue initiative. Its stated objective and scope include relations between media employers and employees as well as dispute resolution, terms of employment including minimum salary, and legal protection of employees including work environment.\nThe draft contains a series of provisions intended to address some longstanding concerns of media professionals and stakeholders. For instance, the provisions for mandatory issuance of appointment letter, photo ID, and service book, fixation of minimum salary, benefits for in-service death, retirement, retrenchment, termination and dismissal, paid maternity leave, contributory provident fund (CPF), sick leave, rest and recreation leave, medical allowance, employees welfare association (EWA), etc.\u2014all are steps in the right direction. In many cases, however, there is scope for modifications so it can serve the objective better.\nOn the other hand, there are numerous seemingly discriminatory provisions that need closer scrutiny. The draft provides a minimum of 48 hours of work a week, whereas in other comparable countries, like India, it is no more than 144 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks. The provision for overtime has been made without specifying any limit or the basis of calculation of overtime payment. A Trustee Board of CPF will be formed with an equal number of representatives from employers and employees, whereas governance and management of such funds should be exclusively within the jurisdiction of employees.\nThe bill provides that a woman-friendly work environment shall be created, but it is left for the rules to be framed to determine how it will be ensured. It does not make any provision to ensure that work conditions, including salaries and benefits, are not discriminatory depending on gender, social, religious, ethnic, disability or any other marker of identity.\nThe retrenchment provision on the ground of excess staff can be arbitrarily used in the absence of specific criteria determining the credibility of said ground. The provision for dismissal on the ground of physical or mental infirmity based on a registered doctor's certificate can also be misused in the absence of a provision for veracity check. In case of termination of contract, no scope has been made for due process including right of self-defence.\nOwners and employees\u2014\"we\" vs \"they\"\nA blanket provision has been made that 10 or more employees can be wholesale terminated to maintain \"overall security and peace and order\", which can be widely and variedly interpreted. This may have a demoralising and intimidating effect on employees and may render the EWA practically dysfunctional.\nA key stated objective of the bill is to manage the relationship between \"mass media owners\" (malik) and employees and redress conflict between the two sides. The term malik represents an outdated and counterproductive \"we versus they\" approach to the relationship between employers and employees which breeds a mutual threat perception\u2014whereas, corporate good practice features a \"spirit of ownership\" mainstreamed across an organisation including employees of all levels and employers/investors. The bill can play a catalytic role in this mindset shift, and change the narrative accordingly.\nRisk of further government control\nThe draft represents an underlying agenda for legalising unwarranted governmental and administrative control of the mass media. The government has near-exclusive jurisdiction over the formation and composition of the Wage Board. International good practice shows wage boards composed of an equal number of representatives from employers and employees as well as a few independent individuals, whereas the draft bill provides only one employers' representative, three from employees, and two government officials. Moreover, all appointments including representatives of employers and employees and the unspecified number of additional members are left to the government's discretion.\nThe question is why the wage board of a private-sector industry like the media should be so much under government control, unless the underlying purpose is to ensure stricter and more targeted control of the media. While the draft obliges employers to pay at wage board rates, it does not make any provision for actions to be taken for non-compliance. This is important against a track record that only about a dozen out of the 150-plus media houses comply, and no action is taken for non-compliance. Unless rigorously enforced, the vast majority of the employees will continue to be deprived, while the non-compliant entities will carry on enjoying undue benefits of non-compliance protected by the inaction of the authorities, and the compliant ones will be further disadvantaged.\u00a0\nFor dispute resolution, an unwarranted idea of government-appointed Mass Media Court and Appeal Court has been invented, which appears to represent a design to further strangulate the media. Even for dispute resolution through bilateral negotiations, an unwarranted provision has been made to \"report to the government\". These are incompatible with international standards. The most relevant good practice is to repose this responsibility in the wage board like the usual industrial dispute investigation and settlement\u2014provided, of course, that the wage board is truly independent. In exceptional situations, if appeal becomes unavoidable, a Tribunal consisting of a judge of the High Court or above may be provided for.\nWork environment and legal protection\nAnother crucial objective of the bill\u2014to ensure a conducive work environment and legal protection of media professionals\u2014has been left totally untouched. Given that the media is expected to play a watchdog role for democracy and people's right to information, the employers and the government should consider any threat to the working conditions, security and safety of the employees as a threat to themselves. Accordingly, there should be specific provisions for a safe and enabling environment for the employees' professional work, including protection mechanisms and protocols to prevent and address risks such as surveillance, intimidation, attacks, arbitrary arrests, etc.\nThe bill should provide that media employees, particularly journalists, will have unrestricted access to all sources of information and the right to investigate as needed, and without impediment, as part of their professional duties.\nThe draft bill needs to be thoroughly overhauled so that it fits its stated purposes. It should be done through a participatory process involving media employees of various categories, employers, editors, media specialists and other stakeholders. The parliamentary committee has the jurisdiction and responsibility to take the lead. The media employers and employees should take their own initiatives proactively. Any failure to do so will be self-defeating.\n\u00a0\nDr Iftekharuzzaman\u00a0is Executive Director, Transparency International Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "When the troops were being pulled out from Afghanistan, I was thinking where the next theatre of war would be. Ukraine was the last spot on my mind. It was also not in the high alert list of the Council of Foreign Relations, which regularly tracks these types of conflicts.\nTwo Slavic nations with close cultural ties are in conflict\u2014brothers fighting brothers. The horrors of war are difficult to take. Deaths and destructions are piling up with no end in sight. The Western backing has given a new meaning to the war. It has turned out to be a contest between Russia and the West on Ukrainian soil.\nRussia will not be able to continue a protracted war with economic sanctions and political isolation. It did not face anything like this in Chechnya or Georgia. The war has pushed Russia to a corner. It is an existential threat for the nuclear superpower. Can this lead to World War III? We will not be alive to confirm.\nWearing olive green shirt, the media savvy Ukrainian president is on the charm offensive. On April 5, 2022, he addressed the United Nations Security Council. In the Western media, he is being portrayed as a hero championing freedom. However, winning the media is different from winning the war.\nThe UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council, \"The war in Ukraine must stop\u2014now.\" It is \"one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order\u2026 We need serious negotiations for peace, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.\"\nNegotiations are taking place in Turkey. Both parties are evaluating the conditions on the ground and speculations about victory. So far, we have not seen any positive outcome. The world should strongly support Turkey's President Erdogan's peace initiative. Pressure must be put on both parties to come to a settlement.\nRussia is surrounded by many former Soviet Bloc countries who are now members of the European Union and Nato. Ukraine was just another nation that wanted to join this club. Why was it so different this time?\nThe answer lies in Crimea\u2014which Russia annexed in 2014. For strategic reasons, Soviet-era naval base and entry to the Black Sea were critical for Russia. It also wanted to see a friendly government in Ukraine. There was a possibility that after joining the military alliance, Ukraine could try to retake Crimea with Nato's support.\nGiven this, Putin had two bad choices: (i) fight Ukraine today; or (ii) fight Ukraine and Nato tomorrow. For him, fighting today was a better choice\u2014a pre-emptive military move that made him the aggressor.\nPlacing a nation on a \"war path\" for a \"membership\" does not indicate good leadership. It is not a good trade-off, especially when nearly half of the Ukrainians were opposed to joining this organisation. As a country, Thailand has not been invaded by any external power in 1,000 years. The comedian president could learn from the Kingdom.\nNow it is an old story to consider. The conditions on the ground have advanced very fast. Military and civilian causalities have overtaken the issue.\nSanctions are legitimate civil courses of actions against any nation that does not follow the international order. Ever since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, they have been used against belligerent countries.\nSanctions have mixed reactions. They weaken or embolden the leadership at home. Sufferings of the people increase but the regimes remain in power.\nNations are more permanent than their leaders. In the absence of Putin, Russia may inherit a leader who could be more hostile. Hitler came to power protesting against the strangulation of Germany stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles\u2014the rest is history.\nHistory repeats itself. In Bangla we say, \"ek maghe sheet jai na.\" The consequence of this war could be shockingly fatal.\nOn April 5, 2022, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in the Security Council that the conflict will increase the prices of food, energy and fertiliser affecting up to 1.2 billion people in 74 countries.\nHistorically, we have noticed that European conflicts have the potential to expand beyond the continent. Both World Wars started in Europe. America joined later. Rest of the world (some as colonies had no choice) were drawn into it against their will and have suffered miserably.\nNearly three million people died in the Bengal famine during World War II. The deceased people never heard the name of Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini, or Tojo.\nThe poor nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are facing political and economic pressure to side with the sparring parties. The people in these countries will be the unfortunate collaterals.\nBangladesh will be dealt a heavy economic blow if its access to the Western garments market is closed. Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, and Turkey buy 60 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Bangladesh should take preventive measures, if possible.\u00a0\nThe United Nations Secretary General is right. The war reveals one of the greatest challenges of the international order since World War II.\nUnipolar world is as bad as monopoly in economics. There is no force on the planet that can counter the diktat of the West and Nato combined. Both China and Russia have some deterrence, but they are distant rivals to the West's economic, social, and political might. The non-aligned nations do not have the political power to stop a war like this.\nWe should seriously consider restructuring (perestroika?) the global governance architecture. Discussion should include Security Council membership, political power-sharing, dollar-based trade regime, ethnolinguistic fractionalisation, religious tolerance, and global inequality.\nDuring the past 75 years, the economic and military landscape of the world has changed substantially. Restructuring the global governance architecture is likely to face serious challenges. Emerging nations should come forward to make a difference in global governance.\nIt is noticeable how the Ukraine war is being marketed to the American public. Below are my appeals to demarket the war.\u00a0\n1. Stand still and roll back: The moral justification of the current war is weak. It has the potential to prompt World War III. A prolonged war and stalemate benefit the war industry as the body count increases. The situation is not acceptable to our conscious. Let us stand still and roll back.\n2. Moral suasion: There is no better alternative than moral suasion. Academic, journalists, politicians, conscientious people, and social media\u2014all must come forward to play their role. Active opposition against war can change minds. For example, the death of four students at Kent State University (my Alma Mater) on May 4, 1970, literally stopped the Vietnam war.\n3. Responsible media: To portray someone as a hero and the other as a villain in any conflict does not help the peace process. De-escalation and negotiation should be the focus of the media. The media must play a constructive role. Positive discussions must follow this line of thought.\n4. Non-aligned leadership: Historically, leaders of the nonaligned nations have played a positive role in superpower conflicts. Lately, the movement has lost its impetus. The leaders of the emerging nations must take proactive measures to break the stalemate.\nOur hegemonic desire to control the world and its resources puts us in conflicts. As a consequence, the war industry thrives. President Eisenhower noted this in his Farewell Address to the nation on January 17, 1961.\n\"This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience\u2026 Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications\u2026 Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defence with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"\nAs a paradigm, demarketing war is likely to face natural opposition from the industry that benefits from war. Yet then peace efforts must continue.\n\u00a0\nDr Abu Waheeduzzaman\u00a0is a Professor of Marketing and International Business at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.\n",

        "full_article": "\"Is it a boy or a girl?\"\nFunny how this question often preempts concern about the health of mother and baby. Why are we so obsessed with a baby's gender? From the baby's earliest days, we seek to reinforce gender stereotypes that say nothing about the actual biological differences between males and females, but that burden the tiniest baby with expectations that can hamper its hope for a positive future. Adults constantly tell us what it means to be a boy or girl and ensure that we conform to gender stereotypes. But those stereotypes are not only annoying but genuinely harmful.\nWe tell girls to be gentle, soft, and to speak quietly. We encourage boys to be loud and aggressive, but not to cry. We teach girls that housework is their responsibility and boys to shun it as unmanly.\nAs children grow into youth, they often internalise these stereotyped gender roles, perhaps avoiding activities that they might otherwise enjoy or excel at. Boys who have been taught to suppress their feelings and to resolve disputes through violence may grow into abusive adults. Women bear full burden for household responsibilities even when they have a paid job, while fathers often have little connection with their children.\nI worry when I meet very gentle, soft-spoken women. Will they be able to defend themselves if they are in an abusive situation with a boss or husband? If they have good ideas, will they be able to express themselves firmly and confidently enough that others will pay attention, rather than simply talk over them? I also worry when boys cannot express their emotions or know no way of resolving conflict other than yelling and lashing out.\nOne young woman I met is one of a family of girls. Her father, desperate for a boy, gave her a boy's name, and for many years she was encouraged to behave in stereotypically masculine ways. But then when she reached late adolescence, her family attempted to rein in those tendencies and push her to be a conventional girl. Why does she wear her hair short? Why is she so assertive? Rather than celebrate and encourage her, her family tries to mould her into something different, something alien to her essence. She is a continual disappointment to her family both for not being a boy and for not being sufficiently feminine.\nI see it too in the struggles of some children. Boys who wish to play at girls' games, or who are gentle. Girls who want to play sports or have learned to be assertive (which, when girls do it, is known as being aggressive). Can a young woman wear her hair long and pursue a degree in engineering? Can a young man love dance and be attracted to girls? The constant pulls to fit the societally constructed roles for females and males can be exhausting and degrading. What about letting people just be who they are?\nPart of what makes our world so interesting is the great variety in human behaviour. People do not always conform to expectations. They splash out in new fields and new ways, setting new trends or simply joyously or stubbornly rebelling against the norms. They expand the meaning of being male or female, or even of being human. How boring the world would be if we all just mindlessly did as we are told and never challenged authority!\nAlso, with so many problems that we need to address\u2014heck, just flip through the pages of today's newspaper and you'll see an almost endless array\u2014why are we wasting time with trying to force people to be what they're not? Surely people would have more creativity and energy to do good in the world if they were not spending so much time and effort trying to fit themselves into a mould.\nIt can be hard to accept the ways in which we contribute to the furthering of harmful gender stereotypes. Perhaps it is time to engage in some introspection: how often do we encourage young girls to be pretty and gentle, and boys to be aggressive? Could we do better by the young people around us? Sometimes it only takes one or two people encouraging a child or youth to be comfortable and confident as they are, regardless of whether they are male or female, for the young person to bloom. And if enough of us fight against gender stereotypes, real change is possible.\n\u00a0\nDebra Efroymson\u00a0is Executive Director of the Institute of Wellbeing.\n",

        "full_article": "When a private university organised a flash mob and another one a concert to welcome back its students to campus post Covid shutdown, we looked at the safety protocol prepared for our campus in pity. Our peers did not want to miss out on a branding opportunity. However, is it normal to announce the return to normalcy with such a great gathering? Or is it a sign of complacency that belies the strict measures we took earlier? Certainly, the Covid vaccine as well as the flattening of the infection curve has given us some comfort in restoring the semblance of normal life. The rise of the XE variant in the UK and the extended lockdown in Shanghai tell us of a different reality that is far from normal, though.\nThe word \"normal\" is deceptively simple; once you probe into the concept, its meaning starts to disintegrate. The word insists on conforming to certain norms that have been socially agreed upon or endorsed by an established agency. It is normal to breathe without a mask, but because of the Covid-19 health rules, we have agreed to make mask-wearing normal. In this case, normal has a functional aspect. The group endorsement comes when the majority agrees to a norm. The meaning of normal, thus, becomes statistical.\nAfter nearly two years of closures, we have returned to campus. For many students, this is the first time they are in a physical classroom, and find it difficult to adjust. This term, when most of the students fared poorly in their first quiz in my class, I tried to find out the reasons. The answer came as a shock. They have got used to class recordings, which they could repeatedly play to follow a lecture. Some said they were finding it difficult to read my lips with my mask on. Then there is the issue of retention. They have forgotten most of the things they did in the previous terms. The instant projects and assignments, done digitally, have earned them grades, but little learning. In the online classrooms, the teachers created a virtual sense of community with customised accessibility for students. Even at an administrative level, we asked our colleagues to modify their course delivery and rethink student assessments. We were concerned about the way the students would have to adjust to the functional normality of online teaching. We were compassionate in accommodating requests based on \"unstable internet services\" or \"casualty in the family.\" Are these \"additional perks\" (i.e. auto-promotion and curtailed syllabus being the height) going to be the aspirational normal for our returning students?\nDuring the mid-term examinations, we received quite a few applications to be excused on various flimsy grounds. My colleagues confirm that there is a genuine fear among students to be in a physical examination hall. If I take my classroom experience as a case study, my choice to ramp up course difficulty indicates a rocky transition that awaits us. We need clear guidance from the education ministry and the University Grants Commission (UGC) on how they perceive teaching in a post-pandemic scenario. We need to be on the same page, as we are dealing with students who have both a relaxed and challenging exposure to education. Earlier, it took the policymakers more than a year to adopt a guiding policy for online teaching. Judging from newspaper reports, their current focus is on micromanaging institutions. The transition back to in-person learning should be the topmost priority for our education leaders, and the sooner they realise this, the better for us.\nUntil now, we have heard of some lip service on blended learning as the new normal. Does it mean that our universities will be allowed to retain some of the online teaching practices? Will our teachers be comfortable recording their lectures or creating videos for their students to learn on their own time, without coming to campus? Can the teachers be allowed to use online assessment tools and discussion forums? Can the institutions pursue collaboration with national and international institutions to foster a greater sense of academic community? Can we have the lectures of renowned educators curated by the UGC or the education board for licensed distribution among their member institutions? Sadly, the policymakers divest their energy in protecting the financial and political interests of academic institutions. Mega constructions attract mega attention, making the vice-chancellors susceptible to vice. In the process, we often fail to ignore the basics: teaching and learning.\nAs a teacher, I can see some of the things that we have lost or compromised on in the last two years. Handwriting and spelling, for instance. Students no longer have the luxury of typing with the aid of a spell-checker. The output, therefore, is horrendous. These exemplify the new challenges in the post-Covid era. Our topmost priority should be determining what our students have learnt during the pandemic. Then, we need to decide whether we need to modify courses to ensure that they can successfully ease into or complete their postsecondary degrees. An analysis of the data found in the admission tests can be used to identify the gaps in their knowledge. We need to have a clear picture of the impact of the light content of \"Covid-19 curriculum\" and the additional support services offered in the last two years.\nThe immediate challenge for us is to get students back to pre-Covid \"functional normal\" standards. We need to have a proper policy in place to help our students learn or re-learn. We need to guide them in recalibrating their learning strategies by, for instance, memorising facts or formulas, which are normal at their level. The nature of anxieties and fear, too, has changed. Institutions need additional psychosocial services to cater to the new anxieties of our students to navigate through this transition process.\nAbove all, we need to learn to collaborate and share our experiences, so that we can prepare for these challenges together. There should be more intra- and inter-institutional dialogues, so that we are better prepared to welcome our students back to campuses, both physically and emotionally.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "The Russia-Ukraine war has already resulted in an abnormal escalation in global food prices, especially of staple grains and vegetable oils, which the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has confirmed as being all-time high. The UN now fears the risk of a global hunger crisis.\nThe conflict has sent prices of oil, gas and some other essential commodities spiralling out of control across the world, including in Bangladesh, causing inflation to rise further globally. The invasion has hugely disrupted the seasonal agricultural activities, production and shipment of food grains from the region as their ports remain closed since war broke out. Global food commodity prices went up by 12.6 percent in March to reach the highest levels ever because of the war. How high it will climb further if the war does not end any time soon is a question now worrying the experts. As Russia and Ukraine together account for around 30 percent and 20 percent of global wheat and maize exports respectively, it is doubly important that ports are given permission to operate and ships allowed to carry food grains on humanitarian grounds.\nIn an attempt to contain the situation, the Ukrainian authorities approached the European Union to provide aid to its farmers, and the European Commission has been asked to coordinate the delivery of fuel, seeds, fertilisers and agricultural machines to the country. Interestingly, in response to the rising global price of essential commodities because of the invasion of Ukraine and the imperative of export of food items, President Putin said his country would act prudently with supplies abroad, but monitor such exports to countries that are clearly hostile towards Russia.\nAt this stage, the possibility of famine must not be taken lightly by the world leaders, especially the Russian leadership. Hunger is conspicuously prevalent in many parts of the world where people are engaged in battles for survival on a daily basis, despite the spectre of climate catastrophe, flash-floods and drought hanging over their heads. In the food-deficient areas, people are breaking their backs to arrange for some decent meals for their family members, therefore, the new crisis is a burden that may prove too much for them. Russia being a superpower should cooperate with the world community in preventing the global food crisis going from bad to worse. Other world leaders should also step up and take measures to prevent such a terrifying scenario.\n",

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has made a timely call to our development partners to work together and increase their contributions including vaccine supplies to Covax Advance Market Commitment (AMC) so that all countries can reach their vaccination targets. She said that Covid vaccines should be considered a global public good and the international community should give special attention and support to countries that are still lagging behind in achieving their targets. The PM also expressed her will to work with GAVI and Covax AMC to ensure vaccine equity.\nWhile the World Health Organization has set a target to vaccinate 70 percent of the global population with double dose by mid-2022, there are still many countries who are far from reaching this milestone. Comparatively, Bangladesh's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has been quite successful. So far, we've vaccinated 75.25 percent of the population with one vaccine dose and 67.37 percent with two doses, while 9.10 percent of eligible individuals have already got a third dose (as of April 6).\nSince the government started its vaccination campaign in February 2021, it faced some major hurdles due to unavailability of vaccines and consequent disruptions in the drive. However, despite initial struggles, it recovered from the challenges by procuring vaccines from several sources. Apart from the regular campaign, the government also conducted some special drives to bring the majority of eligible individuals under its vaccination coverage. Bangladesh may be the only country in the world that has administered one crore doses of vaccines in a single day. The government's achievement in this regard is quite praiseworthy, and our longstanding partnership with GAVI Alliance and Covax has played a crucial role in this. Moreover, our vaccine cold chain was pretty efficient while the general people have also been quite enthusiastic about getting the jabs.\nHowever, countries that are still falling behind the WHO-set inoculation target must be assisted by the international community. If the able nations increase their contributions to the Covax and GAVI, those in need of vaccines can really benefit from it. We think Bangladesh can also work with the international vaccine alliances and play its part to ensure vaccine equity, as our prime minister has said. Bangladesh has already become a role model in Covid-19 vaccination and can definitely assist other countries with its knowledge and skills to run largescale vaccination campaigns. It can also produce vaccines with assistance from the international community which will surely help fight the pandemic on a global scale.\nIn simple words, only greater international cooperation and collaboration can help all nations reach their inoculation targets, thereby defeating the pandemic together.\n",
