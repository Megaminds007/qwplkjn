Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, arguably the most popular politician, has been in jail since May 2023, facing multiple cases and serving convictions. His party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was barred from using its symbol on the ballot paper, forcing it to field independent candidates. Many of its leaders were also in jail or on the run, while others were forced to quit politics or defect to another party. What Pakistan saw in the run-up to the elections was a systematic effort by powerful quarters to dismantle Mr. Khan\u2019s political vehicle. Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) leader Nawaz Sharif, once the nemesis of the army, who returned from exile in London, led his party\u2019s campaign with the establishment\u2019s blessings. But if the generals thought these measures would destroy the PTI\u2019s political leverage and catapult their favourites to power, they were proven wrong by voters. Independents won 101 of the 265 seats (93 went to PTI-linked candidates), the PML-N secured 75 seats while the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) won 54, and the Karachi-based Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan took 17. To form a government, 134 seats are needed.This does not mean that the PTI, whose independent candidates form the largest bloc, would be able to form the next government. When it was evident that no bloc had an absolute majority, Nawaz Sharif called on every party, barring the PTI, to form a unity government. With Army Chief Gen. Asim Munir backing Mr. Sharif\u2019s call, what followed was an in-principle agreement between the PML-N and the PPP \u201cto work together for political stability\u201d. All these developments point to political manoeuvring aimed at stitching together a unity government that will keep the PTI and Mr. Khan out of power. The independents could also come under pressure to switch to the coalition parties. The PTI, which has already alleged electoral irregularities, has called for street protests, triggering memories of the widespread clashes in May 2023 after Mr. Khan\u2019s arrest. The military may have wanted to turn the page of Mr. Khan\u2019s challenge and create a new political reality through the electoral process, but the results have underscored his popularity and public anger towards the establishment. For a long-term solution, the generals should make peace with Mr. Khan and allow the spirit of the results to prevail \u2014 an unlikely outcome. As political parties that finished second and third are moving ahead with their plans with blessings from the establishment, public discontent and distrust would remain the unresolved issues. With the PTI\u2019s challenge from the streets, Pakistan could face another cycle of instability and chaos.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nvoting",

More often than not, those responsible for such unseemly controversies overshadowing the solemn occasion are the incumbents in Raj Bhavan. In the latest instance, Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi has expressed his inability to read out the address prepared by the DMK-run government, citing what he termed \u201cmisleading claims and facts\u201d in numerous passages. Reading them out, he claimed, would have made the Governor\u2019s address \u201ca constitutional travesty\u201d. Compounding this constitutional mischief with a partisan claim, he sought to make much of the fact that the national anthem is played only at the end of the address and not at the beginning also. Anyone who understands the Governor\u2019s role in a parliamentary democracy will know that it is the one declining to read out the address prepared by an elected government who reduces the address to a travesty. Governments are run by parties that contest elections on a political platform, and it is only to be expected that they would seek to trumpet their achievements, real or exaggerated, in policy statements. It is the role of the political opposition and the people to judge the content of the address, and not that of the Governor.A simple test to ascertain the tenability of Mr. Ravi\u2019s claim that he declined to read out the customary address on factual and moral grounds is to raise the question whether either the President or a Governor in a Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled State would ever do so. He did not spell out what exactly the misleading or factually wrong points were, but it is not constitutionally sustainable to claim that the Governor\u2019s address should contain no criticism of the Centre or make no policy pronouncements against the Centre\u2019s policies. However, his point that the Speaker should not have launched a tirade against him after reading out the Tamil version of the Governor\u2019s prepared speech is justified. Such conduct by constitutional functionaries detract from the Assembly\u2019s dignity. The larger issue is still the propensity of Governors to act as political agents of the ruling party at the Centre. It is an unfortunate feature of India\u2019s constitutional system that the country is never short of grey eminences eager to occupy gubernatorial office, but once appointed, they are equally eager to enter the political thicket. It is as if they believe that their duty is to obstruct and undermine State governments run by political adversaries. The real travesty is not in a formal address containing questionable claims, but in a Governor who disagrees profoundly with its policy while remaining in office.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nGovernor\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nTamil\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\npolitics",

        "full_article": "In his speech at the launching ceremony of the fifth edition of the Banking Almanac held at the National Press Club on Saturday, eminent economist Wahiduddin Mahmud made quite a few critical observations on the much hyped banking reform and the recipes the multilateral lenders such as the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggest for Bangladesh. By banking reform he was referring to the roadmap of banking reform the Bangladesh Bank (BB) unveiled last week. Although the roadmap has as many as 17 key issues for the authorities to decide action plans, they can broadly be encapsulated to five. These are reduction of defaulted loans, prevention of anonymous loans and fraudulent activities, developing mechanism for appointment of competent directors, appointment of qualified independent directors and merger of weaker banks with stronger ones. Referring to his involvement with two bank reform commissions earlier, Dr Mahmud made it amply clear that banking rules and regulations of international order were formulated and had those been included in the Banking Company (amendment) Act, there would be no need for the roadmap. The action plans are mere words instead of strong measures. As for the guidelines put forward now cannot control the damage but may stem future rot. An analysis of the fault lines responsible for rendering the tougher rules and regulations inoperative is essential. Dr Mahmud's example of removal of 70 directors from bank boards, compelling some to repay loans and others opt for voluntary resignation in 2003 due to action by the BB and judiciary serves as a pointer. The question is why such tough measures were not followed up subsequently; rather banking regulations were rendered inoperative or made further relaxed to the advantage of motivated loan defaulters. Their undue influence not only stalled the inclusion of those rules and regulations in the Banking Company Act, but also helped establish their family monopoly in banking business by just purchase of shares of several banks. How the rules and regulations were systematically tinkered with in the interest of certain coteries is clear from former BB governor Saleh Uddin Ahmed's reference to the advantageous manoeuvring by those involved and the authorities' submission to it. During his time, there was no provision for more than two family members on the board of a bank and their tenure was for three years. The number of family members was raised to four and the tenure to six years and lately nine years. Monopoly at its outrageous! The rescheduling policy that went from 10 per cent of the outstanding loans to 20 per cent and then to 30 per cent has now been slashed to just 2.0 per cent. Similarly, the scheduled time for writing off bad loans has been brought to two years from three years. All these are done purposefully to allow defaulters a leeway and give the balance sheet a fresh and clean look. But in the process loans amounting to billions of taka is gobbled up by the loan sharks. Clearly, the banking conundrum is there for all to see but the areas requiring urgent attention have been ignored. The roadmap has bypassed the reconstructive surgery in favour of a cosmetic one. Dr. Mahmud stressed the need for inclusion of the written off bad loans in the Banking Almanac in the interest of receiving an authentic picture of the banking sector. His doubt that the merger theory will fall flat seems to be well founded. Why should healthy private banks accept liabilities of a sick one? Incorporation may be the right word in case the sick one is taken over on its asset value. If the national interests are given preference to coterie interests, the problem, however daunting it may look, can be solved.",

        "full_article": "The media report quoted below says it all. \"By the end of 2022 Bangladesh had nearly 800,000 unemployed university graduates, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). This unemployment rate was 12 per cent (tertiary), highest among all levels of education, according to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2022 published on Wednesday. The unemployment rate among higher educated people was 11.2 per cent in the previous LFS in 2016-17, which shows that joblessness rate among educated youth is growing,\" says a report published in national English daily.The data above makes it obvious that the disconnect between education and employment is real and growing. It has been growing for long and not much has been done and maybe not much can be done. But of course we keep on complaining without facing reality. Every year there is a lot of weeping and lamenting around this issue and shusils complain about the mess society is in and how terrible it is that the formal sector employment of graduates, the ultimate elite of society, is in the dumps. This is usually followed by the talk shows and media columns which end up in nothing and next year of course the rate goes higher. And the ritual is repeated. It would seem that we like to lament the inevitable. While in many columns and speeches this takes on ranting colours, a simple fact points to the actual nature of the problem, the failure of the formal sector in what is increasingly being described as an \"informal state\" . The media report says, \"according to the survey, the unemployment rate was low among persons with low or no education, but the rate of joblessness increased in line with the rise in education level.\" In other words, the problem is with the production of the wrong kind of graduates, not rising unemployment. They just don't qualify for jobs and the quality of their education is not only inadequate but it's wildly unfit for participating in the labour market.Given that surmise it should not be shocking that unemployment was 8.87 per cent in 2022 for those with higher secondary and 2.82 per cent with those with secondary education. The number would be 8 lakhs without jobs. But essentially it's a narrative of failure and although the reason stares at everyone's face, no one wants to deal with it. Economist Rizwanul Islam, has basically asked if graduate education is useful since it doesn't qualify them for jobs. Clearly the labour market and the education system is out of sync. So why should investment in the education sector be justified? The gap is simple. The kind of education that is offered doesn't have market demand and only a single stream general education is useless when the market needs vocational education. Thus those who graduate are almost buying a ticket to unemployment. If everyone knows this, why does it gone on. The answer is probably cultural and may widely be described as \"shushilsm\". This drives the educated middle class and is the source of both our cultural and educational policies. For example, the female unemployment rate in rural areas fell drastically from 26.1 per cent in FY17 to 18.66 per cent in 2022. \"It indicates that rural women have participated in the workforce thanks to the presence of NGOs and other organizations,\" BIDS supremo Binayak Sen has said. The period from 1947 to 1971 was the golden era of this class as their size was small but their impact was higher. The Ekushe events propelled them to the centre stage and they thought that this position was permanent and the situation would remain the same. It was basically a socially conservative education concept -though many policy makers and thought leaders saw themselves as politically radical- that considered general education as the ultimate goal for all. Learning for employment was looked down upon and this has filtered into many policy levels creating a system which looks down on economic professions and ennobles white collar desk jobs be it that of an amla or a teacher or even a clerk. However, the economics has shifted and in fact had long before, creating a backlog of suicidal decisions which refused to accept the need for a proper curriculum that serves economic activities. In many ways it is rooted in colonial culture where general education and the legal profession, producing collaborators and acting as intermediaries for the Crown was considered the noblest activity driving education. A good leftover example is the trashing of businessmen as MPs but acceptance of the political \"middlemen\" as a profession. Any market based activity is considered negative.And that is what lies at the root of the useless education system. Most, perhaps as high as in Bangladesh, 80 plus members of the labour force are in the informal sector. They include wage labourers, self-employed persons, unpaid family labour, piece-rate workers etc. While they are a single cluster including both skilled and unskilled, the performance of the skilled workers is very positive. The biggest chunk of skilled workers is of course the migrant workers which are anywhere between 20-25 million and way better paid than all other workers. Their role in the economy has been the most remunerative and it's an entirely skill driven informal sector. The other sector is digital freelancing which includes many graduates. Not only doesn't Bangladesh need graduates, many graduates don't need Bangladesh either as migration becomes increasingly a jump into employment in various other more practical economies. While the formal sector is down, the informal flourishes when it comes to connecting education to the economy.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It is about a week short of three months that the Iran-backed Houthi fighters of Yemen, the Ansar Allah, started to block movement of commercial ships in the Red Sea. How has the global maritime trade been faring since? Reports say 8.8 million barrels of oil and petroleum products per day, which is about 12 per cent of the world's maritime oil trade, transited through Egypt's Suez Canal during the first half of 2023. And it is through the Red Sea after crossing the choke point of Bab el-Mandeb Strait-a channel 20 miles across with a small rocky island off the southwest coast of Yemen dividing it-that any ship can reach Suez Canal on its way to the Mediterranean Sea. But now the strait is being guarded by the Houthi rebels who won't allow any commercial vessel to pass through if it is bound for Israel or suspected of carrying any merchandise for Israel. Obviously, the world powers, especially the US who along with the UK, in order to safeguard 'freedom of navigation' has been carrying out air strikes against Houthi military installations to destroy Houthi power. But so far the joint US-UK military campaign against the Houthis does not seem to have worked as expected. Rather it made matters worse.The free flow of merchant traffic through the Red Sea has not been ensured. As a result, most of the container ships that previously used the Red Sea route are now rerouting via the Cape of Good Hope. And it has increased the transport cost per ship by USD 1 million, according to CNN. Now, consider that from 10 to 15 per cent of the world's trade is carried out through this maritime route. And much of the trade is energy-related. However, Houthis have not so far hit any oil-carrying ship. That may be due to the fact that most of the oil tankers carry oil from the Gulf countries who are Arabs like the Houthis. But that is cold comfort for many major oil traders. For instance, the giants in this field like the British Petroleum (BP), Shell plc and the world's largest commodity shipper, Trafigura of Singapore, have stopped using the Red Sea route.Notwithstanding the colossal loss suffered by the maritime trade, thanks to the Red Sea stalemate, many are trying to find solace by comparing present situation with what used to be during the Covid-19 pandemic. But this is a wrong type of comparison. Because pandemic-inflicted disruption of supply chain was beyond human control. But the present crisis of the maritime trade caused by the Houthis is not. Maersk, a Danish shipping and logistics behemoth, warned that supply chain disruption on such a scale may continue for a year. That means there is no immediate solution to the Red Sea crisis in sight despite the action being taken by the US and its allies against Houthis. But the US ought to know better than to resolve a crisis of this kind through war.The condition that the Houthis placed to allow commercial vessels through the Red Sea was to stop the ongoing genocidal war against the civilian population in the Gaza strip of Palestine. And it is not just the Houthis, the entire world wants it. So, had the US, without whose support Israel cannot continue this war for a day, willed, the ongoing madness in Gaza would stop forthwith. And that is the road to peace in the Red Sea. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Money laundering poses a significant obstacle to the economic development of Bangladesh. Major methods of money laundering include over and under-invoicing, hundi, and currency exchange. Various initiatives have been implemented to mitigate the prevalence of hundi, such as offering incentives to encourage the use of formal banking channels for foreign currency transactions. However, the effectiveness of bringing in remittance through banking channels has come under scrutiny following a recent incident. According to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), remittances in the form of cash and foreign currency brought into Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport by expatriate workers and air passengers are intended to be deposited in the national reserve through official banking channels. However, unscrupulous bankers exploit these funds for personal gain, diverting them into the black market where they are eventually laundered abroad, thereby undermining the country's economic stability.The ACC has identified and monitored such criminal activities originating from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, estimating that approximately TK 1 billion worth of foreign exchange is diverted away from the state reserve through this channel.Recently, the ACC secretary reported that a day-long operation was conducted at the airport, revealing a network of banks and currency exchangers involved in the illicit trade of foreign currency. These entities acquire foreign currency from inbound passengers using counterfeit or unsigned vouchers, but didn't register these transactions in their official accounts. Consequently, these funds are not included in the central reserve.Despite various efforts to curb money laundering, it remains pervasive. According to a 2021 report by the United States-based organisation Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a staggering Tk. 4,617.45 billion has been smuggled out of the country over the past six years, averaging Tk. 770 billion annually. New methods of money laundering continue to emerge, including the abuse of Mobile Financial Services (MFS) and digital banking platforms. Moreover, illegal online activities such as gambling, gaming, betting, forex trading, and cryptocurrency transactions are being used for money laundering purposes. Bangladeshi funds are also being stashed in offshore accounts and invested in real estate businesses abroad, as evidenced by numerous mentions of Bangladeshi money launderers in documents like the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, and Pandora Papers.Urgent and stringent measures are imperative to combat money laundering and ensure sustainable development. The ACC should intensify its operations, and other relevant agencies responsible for combating money laundering must enhance their proactive efforts to curb money laundering through various channels.\nFaruk MahmudStudent,Department of EnglishUniversity of Dhaka",
