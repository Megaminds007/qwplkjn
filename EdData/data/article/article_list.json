The resolution, which was discussed in a rare special emergency session and under the rubric of the \u201cUniting for Peace\u201d resolution invoked after decades, came as a result of an aborted resolution at the UN Security Council, which Russia, as a permanent member, had vetoed. While the UNGA resolution carries little teeth, it does represent a common stand taken by the international public commons, with 96 countries signing up as co-sponsors of the resolution. Russia rejected the outcome as a political vote that came of severe \u201cpressure\u201d from the U.S. and European countries that were the drivers of the resolution, but it seemed clear that it was isolated on the global stage. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria voted against the motion, and 35, including India, abstained. While the resolution also decried the Russian decision to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, representatives of member states made it clear that it was the relentless bombing of Ukrainian cities that they could not turn a blind eye to.\rIndia\u2019s abstention, not a surprise, disappointed many western countries that have been lobbying for a shift in the Indian position. In the past week, India has abstained from three votes (including two procedural ones) at the UNSC where it is an elected member, one at the UN Human Rights Council, and another at the IAEA on resolutions critical of Russia. In an explanation of vote (EOV), India\u2019s UN representative said that India is calling for dialogue, while officials say that India\u2019s abstention has given it room to play a role in diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine. In a sign of some discomfort with Russian actions, the EOV also dropped the earlier references to the \u201clegitimate security interests\u201d, and included language on respecting the \u201cterritorial sovereignty\u201d of members. India has also sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine although its vote of abstention indicates the Modi government still has many reasons not to vote against Russia, a strategic and defence partner that has stood by India. As the conflict continues, and the global community expresses its disapproval, however, India\u2019s desire to remain an \u201cabstentionist\u201d power is being called into question. The Government has also said that it needs to remain on good terms with both sides as its primary focus remains the safe exit of Indians from the conflict zone. While evacuating Indians is an important priority, it cannot be India\u2019s only focus in this crisis, given its aspirations for global leadership and the oft quoted motto of \u201cVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d. It may become necessary for India to engage more deeply with the conflict in Europe, which is now a global concern.",

        "full_article": "Numbers can often be hustled to tell many tales; but it is the story that is picked on the basis of the desire to do what is morally right that sets the course for meaningful action. The recent Lancet estimates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood, which put the number at over 19 lakh children orphaned as a result of COVID-19, has raised India\u2019s hackles. The Lancet study generated numbers based on modelling, and therefore only estimates and not actual numbers are available. Globally, it estimated that 52 lakh children had been rendered orphans by the pandemic. The study, in its original period, March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 was revised, with updates based on excess mortality and fertility data used to model increases in estimates of COVID-19- associated orphanhood between May 1 and October 31, 2021 for 21 countries. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents; or the death of one or both custodial grandparents. The authors claimed their findings showed that numbers of children orphaned by COVID-19 had almost doubled in six months compared with the data after the first 14 months of the pandemic. India has objected strongly to the estimate of 19 lakh, terming it as \u201csophisticated trickery intended to create panic among citizens\u201d. As per data collected by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and collated on the Bal Swaraj portal, the number of children orphaned during COVID-19 in India was far lower, at 1.53 lakh.\rWhile the study does include revised estimates for all the nations, the message that it seeks to convey is the absolute urgency with which governments must incorporate childcare into any COVID-19 management programme. The state should proactively draw such children into the umbrella of care to save them from numerous adversities \u2014 poverty, violence, destitution, and lack of access to education and health care. The Indian government, to its credit, announced a grand plan of support for children forced into orphanhood by COVID-19. Many States announced rehabilitation plans, including provisions for adoption, foster care, education and health care; some admittedly more progressive than others, but the momentum was certainly built up in the country. It is time to update the status of such programmes, and information on the number of cases where intervention has occurred, and where it is pending, must be put out in the public realm. Well begun is half done, but the Centre and the States must expand efforts. The Government would do well to allow interventions for children to be informed by a \u2018whole-life\u201d care paradigm, and fresh data from time to time, especially in a pandemic that is not only rapidly evolving, but by all accounts, is nowhere near ending.",

        "full_article": "In his first media briefing on February 28, 2022, the newly sworn-in Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal ticked almost all the right boxes. Speaking to the Election Commission (EC) press corps, he touched upon all the major issues raised. He pledged to work with honesty and sincerity to fulfil his constitutional duties to hold free and fair elections in Bangladesh. He invited all political parties, especially the opposition, to stay on the electoral trail and participate in the polls\u2014regardless of what happens\u2014for the sake of democracy. He talked about restoring public confidence in the voting process and the need for a consensus among political parties, assuring them of \"swift actions\" in case of any election-related complaints.\nAs first media briefings go, this was a pretty uplifting statement, rooted in a desire to signal a new beginning. The CEC struck a hopeful note about the future, but was cautious enough not to oversell it by pointing out the fault lines. He even made, earlier in the day, a meme-inducing comment about having only blood pressure, and no other pressure at all.\nDespite the positive vibe, however, one may be pardoned for having a sense of deja vu, and of stagnation, seeing how certain words and phrases have a way of coming back. We seem to be stuck in a time loop in which the same conversations keep happening. Imagine, for a second, travelling back to February 15, 2017, when KM Nurul Huda was sworn in as the chief of the 12th Election Commission. In his first public comment, he too talked about trust, neutrality and gaining the confidence of all political parties. He, too, promised to uphold their constitutional duties to deliver free and fair elections. Five years later, we all know how that ended.\nThis is not to cast aspersions on the new EC\u2014which deserves the benefit of doubt despite how it was formed\u2014or the CEC's sense of responsibility. But the repetitive nature of these conversations and promises is a sad commentary on how our present electoral system keeps throwing up the same problems over and over again. The disastrous tenures of the last two commissions should be enough to shake us into a new sobriety: the realisation that \"it's not really working.\"\nThis is where the need for a revolutionary EC comes up.\nLet me explain what I mean by that. I don't mean a large-scale revolution involving drastic changes\u2014in how we resolve the bigger issues of EC formation, election-time government, or the overall electoral exercise\u2014which, frankly, are beyond the scope of the present EC. What I mean is a personal, doable revolution on the part of the election commissioners\u2014by rejecting the laissez-faire approach of their predecessors, setting individual examples of honesty, and moving the needle on much-needed institutional reforms that they should undertake. In short, they will basically be doing their job. But since no one in their positions seemed to care before, it will have the revolutionary impact of challenging the status quo.\nRight now, the main task for the new commissioners is to restore public trust in the EC. There are at least three associated challenges: 1) Eliminating the reasons for the opposition's disinterest in engaging with the EC; 2) Ensuring that the ruling party will not interfere in its activities or the electoral process; and 3) Ensuring that the whole administration, not just election officials, remain impartial in discharging their duties.\nBut it's the EC's approach to these challenges that matters more now. As Albert Einstein famously said, \"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\"\nSo, what does it mean for the new commissioners to reject their predecessors' laissez-faire approach? For one, not allowing bureaucratic deadweight to drive them off their path. Most of the new commissioners are former bureaucrats. They have been used to working in a milieu that demands adherence to orders from upstairs, which needs to change now. A conscious decoupling from that habit would also mean breaking from the bureaucratic tradition of preferring norms to results.\nFor example, in engaging with the opposition parties, the bureaucratic way would be to invite them for dialogue. \"The BNP has already said they will not join elections,\" the new CEC commented. \"But can't we still sit with them? Invite them over for tea?\" Good point. But this merely ensures the continuation of the formality of dialogue; it doesn't promise results. The opposition parties will need more than verbal assurance to be convinced of this commission's sincerity. With all the laws, rules and constitutional provisions at their disposal, it may be tempting to hide behind legal mumbo jumbo to avoid difficult questions of representation and fairness. This is where a result-oriented commissioner would be different.\nWhat does it mean to set individual examples of honesty and integrity? For a commissioner, it means upholding the highest ethical and professional standards in all their conducts. It means taking a lesson from the distasteful allegations of financial anomalies raised against the last EC, or the allegations of lies, inaction, favouritism and not doing the bare minimum to uphold the sanctity of their office.\nAs for undertaking changes within their institutional mandates, there can be any number of them, and they will have to decide what best serves the democratic process. Among some of the unresolved issues that come to mind are the concerns over using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Or the demand for reforming the Representation of the People Order (RPO) to give EC field officials magisterial power to promptly deal with irregularities during national elections. (Traditionally, the roles of returning officers with magisterial power are given to deputy commissioners.) Or the debate about deploying the army to maintain law and order during elections. The EC can, undertake some decisive changes that will help calm frayed nerves and combat election-related irregularities. The question, in the end, is not \"if they have the power,\" but \"if they have the will.\"\nUnfortunately, the EC culture is built around following the letter, not the spirit, of the EC rules and laws. This, as we know from previous experience, rarely adds up to a spirit of reform and moving forward. Only a revolutionary mind, accountable only to the people, can rise to the occasion, change how things are done at the EC, and get us out of the present deadlock.\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is an Assistant Editor, The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "In a callback to its trigger-happy Soviet days, Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, blocking all avenues of dialogue and negotiation. In the eight days since, things have only escalated. Russia has already occupied the Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. They have attacked and/or captured sensitive installations, including military bases, airports, land ports, and the Chernobyl nuclear power station.\nAs per an estimate, more than 9,000 people have died so far, at least a million have become displaced, and massive destruction has swept over the Ukrainian soil. Russia's main goal now is to seize control of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as soon as possible.\nThis is Russia's deadliest and most sensitive military strike in two decades. The attack sparked a war of attrition between NATO member states and the former communist bloc. It is difficult to say where this war will end up. While the NATO superpowers\u2014that is, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany\u2014are currently refraining from military action, Russia is facing strict economic sanctions.\nConcerns over the severity of the attack on Ukraine are spreading all over the world. Per barrel oil prices have jumped from USD 70 to USD 110. Food prices are already rising. As a result of the Covid-19 crisis, the world economy was already in a state of turmoil. Although there are many concerns in my mind, the biggest one is the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.\nFifty-one percent of Ukraine's electricity comes from 15 running nuclear power plants. These are Russian Generation II plants that were built in the 1970s and lack fortification and safety features of the current Generation III+ plus reactors. Their safety system cannot last more than half an hour without electricity. Moreover, all these nuclear reactors are incapable of withstanding missile or bomber strikes. Cyber-attacks can also destroy the power system and data system of a power plant. This could lead to a catastrophic situation like Chernobyl if the power transmission line breaks down, or the power dependent emergency cooling system is not turned on in time.\nThe three major nuclear accidents that have occurred so far globally (Three Mile, Chernobyl and Fukushima) have all had contributions from the inefficiency or negligence of certain plant workers. Now, if the workers are mentally strained or worried about the security of their families and the country, then there is a good chance that a nuclear accident may happen. In the case of the nuclear industry, it is known to all that ensuring safety and security is largely dependent on human performances and reliability. The rest depends on equipment quality and reliability of the systems.\nAnother highly sensitive issue is nuclear security risks. Enriched material security at nuclear facilities is extremely fragile during times of war or political instability. As a result, domestic or regional terrorists may utilise this opportunity to hijack radioactive material in an attempt to make a dirty bomb, or even a nuclear weapon. Imagine the damage that could cause! None of us would be safe.\nOn the first day, Russia launched a military offensive in Ukraine, taking control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the Belarusian border, and taking its staff hostage. The Chernobyl site, though inactive, is still undergoing waste management at its four reactors, and Ukraine has set up a central waste management facility there to handle highly radioactive waste generated from the country's 15 nuclear power plants. According to international law, a nuclear power plant can never be the target of a military strike. If a nuclear power plant is hit mistakenly by a wayward missile or a bomber, the damage could be greater than all other devastations of the war combined. This will spread radioactivity in the neighbouring countries. Russia may not want to launch direct attacks on Ukraine's nuclear power plants and may instead take control of them. But this will result in Ukraine's defence system no longer working. Then, Ukraine will have nowhere to go.\nExperts and policymakers from the international community, including those from the International Atomic Energy Agency, are concerned about the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear power plants. In this scenario, both countries should be very alert and prudent. The irreparable damage from the Chernobyl or Fukushima nuclear accidents is still being borne by Ukraine and Japan, respectively. We don't want to witness war anymore. It is our expectation that responsible policymakers will act sincerely to protect future generations.\n\u00a0\nDr Md.

        "full_article": "In 2019, Taqsem A Khan, managing director of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), faced huge public outrage for saying that the water supplied by Wasa was 100 percent drinkable. He made the claim at a press conference arranged to refute a number of allegations raised against his organisation by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB). Taqsem said that the water Dhaka Wasa supplied to the city residents was good at the source, but that they might get contaminated in the pipelines, adding that they had undertaken projects to replace those pipelines. He then declared that people would be able to drink water straight from their taps by 2021.\nMore than two years later, a large part of Dhaka is still getting smelly, dirty and contaminated water. The water is not only unsafe to drink, but it's often completely unusable. Since Taqsem took charge of Dhaka Wasa 13 years ago, many projects have been initiated to improve Wasa's service, spending crores of taka, but the quality of its water at the consumer end has hardly improved, according to our reports.\nThe TIB did a year-long study titled \"Dhaka Wasa: Challenges of Good Governance and Way Forward,\" and revealed their findings in April 2019. They surveyed 2,728 connections and service recipients of Wasa and found that 91 percent of Dhaka's population had to boil water to drink it. In the process, they burnt gas worth Tk 332 crore a year.\nAccording to the study, nearly 45 percent of Dhaka Wasa consumers didn't get adequate supply of water, while about 35 percent complained of getting poor-quality water throughout the year. However, they did have to pay the increased water tariff every year. Reportedly, Dhaka Wasa has increased its water tariff 15 times since 2009. It has proposed to raise the water tariff by 20 percent again this year. If the proposal is approved, consumers will have to pay the increased price from July.\nNaturally, such a ruthless proposal made by a state-run organisation has been met with widespread criticism. People questioned the rationale behind such a proposal at a time when inflation has hit us hard. In fact, people have started to question the honesty and integrity of the Dhaka Wasa MD, who is drawing a hefty amount for a salary every month. According to news reports, as the water tariff increased year after year, so did the Wasa MD's salary. During the past two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the water tariff was raised twice, Taqsem's salary was also raised by Tk 1.75 lakh. Currently, he gets a monthly salary of Tk 6.15 lakh\u2014a whopping 421 percent raise in 12 years! We also learnt that the Dhaka Wasa officials received stimulus benefits of Tk 40 crore last year. The Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has rightly said that it's the Dhaka Wasa MD and officials who are actually getting the benefit of frequent water tariff hikes.\nOne of the many allegations that Taqsem has faced over the years is that he has been appointed and reappointed as the MD for six consecutive terms, reportedly in violation of Wasa's rules and regulations. TIB termed his appointment and repeated reappointments \"questionable\" and called for a neutral audit of his performance, which has not happened till date.\nUnder his leadership, Dhaka Wasa has failed not only to provide safe water to its consumers, but also solve the waterlogging problem in the city. In 2020, the responsibility of Dhaka's drainage management was handed over to its two city corporations because of Wasa's prolonged failure to eliminate waterlogging. It has also been revealed that Wasa's sewerage lines contaminated the Buriganga River.\nNow, the Wasa MD, with his questionable track record, is trying to burden the consumers with another tariff hike. The justification he has given for this hike just doesn't hold water: He said Wasa needed to raise the water tariff as it couldn't continue its operation \"through begging.\" The fact, however, is that Dhaka Wasa is already a profitable organisation. In the 2020-21 fiscal year, it logged in a profit of Tk 49.6 crore, while its retained earnings (the portion of a company's cumulative profit that is held and saved for future use, particularly for investment purposes) stood at a staggering Tk 892 crore, according to its audited financial report.\nTherefore, there is clearly no logic behind raising the water tariff at a time when ordinary people already have their backs against the wall due to uncontrolled inflation, unemployment and the pandemic impacts. In fact, instead of burdening the consumers, what the Dhaka Wasa authorities should have done is try to improve their service quality by addressing the allegations of corruption and irregularities raised against them.\nThe TIB study mentioned above found that 62 percent of those seeking water and sewer connections from Wasa reported facing harassment and irregularities. The TIB said that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) should look into Wasa's corruption. Later, the ACC's investigations found that Wasa's consumers were not getting good service because of widespread corruption and delays in project implementation. The ACC clearly mentioned that Wasa kept extending deadlines and increasing the project costs to facilitate corruption, highlighting in its report the many ways in which corruption gripped the organisation.\nIt is, therefore, most unfortunate that after all the studies and investigations\u2014not to mention a number of news reports revealing Wasa's irregularities over the years\u2014no substantive action has been taken against Dhaka Wasa and its MD. We can't help but ask: Are Dhaka Wasa and its MD beyond accountability?\n\u00a0\nNaznin Tithi\u00a0is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "I often feel a visceral pain just thinking about raising our children without having them read the treasure of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, and without feeling the immense joy of listening to \"Thakurmar Jhuli,\" a collection of fairy tales by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar, as well as works by Palli Kabi Jasimuddin, Hasan Raja or Lalon. Ami ki bhulite pari, the sacrifice and bloodbath of my brothers and sisters? How can I forget that, as a nation, we were born out of a long historical struggle to establish the due respect of our mother language, cultural distinction, and self-determination? The gradual loss of language, culture, and identity as a Bengali-American feels like a loss of self and surpasses the material benefit of immigration to the US, as millions of Bangla-speaking people here experience. I teach my child, born and raised in the US, \"You are the one who will keep our legacy forward. Remember, our language and culture will live with you.\" I have no idea how this message will be translated into her life journey.\nMore than 2.5 million Bangla-speaking people consist only a tiny fraction of the huge mosaic of the US population, which is around 331.45 million, according to the 2020 census. The ever-growing population of Bengali immigrants in the US and around the world has emerged and evolved as a new cultural community, without living in a nation-state and still sharing a linguistic and cultural identity drifting from their country of origin\u2014namely Bangladesh and India. Bangla is the seventh most spoken language in the world in terms of population, with nearly 265 million speakers in total, among whom around 228 million speak Bangla as their first language. The global cosmopolitans such as New York, London, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Berlin, and many other cities have been embracing Bangla as a second language as the Bangla-speaking diaspora communities have been growing and evolving for more than half a century now. This community, living in a new form of Bengali culture as a minority adapting to the new mainstream cultures hybridising their language and identity, faces the challenge to pass their legacy and language down to the new generation. Teaching children Bangla as a second language has become a great challenge for the families living beyond the border of Bangladesh and West Bengal of India. The Bengalis beyond the borders bring new elements into the global plural cosmo-culture, though; they are also evolving and transmuting themselves as the minority Bengalis without having the boundary of any nation-state.\nIn the US, the number of Bangladeshi immigrants began to grow in the 1970s, reaching from 57,000 to 1,88,000 during 2000-2015, whose first language is Bangla, and according to the 2006 census, the number of Indian Bengalis is 47,600. Both of the Bangla-speaking communities have been struggling to keep the language alive in their family and community lives as Bengali-Americans. These families have begun to establish Bangla language schools to keep the language alive and are trying to keep their children grounded in their roots, while raising them as global Bengalis. This trend is now on the rise in all the cosmo-cities around the world, thriving especially since 2020 on the online platforms during Covid-19. Some of the Bangla schools have been running for three or four decades now, and new schools continue to emerge.\nThese Bangla schools have begun to consolidate their activities through collaboration, using the concept of Milan Mela, for example, supported by the Friends of Bangla School in the South Asia Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Last year, Milan Mela was organised as a coming together of 16 Bangla schools from around the US, with both West Bengal and Bangladeshi traditions to celebrate the Bangla language and Bengali identity, and to build a greater alliance for advancing the Bangla language, literature, and culture within the pluralistic society of America. This assembly is seeking to form a North American Bangla Association to negotiate identity and attain a recognition of Bangla as a second language in the institutional form and American state policy. Keeping the education of Bangla at the heart of claiming the Bengali identity and building a community, this collective aspires to knit together the Bengali diaspora to secure a future for Bangla beyond Bangladesh and India.\nBesides the interest of Bengali-Americans, Bangla has also been taught and researched in some major US universities as a foreign language, usually in the Asian and South Asian centres in the University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, Yale University, University of Texas, Austin, Pennsylvania State University, University of California, Berkeley and University of Washington, for example, where curriculums for Bangla have been developed and offered each year. The community Bangla schools have begun to receive recognition as certified language schools that enable the students to get the freshman year credit, exempting the requirement for taking a foreign language course. As teaching elementary Bangla is not similar to teaching Bangla as a native tongue in Bangladesh or West Bengal, these schools are often struggling with finding the contextual pedagogical approach, which must be methodologically different from the setting of the country of origin. Engaging with the curriculums already developed and available in the US universities and using those in the contextual situations might be effective to achieve the language skill in a pleasurable manner.\nCurrently, there are two major pedagogical approaches used in these community schools\u2014namely, linguistic approach and cultural immersion/community learning approach\u2014which have been further benefited with the opening of the floodgate of online teaching and learning platforms during the pandemic. The practical benefits in professional training and career advancement in some areas can be explored with Bangla language skills\u2014as a medical and legal translator, research and diplomatic interpreter, and in the job posting in the missions and consulates in Bangladesh and India\u2014not to mention the issue of bonding with the extended family members back home.\nCelebrating the pluralistic values as new immigrants in the US, I believe that language and communication play a vital role in the heart of the human experience that must be nurtured and developed with the vehicle of indigenous, immigrant, and world languages, as Bangla is in America. To educate our children to be bilingual or multilingual and encourage them to be linguistically and culturally prepared to be able to navigate an increasingly globalised world with confidence, courage and mutual admiration is our solemn duty. I believe we are bringing Bangla to the global stage and making it a global language through instilling the beauty of the language and the literature into children's hearts, and empowering ourselves by being the Bilingual Bengalis without a border. More centres of Bangla language and culture may emerge in the future\u2014who knows? Thus we are possibly paving the way for many more Jhumpa Lahiris, Arundhati Roys, Zia Haider Rahmans, Monica Alis and Tahmima Anams to emerge out of this trajectory.\n\u00a0\nSayema Khatun,\u00a0a Bangladeshi-American anthropologist, is a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee in the US, and the principal of Akkhor Bangla School in Wisconsin.\n",

The deceased, identified as Hadisur Rahman, 32, was the third engineer of the ship carrying 29 sailors. This is perhaps the first-known Bangladeshi casualty in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine over fears of an expansion drive by the anti-Russian North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) in the eastern European country. BSC officials have already confirmed the attack, saying efforts are underway to bring the trapped sailors back home safely.\nIn the eight days since the war broke out, it has been increasingly clear that its fallout will not be limited to Ukraine, or even Russia, which faces widespread condemnation and biting economic sanctions. The human cost\u2014with over 2,000 civilians killed by now\u2014is but a part of its already far-reaching consequences involving global trade, security, geostrategic relations, etc. Many are fearing a reversion to the frigid Cold War era, which will not be good for anyone.\nBangladesh\u2014which on March 2 abstained from voting on a UN General Assembly resolution demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces, perhaps to protect its own interests by keeping the diplomatic channels open\u2014will not be spared either. We're already facing the brunt of rising international prices and trade uncertainties. With an estimated 2,500 Bangladeshis\u2014mostly students\u2014stuck in Ukraine, the danger may grow further if they are not urgently evacuated. We have heard harrowing tales of how they are passing their days in danger, without help, trying to escape through the heavily hit regions. This has rightly prompted calls for a clearer stance from Bangladesh and further diplomatic and humanitarian measures to ensure the safety of our citizens.\u00a0\nWe're told that hundreds of Bangladeshis have already crossed the Ukrainian border. Bangladeshi missions in Poland and Romania are said to be receiving expatriates leaving Ukraine through their borders. But clear safety assurances are needed from all parties, especially the Ukrainian and Russian authorities, and Bangladesh should continue to coordinate with them to ensure their cooperation. We urge the government to expedite its efforts in this regard, and post regular updates about what it is doing. Most importantly, Russia must stop the war now and all involved parties must pursue peaceful means to resolve their disputes.\n",

        "full_article": "A recently published global report on air pollution has revealed that the average life expectancy of a Bangladeshi has been cut by almost three years due to polluted air. According to the report, the life expectancy loss in Bangladesh is 2.91 years; 1.16 years is cut short by outdoor air pollution, while 1.53 years by indoor air pollution. The report also made a dangerous revelation that \"air pollution reduces people's average life expectancy by almost as much as tobacco use does.\" Being one of the worst affected countries in the world in terms of air pollution, Bangladesh must take these findings seriously and try to mitigate the factors behind air pollution.\nBangladesh and its capital Dhaka have repeatedly been in the news for the past several years for suffering from the worst quality of air. In February this year, Dhaka's air was found to be the world's second-most polluted\u2014its Air Quality Index (AQI) score was recorded at 194, which is considered \"poor\" or \"very unhealthy.\" According to the World Air Quality Report 2020, the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in the country was 77.1 micrograms per cubic metre, which was more than two times higher than the WHO-recommended level.\nIt's only natural that this polluted air will take its toll on people's well-being, since exposure to hazardous air leads to many short- and long-term health complications. Air pollution is directly linked to heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, as several studies have found. It's among the top-risk factors for death and disability worldwide.\nThe main reasons for air pollution in Bangladesh were identified by the experts long ago. A report by the Department of Environment (DoE) and the World Bank in March 2019 pointed out that brick kilns, fumes from vehicles and dust from construction sites are the three main sources of air pollution in Dhaka. Sadly, illegal brick kilns are still operating across the country, despite the High Court's directives to shut them down, while the number of unfit vehicles is also increasing on our roads. And nothing substantial has been done by the authorities to stop dust pollution from the construction sites.\nOnly recently, our average life expectancy increased by 0.2 years, according to a BBS study: it increased to 72.8 years in 2020 from 72.6 years in 2019. That unchecked air pollution will take away our hard-earned progress is totally unacceptable.\u00a0\nSince the main reasons for air pollution have already been identified, it's high time the authorities chalked out a special action plan to tackle the menace. They should prepare time-bound mitigation measures to set up air quality monitoring systems in appropriate places and save people from exposure to unhealthy air, as per the High Court directive.\n\u00a0\n",
