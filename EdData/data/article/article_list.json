        "full_article": "The latest meeting of the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) apex decision-making body concluded late on Friday with precious little progress on key issues that affect global trade, despite extending deliberations by a day. To be clear, hopes for any significant outcomes from the 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi were not high to begin with. Yet, this was an important moment for the WTO to deliver on its mandate amid an increasingly fractious environment for the very rules of trade it seeks to enforce. The intervening period has delivered significant shocks to the global trading architecture such as the ripple effects of conflicts in some parts of the world, the disruptions on critical shipment routes that are expected to linger for long, and recalibrations in supply chains to reduce dependence on single suppliers such as China. An increasing inward-looking tendency among nations has also catalysed isolationist, tariff-heavy trade policies that run adrift of the WTO\u2019s primary purpose of open trade for the benefit of all. The Abu Dhabi declaration does refer to some of the challenges, such as the need to ensure open, inclusive and resilient supply chains, but there is little of substance beyond lip service.Divergences between the WTO\u2019s 164 member-countries persisted on most issues carried forward from Geneva (MC12), including areas of particular interest to India, such as a permanent solution in agriculture for public stock holding to ensure domestic food security or subsidies to the fisheries sector. The WTO Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has noted that the agriculture deliberations, in the works for over two decades now, have made some progress as there is finally a text to work with that the body will strive to clinch in future parleys. The exemption from customs duties for e-commerce, that India had sought an end to, citing the adverse impact on countries\u2019 revenues, will now carry on for at least two more years. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has nuanced this outcome stating that India is \u201cnot necessarily\u201d fully opposed to them. Prospects for the resuscitation of WTO\u2019s dispute resolution body, rendered defunct for four years, remain bleak, though the Geneva commitment to revive the vital body by 2024 was reiterated. A key win for India at the MC13 was its successful efforts with South Africa to thwart an attempt that was led by China and backed by over 120 countries, to introduce an investment facilitation pact into the WTO framework. Going forward, India will have to redouble efforts to retain policy space for sensitive sectors, especially farms. The WTO itself must do much more to stay relevant in an increasingly polarised world. That members find it convenient to tout its failed biennial meetings as successes is a sad commentary on its waning efficacy.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nSwitzerland\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nagriculture\n\n/\n\nfood security\n\n/\n\nelectronic commerce\n\n/\n\nSouth Africa\n\n/\n\ninvestments\n\n/\n\nfarms",

Seeking the right to choose her own identity, Ms. Divya Modi Tongya, had petitioned the Delhi High Court that she be allowed to revert to her maiden name after her divorce comes through. She landed in court after running into a barrier in the form of a government notification which said a married woman who wants to use her maiden name after divorce must either furnish divorce papers or a no-objection certificate from her husband. The Delhi High Court has sought the Union government\u2019s response by May 28, the next date of hearing. In her plea, Ms. Modi Tongya states that the notification is \u201cgender biased\u201d and creates unnecessary restrictions for women who seek to exercise their constitutional right to choose their name \u2014 in her case a change of surname \u2014 by violating Articles 14, 19 and 21. The very idea of an NOC is objectionable, divorce proceedings or not, and is reflective of a deep-seated misogyny that wants to control an individual\u2019s preference. Ms. Modi Tongya should be able to choose whichever surname she is comfortable with and not have to fight for it.Women have often complained of harassment when they have taken the path less trodden. For instance, women who have decided not to opt for their husband\u2019s surname after marriage face a barrage of unnecessary questions and a mountain of paperwork while, say, opening a joint bank account, or during a child\u2019s admission in school, or applying for a passport. A society that is already battling caste-based hierarchies should not add to the discrimination by giving an upper hand to anyone in a relationship, but work towards safer spaces without gender bias, difference and humiliation. In India, the most populous country in the world, stark gender disparities persist, both politically and socially. Women do most of the unpaid work at home, and are often edged out of the labour force for various reasons. What a girl or a woman can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 do, is often laid down by the men in the family; sometimes women too acquiesce to such indignities in the name of tradition. The United Nations has said that the greatest human rights challenge in the world right now is achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls. Paying lip service to rhetoric that women are equal without effecting change on the ground with legislative backing and strong social frameworks defeats the purpose.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nsocial issue\n\n/\n\nhuman rights\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ndivorce\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nmarriage\n\n/\n\npopulation\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations",

They have to ensure that its development and use are safe for the public. But also that its opportunities aren\u2019t stifled. Because that could eventually circle back to hurting their publics worse than ever. Against this backdrop, GOI advisory to various platforms related to AI is both welcome and needs to be cautioned.\n\nSafety switch |\u00a0Platforms deploying generative AI to offer their services to Indian users have been advised to do so only after appropriately labelling the \u201cinherent fallibility or unreliability of the output generated\u201d. This is actually the broad direction in which platforms need to be guided globally. Openly disclosing to consumers and seeking their consent before deploying any undertrial models is a vital safeguard.\n\nDefensive ditch |\u00a0The trouble is with the idea of requiring \u201cexplicit\u201d GOI permission before any AI/LLM/algorithm in the beta stage is deployed for users on the Indian internet. Such a straitjacket may impact domestic and international efforts very differently. The domestic ones are already at a Davidagainst-Goliath disadvantage. They need a lot of GOI support to have a shot at being competitive, not a new XXXL red tape. As for international platforms, imagine them bypassing testing in India. This may come to mean that something becomes widespread in the world without the input of our billion voices. Nobody wins a race by being left out of it.\n\n\nElection deception |\u00a0Of course AI needs proper policing. Ahead of Lok Sabha elections, for example, a particular set of dangers is very prominent. ECI has highlighted that AI and deepfakes have the potential to undermine the level-playing field across democracies. It will certainly have to be on its toes over the coming months. In US FCC has outlawed AI-generated spam calls, after thousands of them went out impersonating Biden. States there are on a legislative spree to restrain other kinds of AI use in elections. Many of these efforts show bipartisanship, which would be helpful here too.\n\nDistrust must |\u00a0Big tech is taking \u201cvoluntary\u201d measures to help prevent deceptive AI content from undermining election integrity in 2024. After having failed \u201cduty of care\u201d in profound ways, they cannot expect us to take them at their word. GOI needs to be watchful. But its mantra should be light-touch regulation.

        "full_article": "Why it may take a Bangalorean 37 tries to book a cab\nTraffic rules are seen as mere suggestions for drivers and riders in Bangalore. In the same vein, principles of economics are considered as an optional extra while formulating policies. Both are more honoured in the breach than observance.\nA recent doozy is the Karnataka govt decision to fix the prices for taxis in Bangalore based on the cost of the vehicle. What is idiotic about this? For one thing, we have centuries of literature on govts trying to meddle with prices and fix them. And for centuries, govts have failed in doing so.\nAlauddin Khilji tried to fix prices for all essential items for his soldiers (so that he could pay less for them). Then he expanded this to most items in the market. Black markets soon emerged, as they invariably do. Khilji had to create an elaborate spy network to catch people who were charging more than the set prices and punish them, including beheading them and displaying the divorced heads at south Delhi\u2019s Chor Minar.\nWhatever be our differences on Karnataka govt, we can perhaps agree that it cannot pull off an elaborate spy network to catch errant taxi drivers. Bangalore traffic police, bless them, are a very tolerant lot.\nBoth a massive 10-wheeled truck and a tractor can merrily go in the wrong direction even on the city\u2019s busiest streets. Sadly/thankfully, there simply isn\u2019t enough state capacity to check the fares charged on every taxi ride.\nShould we laud non-discriminatory approaches to policy-making? The problem is that without discrimination, govt has tried to fix prices for cabs like they had done with autos about 50 years ago. With one stroke, all the complexity of price determination based on time and distance of route, traffic conditions, demand and supply of cabs, and weather conditions has been reduced to a simplistic formula based on cost of vehicle.\nHow long before drivers get fake invoices that inflate the purchase cost of their vehicles? And how long before an Ola driver demands one-and-a-half on the meter?\nSo, the next time you don\u2019t get a ride during peak hours or when it is raining despite 37 attempts or when you spiral into self-doubt as the 8th Uber driver cancels on you, rest assured that it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not even them.

        "full_article": "The correlation between poverty and tax does not usually figure prominently because the poor are nontaxable. They are dismissed as a social segment which does not generate revenue for the state. But this is a wrong conception. As consumers \u2013 much as their individual consumption may be meagre compared to their rich counterparts \u2013 they also pay indirect taxes. About two-thirds of revenue in this country is generated from indirect sources. In economies where the higher the indirect tax is, such as value-added tax (VAT), the higher their contribution to the state coffer. Countries like Bangladesh follows the free-market economy but not entirely in its letter and spirit. Emerging economies concentrate more on wealth creation, allowing industries and businesses concessions to enjoy initially. If such privileges continue longer than a certain period and the tax department \u2013 the National Board of Revenue (NBR) in case of Bangladesh \u2013 is compelled to rely more on indirect taxes, economic disparities go by leaps and bounds. It appears, the concession periods for many industries and businesses have gone overboard. A study titled 'Assessing the Impact of Indirect Taxation on Poverty and Inequality: A Pseudo-Panel Data Analysis on Bangladesh and Global Insights from Cross-Country Panel Regressions' corroborates the fact that higher indirect tax burden to a large extent is responsible for higher rates of poverty and wider income inequality. On its own, free-market economy is in favour of the rich and when banking and revenue policies are distorted to suit misappropriation of money leaving room for siphoning off unearned funds as well as evasion of taxes, the poor and lower middle class people are doubly exploited in the open market system. The economic system gives rise to business sharks where the small fries are fated to famish due to raging inflation. Jointly conducted by the Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID) and the International Growth Centre (IGC), the study discloses that one percentage point increase in indirect tax burden leads to a 0.42 percentage point rise in poverty as also 0.1 percentage point income inequality. Contrarily, 1.0 percentage point increase in income translates into 0.084 percentage point decline in poverty. In this context, the Bangladesh Economic Association's (BEA's) revelation that 87 per cent of the country's rich and upper-middle class people evade taxes makes a grim reading. If these tax-payable people could be brought under the tax net and the laundered money in billions of taka could be prevented from flight, how spectacular would be the combined socio-economic benefits for the country! Bangladesh has, indeed, missed a golden opportunity to make the economy robust and spread the economic benefits across segments. That poverty still got reduced by an average of 51 per cent over a decade from 50 per cent in 2000 to 24 per cent in 2016 owes largely to an agriculture revolution. Rural people, courtesy of the agriculture department, has brought about a paradigm shift in farm practices. No wonder, rural poverty is not as starker as that of urban centres. It is time small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of agro-industrial types were extended special financial and technical supports. This would not only strengthen the economy from within but also reduce dependence on import. Some of those can produce exportable commodities to occupy the empty space of the export basket. Reverse migration from urban slums to villages may be a reality with income inequality getting narrowed down.",

        "full_article": "That there are so many definitions and ideas about what constitutes a civil society organization (CSO) is a good pointer that people think it exists robustly but most are not sure what it means. Amongst development workers and academics, there is some agreement about its linkage with NGOs and global ideas about what is a CSO but civil society itself in Bangladesh may not agree with that. The increase in economic activities outside the official state parameters has also led to the rise in interest in CSOs. But the world of informal economic activities largely remains unknown to the rest including the formal cognoscenti. For example, we know much about microcredit functioning, but we don't know enough about informal credit networks and their role in rural -urban economic life. Economic constructs within society are also delivering livelihood activities to many outside the official reality. Informal economies are also involved in both \"legal \"and \"illegal\" economics. While state agencies may occasionally act against them, both can be partners too, showing the growing fuzzing of boundaries and the inability of the state to be adequately formal exposing the limitations of the state. The state as the supreme body is not challenged but ignored by society in many cases. This brings terms, \"civil' and society \"under scrutiny. The overlapping functions of various institutions and the comfortable co-existence of the legal and the illegal are important indicators of parallel existences , one more driven by social needs and the other by formal legal aspirations. Few realities capture this real paradox than the migration economy. Not only do they exist in a semi-official manner but send their money through the hundi informal system which deals in billions of dollars and doesn't require the national economic machinery of the formal state. Their population -- around 20-25 million -- is almost 1/3 of the total estimated labour force of 70 to 75 million, earn the best wages ever and are promoting their own CSOs not just economic but cultural and religious ones. That means about 100-125 million people don't need to build institutions of the state or NGOs. The UN says, \"A civil society organization is an organizational structure whose members serve the general interest through a democratic process and which plays the role of mediator between public authorities and citizens.\" Another definition says, \" Civil society is a nonpolitical sphere and individual made voluntary organization widely understood as the space outside the family, market, and state. It is associated with the welfare of the state on the ground of civic knowledge, civic education, and civic virtue.\" Why CSOs are going to be non-political is not explained when it fulfills all the criteria of the same needs examination. CSOs have always been involved in local politics, but not in elections. But politics and elections are not the same nor mutually exclusive when it comes to societal interest as CSOs. Some NGOs in the 90s had claimed that they were CSOs by performing service delivery functions that had the best interest of society at heart outside the state. It makes them better claimants as \"agents of change\" providing a degree of legitimacy when in competition with the formal/official agencies claiming monopoly over social change dynamics. But that scenario itself has changed. The establishment thinking puts NGOs and CSOs in one pot but before that, a more precise and functions based definition of what constitutes an NGO needs to be done. Given the role of the NGOs and their links with the Northern notion of what CSOs are, this is an urgent area of inquiry. Another issue that emerges is the legitimizing of NGOs as the sole representative of CSOs which marginalizes other organizations that are organic to society, have existed from before colonialism and continue to be active particularly in the rural areas and urban slums. Currently, they are much better funded by local money. These CSOs include religion based-organisations who are now spreading from the rural to the urban zones. At least three examples can be shown in support of the need for initiating new research activities on defining CSOs. - The Expanded programme of Immunization (EPI) was the most successful public health sector programme which took off only when a partnership could be forged between the service delivery machinery-GO and NGO- and the village leadership. This was possible through the intervention of the health assistants and family welfare assistants, village level health workers --who were more familiar with the rural networks -- informal and organic CSOs- that led to what has been dubbed as the 'near miracle. -BRAC's TUP or ultra-poor programme was also able to go top scale when the matbars lent their clout in protecting assets of the programme beneficiaries by forming Gram Daridro Bimochon Committees (GDBC). These units formed the most effective extreme poverty alleviation support from the civil society actors at the micro level. - The third example was the community based response during the Covid which has been studied by BIGD showing that all over Bangladesh but particularly in the slums zones , communities and informal CSOs responded positively as critically as any other players, often better. As the debate begins to pick up several issues need better understanding, clarification. The issues are: a) What constitutes a CSO and its social location and roots? b) Is it organic and sustainable over time like religious organizations and village based networks? c) Does it operate with the consent of the state and expand state ideologies or is it more loyal to society as a CSO ? New research is now critical as the earlier State-NGO-CSO equation has now receded to see the rise of the Society-CSO- State equation. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Ekushey BooK Fair, which had a modest beginning under private initiative immediately after Bangladesh's independence, has meanwhile turned into a big national event organised every year in February. Why the month is important even a child of this country knows. But the observance of the Language Martyrs' Day on the 21st day of this month would have turned into a mere ritual had Chittaranjan Saha, the owner of a publishing house named Muktodhara, not taken the initiative to set up a book stall on the Bangla Academy premises on the 21st of February in 1972. Notably, that was the first Sahid Dibash (Language Martyrs Day) observed immediately after the country's independence. Men, women and children who after laying floral wreaths at the base of the Central Shaheed Minar (the national monument dedicated to the Language Martyrs) on the morning of the Shahid Dibash would usually return home and attend cultural functions in the evenings found another avenue to express their love for their mother tongue, Bengali, for which the language warriors laid down their lives, through buying and reading books. Indeed, it was a befitting way to commemorate and pay respect to the language heroes. And the sapling that the said publisher planted 51 years ago has over the years grown, as though, into a giant Banyan tree. In fact, the Ekushey Book Fair is a unique event centring the Shahid Dibash that can still inspire the old, the youth and the children of the urban Bengali middle class to maintain as well as develop the healthy habit of buying books and reading just for pleasure. Admittedly, the Ekushey Book Fair has been playing a significant role in this regard. In truth, Banglees of this part of the world cannot be said to be great lovers of book nowadays. But they were not so, especially before the advent of the digital era. In those days, at every district and even sub-divisional towns, there were public libraries where local bookworms could read books as well as borrow for reading at home. The service was free for those who would be enrolled as members of those public libraries. And those who are now in their sixties and seventies might recall how popular were the works of Sarat Chatterjee, Bankim Chatterjee, Mir Musharraf Hussain and other famous novelists of that era among their mothers and grandmothers even if they lived in remote villages. And that was possible because of public libraries of those times. But thanks to the internet and the digital revolution, every kind of reading material, let alone books, is just a click away from us. But still what is lacking is the appetite for reading those books. Unfortunately, modern-day readers do not seem to have enough time than those of the pre-internet era. Small wonder that most young people of today consider it a tedious job to waste time reading books such as classics, especially if they are in print and voluminous in size. Amid these not-so-reassuring developments, the Ekeshey Book Fair in Bangladesh has kept alive the culture of visiting book stalls at the fair, touch and smell freshly printed books and buy one or two. According to Bangla Academy, about six million people visited this Ekushey's book fair and saw a record sale of books worth Tk.600 million. Let every Ekushey book fair keep the nation's love for its language and thirst for reading books alive. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

This time it happened at the JS Diagnostic and Medical Check-up Centre in Malibag Chowdhurypara of the capital.Ten-year-old Ahnaf Tahmin Ayham was brought to the health centre in Malibagh by family members for circumcision. Following the administration of anaesthesia for the procedure, the child failed to regain consciousness. Allegations have been raised that while the family requested 'local anaesthesia,' the doctors administered 'full anaesthesia,' leading to the child's death within an hour. The family is demanding a fair trial and exemplary punishment for those responsible.A case has been filed against the doctor of the diagnostic centre on behalf of the family in connection with the child's death. Consequently, two doctors have been arrested, and the hospital has been temporarily closed.This tragic incident follows the death of five-year-old Ayaan in early January after circumcision at the United Medical College Hospital in Badda area of the capital.The unfortunate deaths during circumcision raise several pertinent questions. Expert doctors highlight that individuals with haemophilia, a blood disorder, face challenges in controlling bleeding post-circumcision. Furthermore, the country lacks sufficient anaesthetists and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) facilities, leading to procedures being performed by inexperienced individuals.It is imperative to ensure a fair investigation and speedy trial into the cases of recurring medical mistakes in the country. Measures must be implemented to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future. Action against unauthorised health centres is necessary, with many unregistered private hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres reportedly being shut down by the Health Department.
