External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar warned that the response to \u201cterrorism, extremism and violence\u201d should not be determined by \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d, in what seemed to be a reference to India\u2019s concerns over Khalistani extremism in Canada. He added that countries must not \u201ccherry pick\u201d when to respect \u201cterritorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs\u201d \u2014 a clear reference to Canada\u2019s allegations that Indian \u201cgovernment agents\u201d were responsible for the Nijjar killing in Surrey in June. Canadian UN Ambassador Robert Rae appeared to double down on the Canadian allegations, as he spoke about the \u201cextent to which democracies are under threat\u201d due to foreign interference. In effect the statements reflected the impasse between both countries more than 10 days since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made his claims in the Canadian Parliament. After expelling each other\u2019s diplomats, India and Canada have curtailed people-to-people ties. While India has suspended all visas to Canadians, Canada has put trade talks on hold. These actions have been taken even before Canada has made any evidence of its allegations against India public, and New Delhi has reiterated that despite two visits by the Canadian National Security Adviser to discuss the Nijjar issue, no concrete evidence has been provided. Nor has Canada completed its own investigation or begun any trial. Despite this, there have been calls from Canadian \u201cFive Eyes\u201d allies that India must cooperate, indicating some pressure from Canada.The only way out is for Canada to take the first step in proving its allegations, which, in the absence of verifiable evidence, seem to have been levelled prematurely. Mr. Jaishankar has made it clear that such judicial inter-state killings are not the policy of the Indian government. However, it is hard to believe that the leader of one of the most developed countries would make these claims without sufficient cause, and if evidence is shared, the next logical step would be for New Delhi, which has denied the allegations strenuously, to cooperate on any information needed to conclude the Canadian investigation. India\u2019s grievances against Canada for \u201csoft-peddling\u201d the issue of Khalistan extremism and providing \u201csafe havens\u201d for wanted terrorists, as well as Canadian claims of rights violations by security forces in Punjab, and Indian intelligence operations in Canada, date back to the 1980s, and these were the cause of their high-level engagements being frozen for decades. However, never before have trade, travel and tourism ties been cut down so quickly as in the past week. With students, the business community, and the diaspora feeling the brunt, it is hoped the two countries move with some urgency to arrest the free fall in ties. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nCanada\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nterrorism (crime)\n\n/\n\ninternational relations\n\n/\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nAustralia\n\n/\n\nNew Zealand\n\n/\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\ntourism\n\n/\n\nespionage and intelligence\n\n/\n\nPunjab",

        "full_article": "A good part of the world\u2019s population is growing older, and India mirrors this trend as well. The reality, according to the United Nations Population Fund\u2019s India Ageing Report 2023, is that the population above 60 years will double from 10.5% or 14.9 crore (as on July 1, 2022) to 20.8% or 34.7 crore by 2050. With one in five individuals set to be a senior citizen, there will be implications for health, economy, and society. In Kerala and West Bengal for instance, there is a growing population of the elderly who live alone as children migrate for better opportunities. With life expectancy increasing, thanks to better ways to fight disease, and decreasing fertility rates in many countries, including India, there are challenges in nurturing an expanding elderly population. Within this macro phenomenon, there are myriad other data of importance. For instance, women elderly citizens outnumber their male counterparts. At 60 years, a person in India may expect to live another 18.3 years, which is higher in the case of women at 19 years compared to men at 17.5 years. If women in India, where labour force participation is low at 24%, do not have economic and social security, they will become more vulnerable in old age.There are also significant inter-State variations. Most States in the south reported a higher share of the elderly population than the national average in 2021, a gap that is expected to widen by 2036. While States with higher fertility rates, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, expect to see an increase in the share of the elderly population too by 2036, the level will remain lower than the Indian average. Overall, more than two-fifths of the elderly are in the poorest wealth quintile \u2014 ranging from 5% in Punjab to 47% in Chhattisgarh; also, 18.7% of the elderly do not have any income. A high proportion of the rural population is among the elderly and often economically deprived. To meet the challenges, physical and mental health, basic needs of food and shelter, income security, and social care, a \u2018whole-of-society\u2019 approach is required. Geriatric care must be fine-tuned to their unique health-care needs. There are several schemes targeting the elderly but many are unaware of them or find it too cumbersome to sign up. The National Policy on Older Persons, 1999 and the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 lay down the care of the elderly but to ensure that senior citizens live in dignity, public and private policies must provide a more supportive environment. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\npopulation\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\ndisease\n\n/\n\ngeriatrics\n\n/\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nPunjab\n\n/\n\nChhattisgarh\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nparent and child",

In certain circles there is still complacency about a strong legacy of Aryabhatta and Ramanujan. But the facts do not bear it out at all. Aser surveys indicate that the number of Class III children who can do subtraction hasn\u2019t budged significantly in a decade. It hovers around an abysmal 20% across government and private schools. Because India has not been participating in the Pisa competition, global comparisons are difficult. But the US has. Its students score lower than those in 36 other education systems, China\u2019s score the highest.\n\nThe way forward is to learn from how other countries have overcome this challenge. The key to Vietnam\u2019s high Pisa scores for example is lots of attention to teacher training. On this, India really needs to turn a new chapter. Recently, Bihar suspended teachers\u2019 training programmes to engage them in the caste survey. Such terrible prioritisation is widespread. America is worried because a poor math pipeline means poor prospects for both individual and national prosperity. The equation is no different for India. For example, the difference between fearing job loss because of AI tools and excitement about riding this tiger, is to a large extent scripted by one\u2019s skill levels, and comfort with upskilling. It\u2019s essentially about having a solid grounding. This is also why a US congressional hearing in 2005 rued that 46% of math teachers had not majored or minored in math in college. Again, comparable numbers are not available in India, but the big picture is similar. Too many students are intimidated by math because too many teachers are!\n\n",

The party was at it again in MP, where it\u2019s locked in a tight contest with Congress for the forthcoming assembly elections. On Monday night, BJP released a list of 39 candidates. The highlight was another shakeup, but with a difference. Veterans, some of whom are GOI ministers, were asked to head back and contest assembly elections. Notable among them was agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar.\nAnother surprise was the party\u2019s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who candidly admitted to being ambivalent about it as it jeopardises his son\u2019s chance of getting a ticket. As reported in this paper, some heavyweights asked to contest in the assembly elections were part of the party\u2019s election committee meetings but appeared to be taken unawares by their names on the list. If the aim was to shake up the hierarchy, it worked. There are indications that BJP\u2019s strategy in other poll-bound states such as Telangana and Rajasthan will be similar.\n\n\u00a0\nThis shakeup is different from BJP\u2019s earlier approach of dropping senior leaders. Nowhere was the earlier strategy employed with more drama than in Gujarat in 2021 \u2013 the then CM and the entire council of ministers were replaced a year before the next election. The new CM, Bhupendra Patel, and many of his colleagues, were first-time MLAs. In 2022, BJP won a historic mandate. However, an attempt in Karnataka to relegate its veterans failed to offset anti-incumbency in the assembly elections this year. The results show that a shakeup in the party hierarchy doesn\u2019t always work as voters consider other factors, including the performance of an incumbent government.\nBJP\u2019s action in MP has been interpreted by some as a sign of nervousness. Indeed, the rollout of welfare measures this year by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government indicates that. First, there was a monthly income transfer to women, which was followed by a subsidy top-up for LPG cylinders even after GOI lowered the price.\nThat aside, the pattern over the last few elections shows that the political marketplace remains highly competitive. Not just between political parties but also within them. No one can afford complacency. Voters can be unforgiving.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is distressing to see the continued plight of famers in parts of the Barind region, known as the \"rice bowl\" of the country, where rapidly depleting groundwater levels have caused a catastrophic water crisis. A recent report by this daily shows how the distribution of irrigation water, through deep tubewells, has become a tool for individuals with political clout to exploit vulnerable farmers, particularly those from ethnic minority communities. This is what we can call \"a crisis within a crisis\", its magnitude exemplified by several farmer suicides, which calls for urgent interventions from the authorities.\n\nThe roots of the crisis can be traced back to the 1990s when deep tubewells were introduced, enabling farmers to cultivate multiple crops annually and transforming the Northwest into a thriving grain-producing hub. Ironically, it is this very success \u2013 on the back of excessive groundwater extraction \u2013 that contributed to the water crisis and attendant troubles. Although the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA), responsible for overseeing irrigation, ceased installing new tubewells in 2012, unregulated private operators have continued to thrive. Today, these operators as well as the ones appointed by the BMDA are primarily responsible for much of the suffering being caused.\n\nAccording to our report, farmers are supposed to pay a nominal fee for water under the BMDA management, which is Tk 85-125 per hour of irrigation. For context, there are approximately 16,000 government-run and 56,000 privately run deep tubewells in 16 districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. However, tubewell operators frequently sell water at higher rates to affluent farmers, breaching the \"first come, first serve\" policy. Marginal farmers are most at risk \u2013 sometimes the operators take away their smart cards and force them to enter into direct contracts with them, which means paying 6-28 times more than the government-fixed rate. Often, they are also denied water, leading to suffering and desperation. Despite some attempts to prevent it, however, political connections have continued to enable exploitation.\n\nAll this \u2013 against a backdrop of climate change and the region's crisis of groundwater, whose levels alarmingly fell by at least two feet over the last year alone \u2013 serves as a wake-up call for the authorities. Ridding the water irrigation/distribution process of exploitation, and ensuring equitable access for all farmers, is indeed the priority. Equally important, however, is finding a comprehensive solution that takes the bigger picture into account and addresses the water and livelihood crises in the region.\n",

        "full_article": "Energy produced from natural resources (that is, renewable energy) regenerates over the span of a human's life without depleting the planet's resources. These resources, which include biomass, tides, waves, sunshine, wind, rain, and thermal energy stored in the earth's crust, have the advantage of being accessible in some capacity from almost everywhere. They are practically inexhaustible. More importantly, they don't harm the climate or the ecosystem as much. Renewable energy is gradually becoming more affordable; it is equitable and secure, and has the potential to create jobs.\nIn contrast, fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas are only found in finite amounts. They eventually run out as we continue to extract them. Even if they are created through natural processes, they are not replenished quickly enough to make up for what is consumed by humans. More emissions are produced by burning fossil fuels than by producing electricity from renewable sources. The key to solving the climate catastrophe is switching from fossil fuels \u2013 which now produce the majority of emissions \u2013 to renewable energy.\n\nOne of the largest financial obstacles preventing the country's transition to renewable energy is fossil fuel subsidies. The cost of subsidising the fossil fuel industry alone is enormous and includes direct subsidies, tax benefits, and costs for health and the environment that weren't factored into the pricing of fossil fuels. Subsidies for fossil fuels are unfair and inefficient.\nThe energy sector in Bangladesh is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Both domestic and imported fossil fuels play a significant role in our energy production. In 2022, more than 98 percent of all energy production originated from natural gas, oil, diesel, and coal. Less than two percent of the energy mix consisted of renewables. Over the years, the reliance on fossil fuels has intensified. However, the Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh, which was introduced in 2008, aimed at harnessing the potential of renewable energy resources and technologies in the country. The policy set a target of meeting five percent of total power demand by 2015 and 10 percent by 2020 using renewable sources. These targets were never met. There are, however, conflicting targets in various governments' policies and plans. The Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) was introduced in 2021 to enhance the nation's resilience against climate change. This plan aims to reach 30 percent renewable energy share by 2030 and at least 40 percent by 2041. In contrast, under the draft Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP), Bangladesh has set a clean energy (renewable\u00a0and\u00a0nuclear) target of 40 percent by 2041. Also, the government's annual budget documents set different targets. The real picture shows that Bangladesh's progress towards switching to renewable energy has remained slow and uncertain.\nThere is no denying that the viability of renewable energy in the country will depend on the market price or value of renewable energy, the costs of renewable energy in comparison to those of other energy resources, policies to promote renewable energy, and environmental goals that increase the costs of using fossil fuels and/or subsidise the costs of renewable energy. As such, the wider adoption of renewable energy is hindered by pressure from fossil fuel lobbies, ineffective governmental regulations, outdated infrastructure, expensive initial installation costs, a lack of proper battery storage systems, a lack of knowledge and awareness, and a lack of relevant policies and subsidies.\n\nTo transform Bangladesh's energy systems and speed up the shift to renewable energy in the next decade or so, a few critical actions need to be prioritised. In line with the statements of the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the following actions can be suggested.\nFirstly, there is a need to ensure easy access to renewable energy. Renewable energy technology needs to be accessible to everyone and not just for the wealthy. Energy from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, can be stored and released whenever people, communities, and businesses need power thanks to technologies such as battery storage systems. Due to their special ability to quickly absorb, hold, and re-inject electricity, they help increase the flexibility of the energy system. And, when combined with renewable sources, battery storage technologies can offer dependable and less costly electricity in off-grid settlements and isolated networks. Bangladesh also needs to explore the opportunities for importing renewable energy from neighbouring countries like India, Bhutan, and Nepal.\nSecondly, a steady supply of raw materials and components for renewable energy is crucial in order to ensure broader access to all the necessary resources. In addition, the management of renewable energy waste is important in order to create supply chains that safeguard ecosystems.\n\nThirdly, there is a need to create a level playing field for technologies utilising renewable energy. Domestic policy frameworks need to be quickly changed to streamline and accelerate renewable energy projects and spur private sector investments. Policies and procedures must be put in place to lower market risk, enable investment, and provide incentives \u2013 including by streamlining the planning, permitting, and regulatory processes and avoiding bottlenecks and red tape. The adoption of solar and wind energy technologies can be accelerated by the availability of modern energy transmission infrastructure, clear and strong policies, transparent processes, and public support.\nThe country needs to switch energy subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy. One of the largest financial obstacles preventing the country's transition to renewable energy is fossil fuel subsidies. The cost of subsidising the fossil fuel industry alone is enormous and includes direct subsidies, tax benefits, and costs for health and the environment that weren't factored into the pricing of fossil fuels. Subsidies for fossil fuels are unfair and inefficient. Subsidising renewable energy instead reduces emissions and has the potential of fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation, improved public health, and greater equality, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable people.\n\nIt is also critically important to make considerable investments in renewable energy. There is a need for commitment and accountability, especially from the banks and other public and private financial institutions, which must direct their lending portfolios toward hastening the transition to renewable energy.\nFinally, resources must be shifted between competing industrial sectors and political constituencies as part of a sustainable energy transition. As stakeholders in this process hold varying degrees of political and economic power, understanding how political and economic factors influence the transition to renewable energy is crucial in order to formulate effective policies and facilitate the shift to sustainable energy systems.\nDr Selim Raihan\u00a0is professor at the Department of Economics in the University of Dhaka, and executive director at the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem).

Ironically, it is this very success \u2013 on the back of excessive groundwater extraction \u2013 that contributed to the water crisis and attendant troubles. Although the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA), responsible for overseeing irrigation, ceased installing new tubewells in 2012, unregulated private operators have continued to thrive. Today, these operators as well as the ones appointed by the BMDA are primarily responsible for much of the suffering being caused.\n\nAccording to our report, farmers are supposed to pay a nominal fee for water under the BMDA management, which is Tk 85-125 per hour of irrigation. For context, there are approximately 16,000 government-run and 56,000 privately run deep tubewells in 16 districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. However, tubewell operators frequently sell water at higher rates to affluent farmers, breaching the \"first come, first serve\" policy. Marginal farmers are most at risk \u2013 sometimes the operators take away their smart cards and force them to enter into direct contracts with them, which means paying 6-28 times more than the government-fixed rate. Often, they are also denied water, leading to suffering and desperation. Despite some attempts to prevent it, however, political connections have continued to enable exploitation.\n\nAll this \u2013 against a backdrop of climate change and the region's crisis of groundwater, whose levels alarmingly fell by at least two feet over the last year alone \u2013 serves as a wake-up call for the authorities. Ridding the water irrigation/distribution process of exploitation, and ensuring equitable access for all farmers, is indeed the priority. Equally important, however, is finding a comprehensive solution that takes the bigger picture into account and addresses the water and livelihood crises in the region.\n",
