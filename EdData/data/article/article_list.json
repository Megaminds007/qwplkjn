As an article presented at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting in Davos last month notes, India holds the key to hitting global climate change targets given its sizeable and growing energy needs. With the country\u2019s population set to overtake China\u2019s some time this year, India\u2019s appetite for energy to propel the economy is set to surge exponentially. The transition to green alternatives from the current reliance on fossil fuels is therefore an urgent imperative and an opportunity to leverage this move to catalyse new industries, generate jobs on a sizeable scale, and add to overall economic output. In a nod to this, Budget 2023-24 devoted a fair amount of space to the green industrial and economic transition needed. With the electric vehicle (EV) revolution poised to take off as every automobile major rolls out new EV models to tap demand, the availability of indigenously produced lithium-ion batteries has become a necessity, especially to lower the cost of EVs. The Budget hearteningly proposes to exempt customs duty on the import of capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells used in EV batteries. This ought to give a fillip to local companies looking to set up EV battery plants.Another key proposal relates to the establishment of a viability gap funding mechanism to support the creation of battery energy storage systems with a capacity of 4,000 MWh. Energy storage systems are crucial in power grid stabilisation and essential as India increases its reliance on alternative sources of power generation including solar and wind. With wind turbine farms and solar photovoltaic projects characteristically producers of variable electric supply, battery storage systems become enablers of ensuring the electricity these generators produce at their peak output is stored and then supplied to match the demand arriving at the grid from household or industrial consumers. Ms. Sitharaman also set aside a vital \u20b98,300 crore towards a \u20b920,700 crore project for building an inter-State transmission system for the evacuation and grid integration of 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh. With its vast stretches of barren land and one of the country\u2019s highest levels of sunlight availability, Ladakh is considered an ideal location to site photovoltaic arrays for producing a substantial capacity of solar power. The transmission line will help address what had so far been the hurdle in setting up solar capacity in the region, given its remoteness from India\u2019s main power grid.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBudget 2023\n\n/\n\ncarbon emissions\n\n/\n\nautomobile engineering\n\n/\n\nsolar\n\n/\n\nrenewable energy",

On February 1, the second anniversary of the coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, thousands joined the opposition\u2019s call for a \u201csilent strike\u201d by shutting shops and staying at home. The junta\u2019s decision to extend the state of emergency \u2014 which would also mean that the August elections the Generals had announced seeking political legitimacy would be further delayed \u2014 points to the regime\u2019s weakening control. This is certainly not the scenario Gen. Min Aung Hlaing had anticipated when he grabbed power, citing fraud in the 2020 general election which Ms. Suu Kyi\u2019s party had swept. The Tatmadaw (the military) imprisoned the entire government and most of the ruling party lawmakers, including Ms. Suu Kyi, cracked down on democracy protests and started ruling the country directly \u2014 old tactics that have helped the Generals to rule through fear. But unlike in the past when the military faced democratic civilian resistance to its brutal rule, Myanmar fell into an armed civil war after the February coup. Whatever the military did to take control only made matters worse.Now the junta is facing multiple crises in the face of a humanitarian disaster. The remnants of the old government have formed an alternative administration, the National Unity Government. Several cells of the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF), the armed wing of the NUT, have sprung up in the otherwise peaceful Buddhist heartlands carrying out ambushes. In the borderlands, ethnic minority militias, which have been fighting the military, have joined hands with the urban guerillas of the PDF. The junta\u2019s response has been indiscriminate bombings. Since the coup, some 3,000 civilians have been killed, 40,000 houses destroyed and about 1.5 million people displaced. According to the UN, some 17.6 million people, roughly a third of Myanmar\u2019s population, will need humanitarian assistance. The junta is neither interested in nor capable of addressing these problems. And the war it is fighting against its own people is not helping the Generals\u2019 cause either \u2014 a report by the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, an independent group of international experts, says the junta has stable control over only 17% of the country. This is an unprecedented scenario. What Myanmar urgently needs is meaningful dialogue between the junta and the opposition to restore democracy and start talks with ethnic rebels. Regional and international players, especially the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China and India, should push the Generals to start talks with the opposition.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMyanmar\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nASEAN\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\ndemocracy",

Pakistan is in the midst of a deep forex crisis with reserves down to just $3.09 billion as of January 27. This can cover only 18 days of imports. Thus, Islamabad desperately needs to complete the pending ninth review under IMF\u2019s $7 billion extended fund facility to stave off default.\nBut Pakistan\u2019s power sector, long a quagmire of unsustainable subsidies, poor transmission and lack of accountability, is posing a problem. For the source of the woes, many point to the mismanaged privatisation exercise that led to the creation of 12 local distribution companies that mostly provided employment to military retirees. Meanwhile, a 2020 study flags the Pakistani government paying more than Pakistani Rs 1 trillion as Tariff Differential Subsidy where a uniform tariff is applied across all electrical distribution companies despite differences in cost, and the gap in revenue is financed by government. Add to this Islamabad\u2019s policies like the Pakistani Rs 120 billion energy subsidy to exporters announced four months ago.\nIf Islamabad is unable to get itself out of this economic hole, it would of course have catastrophic consequences for Pakistani people. But India should be concerned too. A total collapse of the Pakistani government \u2013 which is also facing a new spate of homegrown terrorism \u2013 could see the entire stretch from the Iran-Afghanistan border to Lahore becoming an extremist hotbed. This would certainly complicate India\u2019s security challenges and lead to an even greater Af-Pak problem than the one the world has faced.

One of its constituents, Adani Enterprise, recorded a 50% fall in its price during the week to close at Rs 1531. The sharp divergence here is an indicator of the underlying optimism in the Indian economy which an index of diverse companies captures.\nThe optimism about India\u2019s economic future has shown up for a while. Two trends are worth highlighting. In 2022, global economic and geopolitical disruptions led to a net FII outflow of $16.5 billion in Indian equities. Yet, the bellwether BSE Sensex rose 4.4% during 2022. The FII outflow was more than offset by the emergence of Indian retail investors in equity as a countervailing force. Take mutual fund SIPs, a proxy for retail investment. Since September 2021, the monthly inflow has exceeded Rs 10,000 crore every month. In 2022-23, the annual inflow is set to more than double what was collected five years ago.\nThe growing interest of retail Indian investment in Indian equities is a positive development. It helps households capture the gains of economic growth and also helps firms by providing a more diverse pool of investors. While GoI has taken pains to reassure investors on the integrity of market systems, the performance of Adani group shares indicates uncertainty.

        "full_article": "There are a few things to be noted regarding this year's Amar Ekushey Boi Mela, one of which is the expectation that this would be the year of recovery. After two years of writers, publishers, and publications being held hostage by the pandemic, the last Boi Mela was able to exude a sense of normalcy. But then, of course, a national economic crisis hit.\nThe key issue that must be highlighted, and which has significantly harmed this sector, is the increase of paper price. The price hike was drastic enough to become a hurdle, but was not addressed as seriously as it should have been. As such, the price hike and the issues begotten by it have actually escalated over the past year. However, even after paying the high prices for locally made paper, publishers are not receiving goods of their desired quality. This is something that needs to be highlighted, as the media is naturally focusing on publishers now, thanks to Boi Mela, as opposed to the rest of the year. This should not be the case, however. Such issues concerning publications must be viewed and dissected extensively throughout the year by those who determine these prices, and by the media.\nBehind the scenes, publishing houses have tried hard to keep the promises made to authors and readers, despite the struggle of launching themselves at this year's Boi Mela in the first place. Needless to say, the publication sector supports the livelihoods of many people.\nAs for quality control, the Bangla Academy certainly has a role to play in terms of controlling the quality of the content that is being displayed and sold at Boi Mela. As publishers, we also want the academy to play this role and host the book fair, and act as a non-partisan entity in doing so. As such, there is still scope for the policies at work to be reviewed. It is normal for one to not agree with what one book may be condoning, but it is also possible for another book present at Boi Mela to question or contradict it.\nWe believe that the freedom of expression of writers and publishers must be preserved. In that vein, even if one does find the content of a certain book or the opinions of its author to be agreeable, it is unfortunate for that book to be altogether banned from having a place at the book fair. The Bangla Academy and our cultural affairs ministry is tasked with upholding the interests and rights of publishers and writers. For these institutions to instead become a barrier to our freedom of expression can only be described as tragic.\nNow that such restrictive policies are being put in place, they indicate that worse and perhaps more irrational rules will eventually follow, which may not end in good news for the Bangla Academy or the cultural affairs ministry, either. Keeping this in mind, one can only hope that the current policies \u2013 which are likely harming the concerned publisher in a time of financial crisis such as the present \u2013 will be reviewed with sufficient forethought.\nWhat really signals an absence of foresight on the part of Boi Mela authorities is that placing restrictions on the sale of particular books has actually led to the rise of their overall market sales. So, if the intended \"benefits\" of banning a book are not being brought about, what was the point?\nPublishers nowadays are having to work through a lot of challenges, but one hopes that some scope for discussions and dialogue will open up. I do believe the current rules in place at Boi Mela are somewhat well thought out, as they have helped many publishers qualify to participate in the fair. However, these regulations have also not been beneficial across the board. A scenario has been created where a select few publishers have more power, including over the exclusion of other publishers. Is this fair or justifiable in any way?\nStill, going forward, we must remain hopeful that the institutions tasked with regulating Boi Mela will open up space for dialogue. We hope that, when these regulations are formulated in the future, active participation of all stakeholders will be sought. After all, Amar Ekushey Boi Mela does not just belong to the Bangla Academy; it belongs to the publishers and writers as well. As such, the input of these crucial stakeholders must not be silenced.\nWe would never want for the relationship between the overseeing institutions and other stakeholders to turn sour with conflict. Lastly, we hope that our freedom of expression \u2013 which we believe is our constitutional right in a free country \u2013 will be ensured and that the relevant government organisations will play the most significant role in making this happen.\nTranscribed and translated by Afia Jahin.\n\nMahrukh Mohiuddin\u00a0is the managing director of The University Press Limited (UPL).\n",

        "full_article": "With less than a year to go until the next parliamentary election, by-elections to six constituencies took place on Wednesday, apparently in a peaceful way, bar a few stray but customary incidents of gun-firing and the ever-familiar chase and counter-chase between the supporters of rival candidates.\nHowever, other features of these by-polls were not so customary, at least if we consider how participatory elections used to be held in Bangladesh, amid a festive atmosphere, even a few years ago. This time, there were extremely low voter turnouts (indicating a lack of interest among voters, possibly resulting from the boycott by the main political opposition BNP), ruling party men taking control of polling centres (also because BNP members were absent from the field), and the most alarming of them all \u2013 the disappearance of a candidate five days before voting day.\nThese phenomena raise some serious and obvious questions about the Election Commission's capacity to hold free and fair polls. But what they also indicate has grave consequences for the state of democracy in the country. The commission's primary task is to make sure that all elections are fair, that every candidate gets a fair shot at winning, and where every voter gets the chance to cast their vote in favour of their chosen candidate. But given what happened on Wednesday, it didn't take people long to forget that this same Election Commission managed to hold an impressive by-election (at least by recent standards) in the Gaibandha-5 constituency only a month ago. As if it was just a fluke.\nWe saw the recurrence of the most alarming trend ahead of the by-poll to Brahmanbaria-2 as well: one of the opposition candidates went missing. Nothing could be worse for a democracy than when the Election Commission, without a shred of proof, speculates that the candidate might have gone into hiding. Should they not have taken a moment to reflect and used common sense to realise that whatever they were saying was completely against the spirit of the very existence of their commission?\nThe missing candidate, Abu Asif Ahmed, returned the day after the by-election, saying he had gone away as the pressure of the election had gotten unbearable for him. If that is indeed the case, would one be wrong in thinking that the Election Commission has failed to do their primary job?\nAltogether, this adds more weight to the BNP's and other political parties' claim that a fair election under the current Election Commission is not possible. The commission, which has been suffering from a severe credibility crisis \u2013 obviously, this commission is not solely responsible for such a situation; the last two commissions contributed a lot to the lack of credibility given how they conducted the last two general elections \u2013 will feel more pressure.\nThe six by-polls were not seen as hugely important when the election schedule was announced. But the drama surrounding Brahmanbaria-2 changed that, as did the Hero Alom saga.\nWe know that these by-elections will neither bring any changes in the government nor in the electoral system. The ruling party was desperate to prove that the BNP lawmakers' decision to resign from parliament was wrong. It possibly also wanted to send a message to the BNP leaders and aspirants that they might have a chance in the next polls if they betrayed their party.\nBut what has been more surprising is the desperation of the ruling party. They exercised their maximum strength to ensure the victory of Abdus Sattar (who was elected five times from the BNP ticket and was a technocrat minister during the BNP-led four-party alliance government in 2001) in Brahmanbaria-2.\nThey succeeded, but at a high cost: they proved once again that a free and fair election under a partisan government is absolutely impossible (at least recent history says so).\nThat is why we now see Hero Alom, an internet sensation with a huge fan following, pointing his finger at the Election Commission and the local administration with allegations of election result manipulation. Alom contested the election from two constituencies as an independent candidate, losing both. But in Bogura-4, he was neck-and-neck with the other candidate and was confident about his victory when voting was underway.\nAfter the result, he told journalists, \"There are some people in the educated society who don't want to accept me. They think that if I get elected, Bangladesh's prestige would suffer; their [the educated people] prestige would suffer. They would be forced to call illiterates like me 'Sir.' That's why they don't want to accept me. They couldn't accept my victory. If the election is rigged and farcical, people will disregard elections forever.\"\nAside from Alom's concerns about political and educated people's alleged disdain towards him, what is truly concerning is that the Awami League may replicate the Brahmanbaria-2 template in luring opposition candidates like Sattar in the upcoming general election, scheduled for January 2024. That would undoubtedly be a moral and political defeat for the ruling party, and certainly an unsmart move of a government that dreams of a \"Smart Bangladesh.\"\n\u00a0\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "I recently visited the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) to conduct a survey for my university coursework. It was essentially my first visit there. My perception of DMCH prior to this visit was that, since it's a government facility, it's not very well-managed, and only gets so many patients because it provides affordable healthcare and related services.\nHowever, only after visiting the place did I realise how dire the situation is at this hospital. It is clearly operating at overcapacity and is burdened with more patients than it can accommodate. Unable to find a bed, sick patients can be seen lying on the floors of corridors and balconies. The agony of those injured or in critical conditions is on open display. I found the overall environment suffocating, and could not help but wonder how the health of a sick individual could improve under such dreadful conditions.\nHowever, we cannot blame the DMCH for this situation. The main reason behind the overcrowding lies elsewhere.\nDMCH is a tertiary healthcare facility. That is, the facility's service provision is primarily involved in providing specialised care to patients referred by secondary and primary care facilities. The accepted practice worldwide is, unless it is an emergency, a patient will go to a primary healthcare facility, then get referred to a secondary facility, and eventually a tertiary facility if needed. Yet, a majority of the patients who visit DMCH go there without being referred from the lower-tier healthcare facilities.\nBangladesh became a signatory to the Alma-Ata Declaration in 1978, which means the country is committed to providing primary healthcare. Over the years, despite some setbacks due to the shifting of policies between different governments, Bangladesh has invested significantly in developing its primary healthcare system. For instance, the rural healthcare service delivery system has sound structural design. A hierarchical system is followed, where a patient initially visits a community clinic, then is referred to a union-level health facility, and finally an upazila health complex, depending on their needs.\nHowever, urban areas in Bangladesh don't have a properly defined service delivery system because the health ministry is not responsible for primary healthcare service provision in urban areas. Rather, it is the LGRD ministry's jurisdiction through city corporations and municipalities. However, the LGRD ministry does not have the resources or infrastructure to provide the healthcare services that are required in the urban sphere.\nThe LGRD ministry currently provides primary care through the Urban Primary Healthcare Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) and government dispensaries. However, these healthcare facilities are insufficient in number and cannot cater to the entire urban population. These facilities face various challenges as well, among which are a lack of accountability, weak monitoring system, staff shortages, and provision of limited services. But, most importantly, these facilities are not designed under an umbrella model.\nTo tackle the existing crises in the provision of primary healthcare in urban areas, Sida of Sweden, Unicef, CMED Health Ltd, and a few other stakeholders recently launched the Urban Clinic Model. The model is currently being operated in six areas under the name \"Aalo clinic.\"\nAalo clinics are designed to provide comprehensive primary healthcare services. The design of this model draws inspiration from Delhi's\u00a0mohalla\u00a0clinics, UK's general practitioner (GP) system and a few other countries' primary healthcare systems. The model also addresses the challenges that the existing primary healthcare facilities face, and has designed Aalo clinics in a way to mitigate those problems.\nServices at Aalo clinics are provided free of cost and each clinic is expected to have a service coverage of 5,000-6,000 households. The goal is to provide all types of healthcare services, which come under the purview of primary healthcare services such as preventive care, communicable and non-communicable diseases, among others.\nAn Aalo clinic operates in two shifts of 12 hours each. It houses an adequate number of staff: two GPs (one male and one female), a clinical assistant, a cleaner, and a security guard. The staff is well-trained and doctors are explicitly instructed to see an individual patient for a minimum of 8-10 minutes.\nEach facility can provide common diagnostic tests and also telemedicine services. The entire system is digitalised. Therefore, accountability can be ensured through constant monitoring. New patients are also registered in the system's database, for which the doctors will be able to view past records for future visits.\nTalks are underway for the government, specifically the health ministry, to take over the project and scale up the model to ensure that there are an adequate number of facilities across all the cities and municipal areas in the country. Implementing such a model, where there are free provisions for healthcare services, and a foolproof system to counter absenteeism, poor quality service, etc, can improve the health of lower-income groups in our urban areas and prevent them from facing catastrophic health expenditures.\nIf the government can implement the Urban Clinic Model, it is certainly expected to completely change the primary health provision landscape in urban areas, and would significantly reduce the burden on tertiary facilities like the DMCH and other medical colleges. By scaling up the Aalo clinic model, we can go a long way in realising our goal of becoming a country with universal health coverage.\n\u00a0\nMohammad Ihtesham Hassan is pursuing a master's degree in health economics at the Institute of Health Economics, Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We welcome the government's decision to revise its power purchase agreement with Adani Group in light of skyrocketing coal prices, although we cannot help but wonder why such an unfavourable agreement to Bangladesh was signed in the first place \u2013 and that, too, in such a clandestine manner.\nBangladesh is set to buy 1,496MW of electricity from Adani Power Ltd for 25 years, under a contract signed by the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in 2017. The request for a review of the agreement came after Adani Power asked BPDB to issue a demand note to open letters of credit (LCs) for coal, in which the price of coal was quoted at USD 400 per metric tonne \u2013 a significantly higher amount than that paid by the local coal-fired power plants. To compare, the BPDB pays USD 245 per metric tonne for the coal used in the Payra power plant, USD 254.38 for S Alam and Rampal power plants, and USD 270 for the Barishal power plants.\nA recent report by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0has exposed the enormous degree to which the agreement would cost Bangladesh, after reviewing the 163-page confidential document.

The request for a review of the agreement came after Adani Power asked BPDB to issue a demand note to open letters of credit (LCs) for coal, in which the price of coal was quoted at USD 400 per metric tonne \u2013 a significantly higher amount than that paid by the local coal-fired power plants. To compare, the BPDB pays USD 245 per metric tonne for the coal used in the Payra power plant, USD 254.38 for S Alam and Rampal power plants, and USD 270 for the Barishal power plants.\nA recent report by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0has exposed the enormous degree to which the agreement would cost Bangladesh, after reviewing the 163-page confidential document.

        "full_article": "Coming a year before the general election, and nearly a year after the formation of the incumbent Election Commission, it is natural that the six by-polls held Wednesday would be viewed against the wider political backdrop. It was, therefore, frustrating to know how little things have changed, despite the relative lack of violence, which would have been something to look out for under different circumstances. It's quite evident now that any changes, or promises of changes, made over the past year or so only cemented the status quo, which doesn't bode well for our electoral future.\nIf we're to pick a word to summarise the by-polls, it would be \"absence\" \u2013 absence of voters, absence of interest from the wider society, absence of strong safeguards against irregularities,\u00a0absence of main opposition BNP, whose lawmakers' resignation from parliament had led to the by-polls. Voter turnout was poor in all the six constituencies. As per an estimate, only about 28 percent of voters showed up, in a trend that has been persistent throughout all local elections and by-polls held over the last few years. The predictable nature of election outcomes, and the lack of trust about the neutrality of responsible state departments, seem to have caused ennui and despair among the people.\nIt seems almost futile to ask why the Election Commission is failing to address voter apathy despite repeated appeals from election observers. The EC, after the latest by-polls, again stuck to its \"peaceful and well-organised\" narrative, even though we have received reports of various election-related irregularities from a number of constituencies. The EC's failure to recognise that the mere appearance of elections is not enough is really alarming. We need fair and participatory elections. And we need the EC to restore the trust of all voters and opposition parties alike.\nAnother major concern about the by-polls is the \"disappearance\" of the main rival of the eventual winner in the Brahmanbaria-2 by-poll. This by-poll \u2013 which saw a voter turnout of less than 16 percent, the lowest of all constituencies \u2013 has been in the news ever since the winner, expelled BNP leader Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan, was backed by the ruling Awami League, which didn't field a candidate there. Abu Asif Ahmed, an independent candidate, has been missing for about a week now. Which makes us wonder: why is nothing being done to find him? What message does it send to the political opponents of the ruling party? And how long will the EC refuse to address the concerns of the opposition parties?\nThe culture of fear, distrust and criminality that still plagues our electoral system must be removed, and the ruling party must play a leading role in this. Lack of violence in one election means nothing given how political violence and repression continue to occur in every other sphere. If anything, the recent by-polls have shown that we have remained stuck in the same spot for too long, and the authorities must allow genuine reforms to break this status quo. They must help create a level playing field for all parties, and restore public trust in the function of the electoral system.\n",

        "full_article": "Amid the many negative developments in the country's economy over the past few months including a declining remittance flow, volatility in the forex market and high inflation, to name but a few, some positive reports are also coming in. One of those is the significant increase in remittance receipt in January this year compared to its trend over previous months. Last month, the remittance money sent by the migrant overseas workers amounted to US$1.96 billion, informed central bank sources. This marked a 16 per cent growth in remittance compared to what it was (at US$1.69 billion) in December last year. What is notable here is that this was 14.9 per cent higher than the remittance receipt recorded in January 2022 when the country received US$170 billion from migrant workers. Though this amount of rise in remittance inflow cannot be said to be extraordinary, especially when one compares it to the receipts (of remittance) in August and the preceding months last year, it is still something to rejoice over. For the last month's remittance earning was the highest in five months. Though what lay behind this welcome turnaround is yet to become clear, it is definitely attributable to some extent to the strong measures taken by the central bank against money laundering. Also, the roles of the banks, especially the incentives they provided to the remitters did play their part. For instance, the lucrative exchange rate at Tk 107 for each remittance dollar acted as an inducement for many expatriate workers to send their money through the formal channel instead of informal ones including the illegal mode like hundi. However, it will be too early to say anything conclusive on the issue based on the remittance's performance in a single month. In that case, one would be required to watch the trend of remittance flow for some time more in the coming months. Even so, in the short run, the growth in remittance inflow is, hopefully, going to act as a morale booster for the economy. For the volatile foreign exchange market in particular, the increased inflow of remittance is expected to bring some stability. The extra remittance dollars in the country's foreign exchange reserve would also help reduce the country's current account deficit. One may note at this point that the central bank has adopted a belt-tightening policy to arrest the ever-widening current account deficit. Though it worked in some measure, it has also led to considerable reduction in the import of capital machinery and intermediate goods, which risks slowing down the nation's pace of industrial growth. Against this backdrop, if the positive trend in remittance receipts continues, it may help relax the central bank's restrictive import policy to a certain degree. Meanwhile, other developments including the report that there has been a marked rise in the overseas employment of Bangladeshi workers in recent months are no doubt uplifting. However, it has to be ensured at the same time that this fresh crop of expatriate workers send their hard earned dollars through the formal channel rather than the informal and illegal ones. On this score, the central bank should continue its policy of giving various stimuli to the migrant workers. Simultaneously, stricter monitoring by the central bank should be in place to hold the illegal means of money transfer in check.",

        "full_article": "The country's economic outlook for FY 2022-23 has been revised downward to 5.5 per cent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is not that Bangladesh has received only a scaled down projection, the economy is also slated to rebound in 2024. According to the World Economic Outlook Update 2023 report, GDP originally forecasted to grow at 6.0 per cent is now slated to grow at 5.5 per cent. This should not be thought of as the end of the world by anyone. The fact that Bangladesh managed to tackle the global pandemic in a positive manner goes to its credit. Indeed the country has received praise from the United Nations for having acted promptly to contain the pandemic with the fast rollout of a nationwide vaccination programme. Unfortunately for Bangladesh and many other nations, certain things have been beyond their control to influence. External factors such as the continuation of the war in Europe, the massive disruption of supply chain of essentials like edible oil and cereals, the volatility of the international oil and gas prices, to name but a few. With the reduction in inward remittance and dip in the RMG exports, while the import bill mushroomed to astronomical heights, the negative developments have taken a heavy toll on the economy. Things are not going to be rosy for the current fiscal.As the Bangladesh Taka has continued to depreciate on the back of falling foreign exchange reserves, policymakers were forced to approach multilateral agencies like the IMF and the World Bank (WB) for budgetary support. In the midst of all this gloom came the news of fresh scandals in the financial sector, which have undermined public confidence somewhat, but not to the extent that the economy cannot recover from it. That the national exchequer can no longer afford to keep subsiding energy sources - a significant portion of which is being imported from foreign sources has brought about new uncertainties for the various productive sectors in the economy. Some industries are hugely gas-intensive and major producers in the areas of steel, ceramic and RMG are going to find it increasingly impossible to foot the revised gas bill. Certain industrial processes are entirely dependent on machinery that can only run on natural gas. The government has no choice but to lift subsidies that have been holding back gas prices. On top of energy crisis, the dearth of foreign exchange has put a lid on imports of raw materials amongst other things. That has led to price increases of everything from edibles to finished products. All in all, time is hardly propitious.When one takes into account the fact that the world economies will, according to the IMF, grow at 2.9 per cent rate in the current fiscal, the projection for Bangladesh's 5.5 per cent growth is actually very rosy. \"Global inflation is expected to fall from 8.8 per cent in 2022 to 6.6 per cent in 2023 and 4.3 per cent in 2024, still above pre-pandemic (2017-19) levels of about 3.5 per cent.\" However, the IMF's projection for Bangladesh is at the other end of the spectrum. Inflation is expected to average around 8.9 per cent throughout the year, and only begin to ease off in 2024.For Bangladesh, this year is one of make-or-break undertaking. The RMG sector is the single largest employer of people. Any hiccups in terms of energy supplies to this sector will mean large scale shutdown of factories and hundreds of thousands unemployed. When energy crisis is extended to other sectors, the domino effect will apply. Blaming Russia-Ukraine war and external factors will do little to help matters. As the country is facing a serious threat to the production side of things, why are policymakers talking about renewable energy now? An all-out drive to explore every inch of the country aimed at finding new gas reserves ought to be there. Why is 1.0 billion tons of coal allowed to stay idle under the soil? Where is the new coal policy that will attract serious foreign investment in the sector? Why is the proposed pipeline from India to Bangladesh not being explored? Why is there no effort to import cheap Russian oil (if necessary, via a third country)? Bangladesh needs energy now. Its proven 8.0 tcf (trillion cubic feet) gas is a finite resource. Bangladesh can continue to keep draining its known gas fields, but there must be vigorous efforts to find new onshore gas reserve. The revised off-shore drilling PSC will take many years to operationalise. Energy experts state that from signing of contract to getting gas in the grid (from offshore) is around eight years in the making. Should Bangladesh sign contract for coal extraction today, the first commercially available coal is five years away. These are the ground realities. Bangladesh cannot be a \"smart\" country if it has no energy to power its industry or agriculture (if no diesel-run pumps, no irrigation, no solar-powered diesel pumps, no irrigation). It is good to know that some economists are hopeful that the global economy will start recovering from 2024. Bangladesh has to ride out the rough times of 2023. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The month-long Amor Ekeshey Boimela was inaugurated last week. It is the largest national book fair in the country, for which book lovers wait for the rest of the year. Notwithstanding many odds, it is the most vibrant gathering spot for writers, publishers, and readers. The Bangla Academy, with the help of publishers and support from the cultural ministry, has been organising the book fair for more than four decades, drawing huge crowds. More than five decades ago, the concept of the book fair was introduced by Sardar Jainuddin and Fazle Rabbi of Bangla Academy in Dhaka, and professor Sharif Hossain in Jessore. Jainuddin organised a day-long children's book fair in Dhaka in 1965 under the banner of the national book centre. Two years later, in 1967, Sharif Hossain organised a week-long book fair in Jashore, the first of its kind in the country. Then in1970, Jainuddin and Rabbi played a leading role in organising a week-long book fair in Narayanganj. Sudhijan Pathagar, a public library in the locality, with support from the national book centre and the National Board of Development for Bangla (which later merged with Bangla Academy), was the organiser.After the independence of Bangladesh, the first book fair was held in December 1972 on the premise of Bangla Academy in Dhaka. During the commemoration of the language martyr's day on February 21, a few publishers displayed their books on the footpath adjoining the main gate of Bangla Academy. Chittaranjan Shaha of Muktodhara and Ruhul Amin Nizami of Standard Publishers led the display and sales of books in an open public space. Some others also joined them in the years to come. As the number of publishers grew, the demand for an organised event also increased. Finally, Bangla Academy decided to organise Amor Ekushe Boimela in February every year, and the first book fair took shape in 1980.The brief history of the book fair showed that it was the children for whom the first exhibition was organised 58 years ago! The organisers rightly identified that children need to know the wonderful world of books and encouraged reading for pleasure. Today, the book fair at Bangla Academy has dedicated hours and premises to children, which is a good thing. It encourages guardians to bring their children to book fair and introduce them to books. Thanks to the expansion of online marketing, selling and distributing, it becomes easier to collect almost any book that appeared in the book fair. Thus, it is not always necessary to come and visit the book fair to collect the desired titles. Nevertheless, encouraging children to read books for pleasure and fun becomes difficult for various reasons. First, workloads of school textbooks have reduced the time for reading books for fun. Besides class and homework, most parents are worried about the results of tests. They keep their children busy with private tutors or coaching centres to overcome their worries. After school and coaching or private tutors, the children do not have any mood to read books of stories or other types. They are also facing the constraint of time. Instead, most of them utilise their spare time to browse the internet on smartphones and laptops. Children are engaging themselves in virtual games instead of participating sports and games. Thus, there is little time to read and enjoy books.Unfortunately, almost no one cares about the damaging future of the children and the country. A society of anti-book or with apathy towards books is gradually taking shape where a dislike for books and opposition to reading for pleasure and enlightenment will prevail in the long run. Reversing the course is essential. The first step is to allow sufficient time for children to read and enjoy. [email\u00a0protected]",

The condition of toilets, floors, bad odour, overcrowding, noise, and unfriendly behaviour by nurses and doctors are causing a great deal of distress to patients and their families. This situation not only creates an unpleasant environment, but also poses a serious threat to the health and well-being of patients. This can never be acceptable in any healthcare setting, where patients come to seek medical care and comfort. Furthermore, surging medical bills add woes to the already stressful situation of patients. It is a matter of great concern that patients are forced to bear such a burden at a time when they are already dealing with health issues. I urge the authorities concerned to take immediate action to improve the conditions in hospitals and care facilities. This can be done by increasing the standards of hygiene, ensuring cleanliness, reducing noise levels, and improving the behaviour of healthcare providers. It is also important to address the root cause of the problem, which is the shortage of healthcare staff and funding. The government must take steps to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the healthcare sector so that patients can receive the care and attention they deserve. Thousands of patients go abroad every year for better treatment. Against the backdrop of increasing number of patients rushing out of the country for medical treatment, the health ministry has a big role to play. It should take necessary initiatives to bring about qualitative change in public hospitals and clinics in the country by upgrading their existing equipment and facilities and bringing in state-of-the-art technology. In this way, the medicare industry will flourish and if sophisticated and modern treatment is made available, people will feel discouraged to go abroad for healthcare.
