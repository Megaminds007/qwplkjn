The take-off trajectory of the country\u2019s IT services sector, unleashed after critical economic reforms in 1991, is well known. The firm takes a broader view of India\u2019s services exports over the last 18 years, including professional consulting, that have grown the fastest, travel services which have grown the slowest, and financial services that could gain if initiatives such as the GIFT City click. While global services exports tripled over 18 years, such intangible exports from India grew at twice the pace to reach nearly $340 billion last year. In fact, its exports growth has been the third fastest globally since 2005, behind Singapore and Ireland. The country\u2019s share in global services outflows has risen from under 2% in 2005 to 4.6% in 2023. India\u2019s share in goods exports increased from 1% to 1.8% during this period.The services trade boom has also served as an invaluable cushion for India\u2019s external account balances against shocks such as pricey oil imports. Goldman Sachs expects that buffer to remain in play with services exports projected to rise to $800 billion by 2030. While this is slightly lower than the government\u2019s target of $1 trillion by 2030 for both services and merchandise exports, a continuing uptick in high-value services would also drive top-end discretionary consumption and real estate demand, the firm reckoned. In the immediate term, the outlook is tentative as top firms in IT services, still India\u2019s most dominant export segment, have shed employees over the past year and their growth guidance for this year is far from bullish. Infosys, for instance, expects revenues to rise 1% to 3% this year in constant currency terms. The rise of global capability centres offers some comfort. However, the firm\u2019s analysts stress it would be imprudent to take India\u2019s services growth for granted. Constraints that need attention include training graduates to be job ready, and the stress on natural resources in regions where growth is concentrated, as reflected in the water crisis at Bengaluru. A protectionist tendency in destination countries could hurt exports, just as irrational domestic policy interventions such as attempts to \u201cmanage\u201d IT hardware imports. India needs a calibrated approach to sustain the services success story. That should include a hard push for global market access and opportunities for all professional services, as well as a light-touch regulatory approach to let new ideas and enterprises bloom across areas such as artificial intelligence, manufacturing-linked services, and blockchain applications. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nconsultancy service\n\n/\n\nexports\n\n/\n\nSingapore\n\n/\n\nIreland\n\n/\n\noil and gas - upstream activities\n\n/\n\nIT Enabled Services\n\n/\n\nemployee\n\n/\n\nwater\n\n/\n\nbengaluru\n\n/\n\nhardware\n\n/\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n/\n\nmanufacturing and engineering\n\n/\n\ntechnology (general)",

        "full_article": "India may be roiling in heatwaves but the possibility of a munificent monsoon, as envisaged by the India Meteorological Department, may be contributing to some psychological relief. In the long run, however, there is much to be worried about. A recent study led by scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and other international institutions has forecast \u2014 based on expected global carbon emission trends \u2014 the likely impact on the Indian Ocean. They report that the Indian Ocean warmed 1.2\u00b0C and will likely heat up 1.7\u00b0 C-3.8\u00b0 C from 2020 to 2100. While heatwaves are a lived experience, the study warns of \u2018marine heatwaves\u2019, their counterparts in the sea and linked to the rapid formation of cyclones, as likely to increase tenfold from the current average of 20 days per year to 220\u2013250 days per year. This will push the tropical Indian Ocean into a \u201cnear-permanent heatwave state\u201d, accelerate coral bleaching and harm the fisheries sector. The heating of the ocean would not be merely confined to the surface but actually increase the heat content of the ocean. When measured from the surface to 2,000 meters below, the thermal capacity of this ocean is now rising at the rate of 4.5 zetta-joules per decade, and is predicted to increase at a rate of 16\u201322 zetta-joules per decade in the future. Joule is a unit of energy and 1 zetta joule is a billion-trillion joules (10^21).The consequences of a warming Indian Ocean extend very much into mainland India with the frequency of severe cyclones rising and the monsoon becoming more erratic and uneven with long spells of drought followed by intense rain and concomitant flooding. These are linked to global warming with anthropogenic sources such as fossil fuel burning playing a significant role in nudging the planet closer to cataclysmic tipping points. Current global commitments to stem greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to make a significant dent in the state of the oceans capacity as unlike on land, the seas respond slower to changes in external inputs. Therefore, a realistic way out is to fine-tune the understanding of the Indian Ocean\u2019s local impact. India needs to form a collaborative association with countries bordering the Indian Ocean to invest in data gathering \u2014 currently this pales in comparison to what is in the Pacific, for instance \u2014 and projections to guide the development and protection of infrastructure and people. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nMonsoon\n\n/\n\nweather\n\n/\n\noceans\n\n/\n\nheatwave\n\n/\n\nglobal warming\n\n/\n\nPune",

What the world prizes is political stability and policy predictability, he argues\nThe world today is turbulent and unpredictable. Many countries have still to recover from the socio-economic damage of Covid. A conflict now in its third year in Ukraine has had serious impact on energy, food and fertiliser security. Fighting in West Asia triggered by the Oct 2023 terror attack on Israel could escalate into something wider. Drone and missile attacks in Red Sea are disrupting global shipping, even as piracy in Gulf of Aden becomes more threatening.\nIn Asia, territorial claims and disregard for law and agreements have created new tensions. The longstanding challenge of terrorism remains, waxing and waning, but still, always there.\n\nFor India, these larger uncertainties are compounded by the pressure on LAC with China, the threat of crossborder terrorism and the instability on its Myanmar border. Each of these challenges has been met with an appropriate response. But the overall scenario only highlights the need for a strong, clear-headed and capable leadership in the days ahead.\nRead full story on TOI +\n\n",

That\u2019s the most likely explanation for JDS suspending Prajwal Revanna, grandson of the party president, who has been accused of sexually exploiting women. Political parties typically push back against similar accusations made against powerful functionaries.\nRevanna contested the Hassan LS seat on NDA platform. He was then already under a cloud. Last June, he successfully moved a civil court to obtain a gag order against the media bringing up the issue. Subsequently, a local BJP functionary publicly brought it up.\nLook away, deny\u00a0| The sequence of events in the Revanna case is not uncommon. Neither is it unique to political parties. It\u2019s a pattern of behaviour found in all walks.\nAsymmetrical power structures are vulnerable to exploitation. That\u2019s been the root cause of most sexual exploitation cases. It makes it hard for victims to fight back and ensures a culture of silence that allows perpetrators to get away.\nJustice, a lonely pursuit\u00a0| The power asymmetry also undermines efforts to secure justice. For example, it took the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention to get Delhi Police to file an FIR in the case of Brij Bhushan Singh. If not for an uncommon effort by wrestlers, including an Olympic medallist, it\u2019s unlikely that there would be enough popular pressure to reach the stage where a chargesheet has been filed.\nIt\u2019s the obstacles placed at every step that make it hard for women to find the wherewithal to go through a process seeking justice.\n\u00a0\n\nWhose reputation?\u00a0| Karnataka has appointed an SIT to investigate the complaints against Revanna, who has reportedly left the country. He last year convinced the judiciary to gag the media to protect his reputation. It\u2019s a cruel irony that the powerful can use reputation as a reason to prevent exposure, but it\u2019s the victims whose reputation is damaged by subsequent slander. At every stage they face a hostile system.\nFocus on the present\u00a0| It\u2019s important that the SIT gets to the bottom of the matter and not get distracted by the inevitable politicisation of the complaint because of election season. Society too has a role here. To provide a safe environment for women, we don\u2019t need to look to a distant past and pat ourselves. What matters is the environment that women face now. As so many cases have shown, India\u2019s institutions have fallen short.\n\n",

Why did regulator need court orders to act?\nYesterday, Supreme Court was unsparing in its takedown of Uttarakhand\u2019s state licensing authority over its inaction in cracking down on Patanjali and its associate ayurved factory Divya Pharmacy\u2019s malpractices. \u201cIt was only after our order that you realised that there is a law \u2013 Drugs and Magic Remedies Act,\u201d SC said.\nBan on ads | Yoga trainer-\u2018activist\u2019-businessman Ramdev\u2019s project Patanjali has for years advertised its full range of ayurved drugs, across every medium available. Indian law in very clear terms bans advertising, direct or indirect, in any form, for a range of diseases and conditions, regardless of (1) efficacy of drug (2) promise of cure or therapy. The Drugs and Magic Remedies Act (Objectionable Ads) states that for 54 conditions/ diseases, advertising of any cure or therapy is banned.\n\nThe case | SC has been hearing Indian Medical Association\u2019s (IMA) writ petition against Patanjali\u2019s misleading ads, including its claim to have completely cured diabetes and asthma through medicine and yoga. Given Patanjali\u2019s dual business as a pharma company and FMCG, IMA\u2019s petition focused on misleading ads of its drugs, under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954. Given the case\u2019s gravity, and a defiant Patanjali, SC strongly criticised Patanjali for persisting in publishing deceptive claims and ads against modern medical systems, warning it in Nov 2023 of a fine of \u20b91cr if Ramdev and his company persisted.\nThe upshot | Uttarakhand\u2019s licensing authority told SC that in mid-April it had suspended Patanjali\u2019s licences to manufacture 14 drugs, under Rule 159(1) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1945. SC remains unimpressed, as it should. State licensing bodies are drug inspectors of Indian medicine. The Uttarakhand body has failed the public it serves in not acting against Patanjali at the first appearance of an ad that\u2019s banned in law.\n\n",
