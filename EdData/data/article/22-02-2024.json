Yet, the election of Chandigarh\u2019s Mayor has emerged as a microcosm of the sort of serious electoral malpractice that can undermine democracy. The Supreme Court of India, while declaring the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Kuldeep Kumar as the duly elected Mayor, has exposed a malaise that is not often recognised in the great Indian election scene: the role of officials in helping parties steal elections through fraudulent means during counting. The act of the Returning Officer, Anil Masih, in marking or defacing ballot papers, was not only captured on camera but was also proven to be a ruse to declare invalid votes that were validly cast in Mr. Kumar\u2019s favour. Mr. Masih, a man with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) affiliation, appears to have committed the illegality to help Manoj Sonkar, the BJP candidate, win the mayoral election, but it ultimately backfired on him, as the apex court has initiated the process to prosecute him for giving false information to the Court. Ever since he controversially declared Mr. Sonkar elected after ruling eight votes invalid, Mr. Masih had sought to brazen it out by claiming that the votes were invalid as they were defaced. His claim was shown to be false, as the Court found nothing on the ballots indicating defacement.When Mr. Sonkar resigned from his post on the eve of the hearing, the Court was alive to the possibility that the BJP was looking for a reason to have a fresh election, as by that time, it had won over three AAP councillors to its side, a development that may impede the new Mayor\u2019s functioning. The Court warned against the democratic process being set at naught by \u201csubterfuge\u201d. It was, therefore, logical that it did not order a fresh election, but decided to go ahead with the original votes, taking into account the valid votes illegally declared invalid. There is little doubt that the development is a setback to the BJP, which seems to have resorted to the fraud with the aim of subverting the cooperation between the Congress and the AAP, which are part of the Opposition INDIA bloc and had forged an alliance for the municipal election. BJP president J.P. Nadda had sought to use the election result to underscore the failure of both arithmetic and chemistry in the Opposition alliance, but will now have to deal with the party\u2019s loss of face. It was indeed a fit case for the Court to invoke its extraordinary powers to decide on fact who actually won the election. The prosecution of Mr. Masih should also establish at whose behest he had resorted to such flagrant fraud.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChandigarh\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nlocal elections",

Acceptance of such [a] patriarchal rule undermines human dignity, right to non-discrimination and fair treatment.\u201d The observations were part of an order which upheld the rights of Selina John, a former lieutenant and Permanent Commissioner Officer in the Military Nursing Service, who was discharged from service in 1988 for getting married. A Bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna directed the Union Government to pay Ms. John \u20b960 lakh in compensation within eight weeks. The government had appealed in the top court against a decision of the Lucknow Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal which had ruled in her favour in 2016. Pointing out that her dismissal was \u201cwrong and illegal\u201d, the Court noted that the rule against marriage was applicable only to women nursing officers. Women have been fighting a long and uphill battle for gender parity in the Army \u2014 they were granted permanent commission after judgments in 2020 and 2021. Words to the effect that the Indian Army is encouraging more women to join the forces have to be backed by deeds.It is not that the civilian space is much better off, and women are often asked uncomfortable personal questions at job interviews. They are quizzed about future plans on marriage and motherhood. If labour participation of women in the workforce has to increase \u2014 in the latest Periodic Labour Force data (October-December 2023), India\u2019s is at an abysmal 19.9% for women of all ages \u2014 then barriers in education, employment, and opportunities, not to talk of bullying mindsets, have to be broken down. It is a fact that many girls, especially among the poor, have to drop out of school for various reasons, from economic to lack of proper toilets. The UN\u2019s Gender Snapshot 2023 had provided a grim picture of where the world is on gender parity, pointing out that if course correction measures are not taken, the next generation of women will still spend a disproportionate amount of time on housework and duties compared to men, and stay off leadership roles. The schemes routinely announced by the government for girls and women will mean little on the ground if they have to abide by restrictive social and cultural norms. The Court\u2019s words that rules making marriage of women employees and their domestic involvement a ground for disentitlement are unconstitutional should be heard by all organisations so that the workplace becomes an enabler, and not a hurdle. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nmarriage\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nsocial issue\n\n/\n\ndefence\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations",

AAP\u2019s candidate has been declared winner, in place of BJP\u2019s. The apex court did the right thing. And its judgment is a much-needed reminder that integrity of elections is what builds trust in a democracy.\n\nComplete justice |\u00a0SC invoked the Constitution\u2019s Article 142 to underpin its verdict. This clause allows it to pass an order that will ensure \u201ccomplete justice\u201d. It signals the seriousness with which the court viewed the situation.\nNo case for re-election |\u00a0Once evidence of the presiding officer\u2019s measures to rig the election surfaced, questions on a re-election came up. SC rightly turned down that argument because a physical examination of ballot papers suggested otherwise. The municipal corporation has regulations that lay out conditions under which a ballot paper is invalid. Not one of those conditions was met. Therefore, the electoral process didn\u2019t have a problem. It was the action of the presiding officer at the counting stage that contaminated the result.\nProsecution as deterrence |\u00a0The presiding officer not only tried to rig the result but he also misled the court. SC initiated criminal proceedings against him. There should be consequences for tampering with results of an election. Absent that, there\u2019s no deterrence.\nSpeed is the key |\u00a0A factor that made SC\u2019s verdict significant for all polls is the short timeline in which it reached a conclusion. In contrast, SC\u2019s verdict on MVA govt\u2019s fall in Maharashtra came almost a year later. For SC to then say Maha governor was incorrect in calling for a no-confidence motion was judicially correct but practically of little use. In electoral malpractice cases, justice delayed is emphatically justice denied.\nEC and elections |\u00a0India\u2019s track record of ensuring integrity of elections has been excellent mainly on account of EC\u2019s efforts. Under difficult circumstances, EC has ensured that India never had to experience chaotic situations like US did in 2020 presidential elections.\nChandigarh\u2019s municipal poll didn\u2019t come under the purview of EC. It was therefore important that SC quickly wrapped up this case. All officials, from police or administration, who will be working for EC during general elections, will now know even more that fairness is non-negotiable.\n\n",

At least in the experience of these women, attitudes of the Great Indian Family have undergone a sea change. In a virtuous circle, so has their self-confidence.\n\n\nYoung Indian women are going places |\u00a0Education consultants indicate that applications from female students have jumped from 20-30% in FY21 to 40-45% in FY24. That\u2019s a dramatic jump. It\u2019s not confined to the metros either. Non-metro cities and small towns are behaving similarly. Young, educated women are making economically and socially bold decisions. To pursue success in their own rights. Take udaan.\n\nBut are young men keeping up? |\u00a0A 2020 YouGov-Mint-CPR Millennial Survey found that even as educated men and women now have no difference in their career aspirations, the latter tend towards liberalism much more. Women are more likely to have close friendships outside their own caste, religion and gender.\n\nGender gap is global |\u00a0Actually liberal attitudes between Gen Z women and men seem to be undergoing a global divergence. In US, youth gender gap in identifying as liberal first passed 10 points when Trump took office. It now stands at 15 percentage points, five times larger than in 2000. Germany has a comparable gender divergence of 30 points and UK 25.

Between 2018 and 2023, BJP raked in \u20b96,566 crore by way of such bonds, over five times more than Congress with \u20b91,123 crore, and Trinamool coming in third with \u20b91,093 crore. That\u2019s one heck of a lot of corporate-politics bonding.\nDeclaring the bond scheme to be unconstitutional by enabling Big Business literally to buy democracy through money power, subverting the principle of One Citizen, One Vote, SC has banned bonds and directed that the identities of the donors of these instruments be made public.\nPredictably, opposition has lauded the judgment for making transparent from where the wherewithal comes to fill the war chests with which political parties fight the battle of the ballot box. Equally predictably, BJP has decried the ruling in that it will not only bring back the bad old days of cash-and-carry elections \u2013 whoever has more cash carries the votes \u2013 but the directive to disclose the names of donors violates their right to privacy.\nFor instance, if it became public knowledge that XYZ Company had doled out large sums to ABC Party and ABC\u2019s opponent, DEF Party were to come into power, then in political vendetta DEF Party could try to scupper XYZ Company by setting upon it other alphabetic organisations, like ED and CBI.\nDonations to parties up to \u20b920,000 can be made anonymously, but the source of anything above that amount must be revealed.\nHowever, Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPP) of which there are 2,597 in India, could act as conduits for untraceable donations, showing that political ingenuity can take RUPP with the smooth.\n\n",

So the cliche of 'ease of doing business' is overused as a marker of trade facilities existent in a country. Infrastructure and logistics together are a sure indicator of the facilities to drive trade particularly export and import as well as foreign investment. There is an institutional shape of the state of logistical support called Agility Emerging Markets Logistics Index that measures the emerging countries' related scores. The Kuwait-based global logistics company published its 15th annual edition on February 6 last in which Bangladesh moved two notches up but still lags behind the other three South Asian economies. India ranks second in the Agility Emerging Markets Logistics Index 2024 followed by Sri Lanka at a distant 26th, Pakistan at 29th position and Bangladesh at 33rd \u2013 two notches up from 2023's 35th. China duly holds the pole position.The good news is that the poor performances have prompted Bangladesh to frame a business-friendly logistics policy, first of its kind. One wonders why the country had to wait so long for this broad guideline aimed at reducing the lead time for customs clearance and other formalities for export and import to the minimum. That 20 government agencies and nine ministries are involved with the logistics sectors speaks volumes for the bureaucratic lengthy process through which the system is at work. Similarly, yet to be automated fully, customs clearance falls short of overcoming complicated procedures as 20 manual signatures are still required to accomplish the job, causing delay. In this age of digitisation when the government is determined to build a smart Bangladesh, such backwardness inherent in the system is contrary to the aspiration of the administration and the people. There has to be a paradigm shift in the mentality of the bureaucratic behemoth if the country has to stay competitive in business at least among the emerging nations. There has been some phenomenal infrastructure development by this time but logistics support means more than mega projects. Enabling policy complemented by removal of bottlenecks that unduly delay release of the exportable and importable goods and capital machinery at ports can bring down the lead time \u2013 a key to giving an edge over rival competitors. As long as the bureaucratic tangles remain intractable, this lead-time will remain elusive. Development of appropriate logistics with duly taken care of the knotty points should be the objective of the policy now underway of finalisation. To that end a lead-time coordinating authority must be set up. It will be manned with knowledgeable and smart people well versed with the complicated procedures of customs clearance, export and import and at the same time know how to handle sophisticated gadgets to detect false import-export declarations. Making the process easier for trade does not necessarily mean that the dishonest and motivated black sheep in the business community will get away with their nefarious business. In a nut shell, such a dedicated lead authority will be expected to provide institutional support and coordination for facilitating the country's overall business.",

        "full_article": "Collection of illegal tolls on highways during the transportation of goods is one of the major factors contributing to the price hike of essential commodities. It is, however, nothing new. It is as old a practice as is the story of government failure in taking action against the highway extortionists belonging to the unholy nexus of some corrupt politicians, errant police personnel, and rowdy musclemen. The same old tale came to the fore once again when former Foreign Minister Abdul Momen, an MP from Sylhet-1 constituency, recently vented his frustration before the national parliament.He said small and medium businessmen of his area had complained to him they were being forced by criminals to pay Tk 5,000 to Tk 10,000 per truck while carrying daily necessities such as vegetables and sugar. If traders refused to pay, the drivers had their trucks hijacked. He demanded this sort of 'oppression of traders' to be stopped.Highway extortion, however, is not a cause for concern for traders in the constituency of the said MP alone. Traders all over the country are faced with this grim reality, which ultimately takes a toll on the economy and the people, as it adds to the cost of doing business and cost of living.Sensing the gravity of the situation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina early this month gave directives on at least a couple of occasions to lawmakers, bureaucrats and cops to stop extortion to bring down the rapidly rising prices of essential commodities. Reining in the galloping inflation horse is the new government's 'biggest priority', said the top leaders of ruling Awami League after retaining power for four consecutive terms in January 7 elections.In accordance with the government's priority, Bangladesh Bank in mid-January announced a contractionary monetary policy for the second half of this fiscal (January-June) with the aim of bringing down inflation rate to 7.5 per cent. The main objective of the MPS is to reduce money supply in the economy, which in turn is expected to help arrest inflation. But in spite of the tight money supply, the rate of inflation spiked from 9.41 per cent in December to 9.86 per cent in January, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).While it is too early to claim that the new monetary policy has failed to curv inflation, it is essential to recognise that curbing inflation in Bangladesh requires a multi-pronged approach. Relying solely on an orthodox monetary policy might not be enough, given the complex interplay of factors contributing to price hikes. Apart from demand-pull, cost-push and exchange rate factors, inflation in Bangladesh is also fuelled by market manipulation and rampant extortion of money from traders. So, pursuing a contractionary monetary policy without addressing the underlying factors might not prove to be very effective.Moreover, contractionary monetary policy comes with the risks of contraction of the economy, job cuts and economic slowdown. So, when the government is risking so much by following a tight monetary policy, it is simply untenable that unfair practices in the market and transportation network cannot be addressed.Syndicates are often blamed for destabilising the market. Raids are often conducted both at wholesale and retail markets. But if past experience is anything, this creates panic among traders but fail to make the goods cheaper. But the issue of stopping extortion has never been given the due attention it deserves for smooth operation of the market.The issue of extortion leading to price hike also came up during Sunday's meeting between the Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI) President Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan. BCI President categorically said the extortion practice is one of the major reasons for commodity prices not coming down. He informed the home minister that the prices of essential commodities could be reduced significantly if extortion was stopped during their transportation. Earlier, sections of businessmen submitted memorandums to the authorities concerned demanding an end to the extortion on highways, but to no avail.One may get an idea of how widespread and deep-rooted the highway extortion menace has become from a recent investigative report of a national daily. According to the report, a reporter of the daily went undercover as a trader by boarding a truck carrying potatoes from the Saidpur in Nilphamari to Narayanganj, and he witnessed that the truck was stopped either by policemen or their representatives in no less than 14 spots along the 353km stretch of highway to collect tolls. The truck driver and his assistant ended up paying Tk 5,400 in that single trip. Moreover, there are monthly tolls to be paid.The traders alleged that they need to pay a sum of around Tk 10,000 in total (spot payment plus monthly toll) for bringing agricultural products from the northern districts to Dhaka and its adjacent areas. Just imagine how much money is made by collecting daily tolls from thousands of goods-laden trucks plying on the country's highways. Obviously, extortion is not limited to transportation of goods alone. The shoppers and vendors are also victims of this ever-escalating crime. Ultimately, it is the common consumers who bear the brunt of this evil practice.While extortion by unruly party activists and local criminals has long been regarded as an aspect of the country's deteriorating law and order and unhealthy political culture, the picture becomes even more muddied and complicated when lawmen themselves are found to be in the forefront of the extortion racket.Extortion on the roads and highways across the country is not being carried out clandestinely; it is done very much openly in defiance of all rules and authority, and not by one or two wayward policepersons but by a syndicate. The government could very easily end this menace if it wanted to. It could prove the allegation by deploying intelligence service, secret camera, etc. But so far no concrete measure has been taken to stop the rot. Even the 'routine supervision' of the police department seems to be mere eyewash and traders and consumers are left to the mercy of a section of corrupt highway police and tugs.Police authorities say they can take action after they receive a complaint, but toll collection is done so openly official complaints are unnecessary. It is just a matter of observing and monitoring. Furthermore, traders are reluctant to lodge formal complaints fearing retaliatory action that may affect their person and their business. The attitude of the police administration amounts to showing indulgence to corruption. If the government seriously intends to curb corruption and halt the escalating prices of essentials it should be reflected in its action.It is said that where there is a will, there is a way. But if the thriving illegal extortion rackets on the highway proves anything, it is that the authorities had actually lost their will to curb this illegal toll collection. It is high time to address this lingering problem if the government truly wants to bring down prices of essential commodities, otherwise it will blunt the tight monetary policy, which in turn will further aggravate the country's economic woes.[email\u00a0protected]",

The application of scientific technology in agriculture has helped us to increase our food and grain production manifold compared to that of the two decades ago.But with the adverse impact of climate change intensifying, rapid industrialisation and increased use of land for physical infrastructures the availability of cultivable land is falling down.In such a circumstances contract farming is seems to be an unique opportunity for ensuring food security.According to a report published in the FE, several countries in Africa have agreed to provide Bangladeshi entrepreneurs land for farming.In 2021, Sudan placed contract farming proposal to Bangladesh.South Sudan has more than six lakh square kilometres of land, most of which are cultivable and fertile.Kenya also showed interest in offering 1,000 acres of land to Bangladeshi companies on lease for cotton cultivation. The advantage of contract farming -- no matter if it comes directly from government or the private sector -- is that it can choose the kinds of crops that are in demand both the contracting countries.African soil in general is useful for producing paddy, maize, onion and wheat, they said adding that for a land-scarce country with an outsizes population like Bangladesh, contract farming in the African continent can be a golden opportunity. As countries like Pakistan, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia - have already started investing in the agricultural sector of African countries like Sudan, Bangladesh should rush to take the opportunity.One of the main obstacles in this regard is the transfer of capital invested in those countries to Bangladesh, when such need arises.Many entrepreneurs backed out of the contract farming venture due to this problem.So taking immediate measures to resolve this issue is a must for availing this opportunity.Not only in African countries, regional countries like Sri Lanka can be a good destination for contract farming.Many in Sri Lanka felt that Bangladesh with it success story in agriculture, can be good partner in boosting Sri Lanka's agriculture sector. As Bangladesh provided forex support during the recent recession of the island country, it can also provide investment for contract farming there through which both the countries will be benefited.Actually, the move for contract farming was initiated in 2010 but no significant output could be made due to half-hearted approach by the officials concerned.Official delegations were sent, seminars were held and we heard tall talks from the policymakers but policies for accomplishing the tasks were not framed.So, it's time for our policymakers to pull their shocks up and start action to reap the dividends of contract farming.[email\u00a0protected]",

This proposal stems from a sincere concern for the well-being of the students and the broader university community.The absence of a pharmacy on campus poses challenges for students seeking timely access to medications and health-related essentials. A dedicated pharmacy within the university premises would not only offer convenience but also serve as a proactive measure to address health emergencies promptly. In absence of a single pharmacy on the sprawling RU campus, residential students often have to go a long way outside the campus to buy medicine, which is not only time-consuming but also extremely difficult for students feeling unwell. By setting up a pharmacy on campus, RU can create a safer and more supportive environment for its students. Quick access to over-the-counter medications, prescription drugs, and basic healthcare supplies can significantly enhance the overall health and productivity of the student body.

Residential students of the university will be immensely benefitted from it.Md Tarek AliStudent, Department of SociologyUniversity of Rajshahi[email\u00a0protected]",
