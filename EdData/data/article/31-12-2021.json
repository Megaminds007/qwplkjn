Close on the heels of the news that the Missionaries of Charity group had been denied a renewal of its licence under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (amended in 2020), comes the revelation that more than four-fifths of the applications of the 22,000-plus NGOs that have sought renewal have yet to be scrutinised. Unless the Government extends the deadline by midnight, all of them stand to lose their ability to access international funding in the new year. As experts have explained, the NGOs have to prove not only that the source of funding and their usage of the funds is appropriate but also establish that their work does not qualify as harmful to \u201cpublic interest\u201d or \u201cnational security\u201d \u2014 ambiguous terms that are left to MHA officials to define. So, as many as 2,000 NGOs under scrutiny may be denied a renewal of their FCRA licence as the Missionaries of Charity and its roughly 200 homes around the country have been in this round.Contrary to the Government\u2019s defence that it is only following accounting and audit procedures, it seems clear that organisations that have particularly faced the Modi government\u2019s ire are those that work in specific \u201csensitive areas\u201d: pollution and climate change issues, human rights, child labour and human slavery, health and religious NGOs, particularly Christian and Islamic charities. Prominent names among nearly 20,000 NGOs to have lost their foreign-funding licences since 2014 include Amnesty International, Greenpeace India, People\u2019s Watch, European Climate Foundation, Compassion International and the Gates Foundation-backed Public Health Foundation of India. If the Government has ample evidence to prove that Indians are better off without the work of these internationally renowned organisations, then it has yet to show it. It is time the Government gives a more transparent account of its actions against NGOs, which at present appear to mirror those in China and Russia which have used their NGO laws to shut down dissent and criticism. The actions in India over \u201cforeign hand\u201d concerns seem more hypocritical given the relative ease with which political parties are able to access foreign funds for their campaigns through electoral bonds, under the same FCRA that seeks to restrict funds to NGOs. At a time when India is facing the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a long-term economic crisis, the Government\u2019s moves that have resulted in an estimated 30% drop in international non-profit contributions, only hurt the poorest and most vulnerable recipients of philanthropic efforts, particularly those by NGOs working in areas where government aid fails to reach.",

        "full_article": "Ever since the maiden Test at Melbourne during March 1877, cricketing history always had a special place for the Ashes, the series that involves England and Australia, the rivals from that inaugural joust. The series-nomenclature Ashes was coined by a British newspaper in 1882 and that term and the trophy, the urn, have become part of sporting folklore. England lost the 1877 game and cut to the present, Old Blighty suffered defeat yet again at Melbourne to hand over the current Ashes at 0-3 to host Australia while two Tests still remain in the series. The juxtaposition of history and the present may seem like a one-way street but the Ashes remains far from it with Australia having won 34 and England 32 through a series that has attained mythical proportions over the decades. However, recent history would vouch for Australia\u2019s dominance with the Ashes being snapped up in 2017 and 2019, and the latest result too favours the former colony while the mother-country is resigned to eating humble pie. The three defeats in consecutive Tests have shown England in poor light. The will to fight seems to have declined and Joe Root\u2019s men have been tagged as the worst tourists to land in Australia and as it has been pointed out, all that the host needed was just 12 days to seize the urn.There have been times when England looked anaemic, especially in the contests in the 1980s against the marauding West Indians. To those tales of ignominy, cricket\u2019s birthplace has added the latest chapter. England\u2019s batting has leant on Root while his colleagues fell with tentative feet, itchy hands and an insipid mind. With the batters failing, England\u2019s attack has struggled to mount pressure. And when the bowlers did strike with James Anderson belying his 39 summers and clocking a masterly spell in Melbourne, the England batters failed to offer support and Australia won by an innings and 14 runs. Debutant Scott Boland\u2019s six for seven in the second innings further reiterated Australia\u2019s talent base and its strong domestic structure while England was left to ponder about its County circuit. That an injured Josh Hazlewood was not missed spoke volumes about the inherent strengths within the Aussie pace-pack. Boland showed that at 32, hope could still float for the committed athlete. That he is the second after Jason Gillespie to emerge from the aboriginal community to turn out for the Australian men\u2019s Test team also revealed cricket\u2019s democratic footprint. Before the series, Australia seemed unsettled having lost its regular captain Tim Paine to a hushed-up scandal. But in Pat Cummins, the Aussies have found a calm skipper, and with England in disarray, the Ashes will stay in the southern hemisphere.",

        "full_article": "South Asia is home to about a quarter of the world's population. Sprawling over eight countries, the region is a vibrant mosaic of various ethnicities, religions, cultures and languages. And the region\u2014having turned around after independence from the shackles of centuries of colonisation by the West\u2014is all set to embrace the next big growth spurt, with many of the countries already being on an upward growth trajectory.\nDespite the economic brunt of the global pandemic, South Asia is expected to achieve a 7.1 percent growth by 2022 as per the World Bank's recent South Asia Economic Focus, titled Shifting Gears: Digitization and Services-Led Development. As the report states, \"India's economy, South Asia's largest, is expected to grow by 8.3 percent in the fiscal year 2021-22, aided by an increase in public investment and incentives to boost manufacturing. In Bangladesh, continued recovery in exports and consumption will help growth rates pick up to 6.4 percent in fiscal year 2021-22. In Maldives, GDP is projected to grow by 22.3 percent in 2021, as tourism numbers recover.\" Pakistan and Sri Lanka are also forecasted to experience growth during this period.\nWhile the economic possibilities of the region remain highly promising, major socio-political challenges can stunt its growth in the long-run. Shrinking space for minorities is one such major hurdle that the region needs to overcome in order to realise its full potential.\nBangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, and Afghanistan, along with neighbouring Myanmar, are all plagued by the malady of minority suppression\u2014where people from various religious, ethnic, racial and marginalised backgrounds are finding themselves on increasingly shaky grounds; their rights being violated, and voices being smothered, by various actors.\nWhile discrimination against minority communities has been institutionalised in most of these countries through laws, policies and guidelines, these communities continue to suffer at the hands of various actors, not always necessarily state-sponsored.\u00a0\nIf we take a look at the condition of the minority communities at home, we would see an alarming increase in violence against them in the recent years. While the 2012 Ramu attacks, when 12 Buddhist temples and monasteries and 50 houses were destroyed, had shaken the roots of our communal harmony, it was not to be the last one of its kind. This was followed by episodes of communal violence in Nasirnagar, Rangpur and Bhola in 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Even this year, the Durga Puja celebrations were marred by communal violence that lasted for days, and spread across many parts of the country, leading to destruction of Hindu temples, houses and properties. What was supposed to have been an occasion to celebrate our communal harmony had turned into a nightmare for the people. And the constant failure of the state to bring to justice the culprits has only added to the belligerence of these criminals, who carry out such attacks with complete disregard for the laws, perhaps confident in the knowledge that the long arms of the law will never reach them.\nHowever, it is not just the religious minorities who face persecution in Bangladesh. One should remember the 2016 attacks on the Santal community in Gaibandha's Gobindaganj. The law enforcers, with the support of local ruling party leaders and their henchmen, opened fire on Santal men\u2014killing three people\u2014and torched their homes, leaving more than 2,500 families homeless. The incident has scarred the local Santal community. Of the affected Santal families, 1,500 are still living in fear of eviction, as they, along with some Bengali families, might be rendered homeless again as authorities are planning to set up an export processing zone where they now reside.\nThe situation is not so different in the backyard of our neighbour, India. Despite being home to about 200 million Muslims\u2014one of the largest minority groups in the country\u2014India is gradually deviating from its secular and pluralistic character that had been one of its pillars of strength for centuries. The unrest unleashed by the Modi government's hard-line approach against the Muslims\u2014expanding the scope of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) from Assam to other parts of the country; pushing for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and revoking special status of Kashmir through abolition of Article 370 of the Indian constitution\u2014among various others measures have pushed the Indian Muslims to a tight spot where they will find little room to ask for their rights.\nOnce the NRC and CAA are fully implemented, many of the Muslims in India will find themselves in no man's land. These measures will effectively render them homeless and put them in an identity crisis.\nMoreover, the recent attacks on Christian communities have left them feeling edgy and vulnerable. The controversy over the Indian government's refusal to renew license of Missionaries of Charity (MoC) under the Foreign Contributions Regulation (FCRA) Act, effectively limiting their funds, and the constant and baseless accusation against MOC of forced conversation, followed by subsequent threats of retribution are making the situation worse for the Christian population. The burning of Santa Clause effigies in many parts of the country, with the slogan \"Santa Clause murdabad\" during Christmas, is a sign of India's growing intolerance towards its minority communities, which in the long run could lead to increased religious tension in the country.\nIn predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, the Rohingya have been excluded from citizenship by successive governments. Especially after General Ne Win grabbed power in 1962, he systematically phased out Rohingyas from the citizenship law. Initially the constitution excluded those people from citizenship whose ancestors had entered the country after 1823. Later, in the 1974 constitution, only 134 \"national races\" were recognised, which did not include the Rohingya, who were treated as a non-indigenous minority. The Burma Citizenship Law of 1982 then stated that only children of the \"national races\" will be considered full citizens of the country. This was the final step in excluding the Rohingya from citizenship status.\nLater, over the decades, the Myanmar military has unleashed various ethnic cleansing and genocide operations to wipe out and drive out the Rohingya from Myanmar. The result: the Rohingyas have been entrapped into a perpetual state of displacement, wandering from land to land, living off the generosity of others, with no place to return to or call home.\nIn Sri Lanka, the anti-minority orientation of the Rajapaksa brothers\u2014President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2014is stoking communal tension and the policies being formulated are taking away from the rights of targeted minority groups. Muslims, Hindus and Christians, along with the Tamils, have been subjected to systemic discrimination because of their minority status, for decades. The 2019 Easter Bombings made the situation worse for Muslims, who have been treated as pariahs ever since.\nChristian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), a UK-based rights organisation, in a report titled \"A Nation Divided: The state of freedom of religion or belief in Sri Lanka\", suggested that the government was systematically discriminating against the Christians \"through legal means, via orders to close or register their places of worship,\" referring to a 2008 circular that was issued requiring all religions to seek permission from the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs to register and construct new places of worship. While in 2018, the same ministry stated that it was only applicable for the Buddhist religious sites, it is still sometimes referred to in order to create pressure on minority groups.\nAccording to the same report, the Hindu temples \"are coming under threat in the north-east as they are being replaced by Buddhist temples, and the grounds on which the kovils [temples] stand are being claimed as Buddhist archaeological sites by the Archaeological Department.\"\nThe report also elaborated on how the government actors are working to \"reduce the visibility of Islam through the destruction of mosques and restrictive stances on religious clothing.\" Earlier in April this year, the Sri Lankan cabinet approved a proposal to ban wearing burka in public places, citing terrorist threats. The country also plans on pulling the plug on 1,000 madrasas. The worst perhaps was the forced cremation of Muslims who died of Covid, given that cremation is forbidden in Islam.\nTalking about policies and legalities, Pakistan has one of world's strictest blasphemy laws, second only to Iran, according to US Commission on International Religious Freedom. In the last three decades, 1,500 Pakistanis have been charged under these laws, some of them even Muslims. And as if legal measures were not enough, 70 people have been lynched by mobs since 1990 on accusations of sacrilegious acts. The recent to fall was a Sri Lankan man who had been killed by a mob based on the same accusations. And the government does little to prevent these incidents of lynching. The Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Shia Hazaras, among other minority communities, live in constant fear for their lives.\nInstances of women and girls from minority communities getting abducted, raped, or converted and married to Muslim men are also very common in the country. In May 2020, a Hindu woman was sexually assaulted in a village in Sindh province. Her family was also attacked. This was revealed in a European Parliament report. In 2017, in Thar of Sindh province, a 14-year-old Hindu girl was abducted, converted into Islam and forced to marry a Muslim man, while her family was being held hostage.\nIn Afghanistan, the problems are multi-layered due the ethno-tribal construct of the nation and its turbulent political history. With various players coming to power over the decades, the tribes have witnessed highs and lows, at times exercising power, at times running away from the powers that be. However, one of the communities that has constantly been persecuted are the Hazaras, who had been the \"target of mass killings and other serious human rights violations by Taliban forces in the 1990s. They have faced discrimination and abuse by successive Afghan governments going back over 100 years,\" as reported by Human Rights Watch.\nIn Nepal and Maldives, minority persecution is mostly focused on the tvreligious lines. Particularly in Nepal, the Christians and Muslims among others, are often subjected to suppression based on their religious identities. The government passed a legislation in October 2017 that criminalises religious conversion. Even encouragement to convert is a criminal offense, with the punishment for the guilty parties including imprisonment for up to five years and fines amounting to USD 500.\nIn Maldives, where almost the entire population consists of Muslims\u2014about 98 percent of the total population\u2014there is very little space for other religions to have their say in national issues. And there are rifts even among the Muslim sects, with Sunni Islam being designated as the state religion and all the members of the government adhering to this sect. Non-Muslims are prevented from getting citizenship and religious exercises in public are prohibited for the minorities. And these are just some of the major problems faced by the very small segments of religious minority communities in the country.\nBhutan, despite being one of the more peaceful nations in the region, has a notorious history of ethnic cleansing of the Lhotshampa (or, ethnic Nepalis) dating back to the late 1980s. More than 100,000 Lhotshampa have been displaced from Bhutan and have had resort to migration for survival.\nThis constant suppression of the minority communities across South Asia should be a cause of concern for the region and its governments. The scenario is completely in contradiction of the region's overall narrative and objective of inclusive growth.\nWhile South Asia is one of the economically thriving regions of the world, such discords among the populations of the South Asian countries will act as a major hurdle in its quest for long-term prosperity. These unrests and conflicts, as a result of human rights violations of the minority groups, and targeted exclusion of certain communities from economic growth will dent the region's aspiration to become one of the economic powerhouses of the world.\nThe governments should rethink their growth strategy and assess the economic implication of these cases of minority persecution. The states need to realise that the minority communities have a major role to play in the economic growth of their countries. And unless all countries grow together, it will be difficult for the region to sustain its growth curve, because then there will invariably be factors that will pull the region backwards.\nIt is time for the South Asian leaders to rise above their individual agendas and work towards ensuring sustainable development for all, and this should be done in the spirit of the overarching SDG agenda to \"Leave no one behind\".\nIf we leave the minority communities behind, if we exclude them from our growth blueprint, neither will we be able to attain the SDGs, nor will we be able to prosper in the long run.\nFor the greater interest of the region and its people, the situation must be corrected now, and by all the states, under a common framework promoting inclusive prosperity.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "It seems that some of us are quite intrigued by the results of the Union Parishad (UP) elections that show official nominees of the ruling party, Awami League, having lost in a big way. According to Prothom Alo, AL nominees' percentage of losing the electoral battle gradually went up from 24 percent in the first phase to 49 percent by the fourth phase. Many critics of the government see it as a sign of serious erosion of popular support to the ruling party.\nThe fact, however, remains that most of the winners are so-called rebels of the AL and these elections were not a direct contest with AL's main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), as the latter boycotted these elections. The Information Minister, Hasan Mahmud, is right to point out that the rebels' win is also AL's win. However, his assertion that the Awami League is the only alternative to the Awami League is quite a different and much more serious issue. It raises a whole range of critical questions, including whether it reflects any intention of making the country a single-party state. And, the scale of rebellion within the party exposes how vicious and deadly the intra-party power struggle has been. The 70 or more death toll of the UP elections that essentially became a factional contest also shows the inability of the party's leadership to resolve internal conflict and build a disciplined party.\u00a0\nThese bloodstained UP elections, undoubtedly, have caused enormous pain to those families who have lost their near and dear ones and have left hundreds of others with life-changing injuries. But, it has also exposed the worst weaknesses of the ruling party, including the internecine rivalries between several factions. Factions led by MPs were competing against groups led by Upazila chairpersons or party functionaries. It, however, does not mean an automatic opportunity for the opposition parties to exploit the ruling party's weakness, as those power-hungry local government representatives are unlikely to remain rebellious for too long and are likely to be welcomed back soon to the ruling party.\nPress reports suggest voters' participation in these elections had indeed improved in the fourth phase. The proportion of uncontested winners has also declined in this phase.\nBut, despite these little improvements in the latest phase of these staggered elections, the performance of the EC remained woeful. These bloodstained UP elections are the latest addition to a very long list of the current EC's miserable failures in fulfilling their constitutional duties and obligations.\nIt is true that some degree of violence in most electoral contests in Bangladesh is not unexpected. But the spread and gravity due to the failure of the current EC to stand up to the hegemonic pressure from the party in power have hit new records. In the past, electoral violence was largely meant to stifle political competition, but under the current EC, it also disenfranchised the electorate.\nAs the President has initiated a process of consultation on the formation of the next EC, we need to remind ourselves of these facts, as restoring trust in the electoral mechanism and the institution in charge has now become too daunting a task. Questions have already been raised about the prospect of the President's dialogue as the opposing BNP and the few other remaining parties have already declined the invitation. There's some confusion too about the purpose of the presidential initiative as leaders of NAP, one of the parties who had met with the President, told the media afterwards that there had been no discussion on the so-called search committee, though we were told earlier by ministers that it was the precise objective.\nLeaders of a few other parties, allied with the ruling Awami League, have called for legislation to form the commission. It is quite interesting to note that none of these parties, despite having been partners of the ruling coalition for over a decade, have thought of and spoken about such legislation before. Had they felt the necessity of such legislation as they do today, they could have attempted to introduce a private member's bill in this regard long ago. Perhaps, this is an opportunistic position to align themselves with some citizens' groups who have been demanding enactment of a law codifying required qualifications and criterion for the appointment of election commissioners.\nThere's no doubt that a law can bring an end to the uncertainties and political wranglings every five years. But the most crucial question is: What is the incentive for the ruling party in agreeing to cede the power of influence over such a crucial constitutional body? On the contrary, if the ruling party codifies such a mechanism which gives an in-built advantage to the party in power, what would be the remedy? No wonder, the current CEC, KM Nurul Huda and his apparent in-house critic, commissioner Mahbub Talukder, have both called for a political consensus on the formation of the future EC. On September 22, Mahbub Talukder told the media that it was not possible to change the current state of elections without a political compromise. He said multi-party participation in elections was essential for multi-party democracy and uncontested elections have resulted in voters' aversion to elections which, according to him, was a bad omen for democracy. A week later, on September 29, CEC Nurul Huda echoed similar views when he said the commission should be based on the consensus of all parties.\nIt is, therefore, high time to push for a broader political dialogue and compromise on how to conduct the next election in an acceptable manner. Otherwise, the new commission would not be any better than the preceding two commissions.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed is an independent journalist.\nHis Twitter handle is @ahmedka1\n",

        "full_article": "The United States of America took three ominous actions related to Bangladesh in the 11-day period between December 11 and December 20.\nFirst, the US excluded Bangladesh from the \"The Summit for Democracy,\" an event initiated and hosted by the US from December 9 through 10, which welcomed 111 countries, including India, Nepal, and Pakistan from South Asia.\nSecond, on December 10, the US announced punitive actions against six current or former ranking officers of Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), including Benazir Ahmed, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the highest-ranking law enforcement officer of Bangladesh. Financial sanctions and travel bans were imposed on RAB officers by two executive departments of the US federal government, citing the violation of human rights, extra-judicial torture, and the killing of prisoners under RAB's custody. These same officers played a vital role in suppressing and crushing Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organisations that the US has declared as enemy combatants. Indeed, for its work, the RAB has garnered widespread accolades, including in a phone call between Antony J. Blinken, US Secretary of State, and the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, just two days after these officers were censured.\nThird, on December 20, the US State Department's Rewards for Justice (RFJ) programme announced a USD 5 million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the arrests of two fugitive convicts, Major (sacked) Syed Ziaul Haque and Akram Hussain of Ansar Al-Islam Bangla Team\u2014reportedly an offshoot of Al-Qaeda. Both convicts received death sentences by a Bangladeshi judge on February 16, 2021, in the murder case of Dr Avijit Roy, a US citizen, who was a famed writer and blogger. The murder happened six years earlier, on February 26, 2015, near the Dhaka University campus while Avijit was visiting Bangladesh. Out of the six defendants, five received the death penalty and one received a life sentence in prison.\nIt is clear from the RFJ's announcement that the US has reservations about Bangladesh's handling of this case. On one hand, it implicitly suggests some acceptance of the investigative and judicial processes of Bangladesh by explaining that \"six individuals were convicted in a Bangladeshi court and sentenced for their role in the attack.\" On the other hand, it includes a sentence asking witnesses to contact the US Department of State directly with information regarding the fugitives and anyone else involved in the attack: \"If you have information about Haque, Hussain, or anyone else involved in the attack, text your information to us.\" In other words, the US State Department is not only interested in information about the fugitives\u2014it is interested in information about any possible others involved, and it is interested in receiving this information through its own channels, independent of any authority in Bangladesh. Although the US potentially has the jurisdictional right to prosecute this case under legal precepts like the passive personality principle, it would be very difficult\u2014and possibly impossible\u2014to meaningfully try this case in a US court without subpoena powers over witnesses who are resident citizens of Bangladesh, and without Bangladesh's cooperation. That cooperation may not be given enthusiastically: from public statements of Bangladeshi Foreign and Home ministers, it appears that they were not consulted and are upset about the US's unilateral announcement, issued nearly ten months after the verdict.\nThe obvious question arises: Is the US unhappy for some reason? Why is Bangladesh included in a group with North Korea, Russia, and China? Bangladesh is neither a hostile military rival to the US, nor a geopolitical economic rival. And while concerns about human rights violations may certainly invite harsh scrutiny, the US seems to be ignoring such concerns regarding other countries.\nPerhaps we should instead look to the world's emerging \"digital iron curtain\" for answers. Over the last two decades, there has been intense competition between the US and China in attempts to achieve domination over the digital technology space. In this race, it appears that China, in some areas, runs ahead of the US\u2014at least for now. But the countries are mutually dependent on one frontier: 5G, which is used for advanced telecommunications. The US is superior in computer chip manufacturing and China is ahead in 5G device design and equipment. There are also other small players in parts-making.\nChina has been alleged to steal intellectual property related to digital technology from Western countries and to engage in digital espionage. Meng Wanzhou\u2014the chief financial officer of Huawei (the Chinese telecommunications giant) and the daughter of Chinese billionaire Ren Wanzhou, founder of Huawei\u2014was arrested and detained by Canada on December 1, 2018, on a charge of fraud and conspiracy filed by the US for circumventing US sanctions against Iran. She was freed from house arrest, conditionally, on September 24, 2021.\nIt is the US's concern that if Huawei equipment and designs are used in the US, China can spy on everything that uses Huawei technology. And, according to the US, if China wants, it can sabotage and devastate the entire Western world's power grid, telecommunications, internet, computers, transportation, and anything that uses Huawei's 5G technology. Huawei's business reputation has tempted the US's allies to sign contracts with Huawei. However, under the US's tremendous pressure, Huawei's 5G technology was banned by the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, and Australia. Canada, Germany, and New Zealand are considering following suit. The list of countries participating in the ban is fluid. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, expressed his concern on December 25 that China has been acting as an angel to split the Western alliance. This conflict is not going away anytime soon. It may split the world into two camps divided by a \"digital iron curtain\".\nOn December 12, Bangladesh's TeleTalk, according to an agreement signed previously with Huawei, installed 5G infrastructure, with the hope of pushing Bangladesh to the leading edge of the digital revolution. But in the emerging Digital Cold War, Bangladesh's alignment with the Chinese tech giant may make the US unhappy.\nThe US and its allies are also concerned about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), led and initiated by China, that attracted support from 139 countries, including Bangladesh. The BRI includes New Silk Road and Marine Silk Road initiatives that would encompass most of the globe. Moreover, there are problems in the South China Sea and the Straits of Taiwan where contentious activities and military exercises are brewing. On the top of that, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between the US, Japan, India, and Australia\u2014dubbed as the \"Great Game\" in Asia and \"Asian NATO\" by China\u2014together with accompanying military exercises named \"Exercise Malabar,\" are bones of contention for China.\nThe US's punitive actions against Bangladesh\u2014these December surprises\u2014may be related to Bangladesh's growing relationship with China, and particularly its acceptance of Huawei's 5G technology. This is a very complex geopolitical situation that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has to navigate carefully, like Odysseus sailing between Scylla and Charybdis. A thorough analysis of risks and rewards and a reimagining of Bangladesh's foreign policy are needed at this juncture.\n\u00a0\nDr Mostofa Sarwar is professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, dean and ex-vice-chancellor of Delgado Community College, and commissioner of the governing board of Regional Transit Authority of New Orleans.

This would allow countries to trade the right to emit greenhouse gases.\nCarbon trading is part of how countries intend to meet their obligations for reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, the manner in which countries agreed these rules may hobble the Agreement in its goal of averting catastrophic warming.\nCarbon markets were central to the design of the Paris Agreement's predecessor, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created three different mechanisms for trading carbon. Developing countries had become accustomed to attracting investment via one called the \"Clean Development Mechanism\" (CDM) which allowed industrialised countries to invest in projects to reduce emissions in developing countries and count them against their own targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Many industrialised countries wanted to retain this sort of flexibility in how they met their own treaty obligations.\nAs a result, most governments were keen to keep carbon markets as part of the Paris Agreement. In Paris in 2015, the bare bones of mechanisms similar to those in the Kyoto Protocol were agreed, but without the details needed to put them into practice. Why then did it take six years to agree the rules which would govern these markets? This was more than the four years it took countries to do the same in the Kyoto Protocol and, in effect, they were recreating the same mechanisms. The problems in reaching an agreement this time were three-fold, and they weren't satisfactorily resolved in Glasgow.\nGoing backwards from Kyoto\nVarious states, and many environmental campaign groups, suspect that carbon markets weaken the overall effort to reduce emissions. As climate change has accelerated over the past decade these concerns have become more acute. Why trade emissions if everyone is trying to get them to zero? There is considerable evidence that carbon offset projects\u2014such as wind farms, which emissions trading can fund\u2014have failed to deliver a reduction in overall emissions. A 2017 study led by the EU Commission found that 85 percent of projects funded by the CDM hadn't reduced emissions.\nThere are also fundamental design issues in the Paris Agreement that make setting up carbon markets under it much more difficult. The Kyoto Protocol expressed the obligations of industrialised states to reduce their emissions as targets. These could be translated into a fixed number of emissions allowances that provided carbon markets with a clear set of accounting rules and indicators of market demand.\nNo such set of rules exists in the Paris Agreement. Instead, all states submit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs)\u2014national plans for reducing emissions. They may or may not have an emissions target and they vary in how they account for emissions or which sources of emissions they include in their plans.\nHow can a market function if there is no clear way of measuring what is being traded? And how should a country trading with another adjust its own NDC to avoid double-counting, when the design of each country's NDC varies so much? And what should countries do with all the credits created in the Kyoto Protocol's system? Should they just be rolled over to be used in the new markets? Should they be simply abandoned? Or is there some way of allowing them in but controlling their use? A lot of CDM credits in particular remain, and they could flood the new markets and undermine the integrity of the NDCs.\nA cop out\nIn the first week of COP26, it looked like these issues would continue to dog the negotiations. India supported unrestricted use of CDM credits in the new mechanism while the Solomon Islands (representing the Least Developed Countries group) opposed using them at all. In week two, these issues were either fudged or hastily agreed. The carbon traders were happy, as were the managers of the COP26 process\u2014the UN secretariat and the UK government. We can now see the cost of failing to grapple with these thorny issues.\nThe Glasgow decisions on both Article 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris Agreement are extraordinarily unclear compared with the equivalent ones for the Kyoto Protocol. Specialists in this field are still decoding precisely what they mean in practical terms. It's likely that states will be able to use this opacity to double-count and claim credit for the same emissions-reducing activities.\nCountries are supposed to set new NDCs regularly. At the same time, countries will be negotiating individual emission trades. The possibility for a country to game its NDC\u2014making it appear more ambitious than it really is by counting already agreed trades within them\u2014is impossible to avoid. It's hard to see how this doesn't fundamentally weaken the ambition of countries when updating their NDCs.\nMonitoring how these mechanisms work in practice and whether they have the desired effect will be important over the coming years. While heralded at the time as a breakthrough in implementing significant tracts of the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow pact on carbon markets might instead be remembered as its undoing.\n\u00a0\nMatthew Paterson is Professor of International Politics, University of Manchester.\nCopyright: Inter Press Service\n",

The unhealthy culture of non-payment of loans by big borrowers has become endemic in Bangladesh, forcing a crippling effect on many banks. The gravity of the situation can be construed from the words of Mashiur Rahman, economic affairs adviser to the prime minister. He said that \"non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector had gone beyond control. If banks are unable to recover default loans and mobilise new deposits, the capacity of giving out loans by lenders faces a setback. He called non-payment of loans a social crime.\"\nThe fact that the central bank has to wait for the clearance from the finance ministry before taking decisions on major issues also becomes a deterrent in most cases. The panacea, as suggested by a number of former BB governors, is greater autonomy of the bank. Besides the veteran bankers, eminent economists of the country, while commenting on the issue, also emphasised the importance of ensuring integrity in the financial sector to keep it stable. We welcome the expert suggestion for improving the skills of the bank officials while verifying borrowers' ability to repay loans and that an effective bankruptcy act should be there to solve the problem.\nWe believe with greater power in the hands of the central bank, it would become possible to restrict and bring down the incidence of default loans. An autonomous central bank with the mandate to take decisions independently will contribute to creating a vibrant banking sector crucial for accelerating the economic growth of the country. And it has to be ensured at the same time that Bangladesh Bank will not be subjected to any kind of political pressure while executing their duties.\nThe collective wisdom of the eminent bankers and revered academics of the country should be taken into cognisance by the authorities concerned and they should act accordingly for the good of the country.\n",

He has further stated that a six-member team has been formed comprising representatives from relevant ministries, including those of law, information and communication technology, and home, to address any discontent with the law. This is no doubt an encouraging development, given that since its enactment on September 19, 2018, the law has been widely misused to muzzle dissent and freedom of the press.\nAccording to ARTICLE 19, a total of 225 cases were lodged between January and November this year under the DSA, and 68 journalists were accused in 32 of the cases. As many as 15 of the journalists prosecuted this year were arrested and subsequently jailed. The ARTICLE 19 data also revealed that 83 percent of the cases filed this year were over social media posts and online expressions of individuals. It was also mentioned in their report that the majority of the users of the law\u201440 percent\u2014are individuals affiliated with the ruling party, while a third of the cases were lodged by law enforcement agencies. And 40 percent of the cases were filed against people allegedly for criticising the prime minister, ministers, members of parliament, and affiliates of the ruling party.\nEarlier this year, the High Court had issued a ruling asking the government to explain why two controversial sections of the Act\u2014Sections 25 and 31\u2014should not be declared unconstitutional. The Editors' Council highlighted many times in the past how the controversial sections would harm the cause of independent journalism and freedom of expression. However, despite widespread criticism by journalists, civil society members, human rights organisations, as well as social media users for policing media operations, censoring content and controlling media freedom and freedom of speech and expression\u2014guaranteed by our constitution\u2014this is the first time that that the government has nodded to the possibility of amendment.\nWe hope that the committee will take into cognisance the widely documented abuses of the DSA, engage with various stakeholders affected by the law and take appropriate actions to abolish the much-criticised sections. The government must also come up with a plan to compensate the victims of the misuse of the law.\nFurthermore, we welcome the assurance of the minister that police stations have been asked not to arrest any journalist immediately after a case is filed against him or her, given that 166 people\u2014many of whom were journalists\u2014have been arrested under the Act immediately after the cases were filed this year alone.\nIt is high time that we put this repressive and black law behind us. We hope that the minister's statements are not mere rhetoric but rather the promise of a Bangladesh that values and nurtures freedom of expression.\n",
