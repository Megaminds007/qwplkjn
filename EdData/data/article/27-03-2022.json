The export rebound, coming on the back of last fiscal\u2019s pandemic-induced slump in global demand, is particularly heartening as the key value-added sectors of engineering goods and apparel and garments have done well this year. Engineering goods, in particular, have registered almost 50% year-on-year growth, while ready-made garments logged a more than 30% increase, in the April-February period, as per provisional data from the Commerce Ministry. However, in terms of the sheer scale of increase, petroleum products were the standout performer as the global surge in oil prices lifted the dollar value of overseas shipments of goods produced at India\u2019s refineries by 150% over the first 11 months of the fiscal. The fact that the export growth has been achieved against the backdrop of persistent logistical challenges, including container shortages and port congestion that have pushed up freight rates, is laudable and reflects the concerted effort made by the government in coordination with industry and the country\u2019s overseas missions. Interestingly, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal made a pointed reference to the role played by India\u2019s embassies and envoys in exploring new opportunities for Indian products, and if the current momentum in exports is to be sustained in the coming years, the diplomatic corps will need to enlarge their role in trade promotion.Still, the cheer of attaining the milestone needs to be tempered by the acknowledgment that multiple challenges persist on the trade front. Imports have outpaced exports this year, almost doubling the trade deficit in the April-February period to more than $175 billion. The gap is wider than the pre-pandemic year of 2019-2020 as well and points to the pressing need to step up the pace of export growth if the deficit is to be shrunk meaningfully. While global inflation in commodity prices certainly contributed to enlarging the value of both exports and imports, the fact that project goods were the only item of import, among the 30 broad categories listed by the Ministry that contracted over the 11-month period, is also cause for disquiet. The lack of overseas purchases of capital goods for new projects is a clear indicator that private Indian businesses are still wary of making fresh investments given the lack of momentum in personal consumption. With the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia now posing fresh problems for exporters seeking to ship goods to not only these countries but other markets in Europe as well, policymakers must go beyond stopgap measures such as enabling rupee-rouble trade and expedite ongoing negotiations on the raft of free trade agreements so as to at least help lower some of the tariff walls.",

        "full_article": "Nearly a decade and a half since its inception, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has struck deep roots and acquired nimble feet. General elections in 2009, 2014 and 2019, and the pandemic lasting over two years, have never stymied the league. Irrespective of the external challenges, the tournament\u2019s organisers have always conducted the IPL. Even as India remains the base, at varying points South Africa and the United Arab Emirates have chipped in as hosts. Cut to the present, the 15th edition will commence at Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede Stadium on Saturday with defending champion, Chennai Super Kings, (CSK) taking on last year\u2019s runner-up, Kolkata Knight Riders. And over two months, the IPL will monopolise prime-time television while its caravan will shuttle between Mumbai and Pune due to COVID-19 bio-bubble protocols. Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede, Brabourne and DY Patil Stadiums and Pune\u2019s MCA Stadium will conduct the games while the venue for the play-offs, including the final on May 29, will be announced later. Ever since that summer night at Bengaluru\u2019s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in 2008, when the IPL made its debut, its commercial value has found incremental gains. The latest outing has Tata as the title sponsor while multiple brands will jostle for space through the tournament and its 10 teams. Meanwhile, the two new squads \u2014 Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants \u2014 will enhance the novelty factor.The IPL\u2019s current version will have transition as an underlying theme. Most units have had a change of personnel and in some cases, there are new captains too. CSK, until now led by the talismanic M.S. Dhoni, will have a fresh skipper in Ravindra Jadeja. At 40, Dhoni will continue as a player but with him having relinquished the reins of captaincy, an era has ended in the league\u2019s history. Having led CSK to four titles, the legend from Ranchi remains the IPL\u2019s biggest player. While CSK will look at replicating its triumphs, Mumbai Indians, the most successful franchise with five trophies, will hope to excel in its backyard. Led by Rohit Sharma, who is now India\u2019s all-format skipper, the outfit has Kieron Pollard in its ranks, reflective of the championship\u2019s international flavour. However, the event isn\u2019t just about youngsters grabbing attention, it is also about seniors reiterating their credentials. Virat Kohli is now seeking a fresh wind as a mere player. And this IPL will also help leading players such as Kane Williamson finesse their craft ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia, later this year.",

        "full_article": "Bengalis are well-known for being unusually driven by emotion, a trait that has brought about many great things\u2014our right to speak in our mother tongue, our right to be independent. But there are also emotions that cannot even be translated\u2014like \"obhiman\", an emotion shared by our other South Asian friends, which could be described as hurt pride that crops up at the drop of a hat. This is amply displayed in old Bangla (and Hindi) films or dramas where the protagonists stubbornly indulge in this emotion to ensure that characteristic tear-jerking ending. In general, it is quite natural for us to become \"senti\" (sentimental) over the smallest things\u2014like someone forgetting to acknowledge a \"big brother's\" position in the social food chain by not giving him the mandatory reverent \"salam\", which, in the contemporary context, may lead to dismemberment or a painful death.\nNow that we have reached the digital age and are hell bent on embracing it with a vengeance\u2014we have also acquired the ability to be digitally sentimental. Even what I have written so far could be considered \"harmful\" or \"offensive\" or even racist despite the fact that I belong to the race I am poking fun at. Poking fun? Are you out of your mind? We no longer believe in humour anymore didn't you know? In fact, sharing a cartoon may cause grievous injury leading to death. Sorry for the constant death references but our lives often do have an air of The Godfather trilogy.\nWe are so serious about our sentiments that we are not satisfied with having one choking legal instrument\u2014the Digital Security Act (DSA) to deal with troublemakers. Now we are planning to give it some added support like an unnecessary second corset to pad the first one and make sure that above all, no one dares to hurt anyone's sentiment. Yes, we're that serious about our emotional health. Hence the BTRC (Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission) regulation applicable for digital platforms, social media and OTT - Over the Top platforms. So anything you publish digitally is open for scrutiny by the powerful BTRC ninjas and may lead to long term incarceration. Even with just the DSA, people have found themselves in jail for what people in other countries may consider strange to be seen as crimes\u2014such as singing a song written by an acetic who may have made philosophical observations about spirituality, for being a concerned citizen, or for trying to expose corruption of public officials. If you thought you were safe sending videos of Putin and Zelenskyy singing that catchy Hindi film song \"Jati hu mey..\" to your buddies on WhatsApp, think again. Someone important enough may feel \"hurt\" or \"offended\" on behalf of either one of them or feel this may sour relations with another country and so is \"anti-state\" and wham... The notion of back to back encryption no longer holds with the DSA and the BTRC regulation. It has become a myth just stated to make you feel you are a valued client whose privacy matters. Actually privacy of a citizen has become an endangered species and it would be practical to just consider it extinct and get on with life. Let's not get emotional about everything shall we?\nSpeaking of misplaced emotions, a coalition of around 45 organisations that still believe that human rights are inalienable and sacred have sent an earnest letter requesting BTRC to reconsider this regulation that \"imperils people's freedom of expression, and right to privacy, undermines encryption and weakens online safety\". They further say: \"If enforced, the regulations will have a deleterious impact on human rights, and put journalists, dissidents, activists and vulnerable communities, in particular, at greater risk\"\nThese organisations are also not too happy about the government's plan to adopt a code of ethics which all media would have to comply with (or else\u2026) which would give the Ministry of Information a free rein to control content, something that violates international law. International law my foot, they scoff.\nTo make things more interesting, the new regulation requires registration of all online platforms and we all know how easy it is to get official registration for anything through regular routes. And think of all the OTT platforms. How will we exist if our favourite Netflix shows\u2014our mainstay in terms of mindless entertainment\u2014are considered \"harmful\" or \"incite hatred\" and \"hurt all kinds of sentiments of all kinds of people\", and just censored out? Then of course there are local platforms where popular shows, films and drama serials are aired which may have content that will embarrass or irritate someone or some entity\u2014should we just tell our directors and actors and production people to pack up and try for BTV jobs? That seems the safest bet\u2014at least they will survive even if their creative souls will shrivel up and die a premature death.\nThose who have come up with this regulation have decided that vague, arbitrary ideas of being snubbed or having one's religious sentiments trod upon are far more injurious (to certain privileged groups, not all and sundry please) and must be deterred by having citizens locked up in jail for years or having their voices gagged rather than uphold archaic concepts like \"freedom of speech\", human rights and freedom of expression. In the digital world, we just need some bots or humans who act like bots, religiously following the commands fed to their systems, with no deviation and no attempts to act too clever. This way everyone, I mean those that matter, will remain emotionally happy and can carry on their lives with their sentiments intact and without the nuisance of pesky citizens with the gall to have opinions of their own.\nAasha Mehreen Amin is senior deputy editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are entering a new phase of warfare and global politics. Aside from a heightened risk of nuclear catastrophe, we are already in a perfect storm of mutually reinforcing global crises\u2014the pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, and food and water shortages. The situation exhibits a basic madness: at a time when humanity's very survival is jeopardised by ecological (and other) factors, and when addressing those threats should be prioritised over everything else, our primary concern has suddenly shifted\u2014again\u2014to a new political crisis. Just when global cooperation is needed more than ever, the \"clash of civilizations\" returns with a vengeance.\nWhy does this happen? As is often the case, a little Hegel can go a long way toward answering such questions. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel famously describes the dialectic of master and servant, two \"self-consciousnesses\" locked in a life-or-death struggle. If each is ready to risk his own life to win, and if both persist in this, there is no winner: one dies, and the survivor no longer has anyone to recognise his own existence. The implication is that all of history and culture rest on a foundational compromise: in the eye-to-eye confrontation, one side (the future servant) \"averts its eyes,\" unwilling to go to the end.\nBut Hegel would hasten to note that there can be no final or lasting compromise between states. Relationships between sovereign nation-states are permanently under the shadow of potential war, with each epoch of peace being nothing more than a temporary armistice.\nThis tendency runs directly against the urgent need to civilise our civilisations and establish a new mode of relating to our environs. We need universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities. In 2017, the French philosopher Alain Badiou noted that the contours of a future war are already discernible. He foresaw:\n\"\u2026the United States and their Western-Japanese group on the one side, China and Russia on the other side, atomic arms everywhere. We cannot but recall Lenin's statement: 'Either revolution will prevent the war or the war will trigger revolution.' This is how we can define the maximal ambition of the political work to come: for the first time in history, the first hypothesis\u2014revolution will prevent the war\u2014should realise itself, and not the second one\u2014a war will trigger revolution. It is effectively the second hypothesis which materialised itself in Russia in the context of the First World War, and in China in the context of the second. But at what price! And with what long-term consequences!\"\nThe limits of realpolitik\nCivilising our civilisations will require radical social change\u2014a revolution, in fact. But we cannot afford to hope that a new war will trigger it. The far more likely outcome is the end of civilisation as we know it, with the survivors (if there are any) organised in small authoritarian groups. We should harbour no illusions: in some basic sense, World War III has already begun, though for now it is still being fought mostly through proxies.\nAbstract calls for peace are not enough. \"Peace\" is not a term that allows us to draw the key political distinction that we need. Occupiers always sincerely want peace in the territory they hold. Nazi Germany wanted peace in occupied France, Israel wants peace in the occupied West Bank, and Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace in Ukraine. That is why, as the philosopher \u00c9tienne Balibar once put it, \"pacifism is not an option.\" The only way to prevent another Great War is by avoiding the kind of \"peace\" that requires constant local wars for its maintenance.\nWhom can we rely on under these conditions? Should we place our confidence in artists and thinkers, or in pragmatic practitioners of realpolitik? The problem with artists and thinkers is that they, too, can lay the foundation for war. Recall William Butler Yeats's apt verse: \"I have spread my dreams under your feet, / Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.\" We should apply these lines to poets themselves. When they spread their dreams under our feet, they should spread them carefully because actual people will read them and act upon them. Recall that the same Yeats continuously flirted with Fascism, going so far as to voice his approval of Germany's anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws in August 1938.\nRealpolitik is no better guide. It has become a mere alibi for ideology, which often evokes some hidden dimension behind the veil of appearances in order to obscure the crime that is being committed openly. This double mystification is often announced by describing a situation as \"complex.\" An obvious fact\u2014say, an instance of brutal military aggression\u2014is relativized by evoking a \"much more complex background.\" The act of aggression is really an act of defence.\nThis is exactly what is happening today. Russia obviously attacked Ukraine, and is obviously targeting civilians and displacing millions. And yet commentators and pundits are eagerly searching for \"complexity\" behind it. There is complexity, of course. But that does not change the basic fact that Russia did it. Our mistake was that we did not interpret Putin's threats literally enough; we thought he was just playing a game of strategic manipulation and brinkmanship.\nThis double mystification exposes the end of realpolitik. As a rule, realpolitik is opposed to the naivety of binding diplomacy and foreign policy to (one's version of) moral or political principles. Yet in the current situation, it is realpolitik that is naive. It is naive to suppose that the other side, the enemy, is also aiming at a limited pragmatic deal.\nForce and freedom\nDuring the Cold War, the rules of superpower behaviour were clearly delineated by the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Each superpower could be sure that if it decided to launch a nuclear attack, the other side would respond with full destructive force. As a result, neither side started a war with the other.\nBy contrast, when North Korea's Kim Jong-un talks about dealing a devastating blow to the US, one cannot but wonder where he sees his own position. He talks as if he is unaware that his country, himself included, would be destroyed. It is as if he is playing an altogether different game called NUTS (Nuclear Utilisation Target Selection), whereby the enemy's nuclear capabilities can be surgically destroyed before it can counterstrike.\nOver the past few decades, even the US has oscillated between MAD and NUTS. Though it acts as if it continues to trust the MAD logic in its relations with Russia and China, it has occasionally been tempted to pursue a NUTS strategy vis-\u00e0-vis Iran and North Korea. With his hints about possibly launching a tactical nuclear strike, Putin follows the same reasoning.\nUnfortunately for the rest of us, MADness is pass\u00e9. Superpowers are increasingly testing each other, experimenting with the use of proxies as they try to impose their own version of global rules. On March 5, Putin called the sanctions imposed on Russia the \"equivalent of a declaration of war.\" But he has repeatedly stated since then that economic exchange with the West should continue, emphasising that Russia is keeping its financial commitments and continuing to deliver hydrocarbons to Western Europe.\nIn other words, Putin is trying to impose a new model of international relations. Rather than cold war, there should be hot peace: a state of permanent hybrid war in which military interventions are declared under the guise of peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. How often in the past have we heard similar arguments for US-led interventions in Latin America or the Middle East and North Africa?\nCan anyone be free in such a predicament? Following Hegel, we should make a distinction between abstract and concrete freedom, which correspond to our notions of freedom and liberty. Abstract freedom is the ability to do what one wants independently of social rules and customs; concrete freedom is the freedom that is conferred and sustained by rules and customs. I can walk freely along a busy street only when I can be reasonably sure that others on the street will behave in a civilised way toward me\u2014that drivers will obey traffic rules, and that other pedestrians will not rob me.\nBut there are moments of crisis when abstract freedom must intervene. In December 1944, Jean-Paul Sartre wrote: \"Never were we freer than under the German occupation. We had lost all our rights, and first of all our right to speak. They insulted us to our faces. ... And that is why the Resistance was a true democracy; for the soldier, as for his superior, the same danger, the same loneliness, the same responsibility, the same absolute freedom within the discipline.\"\nSartre was describing freedom, not liberty. Liberty is what was established when post-war normality returned. In Ukraine today, those who are battling the Russian invasion are free and they are fighting for liberty. But this raises the question of how long the distinction can last.\nThe not-so-great game\nWe still lack a proper word for today's world. For her part, the philosopher Catherine Malabou believes we are witnessing the beginning of capitalism's \"anarchist turn\": \"How else are we to describe such phenomena as decentralised currencies, the end of the state's monopoly, the obsolescence of the mediating role played by banks, and the decentralisation of exchanges and transactions?\"\nThose phenomena may sound appealing, but with the gradual disappearance of the state's monopoly, state-imposed limits to ruthless exploitation and domination will also disappear. While anarcho-capitalism aims at transparency, it also \"simultaneously authorises the large-scale but opaque use of data, the dark web, and the fabrication of information.\"\nTo prevent this descent into chaos, Malabou observes, policies increasingly follow a path of \"Fascist evolution\u2026with the excessive security and military build-up that goes along with it. Such phenomena do not contradict a drive towards anarchism. Rather, they indicate precisely the disappearance of the state, which, once its social function has been removed, expresses the obsolescence of its force through the use of violence. Ultra-nationalism thus signals the death agony of national authority.\"\nViewed in these terms, the situation in Ukraine is not one nation-state attacking another nation-state. Rather, Ukraine is being attacked as an entity whose very ethnic identity is denied by the aggressor.\nA new non-alignment\nBut if we can be mobilised only by the threat of war, not by the threat to our environment, the liberty we will get if our side wins may not be worth having. We are faced with an impossible choice: if we make compromises to maintain peace, we are feeding Russian expansionism. But if we endorse full confrontation, we run the high risk of precipitating a new world war. The only real solution is to change the lens through which we perceive the situation.\nWhile we should stand firmly behind Ukraine, we must avoid the fascination with war that has clearly seized the imaginations of those who are pushing for an open confrontation with Russia. Something like a new non-aligned movement is needed, not in the sense that countries should be neutral in the ongoing war, but in the sense that we should question the entire notion of the \"clash of civilisations.\"\nThe new non-alignment must broaden the horizon by recognising that our struggle should be global\u2014and by counselling against Russophobia at all costs. We should offer our support to those within Russia who are protesting the invasion. They are not some abstract coterie of internationalists; they are the true Russian patriots.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2022.\nwww.project-syndicate.org.\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek,\u00a0\nProfessor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School, is International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London.\n\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "When was the last time you looked at the face of the rickshaw-puller who gave you a ride? Or the guard who opened the door for you at a mall? Or the cleaner who was sweeping the streets you walked along? Did you exchange glances? A smile, let alone pleasantries? Chances are you did not even see them. Yet, these are the invisible people representing 80-90 percent of the labour force on whom the informal sector of our economy depends. They include wage labourers, self-employed individuals, unpaid family labourers, seasonal workers and other hired labourers. With too much focus on the leading faces, the initiators, and the ideation process, we often forget the \"ordinary\" implementers and their \"extraordinary\" contributions not only to our economic growth, but also to our very existence.\nToday, as we celebrate the nation's independence, it is important to recall the valour and sacrifice of the marginal groups and remind ourselves of our duties towards them for a sustainable growth.\nAfter the massacre on the night of March 25, 1971, these invisible men and women from the social sidelines were catapulted to the political centre. The Pakistan Army's Operation Searchlight clicked the images of the bullet-ridden body of a rickshaw-puller lying on his mode of livelihood, the body of a street vendor being dragged by stray dogs, the body of a student sleeping in his dorm, the body of a policeman who was killed even before he could react. These corpses highlighted the indiscriminate nature of the military mayhem. The social body was dispersed. The political body regrouped. They worked as one to form antibodies against the occupying force, and ultimately defeated it after a nine-month-long guerrilla warfare. The violence that erupted in the capital was dispatched to every part of the country. Ordinary men and women resisted. Their resilience expedited our freedom. Yet, after 51 years, the part of the body that suffered the most remains inflicted as ever.\nThe urban-based power base that has emerged as the centre of economy has little sympathy for the margin that has its roots in our villages. According to a report, 50 percent of Dhaka's population is invisible to the city's policy and planning frameworks. The city sees the inflow of about 300,000-400,000 internally displaced population each year. Many of them are seasonal migrants who look for jobs in the city during the lean seasons. Many others come seeking upward social mobility. And for many of these people, the slums become the landing ground. Some of them join institutions of higher education to gradually move up the social ladder. A 2007 UNDP report estimated about 3.4 million living in Dhaka's slums. Surely, the number has risen since then. The lack of record-keeping shows the systematic process of exclusion. Public surveys mostly focus on the residents of formal households. The slums remain a niche area of interest for development agencies or NGOs\u2014not so much for city planners. Their basic needs for water, sanitation or power are provided through an \"informal\" patronage system. These men and women residing outside the official frame rely on local syndicates or political nexus for their existence. They are fed into partisan politics for their basic sustenance, including jobs, with no civic rights or public entitlements. For them, freedom is a far cry.\nI was browsing through a trip advisory blog where visitors were commenting on Dhaka city. The suggestions there made me think of the invisible side of our visible city. For instance, one commentator mentioned that finding a female companion in Dhaka was relatively easy as many college-going students were engaged in escort services. There was another blog mentioning that one could buy intimacy with a woman for as little as Tk 100. A video interview of a woman, who had to sleep with 20-25 men a day for her livelihood, brought tears to my eyes. The trip advisors suggested not going to these floating sex workers in fear of STDs, just like they suggested not giving alms to any street beggars. \"They'd gang up for more and tear you into pieces like in Hitchcock's movie The Bird,\" one comment said.\nI felt ashamed to be introduced to the underbelly of the city in which I travel from one place to another with my upper-middle-class privileges. The man who ferries me throughout the city would get two annual leaves. There are so many like him with biological needs, who allow the informal system of prostitution, for instance, to grow. The house rents would force many of these working men and women to live in a city where their needs are not catered to. The same goes for many migrant workers who work abroad to contribute to our wage earners' scheme. The money they send often gives rise to social problems that we are not ready to acknowledge. Adultery is often reported as a cause for murder or kidnapping. We benefit from the informal economy without doing anything significant for the invisible men and women. Fifty percent of the city dwellers take care of the other 50 percent in a symbiotic, if not a parasitic, relationship. The existence is far from healthy.\nWhen the clarion call for freedom was made, we wanted independence from all forms of oppression. We wanted to be free in our thoughts and in our actions. It is about time our policymakers bridged up the formal-informal divide and outlined a healthier alternative. Freedom is not only about getting rid of the chains of the oppressors, but also about providing the rights to live with dignity and mutual respect.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh celebrated its golden jubilee of independence in 2021. The celebration reminded the newer generations of our nation of the patriotism of their ancestors, who fought a heroic war against the marauding Pakistan Army that killed an estimated three million people, raped over 300,000 women, and caused enormous destruction. The celebrations also reminded us of the mass exodus of nearly 10 million people to the bordering states of India to escape military atrocities, which was one of the largest refugee crises in the 20th century.\nAll these human tragedies, well documented in the pages of history, will never be forgotten by the Bangladeshis as most families at that time either lost their loved ones or suffered the brunt of the military madness. In memory of the tragedy, Bangladesh observes March 25 as \"Genocide Day\" as the Pakistan military launched a brutal campaign of manslaughter on that day in 1971, code-named \"Operation Searchlight\"\u2014a campaign that went on for nine months. The irony is that the United Nations (UN) has not yet recognised the genocide nor the use of rape as a weapon of war to this day, even though they were carried out in a calculative and cruellest fashion, as many researchers have concluded.\nOn December 31, 2021, the very last day of Bangladesh's golden jubilee celebration, the US-based Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention issued a statement detailing the genocide of Bengalis. The recognition came following research carried out by the institute after Tawheed Reza Noor, son of one of Bangladesh's martyred intellectuals Serajuddin Hossain, approached the institute, named after Raphael Lemkin, a great scholar best known for coining the term \"genocide\" and who initiated the historic UN Genocide Convention.\nThere have been consistent efforts by various Bangladesh governments, families of the victims and human rights groups for the UN recognition of the 1971 genocide. But the world body remains consistently silent over it, even though it has, in recent years, accorded recognition to the Armenian genocide, and also acted decisively on the Bosnian, Cambodian and Rwandan genocides.\nThe genocide of 1971 is well documented in various forms. The first detailed report of the atrocities was published by a well-known Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas in the UK's The Sunday Times, on June 13, 1971. Mascarenhas, who was among a group of journalists from West Pakistan invited by the government to write in support of the military actions in East Pakistan, fled to London to report what he had actually seen. In his famous report, titled \"Genocide,\" he wrote, \"I saw Hindus hunted from village to village and door to door, shot off-hand after a cursory 'short arm inspection' showed they were uncircumcised. I have heard the screams of men bludgeoned to death in the compound of the Circuit House in Comilla. I have seen truckloads of other human targets and those who had the humanity to try to help them hauled off for disposal under the cover of darkness and curfew.\"\nOn August 2, 1971, the Time magazine provided the details of the massacre. It quoted a senior US official as saying, \"It is the most incredible, calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland.\" Genocide researcher Prof RJ Rummel said, \"These 'willing executioners' were fuelled by an abiding anti-Bengali racism, especially against the Hindu minority. Bengalis were often compared with monkeys and chicken\u2026 and the soldiers were free to kill at will.\"\nArcher K Blood, the US consul general in Dhaka in 1971 who disagreed with his country's handling of the Bangladesh struggle, reported that naked female bodies in Dhaka University's Rokeya Hall were found \"hanging from ceiling fans with bits of rope,\" after apparently being \"raped, shot, and hung by heels\" from the fans.\nRemarkably, the UN could not act decisively to stop the bloodbath as the massacre happened during the Cold War era, although the then UN Secretary-General U Thant, on June 3, 1971, had remarked, \"The happenings in East Pakistan constitute one of the most tragic episodes in human history. Of course, it is for future historians to gather facts and make their own evaluations, but it has been a very terrible blot on a page of human history.\"\nApart from committing heinous crimes, the Pakistan Army and their fanatic cohorts raped hundreds of thousands of women, shaking the very foundation of conscience and human rights. In some cases, according to the studies, young Bengali women were taken from one camp to another to be used as \"comfort girls.\" The brutalities inflicted on them included severing of breasts and mutilation of their private parts by inserting bayonet or gun barrels. Many were kept hanging upside down till death. Tens of thousands of bodies, both male and female, with their hands and legs tied in the back, floating on ponds and rivers were a common sight across the country.\nBelated, yet welcome, since it was the first such public statement by a global genocide research institute, the Lemkin Institute's statement narrated the historical backgrounds of the genocide and remarked that the Bengalis, who constituted the majority of Pakistani population at that time, were perceived by the Pakistani ruling coterie as \"inferior\" or not \"true Muslims.\" The statement stated, \"The genocidal policies of the postcolonial era became expressed in extreme and mass physical violence throughout the entire process of the Liberation War (of Bangladesh), from its very beginning, when West Pakistan implemented 'Operation Searchlight,' to the end of the war, when West Pakistan, facing defeat, proceeded to kill thousands of Bengali intellectuals.\"\nIt further echoed the documented history, \"The atrocities committed by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators\u2014Razakars, al-Badr and al-Shams\u2014included a systematic policy of sexual violence against Bengalis, the majority of them Bengali Hindu women and girls, involving vicious gang rapes, sexual slavery, sexual torture, and forced maternity.\" British physician Dr Geoffrey Davis, who worked in Bangladesh on request of Word Health Organization (WHO), estimated that the commonly cited figures of killing and rape were \"very conservative\" compared to the real numbers.\nTruly, the rape was carried out in a systematic manner with the aim to change the race of Bengalis!\nNoted researcher Robert Payne, in his book \"Massacre: The Tragedy of Bangla Desh,\" quoted a senior Pakistan Army general as saying, \"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\" The UN's declaration of Universal Human Rights 1981 said, \"Among the genocides of human history, the highest number of people killed in (a) lower span of time is in Bangladesh in 1971. An average of 6,000 to 12,000 people were (sic) killed every single day... This is the highest daily average in the history of genocides.\"\nThe Lemkin institute further stated, \"Given the lack of a broad international recognition of the crime, the Lemkin Institute calls upon (the) international community, including the United Nations, to urgently recognise the Bengali genocide as a way to pay tribute to the victims and to hold (the) perpetrators accountable.\" It has also called upon the international community to pressure Pakistan to work with Bangladesh in its search for truth and justice.\nHopefully, the significant statement by a well-known genocide prevention institute will pave the way for many more similar international bodies to come forward with similar recognition, and help remove the UN's inertia that it has preserved for long. The crimes committed against humanity, anywhere in the world, must not go unpunished\u2014otherwise, justice turns futile.\nPakistan, even after 51 years, has not apologised to Bangladesh for the crimes committed by its army, nor has it put on trial those 195 war criminals identified by Bangladesh in 1972 as the principal perpetrators. Pakistan's own Hamoodur Rahman Commission recommended taking effective action to punish those POWs who were responsible for committing the atrocities in the former East Pakistan. However, the listed war criminals were subsequently repatriated to Pakistan along with other POWs following the Tripartite Agreement signed among Bangladesh, Pakistan and India in 1974. But they were not freed from criminal charges. Bangladesh contends that the clemency mentioned in the Trilateral Agreement never implied that the masterminds and principal perpetrators of crimes against humanity and genocide would continue to enjoy impunity. The customary international laws also provide ample opportunity to try the Pakistani POWs.\nTrue, the UN recognition is important for the victims' families as well as for the aggrieved nation that is now 51 years old and also an important member of the United Nations. However, it is also no less important for the world body itself to protect its mandate and image. It must not be forgotten that such recognition is not merely a formal signing of a document, but also a new pledge and fresh commitment against the recurrence of such crimes in the future.\n\u00a0\nHaroon Habib\u00a0is a freedom fighter, writer and researcher.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "It's quite worrying that the number of diarrhoea patients admitted to various hospitals in Dhaka has seen a sudden spike although it wasn't expected to peak until April. According to a report, the disease has broken out in at least 10 areas of the capital city. The hospital attached to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Mohakhali alone has been reportedly treating around 1,200 diarrhoea patients daily for the past few days\u2014the highest daily count in the 60 years of its history. Other hospitals, including the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), have also reported a growing trend.\nOf the 10 areas identified in Dhaka, Jatrabari in old Dhaka is the worst affected, followed by Dakshinkhan and Rayer Bazar, according to hospital sources. Although we usually hear of children being affected more with diarrhoea, this time about 70-80 percent of the patients have been reported to be adults. Experts say that the germs that cause diarrhoea usually attack in April, causing a spike in numbers. Its early arrival this year may have something to do with people drinking contaminated water or street food containing harmful bacteria.\nWhatever the reason may be, the sudden rise in the number of diarrhoea patients including adult patients is an unusual phenomenon that deserves to be properly investigated by the public health officials. Experts believe that only scientific research can identify the reason behind the quick spread. In this regard, it can be said that the water supplied by Dhaka Wasa in the old part of the city is notorious for having hazardous pollutants, which residents have to drink as there is no other alternative for them. Adults are also often seen consuming street food and drinks\u2014including various types of sharbat, sugar cane juice, etc.\u2014in their rush to go to work or for other compulsions.\u00a0\nAn outbreak of this nature, at a time when we are still fighting with the Covid-19 pandemic, shouldn't be taken lightly. All hospitals should be alerted to the danger and equipped to handle any surge in patient numbers. We also urge the health authorities and city corporations to do everything possible to ward off diarrhoea by addressing the possible reasons for itsspread before it travels to other parts of the city or elsewhere, and becomes too difficult to handle.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh observed 51 years of its independence today with a muted fervour, and understandably so. Every year, we visit March 26 with a mixed feeling of happiness subdued by the sadness associated with it. It is a day of elation as well as of mourning. The wanton death and destruction foisted on the helpless Bengalis by the marauding occupation army of Pakistan\u2014from the night of March 25 till they meekly surrendered to the joint Bangladesh-India command\u2014has left a scar that is difficult to heal. The price we have paid for our freedom was aptly articulated by a British newspaper following our victory on December 16, 1971, which merits repetition: \"If blood is the price of independence, then Bangladesh has paid the highest price in history.\"\nIndeed, we have overpaid the cost of our independence, but perhaps no cost can be very high for the most precious thing in a person's, nay, a nation's life\u2014freedom\u2014if the sacrifices of the brave freedom fighters and martyrs are fulfilled. So after 51 years of living as a free nation, as we recall with gratitude their sacrifices as well as the contribution of national leaders and the visionary leadership of Bangabandhu, we must ask: Have those dreams been fulfilled?\nWe have many things to feel proud of. Our per capita income has increased manifold as we transited from a Least Developing Country to a developing one. But the distribution of wealth and opportunities has not happened in an egalitarian manner. The rich have gotten richer, the marginalised even more so. Yes, indeed there are fewer people below the poverty line now, but we ask whether the vision for attaining a poverty headcount of 14 percent by 2021 has been achieved.\nWhile the economic indices have recorded many positives, democratic indices have left much to be desired. The strongest pillar of democracy\u2014the people\u2014have had their rights defiled, given the manner in which the last two elections were held. It is indeed a matter of disquiet that people's confidence in democratic institutions, and interest in participating in the polls, have sapped to a dangerously low level. Political space for the opposition has shrunk dangerously, and the freedom to express opinions without fears of retribution is all but absent. Draconian laws have been formulated to stifle people's voices. Repression against women has not abated, and corruption in the public sector\u2014and consequently flight of valuable resources\u2014remains unaddressed.\nThese are hard questions that we cannot help but ask, and we must address these with due diligence. Otherwise, the sacrifices of our martyrs and freedom fighters will go in vain.\n",
