Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, led by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, 10.2 crore rural households, or about 53% of the eligible population, now have tap water access. This, the Government claims, is a 37-percentage point rise from 2019 when the scheme was announced, where its stated aim is to ensure at least 55 litres per person per day of potable water to every rural household \u2014 which implies a mere connection does not suffice. The Government commissions annual surveys to evaluate the success of the scheme. A recent audit, by a private agency, found that around 62% of rural households in India had fully functional tap water connections within their premises. A report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources in March, based on numbers provided by the nodal Jal Shakti Ministry, stated that 46% households had such fully functional tap water connections. It is important to note that for the purposes of the survey, only 3% of rural households were surveyed by the agency for the updated numbers and so the margin of error may be substantial and subject to the way the survey was designed. If the numbers are accurate, however, this represents an impressive rise in potable, tap water accessibility and suggests that the mission is well on its way to meeting its 2024 target.The survey, however, revealed wide disparities in achievement. Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Puducherry reported more than 80% of households with fully functional connections while less than half the households in Rajasthan, Kerala, Manipur, Tripura, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram and Sikkim had such connections. About 75% of households received water all days of the week, and only 8% just once a week. On average, households got water for three hours every day. Moreover, the report mentions a problem of chlorine contamination. Though 93% of the water samples were reportedly free of bacteriological contamination, most of the anganwadi centres and schools had higher than the permissible range of residual chlorine. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the progress of the scheme but with the economy now close to pre-pandemic levels, it is likely that the challenges of labour and material have softened somewhat to aid the progress of the scheme. The Centre should liaise better with States that are falling behind in targets and ensure that the infrastructure created as part of the scheme is long lasting and not merely to meet election targets.

When some spectators descended onto the pitch after the game and engaged in scuffles, the police over-reacted with the use of tear gas, leading the fans on the pitch and others to scamper to the nearest gate, only to find it closed, resulting in a crowd rush and asphyxiation. This accident is reminiscent of other crowd-related tragedies such as the deaths of eight people in January 2022 during the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, those of 74 spectators in Port Said, Egypt in 2012 and 97 Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough in Yorkshire, England in 1989. In all three cases, the deaths were less the result of hooliganism and more to do with police incompetence and crowd control failure. FIFA, football\u2019s governing body, has come up with a clear guideline on stadium safety \u2014 \u201cno firearms or crowd control gas shall be carried or used\u201d by police or stewards in charge of crowd control. This guideline is not without reason. Policing of this kind is done to bring order when violence goes beyond control and descends into riots and there is little thought for public safety. With stadiums being regulated and closed spaces, using firearms or tear gas for crowd control would only result in furthering chaos and threats to public safety. It is only apt that the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights is planning to investigate the use of tear gas by the police and civil society organisations are asking for the organisers and police to be brought to trial.With legions of passionate supporters across several countries, football is unquestionably the world\u2019s most popular spectator sport, largely due to its simplicity and emphasis on skill and team work. But the flip side of spectator passion is that their tribal emotions for and against some teams or players overcome their appreciation of the abilities of the players or actual play. This false consciousness of identifying with the actual participants in a competitive game while merely being a spectator, is a key reason for the inflamed passions that come with the territory of spectator sports, which are also fanned by commercial and political interests. While the blame for the deaths in Kanjuruhan should be on the police for overzealous crowd control, the recurrent nature of such tragedies should also make every sport fan introspect on the role of a spectator. It\u2019s one thing to appreciate the beautiful game, it\u2019s quite another if that appreciation turns into a fatal attraction.To read this editorial in Hindi, click here.",

Higher female IMR was a dead giveaway of evils like female infanticide. But in 16 states female IMR still is higher than male IMR, and averages shouldn\u2019t lead to complacency. Nevertheless, levelling of female and male IMR in the national average suggests a definitive trend. In 2011, this was the case only in Uttarakhand. A state like Haryana where \u2018Beti Bachao Beti Padhao\u2019 was launched has flipped a high male:female IMR of 41:48 in 2011 to 29:27 now.\nIndia\u2019s IMR has fallen slowly from 44 per 1,000 live births in 2011 to 33 in 2017 and 28 in 2020. To meet UN Sustainable Development Goals, India has to reduce under-five child mortality to 25 (per 1,000), neonatal mortality to 12 (per 1,000) and maternal mortality rate to 70 (per lakh live births) by 2030. India\u2019s latest corresponding figures are 32, 20 and 103. Some states have bettered SDGs and official statements suggest confidence that India will achieve these SDG benchmarks. But what national averages still disguise are backward states falling short. MP, Chhattisgarh, UP and Assam have MMR over 150 while Kerala and Maharashtra have fallen below 50.\nGiven these challenges, two-pronged focus on public health institutions and nutrition mustn\u2019t waver. Percentage of live births in hospitals shot up from 35% in 2006 to 67% in 2011 to 82% in 2020. Similarly, the percentage of deaths with medical attention received at hospitals has risen from 28% in 2006 to 34% in 2011 and 49% in 2020. These gains need further expansion. However, NFHS-5 (2019-20) showed anaemia among children and women spiking since 2015-16, suggesting that backsliding is equally possible.\nEconomic growth has boosted spending in social sectors. Public health focus mustn\u2019t waver despite the pandemic ebbing. The temptation to concentrate elsewhere is there. Combined government expenditure on health had increased from Rs 2.73 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 4.72 lakh crore in 2021-22, a 73% increase. The money spent mustn\u2019t be grudged. Take Jharkhand: its MMR now is 61 against 304 in 2004-06. These are great results achieved in short periods. Every part of India meeting SDGs would be a real big achievement.\n\n",

Over the last weekend, Ukrainian forces recaptured Lyman \u2013 a strategic rail hub that will be a staging post for pressing into the Russia-claimed provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. The latter, along with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, were recently declared annexed by Moscow. This has raised the possibility that Russia\u2019s nuclear cover will extend to these areas. With Ukrainian forces now clearly operating inside Russia-claimed territories, things could get hairy if President Putin believes he has no option but to up the ante, which, of course, will be catastrophic for Europe and the world. Or he may be given a reprieve by the winter, and therefore the war will carry on for far longer.\nSo, and despite all the sympathy Ukraine deserves and despite the courage shown by its armed forces, there must be cool calculations of the costs. Difficult as it is to swallow, Ukraine needs to be realistic. It must realise that Putin may prefer blowing up everything rather than surrender. That he does need something so he can spin away a retreat. Plus, the war has taken a massive toll on the Ukrainian economy. It can\u2019t really afford any more damage.\nIndia, which has reached out to both Moscow and Kyiv and walked a difficult diplomatic tightrope, can help with peace talks. In fact, PM Modi yesterday spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and called for cessation of hostilities and the need to pursue dialogue. This is sensible. And Putin knows even his main strategic partner China isn\u2019t happy with his Ukraine operations. This gives some leverage to bring him to the table. Some European countries want the conflict to end, and not wait for a \u201cvictory\u201d over Putin. They should try and persuade Ukraine. Peace looks elusive but isn\u2019t impossible.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a few short days, I will leave Bangladesh again. The first time I left, I left because I wanted to know more about the world and my place in it. A decade, a Master's degree, and a humanitarian mission later, I know there is still a lot more left to learn.\nYou might be wondering who I am to write you a letter. In a number of ways, I am no one special. I have not done much that is worthy of note, and have not won any awards you might know of. But I did grow up here and I know how the rain feels. I know the air and I know the dog that sits in the corner of my street. And so, perhaps foolishly, I feel like I can write to you. But I do have an ulterior motive, like all who write must.\nFor the past 18 months, I have worked for an international agency engaged in the Rohingya refugee response. I have been fortunate enough to learn from a community forced out of their homes, and in their plight, I have seen time and time again the urgency of fighting for our collective future. My note to you is a request to think of those deprived of what you and I can take for granted.\nRight now, 4,000 Rohingyas are stuck in the \"no man's land\" between Bangladesh and Myanmar. While a small percentage compared to the one million who have found safety in Cox's Bazar, these 4,000 humans are victims of the same armed aggression, state brutality and global inaction that has defined generations of the Rohingya experience. Across an increasingly fractured world, conflict remains the primary driver of human displacement, and a reminder that things can break apart anytime, anywhere.\nTo make matters worse, when humans are forced to flee, they are met with barbed wires and the blunt ends of rifles. The richest states are the worst offenders, with pushbacks and incarceration common across Europe and North America. Those who are lucky to find safety still face an uncertain future. Services, resources and compassion available to refugees vary greatly and, despite grand claims of equality, can often be traced over the colour of one's skin.\nClimate change is causing this already flawed system to short-circuit. In northern Bangladesh, the floodwaters showed no signs of receding for a month; in southern Iraq, rivers as old as civilisation itself are drying up. This change, this radical shift, acts as both cause and correlation, precipitating and amplifying the need for people to move. We cannot stop this; we can only prepare for it.\nWhat does this mean for Bangladesh, where one out of every seven people is projected to be displaced over the next few decades? One out of seven people can be someone we know, someone we love, someone we are willing to take on the world for.\nI am plagued by a question that has no easy answer: as the waters rise, as cities become richer and towns become poorer, how do we ensure that humans are able to move to provide for themselves and their families? How do we do so sustainably, yet humanely, in a crowded and under-resourced country? How do we urge the privileged to share responsibility for the forgotten?\nWe are nowhere near where we need to be. Everything that will decide the future is up in the air: in Geneva, they are debating whether climate migrants are refugees; in Sylhet, they already are. These definitions matter because they are tied to responsibility and resources. Equally importantly, it matters who is part of these discussions \u2013 where they come from and what languages they speak.\nEveryone agrees that responsibilities need to be shared, but no one agrees on how. Those who start wars, and those who contribute disproportionately to climate change, should theoretically shoulder more, but that is often not the case. We are trying to hold these feet to the fire, but to paraphrase a colleague, we need more hands.\nBangladesh, despite the great inequality that plagues it, is aware of the existential threat that faces everything we hold dear. But Bangladesh \u2013 and dare I say the world \u2013 needs you. You hold, in your anger and your compassion, the ability to bend the arc of our future towards justice. Your voices, in their unfiltered clarity and unbridled possibility, can inform and influence those with power over lives. Regardless of what others may tell you, you are in a position to inform. Everyone can read theory \u2013 only a few live it.\nAnd so, when you think your words are not strong enough, make them stronger. When your critique doesn't raise enough brows, be more critical. Tell us, no holds barred, about everything we are doing wrong \u2013 about systemic change, about local leadership, about innovation and opportunity.\nYou don't have to be a humanitarian to do this work. On the contrary, those who do this for a living need reminders from those who want to live. Movements live and die with those who support them with their time and energy, with their rage and joy, with their art, their words, their stories about what is at stake: the rain, the air, the dog in the corner of the street we grew up in.\nImrul Islam\u00a0is the outgoing advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Bangladesh.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Social media is a leviathan that all modern governments are struggling with. The increasing internet access in Bangladesh has allowed almost everyone to throw their two cents into the court of public opinion. Governments understand the enormous power of social media quite well. It can also be argued that the quality of political discourse online has declined dramatically in terms of usefulness and civility. There can undoubtedly exist social media posts that are made with the intent and/or the potential to harm national security, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, cause defamation, or incite offence. It is up to the government to decide on reasonable restrictions imposed by law to handle these situations. This is, in essence, the term set in Article 39(2) of the constitution.\nHowever, the key words here are \"reasonable restrictions.\" When talking about the effects of the Digital Security Act (DSA) and the potential impact of the upcoming data protection legislation, it is vital to ensure that the regulations imposed on freedom of expression by these laws remain reasonable. Indeed, it is the current unreasonable nature of the DSA that is being challenged when legal scholars and experts speak out against the overreaching power given to law enforcement agencies through this law.\nAs it stands now, any person whom law enforcement authorities deem to have breached the DSA will be arrested without a warrant, even if they are underage children.\nOn September 20, 2020, a person wrote a comment on late Hefazat-e-Islam Ameer Allama Shafi on Facebook. Local authorities deemed this post offensive, and the person was promptly arrested under the DSA. Meanwhile, this post was shared by a 15-year-old, 18-year-old Abdullah Al Mamun, and 18-year-old Ahsan Ullah. All three boys, including the 15-year-old, were also arrested simply for resharing the post on their private profiles.\nOn March 20, 2021, A college student named Humayun Kabir was arrested under the DSA after he posted a video on Facebook opposing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bangladesh. The college student was arrested and sent to jail in a case filed by a sub-inspector of the local police station.\nOn June 20, 2020, a Class 9 student was arrested under the DSA for criticising the government's move to increase tax on mobile phone call rates by making a taunting post directed at Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The secretary of Jubo League's Habirbari union unit in Mymensingh filed a case against the teenager when the status went viral. After his arrest, the 14-year-old was sent to the juvenile correctional centre in Gazipur.\nI leave it up to readers to decide if the use of the DSA in each of these cases was reasonable or not.\nThe DSA, according to Prof Ali Riaz of Illinois State University, has been widely employed by government organisations and individuals in Bangladesh. Although the government stated that the law would provide individuals with security, the bill was written in such a way that it might be used to suppress critics and criminalise dissent. According to his research paper titled \"The Unending Nightmare: Impacts of Bangladesh's Digital Security Act 2018,\" published by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS), data gathered and analysed from reports between January 2020 and February 2022 revealed that the legislation had been weaponised. Journalists and politicians were disproportionately victimised by this law, and the younger population was vulnerable to rampant abuse of the law. The research also pointed out that although they are not the aggrieved party in these claimed wrongdoings, the vast majority of accusers in lawsuits brought under the statute are members of the ruling party and its supporters.\nThe ambiguity of several legal provisions in the DSA has resulted in a scenario of vigilante justice. Often, falsified claims have been used to justify verbal lynching and social ostracism. Commenting on social media, particularly Facebook, has become dangerous under this rule, and criticising government leaders has placed people in court and in jail.\nAlthough the government has recently begun to acknowledge some misuse of the law, the data strongly suggests that it was widespread. The law undermines the country's commitment to international law and norms of fundamental rights and violates the human rights guaranteed by the constitution.\nAdditionally, the government is now working on a new data protection legislation that would compel mandatory localisation of personal and non-personal data in Bangladesh. Notably, the necessity for localisation extends to user-generated material, implying that all interactions via social media platforms, instant messaging and video communication apps, emails, and user metadata would have to be stored in servers and data centres within the country.\nWith the new online content control and localisation law, service providers such as Facebook and YouTube are required to keep user information in Bangladesh and cooperate with the government's request to erase, trace, and reveal it to state authorities. With broad exemptions granted to government authorities and no procedural safeguards or independent oversight mechanisms in place, there are concerns that these frameworks will open up new avenues for state agencies to monitor and intercept content and communications in accordance with the existing surveillance laws.\nNeedless to say, this would inevitably restrict free speech by encouraging a culture of self-censorship and digital authoritarianism, and increase the dangers of coercive actions against journalists, activists, dissidents, and the general public for expressing unpopular opinions or dissent.\nAll indications point to the government consciously or unconsciously acting in a way as to undermine people's right to privacy and free speech. A discussion needs to take place on where the lines of reasonability are drawn. When new laws are made, there has to be sufficient consideration about balancing citizens' rights with protecting national security. As for the DSA, its clauses need to be made more specific and not so all-encompassing. The power vested by the act to arrest without a warrant needs to be brought under oversight.\nUltimately, I believe it would be better for the people of Bangladesh if the Digital Security Act was repealed and a new, more reasonable data protection law was instated.\n\u00a0\nZillur Rahman\u00a0is the executive director of the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) and a television talk show host.

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is set to graduate out of the Least Developed Country (LDC) category in the next few years, and then become a developed country by 2041 while achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. We have even developed the Delta Plan 2100. This will require us to transition as quickly as possible from a labour-based economy to a knowledge-based one within the next generation by investing in our most valuable asset \u2013 our young girls and boys.\nWe must first identify the economic sectors of the future, such as artificial intelligence (AI), information technology (IT), robotics, and environmental problems (including climate change), among others. In order to tackle the impacts of human-induced climate change, turning Bangladesh into a knowledge-based economy will enable us to better adapt to and mitigate said impacts as well as dealing with climate losses and damages.\nLet me start with mitigation, which is essentially transitioning from the use of fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nWhen it comes to installing solar home systems (SHS), Bangladesh is already a world leader, with over six million households having solar panels and batteries delivered by large and medium-sized private companies, who are generating green jobs for millions of young people. The challenge for solar energy expansion going forward will be going beyond the small SHS units to bigger units that can supply electricity at the commercial scale. While there is a constraint of land availability, the newer technologies should be able to overcome this impediment. At the same time, development of battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), which has already expanded in rural areas, requires solar stations around the country. This will create more green jobs and will be a major investment opportunity for private sector investors.\nAs for wind energy, efforts to harness onshore wind energy in a few locations of the coastal zone of Bangladesh have not proven very successful, but the latest technology of offshore wind turbines, which can float and also withstand cyclonic storms, may make it feasible to invest in them. This is envisaged in the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP), with plans to explore feasibility over the next few years.\nAnother climate change solution that Bangladesh is already becoming an acknowledged global leader in is adaptation, with a special emphasis on Locally Led Adaptation (LLA). This is a knowledge sector for which there is a growing demand globally, as all countries will need this knowledge in the coming years. Here, Bangladesh can become a knowledge exporter on LLA.\nHowever, in order to become a knowledge exporter, we will first have to invest in our own knowledge production capacities, such as our universities, research institutions and younger researchers, who will have to be trained and upskilled appropriately. This may not necessarily require much additional finance, but will require new ways of teaching and learning for our youth.\nAn important aspect of tackling climate change is addressing and minimising loss and damage, which is a growing problem in every country. Bangladesh can develop its own loss and damage mechanism (LDM), with the government, private sector and research sector coming together to build on our own experience of disaster preparedness for cyclones and floods. This will be a world-leading knowledge-generating sector and will require a new generation of experts in many different fields \u2013 from climate to finance.\nThe opportunity to make all this happen lies within the development of the ninth Five-Year Plan as well as the next iteration of the Delta Plan 2100, which will take place over the next two years. This is a tremendous opportunity to lay the foundation for the transformation of Bangladesh's economy within a generation.\nIn a nutshell, Bangladesh has an opportunity to leapfrog our development pathway into a knowledge-based economy if we invest wisely and expeditiously in training our young girls and boys to become the knowledge workers of the future.\nDr Saleemul Huq\u00a0is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).\n\n",

        "full_article": "The term 'fanfiction', self-explanatory enough, describes amateur fiction pieces written by a fan, based on popular literary works. Its writers are devoted members of their respective fandoms\u2014be it books, television shows, a film franchise, or a video game; these fans spend considerable amounts of time revisiting the universes of their favourite characters. So much so, that continuing the narrative to their own liking becomes the next logical step.\u00a0\nDespite the great effort that often goes into these works, writers do not really emphasise on putting it through a publication process; they are mainly published on online platforms like Wattpad, and shared via their personal social media accounts\u2014should they choose to circulate it.\u00a0\nIn commercially published works, there is always a name, a face and biography attached to the book; book-signings and interviews take place where the readers can glimpse at the person behind the work.\nFanfiction writers, in contrast, mostly write their content incognito: their profiles are devoid of their photos and their real names hidden behind aliases. So the questions remain: Why do they take such great efforts to create new, additional plot-points and storylines of content that have already been sufficiently discussed and explored by the original creators themselves? Why not develop their own new story/universe? Why put in so many hours into writing about someone else's work?\u00a0\nTo appreciate the 'fanfic' writer, one must understand how a fan's mind works. Fans are not just passive consumers. They do not finish reading a book or watching a show and move on with their lives. Instead we spend hours reimagining scenes, wondering about other possibilities and contemplating pivotal moments from within the fictional world that we have grown to love. And sometimes, in our obsessive devotion, we let our minds run wild, and this is why we create fan-clubs, the existence of which often prompts activities such as cosplaying and multi-day fan conventions and expositions. And when our imaginations continue to overflow with possibilities and our minds keep churning out newer ideas about the source material, the only way forward is to write it all down.\u00a0\nI believe fanfiction is written for a number of reasons. Some fans want to explore other possibilities by expanding on certain ideas from the source material that they most cherish. Others seek to answer questions that were left unexplored, and many others seek to change elements in the story to result in an ending to their satisfaction. Some ambitious fans want to explore the possibilities of combining two or more franchises to form crossovers.\u00a0\nPersonally, my mind has often wondered what would have happened if Nina Zenik and Matthias Helvar from Six of Crows escaped to Novyi Zem instead of coming back to Ketterdam, or how the story of Lord of the Rings would have progressed if Boromir managed to snatch the ring from Frodo. These are questions that can only be answered by fanfiction writers.\u00a0\nNo matter how many reasons there are for writing fanfiction, they all intimately coalesce into a simple fact: fanfiction is written and read because it allows fans to spend a little extra time with the characters they have grown to adore. What fan would not want to prolong their time within a story surrounded by the fictional characters, whose joys and struggles have moved them, characters that they have rooted for and characters that they have lost?\u00a0\nDespite this kind of sincere devotion, many critics dismiss fanfiction writers as being too lazy or lacking in active imagination, stemming from the concern that the content is based on borrowed characters and plots (even though all fanfiction comes with a disclaimer that gives all content ownership to the original creators). Simply explained, fanfiction is just a devoted fan's mind asking, \"What if?\"\u00a0\nThe genre means that the author or the creator of the fictional work has touched the hearts of their fans, it means that they have given their fans hope and vision, causing positive ripples in their lives. Fanfiction is the greatest love letter a work of art can receive from a fan.\nSameirah Nasrin Ahsan is a mechanical engineer in Dhaka. She aspires to be an author someday.

        "full_article": "It is concerning to learn that government officials in the public administration cadre are getting blanket promotions despite there being no posts against these promotions. According to the calculations of the ministry of public administration, currently there are 5,971 officers working in the ministry. While there are 337 posts of additional secretary, in reality, as many as 433 people are working as additional secretaries, meaning that there are 96 additional secretaries for whom there are no posts. And 717 officials have been promoted to joint secretaries against 502 posts, which means there are 215 more joint secretaries than are designated. The same goes for the positions of deputy secretaries. Moreover, the process of giving new promotions in the ministry is ongoing. Reportedly, this trend of giving promotions without following due procedure has been going on for almost a decade now.\nThe question is, what purpose will this large pool of high-ranking officials \u2013 who have been promoted in these posts despite there being no vacant positions \u2013 serve in the ministry, as their job responsibilities do not change with their promotions? Reportedly, most of these newly promoted officials are performing their previous job responsibilities, and no additional responsibilities have been given to them. The question that natural arises is, why then did the ministry give them such blanket promotions? The answer is simple: promoted officials can draw higher salaries and have more perks and benefits. Clearly, these promotions have been given solely to please the officials concerned.\n\nUnfortunately, while a huge amount of public money is spent for government officials \u2013 reportedly, more than 25 percent of the total budget for FY 2022-23 has been allocated for salaries and pensions in the public sector \u2013 its return has been anything but satisfactory. \nUnfortunately, while a huge amount of public money is spent for government officials \u2013 reportedly, more than 25 percent of the total budget for FY 2022-23 has been allocated for salaries and pensions in the public sector \u2013 its return has been anything but satisfactory. People often complain of not getting their desired service from government offices (and officials). There are also allegations of corruption and irregularities against many government offices. Bribing as a means of getting services from these offices is also a common complaint that people make.\nWe think, in any modern state, the structure of administration and its posts should be determined as per demand. If there is a need to promote the officials in the public administration cadre, the government must first create the required positions. But by giving blanket promotions, the government has just set a bad precedent, and it is likely that it will create chaos and anarchy in the ministry concerned, the public sector in general and beyond.\nWe hope the public administration ministry will realise this and stop this culture of unnecessary promotions at the expense of taxpayers. The authorities should rather focus on making the administration more efficient and people-friendly so that people get their desired services without hassle. Most importantly, there should be accountability and transparency in all the works of the administration.\n",

        "full_article": "Looting. Torture. Extortion. You would expect these nefarious activities from hardened criminals, and not from those whose job it is to prevent them. But what happens when their roles are reversed? For Rajib Kar Raju \u2013 a jewellery shop worker who was allegedly looted, tortured, and extorted by three cops from Dhaka's Kotwali Police Station in 2019 \u2013 it means\u00a0seeing his chance of justice slip further away, because of the impunity enjoyed by members of the police force in Bangladesh. This is quite disturbing.\n\nAlthough the authorities claim to have taken action after every such misconduct/crime, the truth is, justice has been neither visible nor promptly and proactively served in most cases. \nRajib Kar is but one of the many victims of custodial torture in Bangladesh. In interviews and official letters and complaints, he described how two police officers in plainclothes raided his house in the capital's Goalnagar area on February 10, 2019, and took 28 tolas of gold jewellery and Tk 41,300 cash from his possession. Then, they took him to the police station where another cop joined them as they beat him mercilessly and left him unconscious. Then, he was tortured again and given electric shock. Later, they demanded Tk 5 lakh for his release, of which he was able to pay Tk 2 lakh. Till date, Rajib doesn't know why he was targeted, nor did he get back the looted gold or money.\nThe second part of his ordeal began after he sought to bring his tormentors to justice. He wrote to the National Human Rights Commission, which was unable to elicit a response from the home ministry and police headquarters. He approached them all, unsuccessfully. Finally, on March 2, he managed to file a case with a Dhaka court under the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act. Since then, Rajib says, he received phone calls from people identifying themselves as police officers threatening him to withdraw the case. Given these impediments and the extremely slow pace of investigation \u2013 a common feature in cases related to police misconduct \u2013 there is no guarantee that Rajib will get justice anytime soon.\nAll this is a sobering reality check for those who hoped things would change for the better after a historic verdict, two years ago, sentenced five policemen to various jail terms over the custodial death of Ishtiaque Hossain Jonny. Since then, there has been little substantive change in terms of accountability for the police force. We have had various reports of custodial torture and even death. Members of the police force, including the Rapid Action Battalion, were often flagged for misconduct and use of excessive force. Although the authorities claim to have taken action after every such instance, the truth is, justice has been neither visible nor promptly and proactively served in most cases. Also, the standard official response has been mostly reactive rather than preventive, which is really ill-suited to the needs of our time.\nWe urge the higher authorities to expedite Rajib Kar Raju's case and all such cases so that justice can be delivered swiftly. The victims also need protection against their powerful tormentors, as well as legal and monetary support. The government must deal with errant police officials with the highest priority.\n",

        "full_article": "Starting is no less a difficult and time-consuming part of a business in Bangladesh than actually doing it. And that is more so for a foreigner who wants to start any business venture in this country. But that is not due to any lack of cooperation from any quarters. In fact, it is completing the necessary paperwork before starting a business that is actually exhausting. One has to run from one office to another to meet the most basic requirements like obtaining a licence, having a certificate issued, or getting a company registered. And if the entrepreneur in question is planning to set up a factory, then the challenges before her/him will only grow bigger.So, to facilitate the inception of a business, be it a trading or a manufacturing venture, it would be important to ensure that the information and forms on all the procedures for the preparation of papers are available on a single platform. In this connection, a report was carried by the Monday's issue of this paper. It was about a study that a local policy think tank, in collaboration with an international development partner, carried out on the institutional, operational and legal requirements that entrepreneurs have to meet to start a business venture in Bangladesh in certain sectors of the industry. The industrial sectors studied include the readymade garment (RMG), pharmaceuticals, leather and food processing. The good news is that the study was well worth the effort as one of the end products of the exercise is a well-designed web portal. It would, it is believed, help would-be entrepreneurs to easily access all the necessary information about establishing a factory and the processes of getting a licence, a certificate or a registration for the purpose, especially, in the aforementioned industrial sectors.And in the light of the said study outcome, experts and business entrepreneurs at a recent discussion event in the city were for a cleanup of the existing tardy and complex procedural tangles in the way of starting a new business setup, a factory, in particular. There is no denying the fact that the government has so far taken various steps including introduction of a one-stop service by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) as well as other pro-business initiatives. Even so, such services are not well-organised to meet the specific needs of business ventures of different categories. For example, the needs of a well-established business and those of a beginner are quite different. And the problems get really difficult, especially, for foreign entrepreneurs as the number of desks they have to visit are too many. Worse, such visit to a particular desk may not be a one-off. And things border on the absurd when they are handed forms printed in Bangla to fill in.So, the case for an online facility in the shape of a webpage containing all the required information and guidelines for setting up a factory needs no further explaining. However, the webpage so designed by a private initiative cannot be said to be exhaustive or foolproof. So, there is ample room for the web portal's further improvement. New features, for example, could be added to it, while inessential ones removed. Finally, the government should extend its total support to the web portal so designed to facilitate starting up of a factory by fresh entrepreneurs. The sooner it is launched for its potential users the better.",

        "full_article": "A recent news item that a state-of-the-art raw material producing plant for plastic goods has gone into operation on the outskirts of the capital might have attracted the attention of many. Among the raw materials-- PVC and PET resin, the key ingredients for scores of plastic products for which the country is entirely import-dependent, will now be produced in the plant-- that too in a big scale. This is a piece of good news, and the reason for it being so is the ever-increasing demand for environmentally-safe plastic products in the global market. The availability of quality raw materials locally is likely to boost production of myriad varieties of plastic products for both domestic and export market.The country's export of plastic goods has been growing. However, the figures are not big enough to evoke great optimism. The fact remains that in Bangladesh, plastic plants have only recently opted for modern technology in producing various food and non-food grade products. With more technology back up, and accompanying diversification, the industry -- though scattered and even disorganised -- has the potential to grow extensively if provided with the required facilities. This may open up a new vista for exporting.It may be noted that the export of plastic goods was far from the targeted goals of the industry even a decade back, though there were few enterprises that used to export in small volumes. Mainly it is the local demand that motivated factories-medium, small and very small-to produce plastic products.The annual sales of plastic products are currently estimated at around Tk 150 billion in the local market, in which household items account for nearly Tk 20 billion. Increase in domestic supplies reportedly grew at 15 per cent a year over the last several years. Industry insiders, as quoted in recent newspaper reports, said the sector is experiencing fresh investment to the tune of Tk 1-1.5 billion each year. The country's plastic sector is said to employ around 1.2 million people directly or indirectly in well over 4,500 small, medium and large manufacturing units. Value addition in manufacturing is also commendably high, ranging between 50 and 70 per cent. At present, around 5000 factories are producing plastic products in more than a dozen categories. Use of plastic products in the country has grown manifold thanks to the dynamic improvements in recycling technology-- a key stimulus in increased production on the one hand and growing consumer preference on the other. However, lack of up-grading the quality and diversification in product range is commonly attributed as the main impediment to the sector's growth to a far higher level. This holds true in respect of production for domestic consumption as well as exporting.Despite the progress, concerned quarters consider this far from what it actually should be in view of the overwhelming surge in global demand. Major improvements in infrastructure, waste management, recycling and skills development are some of the critical areas in need of urgent attention to push the growth momentum to the desired level. In addition to these basics, product development and product adaptation should be attended to as a matter of priority. This, unfortunately, is an area many of the manufacturers miss out resulting in less than expected success in accessing overseas markets. Global market of plastic is essentially demand-driven. Price structure of plastic products is highly wide-ranging, able to absorb immensely diversified products by the low, middle and up-end market segments. Plastic industry, unlike most other industries, invites arguments both for and against the basic premise -- its presence as an evil or a blessing. The negative attitude is largely because of the many ill-effects that are almost integrally linked to it. Currently, there are efforts, globally, towards cutting down the ill-effects, and one hopes these succeed to the benefit of billions of people dependent of plastic products all over the world. Thus while one speaks about plastic, there are other things that come up too. One such is the poor or inadequate recycling of plastic wastes. This is a scenario common to most developing countries, and Bangladesh is no exception. While pollution caused by plastic waste is tormenting for the environment including aquatic resources necessitating urgent action, the reason why this manufacturing sector needs better management is increasingly felt at home and abroad. The Ministry of Industries has prepared the draft 'National Plastic and Packaging Industry Development Policy 2019' with short and long-term action plans for the development of the growing sector. The draft is reportedly awaiting government's nod. With the draft expected to be cleared soon, the industry will hopefully attract more attention that it urgently deserves, and measures and facilitations envisaged in it should initiate appropriate moves from both the concerned government agencies as well as the industry itself. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The recent announcement by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) that bulk prices of electricity will be raised upward could not have come at a worse time. That the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has proposed a 66 per cent rise citing dearth of gas and oil points to the direction and magnitude of hike.Whatever the BERC's decision is it would come as a shock to both industry and consumers. The regulatory commission has already raised natural gas tariff by 22.78 per cent as of June 2022. At a time when the readymade garments industry (including textile industry), that generates the bulk of export earnings of the country is reeling from a serious drop in gas supply, such hike would be another nail in the coffin. Objections have been raised by both consumer rights organisations and trade bodies which have proposed several measures as alternatives to raising prices. For instance, withdrawal of import duties and taxes on furnace oil imposed in June 2020 will reduce the electricity-generation cost.Although belated, but recent drives by Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company have disconnected some 250,000 illegal gas connections pointing to the culture of siphoning off precious natural gas on a daily basis. By Petrobangla's own estimates anywhere from 250 to 300 million cubic feet of gas can be saved if illegal connections can be minimised. Today, system loss in the country's gas distribution system stands at around 10 per cent, which is estimated at 1-2 per cent internationally. At a time of depleting gas reserves, such drives against illegal connection must become the modus operandi. Our energy sector planning has not benefitted from any serious effort to exploit our own natural gas potential, both onshore and offshore. Furthermore, no effort has been made to extract domestic coal deposits. On the other hand, policymakers have undertaken major projects to build coal-fired power plants that will use imported coal. It is estimated that when all these power plants come on line, the government will have to import 66 million tonnes of coal annually to generate 22,000MW of electricity. At a time when foreign reserves are under tremendous pressure, how will we foot the bill?With the war between Russia and Ukraine showing no signs of stopping any time soon, this situation has pushed up the prices of coal, oil and LNG in the international markets. With Europe bracing for a harsh winter, predictions point to that continent snapping most of the available LNG from the international market, adding another blow to our energy mix where share of imported liquid fuel (furnace oil and diesel) has gone up to 34 per cent. The other problem being Bangladesh's over-dependence on natural gas based infrastructure where industry has become used to subsidised gas. With the rapid rate of decline in domestic natural gas production and steady increment of LNG imports, indefinite subsidies for primary fuel supply is simply not feasible. Again, if production input costs continue to rise (this includes cost of fuel and overall cost of doing business), it would be extremely challenging for businesses to maintain their competitiveness.It is time to rethink the import-dependent primary energy mix taking into account both price and availability. We need to move beyond utopian ideas and adopt a policy of open pit mining at proven coal fields of Phulbari-Barapukuria, which according to experts can provide 1.0 billion tonnes of good quality coal. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

There could be several reasons for this. Mobile phones in schools reduce the interest of students in sports or extra-curricular activities. They are distracted by the attractive games and apps on the phone. Moreover, the device may also limit students' communication with their teachers and classmates if they remain glued to their screens. Also, continuous exposure to radiation causes health problems for schoolchildren. On the other hand, there are some people who are in favour of allowing mobile phones in schools. In their view, a mobile is more a necessity in today's world than a luxury. If not a smart phone, children should be at least allowed to carry a basic mobile. Students can use them to call up parents in cases of emergency, such as a weather disturbance or transport problem. And for security reasons it becomes important for school administrations to allow students to carry their mobiles to school. It can prevent a possible incident of kidnapping or abduction.
