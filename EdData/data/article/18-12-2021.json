While the two meetings may have focused on bilateral issues, the conversations appear to have overlapped in unusual ways. According to a senior Kremlin official, after discussing with Mr. Modi India\u2019s problems with Chinese aggression, which were raised publicly during the visit by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Mr. Putin \u201cbriefed\u201d Mr. Xi on his talks in Delhi. The official then indicated that a trilateral summit of the leaders of Russia, India and China (RIC) could be held in the near future, which would pick up on the Modi-Putin-Xi conversation during an RIC summit on the sidelines of the Osaka G-20 summit in 2019. However, much has occurred between that summit and today. China\u2019s aggression at the Line of Actual Control has dented hopes of peaceful coexistence and growth between the neighbours that had been outlined during the RIC as well as the Modi-Xi Mamallapuram summit, when the leaders last met face to face. Since April 2020, the two leaders have not spoken directly once, and while they have attended the same multilateral summits (BRICS, SCO, G-20, etc.), it would be hard to see them engaging in a face-to-face format unless the situation at the LAC considerably eases. In addition, the RIC summit should not be held before promises made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in meetings with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar are fulfilled.While India-Russia defence and bilateral ties have considerably strengthened, especially after the Modi government\u2019s decision to go ahead with its purchase of the S-400 missile defence systems despite the U.S. threat of sanctions, New Delhi must tread cautiously in its trilateral and multilateral cooperation with Moscow and any hint that Russia could play a facilitator of talks with China must be scrutinised closely. Russia and China have consolidated their support for each other in the face of U.S. concerns over Russian action against Ukraine and Chinese action on Taiwan. Russia is also deeply dependent on Chinese investment, particularly in the 30-year $400 billion gas pipeline. On Afghanistan, Russia has shown that it was prepared to cut India out of negotiations held by the Troika plus group with the U.S., China and Pakistan. Any expectation that Mr. Putin could play \u201chonest broker\u201d between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi must take these factors into account. While India must continue to walk the tightrope between Moscow and Washington, and its partners in Eurasia versus those in the Indo-Pacific, it needs to disentangle these threads from the very potent threat it faces directly and bilaterally from its northern neighbour, where it has little choice but to follow an independent path.",

        "full_article": "The Union Cabinet\u2019s decision this week to set aside \u20b976,000 crore for supporting the development of a \u2018semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem\u2019 is a belated but welcome acknowledgment of the strategic significance of integrated circuits, or chips, to a modern economy. The basic building blocks that serve as the heart and brain of all modern electronics and information and communications technology products, the ubiquitous chips are now an integral part of contemporary automobiles, household gadgets such as refrigerators, and essential medical devices such as ECG machines. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically thrown into sharp relief the vulnerability that a range of manufacturing industries and, by extension, national economies are exposed to in the face of disruptions in the supply of these vital semiconductors. The pandemic-driven push to take sizeable parts of daily economic and essential activity online, or at least digitally enable them, has also highlighted the centrality of the chip-powered computers and smartphones in people\u2019s lives. With the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing and supply capability concentrated in a handful of countries including Taiwan, South Korea, U.S., Japan and, more recently, China, governments worldwide have realised that it is in the national interest to treat chip manufacturing as a strategic imperative. The Cabinet decision to simultaneously establish an India Semiconductor Mission helmed by \u2018global industry experts\u2019 to drive long-term strategies for the sustainable development of the chip and display industry is therefore a step in the right direction.The challenge ahead, however, is fairly daunting. For one, the level of fiscal support currently envisioned is minuscule when one considers the scale of investments typically required to set up manufacturing capacities in the various sub sectors of the semiconductor industry. A semiconductor fabrication facility, or fab, can cost multiples of a billion dollars to set up even on a relatively small scale and lagging by a generation or two behind the latest in technology. Even granting that India\u2019s Production Linked Incentive scheme intends to give only 50% of the cost of setting up at least two greenfield semiconductor fabs by way of fiscal support, not much of the current scheme outlay of approximately $10 billion is likely to be left to support other elements including display fabs, packaging and testing facilities, and chip design centres. Chip fabs are also very thirsty units requiring millions of litres of clean water and extremely stable power supply. It may be best if the new mission focuses fiscal support, for now, on other parts of the chip-making chain including design, where surely India already has considerable talent and experience.",

        "full_article": "In recent times, there have been many discussions, discourses and deliberations on \"muktijuddher chetona,\" wherein passionate and eloquent speakers have emphasised the imperative of holding aloft the spirit of our great Liberation War. People have been given to understand that generations of Bangladeshis need to grasp and appreciate the uniqueness of our emancipatory struggle, and that in matters of public affairs, we should properly imbibe the spirit of said struggle for the democratic flourishing of the polity.\nConstitutionally speaking, we have pledged \"to realise through the democratic process a socialist society free from exploitation, a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice\u2014political, economic and social\u2014will be secured for all citizens.\" It would be pertinent to note that these high ideals inspired our heroic forefathers to dedicate themselves to sacrifice their lives for independence. Quite clearly, therefore, the realisation of these ideals, as incorporated in our constitution, shall realistically mean upholding the spirit of our Liberation War.\nGround realities, unfortunately, do not appear encouraging insofar as the realisation of the spirit of the Liberation War. This is so because of alleged moral failings. Many of the influentials in our society are busy making quick gains, as if that is the be-all and end-all of life. Many public figures hardly ever practise frugality, simplicity and integrity preached by our great Prophet (PBUH), although frequent references are attributed to his teachings.\nThe high ideals of our Liberation War have to be accomplished through the democratic process. However, the spectacle of the shocks and bruises of our democratic progression cannot escape even a casual observer. Too often, we see the temper that presses a partisan advantage to its bitter end, and does not understand and respect the other side. Such temperaments demonstrate a lack of feeling of unity among all citizens. It is taking us a painfully long time to appreciate that democracy depends upon the habits of consent and compromise, which are also attributes of mature political societies. Sadly, as the spirit of moderation is in short supply, our society runs the risk of degenerating into divisions with hatred, replacing goodwill.\nOne may want to ask if the Liberation War's spirit has taught every class of citizens to put the nation above the individual, group or party. Do we witness a change from privilege to talent and from accident of birth to emphasis on calibre? Has money been regarded as something to be earned, rather than to be inherited or won? Do we understand that there is no substitute for knowledge and integrity in public life? Have we been able to ensure the appointment of persons to high public offices on account of what their merits are, and not because they represent a particular interest or region? The desirable course of action related to these queries can truly guarantee the proper imbibing of the spirit of the Liberation War.\nIt is, indeed, unfortunate that many public leaders in their parlance exhibit the arrogance of power\u2014the exact opposite of the unfeigned humility of great leaders. Some among them have the delusion of infallibility, while some others appear to be under an oath never to become wiser. The conduct of some is still prone to be governed by emotions rather than by reason. Surely, such a state of affairs runs counter to the spirit of the Liberation War.\nThere is no doubt that the unflinching devotion to patriotism and unbounded love for the motherland prompted our brave freedom fighters to forsake worldly pleasures and possessions. No wonder that the freedom fighters have been portrayed as the greatest children of the soil\u2014and rightly so, because they embarked on a dangerous course of action without any expectation of gain. Viewed in this light, the unseemly use of freedom fighter identity for irregular material favours demeans the hallowed memories of the greatest children of the soil. The delay in compiling an authentic and complete list of freedom fighters is another deficit that has pained the nation. Surely, the spirit of our Liberation War would demand corrective actions so that, for the generations to come, our struggle for freedom and the contributions of the freedom fighters remain a prized memory.\nThe realisation of the spirit of the Liberation War must make us appreciate that we cannot live by the gross national product alone. The quality of life is far more important, and this quality is determined to a large extent by the availability of the basic human rights and civil liberties, which are enshrined in the chapter on fundamental rights in our constitution. Without those rights, the quality of life would be gravely impaired. While making endeavours to raise the standard of living, we must understand the significance of the standard of life. In so doing, we can be expected to correctly imbibe the spirit of our great Liberation War.\n\u00a0\nMuhammad Nurul Huda is a former IGP of Bangladesh Police.\n",

        "full_article": "How time flies.\nAs an old-timer, I vividly recall that wondrous day. On the glorious morning of December 16, 1971, like millions of Bangladeshis, a pre-teen kid (yours truly) waited with nervous anticipation.\nLater in the day, the wonderful news reached us that the Pakistan Army in erstwhile East Pakistan had surrendered to the joint command of Mukti Bahini and the Indian Army. This was way before the time of the internet, social media and mobile phones. Yet, the news travelled like wildfire, and the nation erupted in joy and relief.\nFreedom at last! Now a newborn nation could chart its own path in the world. But for that we paid a terrible price\u2014millions dead, a nation in ruins. How would the country get back on its own feet?\nHalf a century later, it is impossible not to be impressed by the strides the nation has taken. This is especially true for us old-timers who lived through those difficult early years. Bangladesh, you have to remember, started off as a nation devastated by war with empty coffers. It had to survive a terrible man-made famine exacerbated by a Cold War-era US administration under Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger that withdrew critical grain supplies out of a fit of mean-spirited pique.\nDecades of political turmoil followed, marked by bloody military coups and extended periods of autocratic rule.\nToday, 50 years down the road, Bangladesh is at a crossroads again. As veteran bureaucrat-academic Akbar Ali Khan has astutely noted, the economic strides and advancement in human development indices is something he could not have imagined when the nation won its freedom. On the other hand, the challenges that the nation faces now are also quite serious, and it can ill afford to rest on its laurels.\nI shall talk about the challenges presently, but ask for the readers' indulgence for a moment as I reflect upon the breathtaking strides that Bangladesh has made. To fully realise the enormity of this achievement, I suggest we look further back to 1947, when the British ran a cartographer's knife and ripped apart Bengal to create East Pakistan.\nThe new province lacked even a Bangla-speaking Muslim middle class, which evolved later through the University of Dhaka. The predominantly Muslim Bengali population was largely of peasant stock, in sharp contrast to our ethnic/linguistic brethren in the neighbouring West Bengal, which had a distinguished tradition of excellence in learning that had given rise earlier to the Bengali Renaissance.\nTo their credit, the (predominantly Muslim) Bengalis in erstwhile East Pakistan ignored the siren call of communal, majoritarian prejudice, as over the years they fashioned a political ethos that was based on language and culture. It was an identity which was humane and inclusive in the finest traditions of the titans of Bangla literature.\nThe movement culminated in a liberation of a country who proudly proclaimed its guiding values defined by its national anthem by Rabindranath Tagore: \"Amar Sonar Bangla.\"\nBangladesh's spectacular strides in economic development had to wait until some time after independence. A series of circumstances brought this about: the massive influx in foreign exchange remittances resulting from the growth in expatriate workers, the rise of entrepreneurship pioneered by the ready-made garment industry, and the extraordinary gusto with which Bangladeshis took to entrepreneurship. A nation of people, who barely two generations ago were farmers, ended up spearheading an entrepreneurial revolution that changed the country beyond recognition. Bangladesh became a leading global exporter of a slew of products, ranging from textiles to pharmaceuticals, and massive indigenous corporate houses engaged in a diverse array of activities. It's a modern-day economic miracle.\nHowever, as we take justifiable pride in what Bangladesh has achieved, we ignore its serious challenges at our peril.\nThe challenges that the country faces today are also rooted in its history. One of the less salubrious developments in the recent past has been the moral bankruptcy of post-colonial elites. All over the developing world, the soaring rhetoric that accompanied the independence of former colonial nations stands in stark contrast with the sordid reality of independent nations deeply mired in authoritarian repression, political intolerance, and rampant corruption. Bangladesh, alas, has not been able to escape this curse, which continues to cast an ominous shadow on its future.\nThe sobering fact remains that Bangladesh's achievements, spectacular as they are, rest on a precariously fragile framework of governance whose quality in terms of accountability and transparency leaves a lot to be desired.\nThere is an oft-repeated facile contention that once we achieve economic progress, it will take care of everything else. This is a dangerous myth. The underlying fault lines in governance, left unaddressed, have the potential to bring down the entire edifice tumbling down.\nThese challenges are all the more alarming given the current noxious post-globalised climate, where the rise of an intolerant majoritarianism finds easy prey in restive populations which are angered by the unconscionably uneven distribution of the spoils of economic globalisation.\nAt this historic juncture, we contemplate Bangladesh's future with hope and some concern. Bangladesh has taken enormous strides in the past, and there is absolutely no reason why it cannot cross the hurdles it faces today. What we have to remember, however, is that this will only happen if we recognise the challenges and make a committed effort to address them.\nToday, however, I wish to take a moment, with a heart filled with poignant affection and eyes misty with tears, to thank those who made this golden future possible with their enormous sacrifice. To those valiant, departed souls who brought us our independence, I join my nation in saying, \"Amra tomader bhulbo na (We shall never forget you.)\"\n\u00a0\nAshfaque Swapan is a writer and editor based in Atlanta, US.\n",

        "full_article": "The mood of the moment is overwhelmingly celebratory. And why not? Not only are we observing 50 years of our independence, but we are doing so with a new sense of pride, accomplishment and, most importantly, confidence\u2014confidence that we can face all the challenges that come our way.\nThose of us who had the good fortune of being direct participants in our freedom struggle feel a special pleasure on this occasion. Being 20-something then and being 70-something now, many of us were not sure if we would survive the war in the first place\u2014that we would live long enough to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of independence in person.\nRecalling the days of our Liberation War is a matter of supreme pleasure\u2014as it must be\u2014but it is also one of great sadness. Millions of people\u2014men, women and children\u2014were killed, over 200,000 women assaulted, and millions more were made refugees in India, and a greater number internally displaced. The stunning success of our victory came at an immense human cost forced upon innocent Bengalis by the brutal Pakistan Army, a loss from which we are yet to fully recover, as is the case of the loss of our intellectuals.\nAll this happened due to the brutality of the Pakistan Army. How could an army attack its own people whom they were under oath to protect? Their brutality was not a one-off isolated incident that occurred in one village or two villages, in some remote part of the country. The genocide they indulged in went on throughout the nine months of our Liberation War. Such inhumanity could only be possible if it were rooted in racialism, triggered by a desire for ethnic cleansing.\nFor me and thousands like me, it all began in Dhaka University. Energised by the Six-Point and 11-Point movements, we were ready for the days of March 1971. Following the postponement of the National Assembly by then Pakistan President Gen Yahya Khan, students gathered at the famous \"bottola\" at the Arts Faculty in Dhaka University and witnessed the unfurling of what would become our national flag by the then Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu) Vice-President ASM Abdur Rab. The red-and-green flag with a yellow map of Bangladesh at the centre spread like wildfire as copies of it\u2014both on paper and in fabric\u2014were made spontaneously and distributed to whoever wanted to carry it. And, of course, everybody did.\nWith Bangabandhu's call for non-violent non-cooperation movement, the Pakistan government's control of what was then East Pakistan practically ceased. All government offices came to a standstill, all businesses were shut down\u2014except for the essentials\u2014and everything was focused on only one thing: how to get out of the clutches of the Pakistani rulers.\nDhaka was a city of processions and public gatherings from then on, with only one message: get ready for that long-delayed encounter with history. The gathering of March 7 and our leader's historic speech that all but declared our independence gave us a clear indication of the events to come.\nThe massacre that started on the night of March 25 marked the beginning of the end for Pakistan. The influx of refugees to India, the formation of the Mujibnagar government, the consolidation of the structure and command of the Bangladesh Army, the gradual maturing of the Mukti Bahini, and the rising effectiveness of their guerrilla activities were all leading towards our ultimate victory.\nIn our discussion on our Liberation War, two aspects have not been highlighted enough: first, the role of the international media, including that of India; and second, our success in the world of diplomacy, and the singular role played by the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\nBangladesh owes an enormous debt to the international media for making the world aware of the genocide started by Pakistan from the initial days of the war, and keeping that story alive throughout the nine months, and ultimately persuading the world public to see the reality as it was. It is often overlooked how the story of the massacre on the night of March 25, and the following days of brutal suppression of our people, were brought out through high-risk reporting in some of the most prestigious newspapers and broadcasting houses in the world. Throughout our struggle, the international media never lost sight of the events unfolding in East Pakistan, and contributed enormously in galvanising the world opinion in our favour.\nThe massive expose in the UK-based Sunday Times by Anthony Mascarenhas' (a member of a Pakistani team of journalists who were on an army-sponsored tour of the occupied East Pakistan, and who secretly escaped to London with his family before publishing his story) exclusive eye-witness account of the killing, torture, oppression of women, and displacement of our people made a significant impact on global conscience about what was going on. I personally remember BBC's role\u2014especially of its Bangla section. The Indian media also played a vital part in not only covering the developments of our struggle, but also keeping the international media informed, as the latter regularly monitored the former to keep abreast of the situation. Akash Vani gave us invaluable support.\nOn the diplomatic front, it was an extremely difficult challenge. The bipolar world of the Cold War-era had set the international community apart with its ideological divisions and priorities. Pakistan was a close ally of the US and a long-term recipient of its military aid. On the other hand, India pursued a non-aligned policy, which the US always looked upon with unease and even suspicion.\nChina, probably because of the 1962 war and subsequent rivalry, veered towards Pakistan, and by 1971 was one of its staunch allies.\nIndia had to navigate very carefully in this highly polarised international world and effectively counter the Pakistani propaganda that our Liberation War was nothing but an Indian ploy to bifurcate Pakistan. Thus, India needed to move slowly and focus global attention to the refugee crisis that was growing bigger by the day\u2014seven million by August and 10 million by December\u2014while providing the necessary logistics to the Mukti Bahini and the Bangladesh armed forces, not to mention housing our government in exile and providing security and other assistance to our leadership.\nMuch depended on how deeply China would be willing to go towards backing Pakistan, with clear early signs that the former took no notice of the events in our territory and unquestioningly toed the Pakistani line. Much also depended on the role of the Soviet Union\u2014the other partner of the Cold War\u2014which had not yet shown much interest in the Bangladesh affairs.\nAnd here lies the success of Indian diplomacy and especially of its prime minister, Indira Gandhi, without whose clear, determined, and unflinching support for the Bangladesh cause, our victory might have faced harder obstacles. The Bangladesh government in exile, headed by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, clearly understood that for India to act decisively at some point, China had to be countered by the USSR's active commitment in our struggle (see Muyeedul Hasan's article \"1971: PN Haksar in bridging the security gap,\" published in the Victory Day supplement of The Daily Star on December 16, 2021). This necessitated both the internal redrawing of the political relationships and the reconfiguration of big power alliances.\nThe post-World War II pattern of global power received a massive jolt with the then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's July visit to China, undertaken secretly from Peshawar, Pakistan, and subsequently declaring that US President Richard Nixon would visit China the following year. None of these developments escaped the notice of the Bangladesh government, nor that of India, greatly complicating the international power dynamics within which the Bangladesh government had to navigate. Earlier, Kissinger visited India and literally warned against any military action on Pakistan, saying that India could expect no assistance from the US in the eventuality that the conflict spilled over into something bigger. This warning, coupled with Kissinger using the soil of Pakistan to bring about the biggest shift in the US foreign policy in the post-war period, greatly worried the policymakers both in our government in exile and definitely in India.\nThe intimidation that the US stance really amounted to had the opposite effect on the Indian premier, who quickly signed, in August 1971, the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship with the USSR, significantly assuring mutual strategic cooperation in cases of conflict. This meant a significant shift in Indian policy of non-alignment since independence. Following the treaty, Indira Gandhi undertook a comprehensive tour\u2014in September- November, 1971\u2014of the Soviet Union, Belgium, Austria, the US, France and Germany to explain the Bangladesh situation and appeal for global cooperation in resolving it. When advised to go for negotiations with Pakistan, she said, \"There is no India-Pakistan dispute involved. The negotiations must be held between the President of Pakistan and the duly elected leadership of the Awami League in Bangladesh.\" In a BBC interview, when asked about \"restraint,\" she said, \"When Hitler was on the rampage, why didn't you say, 'Let's keep quiet and let's have peace with Germany and let the Jews die?'\" (See Praveen Davar's article \"1971 War: How India's foreign policy was key to Dhaka Triumph\" in the Deccan Chronicle, October 20, 2021).\nThe Indo-Soviet treaty stands out not only as a brilliant strategic move by India, but as one that is of tremendous significance to the birth of Bangladesh. It dissuaded China from getting militarily involved and acted as a caution for the US Seventh Fleet.\nIn a Cold War-ridden world, with the Vietnam War still raging, with Soviet-China rivalry at its height, with India's own military strength untested, and with the last moment opening up of the US-China rapprochement process, it was an unclear global power juxtaposition within which India had to undertake its most significant and dangerous strategic risk in going for an all-out support for the Bangladesh cause. It is my view that the role played by Indira Gandhi in support of our struggle for independence went far beyond the considerations of military balance between two rivals and gaining strategic and military superiority. The Indian leader's support for us was based on humanitarian consideration and genuine feeling that a historic wrong was being done to a people simply wanting democracy, for which it was being subjected to the atrocities of the most bestial kind.\nAs we commemorate 50 years of our freedom, we must realise the complicated world in which our leaders had to navigate, the risk\u2014both domestic and international\u2014that India took to help us, the contribution of our Mukti Bahini, and the supreme sacrifice made by our people, but for whose single-minded determination, untold bravery and suffering beyond all imagination, we could not have emerged victorious from so vicious a war in so short a time.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The Government of Bangladesh has recently drafted the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan Decade 2030. In the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), held in Glasgow, Scotland in November this year, Bangladesh showcased this draft plan, which is now available on its website (www.mujibplan.com) for public comments. For four reasons, I think this plan is different from other medium- and long-term plans Bangladesh prepared over the past decade or so.\nFirst, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan proposes a new development philosophy for Bangladesh. It emphasises that the development pathways should not only transform a country to be resilient to a wide range of crises, such as climate change and pandemic\u2014a nation should also be more ambitious and visionary, and take the path of prosperity.\nSecond, Bangladesh's development strategies and action plans formulated so far are focused on itself only. Bangladesh is the current president (2020-2022) of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a platform of 48 countries. Although the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan is for Bangladesh, it shows how the CVF member countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Oceania could also take a similar path to prosperity. The plan, therefore, can be a legacy of Bangladesh's current CVF presidency.\nThird, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan is organised and written differently than other investment plans prepared in Bangladesh. In 2009, for example, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) estimated that USD 5 billion would be needed in the first five years of its implementation. The Bangladesh Country Investment Plan for Environment, Forestry and Climate Change (EFCC CIP) reckoned in 2016 a need for USD 11.7 billion by 2021 to tackle climate change and pollution, and to improve natural resource management and environmental governance. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) may need USD 37 billion by 2040 to implement 80 projects in order to make Bangladesh a resilient delta.\nPrimarily focusing on the climate crisis, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan\u2014a collaborative effort of 10 national and international agencies\u2014goes beyond building climate resilience. We see six broad visions for change, which are called \"key points\" in the document: 1) Accelerated adaptation; 2) Just transition of labour and future-proofing of industry with technology transfer; 3) Increasing public revenue to spend on the most vulnerable; 4) Comprehensive climate and disaster risk financing and management; 5) Leveraging 21st century technologies for well-being; and 6) Maximised renewable energy, energy efficiency, and power and transportation sector resilience. The plan expects USD 83.55 billion investment over the next decade to achieve these targets. A delay in investing in the proposed infrastructural and adaptive measures may result in losses of minimum 4.9 percent of the country's GDP (or USD 30 billion per year) by 2030. Although the plan expects particular ministries to be responsible for implementing some specific projects, it also envisages concerted efforts from a wide range of public and private entities from the country and beyond.\nFourth, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan is reportedly the first planning document in Bangladesh that explicitly and widely used the term Nature-based Solutions (NbS). NbS use nature for the benefit of both people and biodiversity. When we protect, sustainably manage, restore or create diverse ecosystems to tackle our societal challenges, such as disasters, poverty, water insecurity, or climate crisis, we practise NbS.\nTo speed up adaptation to climate change, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan identifies the BDP2100 as a core instrument. In addition to grey infrastructural solutions, the climate prosperity plan includes 14 percent increase in tree coverage, restoration of degraded forests in Chittagong Hill Tracts and haor (wetland) ecosystems, reduction and elimination of deforestation and forest degradation, afforestation in newly accreted char lands and coastline, and ecological restoration of rivers around Dhaka city as key measures. To develop climate-resilient and nature-based agricultural and fisheries supply and value chains, the plan mentioned mangrove-shrimp culture, seaweed cultivation, floating gardening, aqua-geoponics, and vertical farming. These could only be called NbS if both human and biodiversity benefits are ensured.\nUnder the prosperity plan's resilient well-being programme, projects like \"My Village, My Town\" also includes floating vegetable gardens\u2014a centuries-old NbS practised in Bangladesh. The plan also recognises that, by adopting locally-led adaptation principles, such projects could enhance plant and animal diversity, conserve genetic resources, protect wildlife habitats, and improve the quality of ecosystems engaging local poor households. Creating new jobs and ensuring just transition by upskilling the labour force are key aspects of the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan. By recognising the potentials of NbS in generating employment and diversifying livelihoods, the plan has included forest and biodiversity conservation as a part of future just transition projects.\nFor a highly ambitious transition to renewable energy, the prosperity plan proposes \"Mujib Bongoposagor Independence Giga Array,\" a USD 7.2 billion hybrid renewable energy (wind) adaptation infrastructure project, which would undertake mangrove plantation along the coasts and raise funds through blue bonds to protect marine life. The plan also aims to establish a \"National Carbon Finance Coordination Hub\" to attract finance from voluntary carbon market to conserve and sustainably manage forests, and to undertake afforestation, reforestation, mangrove revegetation, and coastal ecosystem protection and management, as a means of adaptation and reduction of losses and damages from climate change.\nJust before Covid-19 hit the world, in November 2019, the Bangladesh Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on \"planetary emergency.\" There, not only climate change, but also biodiversity loss at an unprecedented rate was identified as one of the crises needing urgent actions. But we see limited attention and funding to conserve our nature. For example, the Biodiversity Conservation Fund has still not been established under Article 36 of the Bangladesh Biodiversity Act, 2017, even though it has been four years since the act was enacted.\nMainstreaming NbS into our development strategies and plans can simultaneously address climate change and biodiversity loss, and can overcome our inertia to conserve biodiversity. Therefore, it is encouraging to see that NbS has been mentioned throughout the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan. But the final version of the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan should go farther. Listing down NbS actions that could be taken under different thematic areas is not enough; the plan should also embrace NbS as a fundamental principle. In this way, NbS can truly be mainstreamed into the prosperity plan, contributing to resilient economic growth, locally-led adaptation, innovative financing, human well-being, and resilient energy system, thus helping Bangladesh achieve the envisaged prosperity outcomes by 2030.\nWhen we talk about the prosperity of our nation, we cannot separate our society and economy from the nature we are embedded in. By placing NbS in the heart of the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, Bangladesh can give the world not only the prosperity pathways, but also the ways to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity emergency.\n\u00a0\nDr Haseeb Md Irfanullah is an independent consultant working on environment, climate change, and research systems.

        "full_article": "The shocking death of Elma Chowdhury Meghla\u2014a student of Dhaka University's Department of Dance\u2014at the hands of her in-laws has once again reminded us of the fact that a majority of our girls and women still have to live in the insecure environment of their own homes\u2014or, to be particular, in their in-laws' homes. Elma, who got married in April this year, had to endure torture by her husband and in-laws from the day she started to live with them in their Banani residence in Dhaka. Her friends, classmates and teachers alleged that she was tortured to death because she wanted to continue her studies after marriage, against the will of her in-laws.\nThe extent of abuse, torture and restrictions she had to endure is unimaginable. During the few months of her marriage, Elma was also under constant surveillance. According to her classmates and friends, whenever she came to the university after her marriage, a bodyguard deployed by her in-laws would accompany her. Her classmates further alleged that they could not communicate with her as her phone would often be found switched off or would be answered by her in-laws. She was even forced to wear a hijab by them.\nThat a young woman had to die for wanting to pursue higher education at this time and age is heart-breaking. But in a country where all kinds of violence against women\u2014including domestic violence\u2014are still rampant, such cases are not surprising. The murder of Sumaiya Khatun\u2014a master's student of the Department of Islamic Studies at DU\u2014by her in-laws in 2020 is still fresh in our memory. She, too, wanted to pursue her studies against their will and was subsequently killed by them. Then there are countless other women who had to discontinue their education after marriage, not to mention the increasing number of girls who had to drop out of school due to child marriage.\nAs we are celebrating 50 years of our independence this year, we want to ask the authorities: Why haven't we been able to ensure a safe environment for women and girls inside and outside their homes in all these years? Why are so many girls and women still being tortured, harassed, raped and murdered in this country? Why are so many cases filed in connection with such events never disposed of? What measures has the state taken to stop violence against women?\nIn this particular case, we urge the authorities to immediately arrest the perpetrators. Elma's husband and his family members must face justice. We hope that no more bright young girls have to lose their lives for wanting to pursue their dreams. And that can only happen if justice is served in cases like this one, and if the state takes appropriate measures to stop violence against women.\n",

        "full_article": "Between 2018 and 2020, the number of people without food security in Bangladesh increased by 2.4 percent, to a whopping 52 million, according to a recent study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The report further said that 31.9 percent of Bangladeshis experienced moderate to severe food insecurity during this time, which is concerning. People often face moderate food insecurity when they are uncertain of their ability to obtain food, and have been forced to reduce the quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other resources. Although the report doesn't directly refer to it, the pandemic-induced economic slowdown and its resultant effects were surely a major driver behind the rise in food insecurity.\nCountless studies have revealed how harsh the effects of the pandemic have been on the lives and livelihoods of people. While thousands have lost their jobs due to the losses incurred by businesses, thousands more have had their salaries reduced and/or are now underemployed compared to before the pandemic. As a result, over the last two years, 31.5 percent of our population has had to face moderate to severe food insecurity. That nearly one-third of the country's population are struggling to meet their daily necessary food intake should be a major concern for the government. Among them, there are children whose growth will be severely hampered due to undernourishment. Stunting among children would likely increase as a result. And this would undo so much of the good work that Bangladesh managed to do in the years prior to the pandemic.\nWhile people's capacity to purchase food has gone down, we have also seen prices of essentials go up for many months now. This is further reducing people's ability to afford enough quality food. Unfortunately, the government's policy to increase fuel prices and its inability to thwart the harmful activities of trade syndicates\u2014which have been keeping the prices up artificially\u2014has done nothing to ease people's sufferings.\nUnder the circumstances, there is a big chance that undernourishment among the people will increase in the days ahead\u2014unless the government immediately intervenes. Given that Bangladesh is already all too familiar with the long-term costs of that, we call on the government to urgently address the matter.\nThe government should continually work to keep prices of the essential items affordable for all\u2014something which it has failed miserably at. It should adopt policies that would help the economy rebound quickly so that the problem of high unemployment is resolved soon. The state-run social safety net programmes need to be expanded and made less wasteful. Most importantly, the government should provide direct food aid to the people who are facing severe food insecurity, and in order to identify those people, the government should involve NGOs in its aid programmes.\n",
