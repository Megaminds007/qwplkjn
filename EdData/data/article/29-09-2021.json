The factory then caught fire, and workers on the third floor were ordered to remain and locked up inside\u2014prohibited from escaping a fire that would burn for almost 24 hours straight. The shift had to go on.\nNo trace of Selina was found by her grieving family, when they were interviewed by Somoy TV two days after the fire. Selina's family were seen holding a photograph of her, ardently hoping the child in it will soon reappear. Selina's sister said grimly, \"Please return my sister. I do not need anything else, I just need her back.\" Will Selina return to her family? Or is she one of the 49 humans burnt beyond recognition, and her photo is all that remains?\nA report by The Daily Star suggests that besides than Selina, at least 16 other children were \"missing\" after the Hashem Foods fire. Children who died producing snacks such as lollipops and chocolate spreads for our children, inside a six-storey death trap we chose not to see.\nThat fateful Thursday was also 12-year-old daughter Shanta Moni's third day at work. Shanta had lost her father seven years ago. She was enrolled in a madrasa but stopped studying as it was closed. Shanta Moni's mother, who was gasping for breath after having frantically searched every children's ward in Dhaka Medical College Hospital hoping her beloved daughter would be in one of them told The Daily Star, \"They were going to give her Tk 5,500 per month for making lollipops. She used to work on the third floor.\"\nAccording to the National Child Labour Survey 2013, 3.45 million children aged 5 to 17 were engaged in child labour. The Hashem Foods fire momentarily exposed the prevalence of child labour in Bangladesh and temporarily penetrated our consciences from which this unpleasant and cruel reality had been conveniently filtered out. As a result of this slippage, many of us were forced to wonder how is it that in a state of lockdown all educational institutions are seen as being too unsafe for children to visit, but working inside factories is not? \u00a0Many of us took a step further back and asked: why, if at all, is child labour still legal in Bangladesh?\nThat is the question I hope to explore in this piece. Under the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 (BLA), child labour is legal for children aged above 14, since the law creates a rather artificial distinction between children and adolescents. An \"adolescent\" is defined as a \"person who has completed fourteenth year but has not completed eighteenth year of age\" (Section 2(8), BLA). By contrast, a \"child\" is defined as a \"person who has not completed fourteen years of age\" (Section 2(63), BLA). Therefore, employing a 14-year-old girl like Selina to oil engines of industrial growth is perfectly legal.\nThe labour law's definition of a child is at odds with that provided in the Children Act 2013, the main law intended to advance the rights of children in our country\u2014Section 4 of which states, \"all persons aged up to eighteen years of age shall be treated as children.\" Section 2(f) of the earlier Children Act, 1974 (which the 2013 Act replaces), had defined a child as \"a person under the age of sixteen years\" and therefore had introduced a wider definition of child than the BLA.\nWhile our labour law does legalise the employment of children above 14, Chapter III of the BLA specifically deals with the employment of adolescent workers. Section 34(1) of the BLA states that, \"No child shall be employed or permitted to work in any occupation or establishment,\" while Section 34(2) places some restrictions on employment of adolescents (i.e. those aged above 14) subject to two conditions being met. The first requirement is for the employer to obtain a certificate of fitness granted by a registered medical practitioner. The second requirement is for the adolescent to carry a token containing a reference to such certificate while at work.\nIt is not yet clear whether either of these two conditions were met by Hashem Foods Ltd. However, when confronted about the question of exploiting child labour, Md Salauddin, the administrative spokesperson for Sajeeb company told The Daily Star: \"The issue about the age of the workers is wrong. They were hired after reviewing the relevant documents. If the age is less, it is the workers who tampered with the documents.\" Under the labour law, if there is any dispute as to the age and whether a particular worker is a child or an adolescent worker, any of three documents must be used to resolve it: (i) a birth registration certificate; (ii) a school certificate; or (iii) a certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner certifying the age (Section 36, BLA). However, the disputes relating to the real age of the child workers \"missing\" after the Hashem Foods fire exposes the pitfall of relying exclusively on documentary evidence (which can easily be \"tampered with\") in resolving disputes as to the age of child workers. While most families of the \"missing\" child workers insist that their beloved daughter or son was underage, the factory authorities insist the exact opposite\u2014and claim to have the papers to prove it. It would be unlawful to employ a 12-year-old like Shanta, but having her age \"certified\" to be 14 or above through one of the three aforesaid documents would be enough.\nOther than the need to obtain and display fitness certificates, Chapter III also places two key prohibitions in the employment of adolescents. Firstly, it prohibits adolescents from being employed in work that is declared too hazardous by the government (Section 39(2), BLA). In 2013, a government order declared 38 processes and activities as being hazardous for children, which includes working in a biscuit factory. In 2015, when the Bangladesh Labour Rules were formulated, Rule 68 also listed 32 activities which are deemed to be too hazardous for adolescents, which includes working with cutter machines. The National Child Labour Survey 2013 found that 1.28 million children were engaged in hazardous labour. Secondly, adolescents cannot be made to clean, lubricate or adjust any machinery of any establishment while it is in motion or to work between moving parts or between the fixed and moving parts of such machinery (Section 39(3), BLA).\nIf any person employs any child or adolescent, or permits any child or adolescent to work in contravention of any provision of the labour law, they are to be punished with a fine that may extend to Tk 5,000 (Section 284, BLA). This penalty is rather minimal when compared to the severity of the offence, with no prison sentence being prescribed, and the amount of fine being capped at a very low level\u2014despite the varying degree of harms that may result due to the offender's contravention of child labour laws in the country. Then again, limiting the liability of those that violate labour rights seem to be a rather defining feature of our labour law. For instance, all an employer has to pay if a worker is killed in an \"industrial accident\" (which, more often than not, is a foreseeable outcome of the employer's failure to ensure occupational safety), is Tk 2 lakh.\nOn 30 November 2020, the National Child Labour Welfare Council published a draft National Plan of Action to Eliminate Child Labour. How can we possibly hope to eliminate child labour while keeping it legal?\n\u00a0\nTaqbir Huda coordinates Justice For All Now (JANO, Bangladesh). \n\nEmail: taqbirhuda@gmail.co\n",

        "full_article": "According to data provided by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), the number of internet users in Bangladesh stood at 11.61 crore in March 2021, up by 12.48 percent year-on-year, whereas the number of mobile phone users stood at 17.46 crore in March 2021, up by 5.62 percent year-on-year. According to industry insiders, the e-commerce industry in Bangladesh has been growing steadily at a rate of 25.6 percent in the last few years, and this industry is expected to generate more than USD 5 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) by 2025 when at least 25 percent of the total population will be e-commerce customers. Since the pandemic hit Bangladesh, Mobile Financial Services (MFS) have experienced tremendous growth as around 1.8 crore customers in 11 months (March 2020 to January 2021) resorted to such digital services last year, taking the total number of registered MFS users standing at\u00a0 10.06 crore.\nOnce you pore over these statistics, it becomes clear to anyone that Bangladesh is taking great strides in materialising the Digital Bangladesh dream. While the pandemic has brought the whole world down to its knees, even the strong economies are struggling heavily to experience a quick rebound. In such a backdrop, Bangladesh's economy has been so resilient and is performing strongly owing largely to the fact that the country has left no stone unturned to turn the tables by capitalising on the components of digital transformation.\nTo cope with the heavy blow dealt by the coronavirus, Bangladesh has, in an adroit move, swiftly shifted its attention to digitisation and has gone all-out to expedite the process. Consequently, we have seen a meteoric rise in the number of mobile internet and MFS users. This transformation was heavily aided by wide connectivity. While Bangladesh now enjoys 4G connectivity all over the country, the rollout process of more advanced 5G technology does not seem too far off into the future, with preparations going on in full swing and the stakeholders, including smart device manufacturers gearing up and scaling up their productions. If Bangladesh wants to continue the existing growth\u2014counting on the power of connectivity and technology\u2014digital inclusivity is a must. At a time when there is every possibility of the digital divide increasing, it is imperative that the access of cross-sections of people to smartphones\u2014devices necessary to access ever-evolving technology\u2014be ensured.\nBangladesh, as always, is playing a commendable role in this regard as policies conducive to the local production of smartphones and other smart devices are already in place. There are many smartphone brands selling smart devices in this country, but it is often seen that people from all walks of life struggle to buy the right phone because of the relatively high prices. This is why it is important that mobile brands manufacture their devices locally so that they can offer smartphones at more competitive prices. It is, however, heartening to see that many smartphone manufacturers have opted for local production, thanks to the time-befitting initiatives of the government.\u00a0\nWhen smartphones are manufactured locally, it will open up many windows for both the manufacturers and the users. Firstly, the brands will witness a dramatic reduction of costs as they will not have to pay taxes related to import. The government has adopted a revised tax policy with a view to encouraging manufacturers to produce smartphones locally. The cumulative tax on imported handsets is 34 percent. In contrast, local assemblers, who follow a Semi-Knock Down (SKD) Process, will have to pay 17 percent cumulative tax, whereas cumulative tax for phones which are locally manufactured is only 1 percent. It is nothing short of incredible. This tax structure is industry-friendly and points to the government's willingness to ensure digital inclusivity for all.\nSuch advantages will benefit the people of the country in mainly two ways. First and foremost, they will be able to buy smartphones at affordable prices, insinuating that bringing down the digital divide in the face of increasing digital transformation will turn out to be a much more feasible task. Just imagine the situation when even someone from the rural backwater will have access to connectivity and digital services with a 5G connected smartphone in his/her hands. Such transformation will even boost the rural economy. Second, setting up factories in Bangladesh will create more job opportunities for the skilled workforce who are sitting idle. Because of the pandemic, the whole world is suffering, so is the job sector in Bangladesh. Its unemployment rate increased by 1.1 percent to 5.3 percent in 2020, according to a new assessment by the International Labour Organization (ILO). This problematic situation can be mitigated, at least to certain degrees, if smartphone brands move on to setting up factories in this country. This way, the country will be able to utilise its demographic dividend in the proper manner.\nThe equation is very simple\u2014the more brands lean towards local factories, the more affordable smartphones will be. The more people have access to smart devices, the more they will be able to tap into the endless possibilities of digitisation and the subsequent transformation. When this transformation will reach every corner of the country, then the vision of Digital Bangladesh and comprehensive digital transformation across all sectors will get realised in the truest sense. Most importantly, in all these scenarios, it is only the people of this country who are going to benefit the most.\u00a0\nTim Shao is the Managing Director of realme Bangladesh.\n",
