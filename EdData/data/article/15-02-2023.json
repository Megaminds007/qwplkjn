        "full_article": "Just five days after Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das asserted that inflation \u2018has shown signs of moderation and the worst is behind us\u2019, Monday\u2019s release of Consumer Price Index (CPI) estimates for January revealed a disconcerting reversal in price gains trend. Headline retail inflation, which had steadily eased over the last quarter of 2022 from September\u2019s five-month high of 7.4%, quickened by 80 basis points last month to 6.5%. Propelling the acceleration was a 175 basis-points jump in food prices, with inflation measured by the Consumer Food Price Index, quickening to 5.94%, from December\u2019s 4.19%. Adding to the disquiet is the fact that inflation had already been at an elevated 6% in January 2022, implying that the year-on-year increase was sans a favourable base effect and entirely due to an upsurge in the momentum of price gains. Food prices climbed across the board, with vegetables being the solitary item in the CPI\u2019s 12-member food and beverages sub-group to post a year-on-year deflation of 11.7% as winter supply outstripped demand. Cereals, which include rice and wheat and carries the heaviest weight of almost 10% in the sub-group, logged a 16.1% jump in prices, and milk and dairy products, the second-heaviest, saw prices gain by 8.79%. Policymakers must be particularly worried about the 2.6% month-on-month dilation in cereal prices, more so because this disproportionately impacts rural households, which spend a larger share of their income on food. With a 12.4% weight in the rural consumption basket, cereal prices fuelled January\u2019s overall rural headline inflation at an even quicker 6.85% pace.The surprise reversal in price trends suggests inflationary expectations in the economy are nowhere near anchored and will necessitate further policy action both from the RBI and fiscal authorities. To be sure, Mr. Das last week not only announced a 25 basis-points interest rate increase but also committed the RBI to enacting policy that ensures a durable disinflation. With core inflation, or price gains that strip out the impact of food and fuel prices, remaining stubbornly stuck above 6% and in fact inching up last month to 6.23%, from December\u2019s 6.22%, policymakers face the challenge of targeting the components of the inflationary trend that can be addressed by raising credit costs and tamping down on demand. Given that inflation in several key services categories including health and personal care is running well above the RBI\u2019s upper bound of 6%, with prices continuing to harden, the Centre and States must mull measures including rationalisation of GST rates to help ease the inflationary burden on the economy. With overseas demand set to stay weak this year, untamed inflation risks hurting domestic consumption and thereby overall economic growth.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nfood",

        "full_article": "Sporadically, but surely, palaeontologists report intriguing discoveries from India. In January, a team discovered 92 dinosaur nesting sites with 256 fossilised eggs of the titanosaurus \u2014 among the largest of its kind, from 100-66 million years ago, when \u2018India\u2019 was a continent and yet to merge into the Eurasian land mass. Similarly, the deserts of Kutch, Gujarat and the Deccan traps in Maharashtra bear witness to the forces that shaped the diverse geography, and tangentially history, of the most populous country. Unlike the quest to preserve cultural history and man-made artefacts from archaeology, there has been limited effort to preserve and communicate at large this natural \u2018geo-history\u2019 such as rock formations, sediment and fossils. For decades now, researchers have been warning that this neglect is leading to an erasure of this history from the public mind and a destruction as well as appropriation of this natural wealth. To that end, the draft Geo-heritage Sites and Geo-relics (Preservation and Maintenance) Bill, 2022, piloted by the Ministry of Mines, is seen as a step to give the process of such conservation firmer footing.The Bill\u2019s provisions give the Director General of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), a subordinate body of the Ministry of Mines, the power to declare sites as having \u2018geo-heritage\u2019 value, take possession of relics (fossils, rocks) that rest in private hands, prohibit construction 100 metres around such a site, penalise \u2014 with fines of up to \u20b95 lakh and possibly imprisonment \u2014 vandalism, defacement, and violations of directives by the Director General of the GSI. This has rankled experts who work outside the GSI-fold in central and State universities, institutes of national importance and private organisations who fear that such absolute vesting of powers in the GSI alone may impede palaeontological research. They demand a more inclusive body, on the lines of a National Geoheritage Authority, that can, more democratically, decide on declaring sites as being of \u2018geohistorical\u2019 importance and how best to preserve artefacts and finds. The government, it is learnt, is still far from introducing the Bill in Parliament and deliberating on several aspects. While there are merits and demerits to either approach on governance, it is important to keep in mind that legislation, while acting as a ring fence, ought not to become a tool for suppressing independent investigation. Given the premium for land and India\u2019s economic needs, there will be conflict over questions of preservation and livelihood, but any legislation must endeavour to balance these forces and enable consensus.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\narchaeology\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nGujarat\n\n/\n\nMaharashtra\n\n/\n\nhistory",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s retail inflation was 6.52% in January 2023, once again above RBI\u2019s threshold of tolerance after a short respite. Among the components, cereal inflation was 16.12%. The cereal basket has been inflating in double digits since September 2022. It\u2019s potentially the most worrisome dimension of India\u2019s current bout of retail inflation. In 2021-22, India\u2019s wheat output declined by 2.5% to about 107 million tonnes. The impact on GoI\u2019s procurement was disproportionately large. To place the current cereal inflation in context, consider GoI cereal stock in January 2023. It was 29.8 million tonnes, just a little over half the stock level of 53-57 million tonnes in each of the preceding three years. Among cereals, wheat is particularly vulnerable. GoI\u2019s stock in January was 17.1 million tonnes against a minimum requirement of 13.8 million tonnes. Subsequently, GoI decided to sell 3 million tonnes in the market to cool prices. Last week, the offer was made more attractive by knocking off transport costs.\nThe tight situation makes the forthcoming rabi harvest of wheat crucial in stabilising the wheat price level. In 2022, a rabi season that was going well was upended by an extraordinary spike in temperatures in March, which had a negative impact on the yield. The big risk that India\u2019s economic policymakers now face is that when their stocks are relatively low, there are unsettling weather forecasts. Recently, weather forecasting company Skymet said inadequate winter rain is building up heat stress. This is a risk that cannot be addressed by policy. The combination of factors, however, does explain why cereal prices have been inflating in double digits.\nIn this situation, monetary policy has no role. Imports are one option as the FAO Cereal Index has been relatively flat since July 2022. However, this option is limited because international supplies are tight and India\u2019s entry will impact prices. The other option is for GoI to offer a bonus on MSP to build its buffer. In a fluid geopolitical situation, it\u2019s fiscal policy that\u2019s got to lead.\n\u00a0\n\n",

Minnu\u2019s success is a rare story for India\u2019s tribal communities. Sports has discovered some talent among tribals and politics has embraced a few. But data tells the real story. The recently released Tribal Development Report 2022 by Bharat Rural Livelihoods Foundation provides damning statistics. They are 8.6% of the population, and they fare considerably worse than others when it comes to access to sanitation, drinking water, education and proper nutrition.\nThe report also says that tribal communities have been pushed farther away from alluvial plains and fertile river basins over the decades, which has had a direct impact on their livelihood. Of the 257 Scheduled Tribe districts in the country, 230 or 90% are in either forested or hilly or dry areas. And past policies like the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 illogically pitted the imperatives of environment protection against the needs of Adivasi communities.\nWhile that approach has been modified and today Adivasis are seen as important stakeholders in forest conservation, on-ground contestations continue. Last year\u2019s amendments to the Forest Conservation Rules have been protested by tribal communities on the ground that they undermine the rights of tribes and forest dwellers over forest resources as envisioned in the Forest Rights Act, 2009. Adivasi activists say the changes make it easier for businesses to divert forest land and make obtaining clearances by commercial entities easier. If true, these provisions have serious implications for tribal welfare.\nIt\u2019s also true that there has been increasing political courting of tribal communities in recent years. From expanding ST status to new communities to the Adivasi vote becoming a sought-after electoral commodity to India getting its first tribal President in Droupadi Murmu, tribals have emerged as a serious political bloc. But their genuine empowerment will lie in creating opportunities. We need thousands more Minnu Manis and Droupadi Murmus.\n\n",

However, the green revolution technology and policy environment gave rice and wheat a strong advantage over millets. This led to neglect of millets and their decline in all respects.\nConsumer bias against millet was built in the terminology which designated rice and wheat as fine or superior cereals and millets as coarse or inferior cereals. Consequently, millet share in total cereal intake in the country declined from 25% at the beginning of the green revolution to less than 6% in recent years.

        "full_article": "It is difficult to recall whether any other high-profile murder case in Bangladesh has remained irresoluble for such a long time as that of the murder of the journalist couple Sagar-Runi. Both were senior journalists, Sagar being the head of an electronic news channel at the time of his death. Both had acquired a decent reputation as good investigative journalists. Soon after the killings, the then home minister had assured us that the killers would be nabbed within 48 hours. Alas! Countless 48 hours have passed since then. And after 11 years, the investigators are yet to solve the murder mystery.\nOnly those who have had to endure the pains of such gruesome killing of their kinsmen can understand the agony one goes through every hour of the day waiting for the case to come to trial and for justice to be done. Eleven years is too long a time to suffer through such pain. But any talk of trial feels redundant when we don't even know what happened to the five or so people arrested at the very seminal stage of the investigation.\nAgain, this year, a fresh date has been sought by the investigating agencies, for the 95th time since 2011. After the investigating officer being changed six times, the case has, in all probability, stalled. We believe, it being a high-profile murder case, the progress made so far must be made public, at least as much as would not hamper the investigation process.\nWhy has the double murder resisted a solution for 11 years? Surely, there must have been some lead pointing to the killers and their motives. Are we to believe that the killers were so methodical that they left no trace behind? Facts tell us that every murderer leaves behind evidence. It defies imagination that our investigating agencies would remain clueless after conducting probes for 11 years. Or are we to believe that the assassins and the mastermind \u2013 and I strongly believe that they are not the same \u2013 are so very powerful that their names cannot be revealed?\nOne despairs to see the waning of interest in the journalist community regarding this matter. Initially, there was a robust group of journos literally breathing down the neck of the government, the information minister's in particular, for a thorough inquiry and quick identification of the killers. But since the person giving leadership to this group of journalists was given an important post, he has not been seen talking much about the case anymore. Little ground there is not to believe that the post was a lollipop to lure him to abstain from lending his weight to the movement seeking justice for the slain couple. And in a situation where a good part of the fourth estate in Bangladesh has chosen discretion over valour \u2013 some willingly sought pliancy, some did so fearing retribution \u2013 it is little wonder that the issue has come to receive decreasing attention from them, except for a yearly statement expressing their frustration, till it dissipates from public memory eventually.\nThe motive of the gruesome murder remains unexplained. We wonder what happened to the High Court hearing on the rule issued by it in 2012 over the government move to identify the motive of the killing, which was scheduled for the first week of April of 2022? It doesn't need a Poirot or a Holmes to surmise that robbery was not the motive, since nothing valuable was found to be missing. Then what was?\nEven an ignoramus knows that the first thing investigators try to establish when probing into a killing is the motive behind it. By a process of elimination, they preclude all possible motives till only one stands out as the prime. It is difficult to believe that our highly trained agencies have so far been unable to put their fingers on\u00a0the\u00a0motive.\nOr are both the motive and the possible perpetrators too hot to put a finger on? Is it that the then IGP's statement of there having been \"marked progress in the investigation\" a few days after the killings was indeed some very incriminating evidence which cannot be revealed? That is a natural corollary to the narrative so far. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the victims, having been investigative journalists, had probably come by very sensitive matters related to influential persons that would have caused serious damage to said person and/or their business if made public. This is not my personal assumption, but something that has been in the grapevine all these years and is still making the rounds. We wonder whether Rab has probed this area at all?\nIt is time the matter came to a head. We wonder what the agencies have not been able to find out in 11 years that the investigators will be able to discover in the next few months or years, if at all. What is there to be probed further that has not been done in 11 years?\nThere can be two explanations. Either the investigators are really out of their depth or in a cul-de-sac (which defies logic), or the findings would rather not be revealed, for whatever reasons.\nWe believe it is up to the government to prove wrong those who label this country as having an \"appalling and pervasive culture of impunity\" by completing the probe into Sagar and Runi's murder without further ado and bringing the killers and those behind the killings to justice, whoever they may be \u2013 or live with the contemptible tag.\nBrig Gen\u00a0Shahedul Anam Khan, ndc, psc (retd) is a former associate editor of The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Embezzling thousands of crores of taka in the name of taking loans from banks is a regular occurrence in Bangladesh. Sometimes behind the front of business and industrial loans, sometimes through direct fraud and deception, such embezzlement takes place. The frequent reporting on such scams, involving a new bank each time, is reminiscent of a popular web series portraying heists. The latest Tk 16,000 crore LC fraud from Social Islami Bank and the Tk 30,000 crore loan scam from Islami Bank by S Alam Group are the latest additions to this parade. These incidents are so systematically organised, using different institutional patronages, that they cannot be called exceptional events and must be seen as an established mechanism of capital accumulation by looting the public's money.\nLooting in the name of bank loans\nIn Bangladesh, the easiest and most common method of primary capital accumulation for businesses is to get loans from public and private banks without collateral \u2013 or with inadequate collateral \u2013 using political patronage and by bribing bank managers. Then, they default. Debt restructuring, lawsuits, investigations, and writs continue for years.\nYunus Badal, who was caught by the police for stealing a car in 2007, emerged as one of Janata Bank's biggest borrowers in 2010 due to his political patronage. Janata Bank violated loan approval rules and provided him with loans worth Tk 5,000 crore in just six years. The chief perpetrator of the Sonali Bank-Hallmark scam, Tanvir Mahmood, embezzled Tk 2,731 crore. Both became businessmen of great scale, with Badal going on to own 22 enterprises.\nBank heists by bank owners\nUnlike other private or public limited companies, a paid-up capital of Tk 400 crore is required to establish a bank. After that, thousands of ordinary people deposit their savings in said bank. By investing only Tk 400 crore, the bank owners are able to control the deposits of thousands of crores of taka, decide where to invest it, and who to lend it to. So, to accumulate a huge amount of money by investing very little, one first acquires a bank licence using political connections and then embezzles the deposited money under the guise of loans.\nAccording to Bangladesh Bank (BB) policies, no bank director can borrow more than 50 percent of their total shares from their bank. To bypass this regulatory hurdle, bank owners either get loans from their banks through relatives or front companies, or take out loans from other public or private banks by establishing a \"mutual understanding\" with other directors/owners.\nThe looting of the Farmers Bank deposits by the owners themselves is a case in point. Due to corruption by the owners, the bank which came into operation in 2013 quickly fell into a capital deficit of Tk 283 crores. By December 2017, its amount of defaulted loans increased to Tk 723 crore. In a report, the BB had held Farmers Bank's former chairman Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir and ex-chairman of its executive committee Mahabubul Haque Chisty largely responsible for the scams.\nThe case of Islami Bank, the largest private sector bank in Bangladesh, is another example of how people's deposits are looted by bank owners themselves.\nIn January 2017, the bank fell into a severe financial crisis, just 15 months after its ownership came into the hands of S Alam Group. According to BB's audit report, S Alam Group has taken out more than Tk 30,000 crore in loans from Islami Bank using various unethical mechanisms.\nUnbridled loan restructuring facilities\nDefault loans are becoming more and more prevalent because vested groups are using their political backing and colluding with bank directors and owners to obtain the loans. Far from recovering thousands of crores of the people's money and punishing the defaulters, the banks are instead giving them rescheduling benefits, with relatively low interest rates and long-term restructuring facilities.\nAccording to a report published by\u00a0The Daily Star, in 2015, 11 big business groups \u2013 each of them having taken out loans of over Tk 500 crore from different banks \u2013 led by Beximco made a proposal to Bangladesh Bank for restructuring their bad loans. The BB agreed and the companies were given a rescheduling benefit of only one to two percent down payment, instead of the usual 10 percent. The total amount of the restructured loan was Tk 15,000 crore. Despite these concessions, after two years, six of these companies \u2013 Beximco, SA Group, Ratanpur Group, RSRM, Keya, and MR Group \u2013 failed to repay instalments. Interestingly, Beximco \u2013 which had obtained one-third of the restructured loan \u2013 made profits and paid dividends, yet did not pay back loans.\nIn May 2019, BB issued a directive providing loan defaulters the opportunity to reschedule their classified loans by making a down payment of only two percent, instead of the previous 10-50 percent. The interest rate was capped at nine percent from 12-16 percent and the tenure for repayment was made 10 years.\nIn July 2022, the central bank allowed businesses to reschedule their loans by making a down payment of 2.5 to 6.5 percent on their term loan, instead of the previous 10 to 30 percent. It also extended their payment tenure to five to eight years, from the previous maximum of two years. In the meantime, businesses could also avail new loans.\nIn this way, through rescheduling, defaulted loans are shown to be reduced without even collecting them.\nTwo other methods used to mask the reality of default loans are the relaxation of loan write-offs and classification policies. In February 2019, BB reduced the time period after which banks can write-off bad debts from five years to three years, and increased the amount which banks can write off without filing a lawsuit with the Artha Rin Adalat from Tk 50,000 to Tk 2 lakh. This has been further increased to Tk 5 lakh, according to the latest directive issued on January 5, 2023. And in April 2019, the time period after which an overdue loan can be classified as \"substandard,\" \"doubtful,\" or \"bad/loss\" was increased to three months.\nCulture of impunity\nHabitual bank loan defaulters who are politically connected are not punished for embezzling public money. Only the small fish are caught and put in jail. The probes and trials go on for years without any conclusion. This culture of impunity encourages defaulters to continue to steal money from banks.\nAlthough an investigation was carried out in the case of the central bank reserve theft, the investigation report was not published and the guilty persons were not prosecuted. The parliamentary committee related to the finance ministry has not published the investigation report on the Sonali Bank-Hallmark scam, either. The trial of 38 cases filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) against Hallmark is still continuing at snail's pace.\nAuthorities were reportedly fully aware of the irregularities and corruption of the former chairman of BASIC Bank, Sheikh Abdul Hye Bachchu. But no action was taken against him. The ACC filed 56 cases in this regard, but Bachchu, accused of being the mastermind, was not charged in any of them. Expressing dissatisfaction with the ACC's role in this case, the High Court recently said, \"Crores of taka have been embezzled. But no work is being done though the Anti-Corruption Commission and so many judges and lawyers are there. Why are they [ACC] silent? This is just like a drama. We are watching the drama. This is not acceptable.\"\nRecognise the pattern\nIt is evident that, while disbursing loans, state-owned banks prioritise those who are close to the state power. On the other hand, private banks act for the primitive accumulation of capital, prioritising businesses related to bank owners and directors. Sometimes, powerful loan defaulters obtain stay orders from the HC using legal loopholes to not be included in the defaulters' list and thus continue to take out new loans from other banks.\nIf we closely observe and analyse the context of each of the ongoing banking scams, a structural pattern becomes evident, one that is directly related to the country's capital formation, the structure of the financial and banking sectors, and the interests of the booty capitalist. And there is no chance of ending this \"mega serial\" of scams without strong and organised resistance from the people.\nKallol Mustafa\u00a0is an engineer and writer who focuses on power, energy, environment and development economics.\n",

        "full_article": "It is disappointing that Bangladesh is unlikely to get the desired amount of remittance despite sending well over a million migrants abroad last year, simply because four out of five of them were less skilled. We have been a victim of this problem for many years, and experts and migrant rights activists have given the government a number of suggestions in the past, urging it to implement those. Yet, the findings of the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU), based on the government's own data, suggest that whatever little the government has done to address it has been less than satisfactory.\nAccording to the RMMRU's 2022 Migration Trends Report, the percentage of less skilled workers who migrated abroad rose to 78.64 percent last year from 75.24 percent the year before. According to the expatriates' welfare ministry, the percentage of skilled workers migrating abroad has been dropping every year since 2019-2020, when it was as high as 33.3 percent. In the following two years, that figure dropped to 22.68 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively. Because less skilled workers receive lower wages compared to skilled workers, Bangladesh has not been getting as much remittance as it potentially could, at a time when the economy is going through a difficult phase \u2013 when we need remittance earnings the most. On the flipside, the migrants themselves are able to send less money back home to their loved ones, and are more likely to become victims of frauds.\nAccording to the 2021-2022 report of the expatriates' welfare ministry, at least 64 technical training centres and six institutes of the marine technology under the ministry's guidance provide training to aspiring migrants on 55 different trades. The ministry's website also said that 86,437 people got training at those institutes in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. Given that more than a million migrants went abroad in the same year, that number seems quite low. Therefore, the government clearly needs to advertise the availability of such training facilities to migrants better, as well as promote the benefits of receiving such training for individuals prior to migrating. It should also find out whether the training it offers can be better targeted, and should include other specialised training besides what is currently being provided.\nA leader of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies said that they receive more demand letters for less-skilled and semi-skilled workers than for skilled workers from Middle Eastern countries, where Bangladeshis migrate to the most. However, it is not because of a lack of overall demand, but because the market for skilled workers there is already being catered to by countries like the Philippines and India. The government needs to find out what these countries are doing that Bangladesh is not, and try and compete with them better. At the same time, it should also look into other potential markets to send Bangladeshi skilled workers.\nOverall, there is a lot more that the government could do to boost our remittance earnings. And these steps should have been taken a long time ago. However, since the current economic crisis clearly demonstrates how valuable remittance earnings is for our economy, the government urgently needs to take these measures now.\n",

        "full_article": "It is disappointing that Bangladesh is unlikely to get the desired amount of remittance despite sending well over a million migrants abroad last year, simply because four out of five of them were less skilled. We have been a victim of this problem for many years, and experts and migrant rights activists have given the government a number of suggestions in the past, urging it to implement those. Yet, the findings of the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU), based on the government's own data, suggest that whatever little the government has done to address it has been less than satisfactory.\nAccording to the RMMRU's 2022 Migration Trends Report, the percentage of less skilled workers who migrated abroad rose to 78.64 percent last year from 75.24 percent the year before. According to the expatriates' welfare ministry, the percentage of skilled workers migrating abroad has been dropping every year since 2019-2020, when it was as high as 33.3 percent. In the following two years, that figure dropped to 22.68 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively.

        "full_article": "It is disconcerting to know that the Telegu community at the Dhalpur area of Jatrabari has been passing their days in fear of being evicted following a verbal notice issued to vacate houses on land owned by the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC). According to media reports, there are about 16 acres of government land in Outfall No. 14 of Dhalpur, where over a thousand members of the Telegu community live. The eviction drive, which was set to begin on February 12, targets illegally built houses, and barring any rehabilitation, community members fear they would end up homeless. Even though the DSCC apparently has a plan to build housing for them on six acres of land after clearance, the message clearly hasn't been convincing enough.\nWe cannot help but wonder why the authorities would opt to evict a marginalised community that has lived there for long without rehabilitating them first. Where will they stay during the time between clearance and building new housing? How long will it take? Will all the tenants be accommodated there? These are valid questions, and with a history of discrimination and social ostracism facing them over the decades, the community is justified in distrusting the authorities or any eviction plan, which activists have rightly termed \"illegal\" and \"whimsical\".\nThe Telegu people form a small part of the Harijan caste, the so-called \"untouchables\", known for their hereditary professions involving rawhide processing, tea plantation, sanitation work, manual scavenging, etc. In cities, you see them mostly in sanitation work on behalf of the city corporations, as cleaners, sweepers, and garbage collectors, keeping our neighbourhoods clean and habitable. Thus they provide a vital service to our cities, and should be recognised and duly rewarded for it. The reality, however, is totally different. Not only do these people have to suffer poor pay and zero employee benefits, but they are also deprived of the chance to live with dignity as well as services that others take for granted. Without any political representation, and hardly any opportunity for their children to pursue high studies, their voice remains unheard, their future pitted against the same uncertainties that plagued them for generations.\nThe Telegu people are found in various slums and \"colonies\" in Dhaka. At the Dhalpur area of Jatrabari, we're told that community leaders were warned by the Jatrabari Police Station not to disobey the instructions of the DSCC or hold any protest publicly, essentially depriving them of their democratic rights. This is quite alarming. We understand that the DSCC is within its rights to reclaim occupied land, but it must be sensible in such cases. Eviction without rehabilitation is not the way to go.\nWe, therefore, urge the authorities to reconsider their plan so that Telegu workers in DSCC's employ, as well as their families, are safely rehabilitated before any eviction is carried out. They must also take steps to ensure that this marginalised community is not left behind in our drive for development.\n",

        "full_article": "Of the country's 8.5 million Tax Identification Number (TIN) holders, only 2.8 million, which is about one third of the total potential taxpayers, did actually file their tax returns until December 31 last year. These figures on last year's submission of tax returns, as could be gathered from reports, may show the NBR's capacity for collection of taxes in a poor light. Similarly, one may also tend to believe that two-thirds of the TIN holders are basically tax-evaders. But sometimes figures may be misleading. In fact, there are a large number of persons registered with the NBR as taxpayers, though they have no taxable income. But in exercise of the Finance Bill 2022, effective from this fiscal year (FY2022-23), the NBR has made the submission of annual tax return acknowledgement receipts mandatory by citizens if they want to get certain services. The number of such services is over 40 including, for instance, obtaining or maintaining a credit card, getting membership of a professional body, opening a postal savings account, maintaining a bank account, buying a savings instrument and so on. As a result, even many poor and marginal people including housewives have to obtain TINs and submit tax returns showing zero income before they can access the listed services. Small wonder that the number of persons registered with the tax department and holding TINs has increased significantly. If anything, these non-productive TINs have only caused to inflate the size of the database of the taxpayers, but contributed nothing to the state exchequer. At the same time, one also needs to consider the hassles those TIN holders, many of whom are unlettered, have to go through every year while submitting their tax returns. It is not that the tax collecting authority is not aware of the difficulties many TIN-holding retired service-holders, senior citizens, housewives and others with little or no income have to face every year when the time for filing tax returns comes. But constrained by the 1984's Income Tax Ordinance, they can hardly do anything to relieve those TIN-holders of their suffering. For the ordinance provides no option for those people to withdraw their TINs from the NBR. Worse yet, if they fail to file their tax returns, notices of non-compliance will be issued against them. This is not only an issue with the said TIN-holders, it is also a big encumbrance on the tax department to deal with so many TINs with little or nothing to add to the nation's revenue earnings. The government, to get around this incongruity, is learnt to be seriously thinking of revamping the system of issuing TINs. To this end, a plan is reportedly going to be worked out to issue temporary TINs for people with marginal incomes. In this system, temporary TINs would be issued for obtaining services that require showing proof of tax payment mandatorily. Such TINs would be cancelled as soon as the particular service is delivered. This is undoubtedly an innovative idea to deal with the issue at hand. The government is reportedly moving ahead with this idea of issuing one-shot TINs for incorporation in the budget for the next fiscal year (FY 2023-24). That would definitely be a step in the right direction. Hopefully, the idea of issuing temporary TINs would be accepted in the next budget and the segment of the TIN-holders being thus affected by the old system would soon be spared the trouble they have so far been going through.",

        "full_article": "Framing of the Digital Commerce Act has reportedly passed the drafting stage. The draft \"Digital Commerce Act 2023\" has been sent to different stakeholders by the commerce ministry and a committee has been formed to review it. Explaining the need for the law, the ministry is of the view that in the absence of any regulatory control to oversee and stop irregularities in the field of digital commerce, a legal framework is necessary.The Act, according to the ministry, aims at facilitating expansion and maintaining discipline by 'preventing, suppressing and prosecuting fraudulent activities' in the sector. A Digital Commerce Authority is set to be established to this end. According to the draft, online platforms will be fined three times the value of goods and services sold if they fail to deliver them within the stipulated time. In addition, failure to pay such fines will result in a maximum of three months of imprisonment. The proposed law also makes it mandatory for online platforms to disclose accurate information about the description, size and measurement of goods and services in the digital marketplace.Clearly, the government has been pressed into framing the law due to widespread scams centring around the e-commerce sector as some fraudulent platforms embezzled thousands of crores of taka from customers and merchants a couple of years ago. The problematic platforms reportedly include Evaly, Dhamaka, e-Orange, Aladiner Prodip, Boom Boom, Adyen Mart, Qcoom.com and Alesha Mart among others. Of these, the most talked about name is Evaly. In a report to the commerce ministry, this scam-hit platform revealed that it had owed more than Tk 2.058 billion to its merchants until July 15 last year.There are mixed reactions from the stakeholders on the upcoming law. A large section of the e-commerce players has expressed displeasure regarding the proposed law, saying it would cause unnecessary intervention, even hassle, and that the existing legal framework is sufficient to ensure discipline, if the authorities are determined to stop foul-play.Speaking from a broad perspective, there is no denying that electronic commerce has already proved its potential to radically alter economic activities and the social environment. It has left its mark on such large sectors as communications, finance and retail trade. It holds promises in areas such as education, health and government. The largest effects may be associated not with many of the impacts that draw the maximum attention (e.g., customised products, elimination of middlemen) with less visible but yet more pervasive routine business activities.E-commerce has definitely changed the way business used to be conducted. Traditional intermediary functions are being replaced, new products and markets developed, and new and far closer relationships are created between business and consumers. The widespread adoption of e-commerce as a business platform is mainly believed to be due to its non-proprietary standards and the open nature of its functioning. A key reason why electronic commerce, especially the business-to-business segment, has grown so quickly is its significant impact on business costs and productivity. Moreover, many of the applications are quite simple. E-commerce is thus expected to result in productivity gains and growth and to be a source of many new products as well.It is well known that during the peak pandemic period on-line shopping caused a huge watershed for households as well as trading communities, flourishing the scope of e-commerce in the country as elsewhere. The overall performance was found to be mostly satisfactory. However, as regards big purchases including those of machinery and equipment that required procurement from overseas manufacturers, there were serious complaints of non-performance. The victims were individual buyers as well as business entities.In their response to the new law, most stakeholders agree that while there is the urgent need to stop malpractices in this fast developing marketplace, existing watchdogs of the country can take care of the problems including bringing the criminals to book. They are obviously not comfortable with a new state agency breathing down their necks all the time. They also opine that the emergence of digital marketplace in the country was more than just a new business model but a need-based novelty that grew up backed by their goodwill and consumers' trust. So any attempt from any unscrupulous quarter has to be reined in iron-handedly.The question is if the existing system is capable of handling the malpractices? The authorities will argue that since the mechanism of e-commerce operations is internet-based, monitoring the activities and detecting wrongdoings, if any, will need a digitised framework as well as technical skill. Going through the reactions of the government and the e-platforms to the upcoming Digital Commerce Act, it seems imperative that the latter be given scope for more interactions with the former before working out the modus operandi for rendering e-commerce operations in the country safe and secure.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It is only natural that the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) president would lament over the sorry state of the textile sector. Funds worth billions of dollars have been poured into the sector over the past few years, and it is now experiencing a chronic shortage of gas. The BTMA president said US$6.0 billion was invested in 2021 and $4.14 billion in 2022 in the textile sector regardless of the state of Covid which ravaged the economy. The importance of the domestic textile sector cannot be overemphasised. It meets \"80 per cent of the knitwear exporters' demand for fabrics\", and hence any disruption caused to it will have a chain reaction in the readymade garments (RMG) sector in general and knitwear sub-sector in particular. BTMA sources state that the textile industry is showing massive potential to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as it constitutes the backward linkage of the RMG sector, which represents nearly 85 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings. But as stated by Mr. Khokon, president (BTMA), the energy crunch has put all those plans on hold.While government officials have been talking about ensuring energy supplies if industry was willing to pay the cost of importing the fuels, there remain major sticking points between the government and industry. The most important point is that the industry may be willing to come to a middle ground, provided the supply of energy is guaranteed. Precisely, how the authorities are going to \"guarantee\" the import of these fuels remains unclear. As has been stated by many energy experts in the past, it is no longer a question of having the money to pay for several cargo loads of liquefied natural gas (LNG). What is important here is the ready availability of LNG in international markets. Again, the double-edged sword that is coming down on the economy whereby the country is being pressured to make payments on loans taken (by it) from foreign lending agencies and the failure to check the use of informal banking channels (hundi) is not helping to prop up foreign exchange reserve. It would appear that policymakers are caught in a web of their own making. Having wasted more than a decade in not exploring own energy sources and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build infrastructure that would cater for imported fuels, has now resulted in a deep energy crisis that causes the economy to wobble. All of a sudden, the sector is told there is no money to import expensive fuels. Then there are all sorts of promises being made - one of which is 'renewable energy'. Given our failure to stick to the previous energy road map in rolling out renewable energy, precisely who is going to believe that solar energy is going to save the country now? Besides, any energy expert worth his (or her) salt will state that base-load energy must come from one of the fossil fuels, i.e. gas, coal, nuclear energy, etc. Renewable technologies that have made big news globally are hydro-electricity and wind-technology. The only major hydro-electricity project was made in pre-independence era and the government has shied away from wind technology. The headlines being hogged about a few megawatt-range solar power plants that have come online is not going to solve the energy crisis. Is it not time to stop beating about the bush and start drilling for possible on-shore gas reserves earnestly? Start exploring where pockets of wind exist. Again, hydro-electric plants have now become miniaturised (the technology actually exists) and Bangladesh is a deltaic region, so there are possibilities in this area too. Last but not least, energy planning needs a major rethink if Bangladesh intends to preserve its industry.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Phantom pregnancy, often known as false pregnancy, is a relatively rare phenomenon. However, in some civilizations, a woman's value is determined by her ability to conceive. For that reason, phantom pregnancy is more prevalent in such societies. This occurs when a woman thinks she is pregnant when she is not. It has been found that for every 22,000 births, one to six cases of false pregnancy are recorded. In false pregnancy, a woman feels the same clinical symptoms of pregnancy including painful breasts with secretions, delayed menstrual cycles and nausea. The root cause of false pregnancy still remains a mystery. Many medical experts think that there are numerous causes for this non-pregnancy including an intense desire to conceive, repeated miscarriages, child loss, infertility, intense fear of conceiving, anxiety, emotional trauma, and sexual abuse. In this situation, convincing women that they are not pregnant is the first step in treatment. The use of ultrasonography or other imaging techniques to demonstrate the patients that no foetus is developing inside their womb can be useful. In most cases, phantom pregnancy is handled as a psychological problem. Counselling, behavioural treatment and emotional support are all part of treating this disease. \nMd.
