Coming on the back of the sharp decline in economic activity due to the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020-21, when GDP crashed 6.6% and GVA by 4.8%, the latest numbers show India is emerging out of the tunnel of pandemic-induced woes. The overall GDP and GVA have indeed recovered from pre-pandemic levels, but only just, by 1.5% and 2.9%, respectively. Remember that growth had already been on a steady decline through 2019-20 even before the lockdowns of 2020 \u2014 with GDP growing just 3.7%. The Government\u2019s assertion that the data establish a \u2018full economic recovery\u2019 is not entirely true. For one, it is not a V-shaped recovery, with GVA from job-creating sectors (trade and hotels) still 11.3% below 2019-20\u2019s low levels. This has kept the services sector, as a whole, in line with pre-COVID levels, not above. While GVA from industry is up 6.7% over 2019-20, another job creating sector, construction, is up only 3.4%, while mining has grown a meagre 1.9% over the two-year period. Manufacturing lifted the industry GVA, growing 9.3% from 2019-20 levels, but there are cracks on that front \u2014 the January to March 2022 quarter (Q4 of 2021-22) recorded a 0.2% contraction, year-on-year. Overall GDP growth slipped to a four-quarter low of 4.1% in Q4, down from 5.4% in Q3, evoking flashbacks of the 2019-20 slowdown and raising concerns about the trajectory going forward.With reluctant demand, supply-chain and input cost woes hurting manufacturing, agriculture (that grew at a five-quarter high of 4.1%) and public administration services (whose growth dipped to 7.7% from 16.7% in Q3) lifted the Q4 numbers amid slower growth in Services and Mining over Q3, and a mild 2% uptick in Construction. A recovery in investment demand, helped by the Government\u2019s capital spending, is a silver lining, but the lingering concern is that consumption remains troubled, and unless it recovers, private investments will remain aloof as will sustainable high growth. Private final consumption expenditure grew 7.9% in 2021-22, but it was just \u20b91.2 lakh crore or 1.4% over 2019-20. Worse, as inflation flared up, households\u2019 consumption growth has steadily dropped through 2021-22, growing a mere 1.8% in Q4. Price rise, combined with higher interest rates, could squeeze middle class disposable incomes and dampen consumption further. Yes, India is the fastest growing major economy and likely to remain so in 2022-23. But the rising tide in the past year has not been enough to lift all boats stranded in the detritus of the pandemic and the slowdown that preceded it. The waters are choppy with war and recession worries in the developed world.",

The plane with 22 passengers, including an Indian family, was on an \u2018air trek\u2019 along the scenic yet aerially treacherous Pokhara to Jomsom route on Sunday when it lost radar contact at around 13,000 feet. STOL operations call for well-honed piloting skills, and as 3-D terrain maps of the flight path show, danger lurks in every corner in the form of jagged peaks, narrow passes and fickle weather. The small unpressurised craft used in this sector operate at a ceiling of 13,000 feet and are airborne for a short duration \u2014 oxygen supplies are needed for all passengers if flights exceed over 30 minutes above 13,000 ft. Flights are characterised by manoeuvres of 90 degree turns in valleys that have at times just wing length clearance. And as in any competitive tourism market crowded with various STOL operators, there are many pressures that can tell on the crew: commercial stress points such as not having wasted fuel moments and ensuring passenger contentment by pushing the envelope of crucial visual flight rules (VFR). Not following VFR is cited as the main cause of accidents in Nepal\u2019s STOL operations.So, is Nepal pushing the boundaries in air safety? Data put out by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal show domestic air travel having risen by 15.45% in 2018, though registering a dip in 2019-20 largely on account of travel restrictions following the global COVID-19 pandemic. But, interestingly, country data over the past 10 years have shown a sharp drop in the accident rate in general, the only blip being a rise in helicopter incidents with growing copter operations in logistics, relief and rescue, and tourism. In the same timeframe, the STOL sector has seen a higher rate of accidents than trunk route air operations; of the 19 accidents, 16 were STOL aircraft. Accident analysis has shown Controlled Flight into Terrain, Runway excursions and Loss of Control In-flight as the leading causes. A more realistic check lies in the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme of the International Civil Aviation Organization monitoring safety oversight obligations by all 193 member-states (as of June 2020), in which Nepal\u2019s scores \u2014 it last participated in the programme in 2017 \u2014 dropped in \u2018Organization\u2019 and \u2018Accident Investigation\u2019. In an era of improving global air safety, Nepal needs to scale a crucial summit by working on pending legislation that unbundles its civil aviation body into a regulator and service provider, paving the way for a full-fledged safety system, and in turn enabling safer STOL operations.",

        "full_article": "Another day, another mass shooting in the US. It is hard not to feel disillusioned as people claim that, perhaps this time, politicians will finally abandon their campaign funder, the gun lobby, and pass some basic legislation. After all, 90 percent of the population wants background checks and many want a ban on assault weapons\u2014and yet, the status quo remains. Yes, the deaths of 19 elementary school children and two teachers are shocking, but so is every mass shooting in schools\u2014and elsewhere. The shooting in Uvalde, after all, was the 27th school shooting in the US just this year that ended in injury or death. Mass shootings occur daily. There were 693 mass shootings in 2021 alone.\nMurder of 19 children is an unquestionable tragedy. Each of those children was loved by people whose lives will forever be torn apart by the loss. But what of the children who weren't killed that day? Will they sleep at night? Will they feel safe in their classrooms? How many of them will face years, perhaps a lifetime, of trauma due to what they lived through?\nThere have been 311,000 children who have survived school shootings since the one in Columbine in 1999. That is 311,000 children who have survived the trauma of being in school when a shooting occurred, when their classmates and friends have been injured or killed.\nEven the children who have never had a shooting at their own school are not free from the damage. They are subjected to active shooting drills. They see images on social media and on TV. They hear others discussing it. They go to school knowing that, any day, it could happen to them.\nNone of this is normal. Other countries have very little gun violence and have never experienced mass shootings in schools. With four percent of the world's population, the US has 40 percent of the world's guns. There are more guns than people in the US.\nAnd what do some politicians (read: Republicans) suggest as solutions? Fewer doors in schools. And more guns. Lots, lots more guns. Because we all know that more guns lead to fewer shootings.\nLet's not forget that Republicans are not incapable of passing laws to respond to perceived threats. They have passed all kinds of laws to respond to the imaginary threats posed by illegal voters, Critical Race Theory, transgender athletes, and those seeking abortions.\nSo, foetuses deserve protection. But children can be shot without the authorities doing anything to reduce the likelihood of it happening in future?\nThe anger generated over this most recent mass shooting is gratifying. But how many times will we repeat this scenario: Intensive coverage, including some that refuses to look at causes or deliberately misleads on solutions? Politicians beholden to the gun lobby casting blame on everything but guns. Others angrily pointing their finger at the need for gun control. Then the media cycle shifts and the anger fades away. Nothing else changes. And every single day, people die from bullet wounds.\nSchool shootings are an extreme example of grossly negligent policies due to nefarious corporate influence. They are uniquely horrific in the immediate trauma they cause. But they are hardly unique in terms of corporations paying off politicians to avoid acting in the public interest. The suffering\u2014whether from sugary drinks, tobacco, air pollution, car crashes or the climate crisis\u2014is just as real. And the solution is the same: People need to stand up and demand that policymakers act in their best interest, not that of the corporations.\n\u00a0\nDebra Efroymson\u00a0is the executive director of the Institute of Wellbeing, Bangladesh, and author of \"Beyond Apologies: Defining and Achieving an Economics of Wellbeing.\"\n",

        "full_article": "The US sanctions against individuals and a law enforcement agency in Bangladesh took us by surprise\u2014especially when we found ourselves bracketed with countries like North Korea and Myanmar\u2014sending shock waves throughout the power structure as well as the civil society. It is also clear that these sanctions are not about to be lifted anytime soon; remember the withdrawal of GSP after the Rana Plaza collapse, and the promise of its reinstatement once compliance was met? Despite very good compliance, the GSP agenda was never under serious consideration by the US.\nComing back to the sanctions: Once the shouts of \"conspiracy\" and the routine blame games have subsided, we will have to come to terms with the rapidly changing geopolitics, of which these sanctions are symptomatic.\nIt is of little consequence to discuss morality or even democracy in this context, although if those were indeed of central concern, one might have been able to conjure up a modicum of sympathy for the actions imposed. There is no denying that not all is hunky dory with our \"State of Denmark.\" However, who can deny that \"Denmark\" has risen, that enemies have been contained, that other challenges remain that might indeed require more muscle? However, it is not enough for \"Denmark\" to grow and expand; it must advance on other fronts as well, which, let's simply say (although this is no simple matter), includes the rights of citizens to be better respected. It should matter not whether the US wants this from us\u2014we obviously want it for ourselves, and if we do not, we certainly should.\nApologies for digressing. At the heart of the matter is the growing Western discomfort with the rise of China compounded by the Ukraine crisis, which further threatens to destabilise the world order. Under the circumstances, the US would like to contain China in the Pacific as well as the Indo-Pacific. Some of you may have noted that the US sent an urgent, high-powered delegation even to the Solomon Islands, a tiny country with a population of under 700,000, after it signed a treaty with China. This is eloquent testimony to the degree of sensitivity in the West around all things related to China.\nThe US wants Bangladesh to get on board its China (containment) project. This is a difficult ask: China is just round the block and commands an economy that will soon overtake that of the US. China is also heavily involved in mega construction projects in Bangladesh. In other words, Bangladesh is way more dependent on China than it is on the far-away US as far as investment is concerned.\nThe human rights and democracy cards are meant to create pressure, and when deployed by the most powerful country in the world, it is best to give it serious thought. After all, the US is a country with which we have vital trade relations, and where\u2014and this is important\u2014we have a large number of immigrants, many of whom are drawn from Bangladesh's upper classes. Bangladesh cannot afford to earn the ire of the US.\nWhile we may cry foul that similar or worse rights violations have occurred elsewhere with nearly zero consequences (e.g. in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, India, Cambodia, Turkey) or that there are growing rights abuses in the West itself, given the rise of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and a history of violent racism against black and indigenous populations, our cries will be of little avail. The main issue is China, and perhaps the coming cold war. The main issue is Western insecurity, and a concern that their dominance maintained over the last 200 years can no longer be taken for granted.\nIf Bangladesh considers joining the Indo-Pacific treaty, it must ensure that it gets its money's worth (think markets, technology, investment; also think GSP). There should be no hurry. So far, Bangladesh has managed to balance India and China with reasonable success. It will now have to learn a new game: how to balance China and the US. Let's wait to see what others do\u2014after all, many countries are likely to face a similar dilemma and will wish to stay away from superpower rivalries. As a developmental state, Bangladesh's concerns are business, markets, and economics; it has no interest in military pacts or security treaties. I do see Myanmar as a threat, but that is something that we will have to deal with bilaterally. At any rate, it does not look as if either China or the US will help us out with that.\nWe have been placed in a dilemma that is not of our making. All we can do is continue to utter our constitutionally binding foreign policy mantra of \"Friendship to All, Malice to None,\" which, unfortunately, will not make anyone happy. In the meantime, we must vigorously avoid joining any security pact, but remain open to treaties structured around developmental goals. Given the second cold war that is clearly in the making, perhaps the need of the hour is for Jawaharlal Nehru to be resurrected to put together a new Non-Aligned Movement?\nWe should also note that the Biden administration has declared its intention to again assume the role of the champion of human rights and democracy. If these can be combined with geopolitical goals, so much the better! I fear, alas, that we may have to swallow some pride. If we are smart, improving human rights and democracy quickly may allow us to earn enough brownie points to put Bangladesh in a stronger position from which to negotiate our geopolitical space.\n\u00a0\nKAS Murshid\u00a0is an economist and former director-general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).\n",

        "full_article": "A hardly noticed but one of the most important parts of Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's speech at a conclave in Guwahati on May 28 was his efforts to weave the sea connectivity through Bangladesh and road link through Myanmar into the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), a US-led initiative agreed on by India, Australia, Japan and 10 other countries, mostly from Southeast Asia.\nDetailing the road, rail and riverine transport connectivity between India and its neighbours in both bilateral and subregional templates, Jaishankar brought up a vision of more integrated South and Southeast Asian economies, saying this offered a \"complete transformation of the regional economy.\" This, he said, would let the region shed its outlier tag and turn it into a hub of economic activities, with shorter supply lines in and out of the area via the expansion of the outlets to global access. Pointing to the confluence of India's Act East and Neighbourhood First policies, he cited the proposed land connectivity through Myanmar to Thailand and sea connectivity through Bangladesh to Southeast Asia as ways that would link South Asia to Vietnam and the Philippines. This, he argued, would \"make a difference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\" Jaishankar was clearly trying to hard-sell the IPEF just four days after it was decided on. The Bangladesh foreign minister was among the dignitaries present at the event.\nThe IPEF stands on four pillars: 1) Trade; 2) Secure and resilient supply chains; 3) Green energy infrastructure; and 4) Standards of transparency through fair taxation and anti-corruption. As of now, the IPEF is not a trade agreement, but a platform. There is no talk about tariff cuts, but of common standards defining the four pillars of the IPEF, which accounts for half of the world's population and a sizable portion of the global GDP. It is too early to conclude if the IPEF is a prelude to Donald Trump's Trans-Pacific Trade agreement in a different cloak. But the IPEF has taken care to ensure that participants to the initiative would only begin consultations and not launch negotiations to start with. Trump's successor, Joe Biden, knows any whiff of tariff cuts is not only sensitive to the US internal constituency, but would also dissuade many countries from joining the IPEF.\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan touted the IPEF as a \"new model\" to promote economic partnership among the Indo-Pacific countries, but admitted the challenges that stand in the way. Barring the one relating to supply chain resilience, all the other three pillars of the IPEF have ingrained in them concerns for all the 13 countries that have agreed so far to be a part of it. For instance, there are bound to be concerns among a majority of the countries over the US insistence on environmental and labour standards on the manufacturing and trade fronts. Secondly, green energy could pose a challenge to the developing countries, if the targets of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts are thrust on them without being assured of generous funds from the developed countries for building renewable energy sources.\nThe third thorny issue relating to the trade pillar could be the digital economy component of it, particularly the demand by India on the localisation of data storage by big multinational firms. The pillar of anti-corruption and transparency may also throw up problems for countries that are yet to sign up to global conventions on the subject.\nPerhaps the biggest political issue that could crop up for many countries keen to sign on the IPEF is to assess how it provides an alternative to China's aggressive economic diplomacy worldwide with liberal finances. It must be remembered that many countries\u2014including India, which agreed to join the IPEF process\u2014have very robust trade ties with China. All the Asean-member countries are part of the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement, which means a vital supply chain route already exists. So, how does the IPEF project itself as a more viable alternative, unless it comes up with something better both in terms of providing funds and technology?\nAt the Tokyo summit, QUAD committed USD 50 billion to building up infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region and opposed China's illegal fishing in the seas of the region and militarisation of disputed territories\u2014a declaration that has resonance not only in India, but also in a number of Southeast Asian countries which have boundary issues with China. The IPEF needs to do a lot more to chip away into China's economic dominance in the Indo-Pacific. The IPEF countries, and those aspiring to join it, have to weigh the benefits and risks, if any, of joining the arrangement.\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya\u00a0is a special correspondent for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Caste census, once again, is the talk of the town\u2014at least in the Indian state of Bihar. Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, has gone public about it. He appears to be all set to initiate it in his state irrespective of the Centre's non-concurrence. Apparently, there is a consensus on it among the political parties in Bihar.\u00a0\nInterestingly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been party to the two resolutions passed in the Bihar Assembly on the issue, the ruling dispensation at the Centre is wary of such an enterprise. The latter has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court opposing the move. It may be recalled that the demands for caste census had reached a crescendo around 2010, compelling the then Central Government to opt for collection of socio-economic data along with the general census data in 2011. It is another matter that the caste-related data of the 2011 census was never released; however, some parts of the socio-economic data were made public in 2015. The official version refers to gross errors in caste-based data as the reason for its non-release. Political parties and opinion-makers supportive of the caste census suspect the government's motive for the non-release of the data and make light of the official alibi. Reportedly, they charge the government for its intent of hiding the extent of socio-economic backwardness in India.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArguably, the issue of a caste-based census is inextricably linked to the politics of competitive backwardness that has unfolded in the country since the implementation of the Mandal Commission Report. The inclusion of new castes and communities in the list of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and the attendant determination of creamy layer, have often been accompanied by some kind of data gathering exercises undertaken by different commissions/committees appointed by different state governments. Yet, one hardly needs to belabour the point that they have essentially been political initiatives with occasional dollops of juridical interventions. The inclusion of Maratha in the list of OBCs in Maharashtra (whatever be the final judicial pronouncement over it) is a recent case-in-point coming over the waves of such demands for Patidars in Gujarat and/or Jats in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\u00a0\nIndeed, there is no harm in interest-based political mobilisations in a democratic polity. What is surprising, however, is the urge to back political claims of backwardness based on supposedly scientific data which would eventually lead to evidence-based policymaking to achieve goals of social justice. The recent pronouncements of Nitish Kumar veer towards such an understanding. He is tireless in advocating for the need for granular caste data to make robust public policies. And he is so convinced of the indispensability of such a data-gathering exercise that he is committing his entire state machinery to achieve this goal\u2014and that too by going solo.\u00a0\nWithout going into various speculations about his motives\u2014from his need to politically position himself vis-\u00e0-vis the BJP (his alliance partner) to his strategy to project himself as the ultimate messiah of the OBCs in Bihar\u2014we wish to underline the futility of the caste census.\nFirst, we do not need a fresh round of data collection exercises to learn that wealth and privileges are unevenly distributed across castes and communities in India. We have umpteen rounds of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data to tell us that upper caste Hindus do much better on all indicators of good life compared to OBCs, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). We have rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data to let us know that upper caste Hindus have higher life expectancy and better access to health facilities than others. We have plenty of data coming out of All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) and District Information System for Education (DISE) to reveal the gross asymmetry between Hindu upper castes and others in terms of gross enrolment ratio, dropout rates, and overall educational achievements across groups and communities. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) is a good indicator of the share of different groups and communities in the labour force. Even some much-discussed reports, such as the Justice Rajinder Sachar Committee Report and Justice Ranganath Misra Commission Report\u2014though concerned with minorities\u2014offer us an overall good sense of distribution of opportunities across social strata. In fact, the idea of socio-religious community (SRC) is a fine conceptual innovation by the Sachar Committee, which addresses the two-fold sources of structural determination in India: Caste and religion.\nSecond, besides these macro-level data, plenty of scholarly social-scientific research carried out by individual researchers has shed light on caste-based forms of discrimination\u2014be it in terms of accessing bank loans or good schools and hospitals or good jobs. There are fine pieces of research which tell us about the dominance of high castes in urban wealth formation and the preponderance of low castes among landless agricultural labourers and the urban precariat. The problem is that, as policymakers, we are unfortunately often opaque to meaningful social scientific research. Notwithstanding the rhetoric about closer ties between social sciences and policy making, they remain mutually isolated.\u00a0\nDoes one need an all-India survey to know that the high percentage of out-of-pocket expenses on healthcare is the single biggest reason driving millions into the poverty trap? And who would be these millions? Those who are generally poor and\u2014given our social morphology\u2014largely from low caste groups and minorities. Is it not obvious from this that an accessible and affordable quality healthcare system is not only an antidote to poverty but a great support to the low caste groups? Likewise, we know enough from existing research that good residential schools with well-defined quotas for the underprivileged, namely Navodaya and Kasturba Vidyalayas, are potent harbingers of socially just change than a fresh round of census.\u00a0\nLastly, amidst the apparent attractiveness of data-driven policymaking, there is a lurking danger: The reduction of a host of socio-economic issues (which have a bearing on social justice) to the singular pursuit of caste-based quota in public employment and admissions to publicly-funded higher educational institutions. The idea of proportional representation in offices, schools, colleges, universities and the like in terms of a given community's share in the overall population has become an article of faith for the supporters of social justice in India. Regrettably, the latter have been politically complicit in unleashing an economic regime that invariably leads to shrinkage of public education and employment as such. However, that does not restrain them from being extraordinarily vocal on the issue of caste quota. In a way, it helps them\u2014lest their political subterfuges get called out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a larger sense, it is ultimately the failure of Lohiaite (following Ram Manohar Lohia) socialist politics in India. In Bihar, one can trace the reductionist version of socialist politics to the introduction of caste-based quota at the state level by Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur in 1979. Rightly held for its innovation in terms of gradation of socio-economic backwardness and inclusion of Muslim communities under the purview of OBC, this policy ultimately helped render social justice as merely caste-based quota. The earlier capaciousness of socialist politics in the state, when agrarian issues concerning tenants, labourers, irrigation, canal rates, employment, socio-economic oppression at the village level would equally form part of the agenda, yielded to monochromatic identity politics of caste qua reservation. The likes of Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav further fuelled this reductionist process through their binary political rhetoric of forward and backward classes.\u00a0\nNo wonder, in India and in Bihar in particular, a large number of political cadres of communist parties\u2014despite having been engaged in class politics for decades\u2014jumped on the Laloo-induced political bandwagon of social justice (read: caste-based reservation) without any qualms. Bihar is a curious case of slow and eventual decimation of class-based politics by caste-based politics. Nitish Kumar's caste-based census may end up reinforcing this reductionist politics initiated by his venerated political mentor Karpoori Thakur. That would certainly spell doom not only for Bihar, but for India at large.\n\u00a0\nNabanipa Bhattacharjee and Manish Thakur, respectively, are professors of sociology at University of Delhi and Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "It is worrying that the country's zila parishads (district councils) are being reduced to what some observers called \"rehabilitation centres\" for the elderly leaders of the ruling party, as per a report by a national daily. These leaders, who are mostly 70-plus (some even 80-plus), reportedly cannot run these important local government institutions properly. In other words, these veteran leaders of the districts were given the posts of administrators as rewards for their past contributions to the party. But when it comes to executing their responsibilities, they can hardly rise to the occasion.\nAlthough a zila parishad is expected to perform 12 different types of mandatory works and 68 optional works, in reality, little activity is seen in the council offices. These institutions have been limping for years for lack of energy. It is, therefore, necessary for the people of the districts to elect the right kind of people so that the zila parishads can function at full steam.\u00a0\nThere is no denying that despite having the potential to strengthen the arms of the local government and contribute to local development activities, the district councils are gradually being rendered useless for reasons we do not understand. The council almost exists as an appendix of the district administration and as another office under the ministry of local government. We strongly believe that its revival, empowerment and proper functioning can be a significant part of the administrative decentralisation process required for establishing good governance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt can be mentioned that although the district councils received budgetary allocations on a regular basis, subsequent governments since 1975 have not shown any interest to reorganise the councils into properly-functioning local government institutions. We believe that if the current government takes initiatives to reorganise these important organs of the state, it will immensely benefit the people in general. Once sufficiently empowered, these bodies would be able to undertake various responsibilities as per their mandates.\nIt should also be noted that the AL government, in its first term (1971-1975), took a decision to appoint \"district governors\" in all the districts but with the sad demise of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, the idea remained immaterialised. Since then, district councils have existed in the background with little visible contribution. However, significant developments began to happen with the enactment of the Zila Parishad Act 2000. But a further empowerment of the zila parishads is essential. It will be the right step towards ensuring good governance, especially from the perspective of making the system more representative, accountable and participatory.\n",

        "full_article": "Not long ago, we said in this column that no law should be iniquitous. But the Digital Security Act (DSA) is exactly that. It's clear as daylight now that the risks of this law far outweigh its benefits, if any, and any lingering doubt is but a refusal to accept the truth. The law minister's comment on DSA, unfortunately, fits into that category. As per a report by this daily, while responding to queries about the use and possible amendment of the law on Tuesday, he used the word \"if\" a total of four times. He said, \"if necessary\" the government would bring changes to the act to ensure best practice, as the law was misused to some extent.\n\"To some extent\" is an understatement, of course. But the phrase \"if necessary\" takes away from what is otherwise a creditable observation coming from a minister, and weakens the prospect of a much-needed reform. Why should there still be any doubt after four long years of a law that has proven to be the single most effective instrument of human rights abuse in the country? What's left to be done but to amend or repeal it in its entirety? The only scenario in which it has any practical use now is one where it is a legal weapon to be wielded at will. For example, according to a study by the Center for Governance Studies (CGS), between January 2020 and February 2022, some 890 cases were filed under the DSA, and 206 of them were filed by members of the ruling Awami League and its affiliated organisations. More worryingly still, opposition activists and journalists are mostly implicated in them.\nThis shows that the main purpose of the law has been not to protect victims of cybercrimes but to intimidate social media users, particularly political activists, rights campaigners and journalists. It also shows that amending the law in light of international human rights standards is not just necessary but urgent, regardless of what the authorities say to justify their action or lack thereof. We have to admit, however, that the number of DSA cases and arrests has declined somewhat in recent times. The law minister cited a home ministry directive to make sure that DSA cases are sent to a cell comprising a high official and a legal analyst for examination before they are brought to trial. True, if done right, this will bring down the number of cases, but it is still a far cry from the reforms necessary in the law itself or how the police, judiciary and ruling party members treat cases involving voices of dissent.\nWe, therefore, urge the government to stop dilly-dallying and immediately amend the questionable provisions of the DSA and also ensure that no one is targeted for exercising their freedom of speech.\n",
