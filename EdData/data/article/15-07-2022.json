In a not-unexpected turn of events, the beleaguered executive head of Sri Lanka fled by an Air Force plane, reached the Maldives and thereafter went to Singapore, presumably on his way to another country. Evidently hedging against the possibility of being turned back by any of these countries, he did not submit his resignation on July 13 as promised. As he sent in his resignation Thursday evening, it was clear he was holding out so that he would not lose his presidential immunity from prosecution until he reached safe haven. Given the widespread wrath against him, being in Colombo without the shield of office was not an option for him. Instead, he appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to discharge the President\u2019s functions in his absence, using a provision in the Constitution which allows such an arrangement if the incumbent has to leave the country or is otherwise unable to perform his duties. Mr. Wickremesinghe is now unlikely to respond to calls for his resignation, as the country\u2019s Constitution provides that the current Prime Minister shall act as President until a new one is elected. While the legislature is to be convened soon for formally electing a new President, there are questions over whether the mass uprising will abate, as its protagonists have been asking for Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s resignation too, seeing him as equally discredited. It is perhaps in anticipation of an intensification of the protest that Mr. Wickremesinghe has asked the military to do whatever is needed to restore order. But order is not born of bloodshed; confrontation must be avoided, and efforts made to heed the demands of the people.The world has been amazed by the unprecedented display of righteous anger and courage by the citizens of Sri Lanka, as they channelled the widespread fury against the devastation caused by the economic crisis on their day-to-day existence. As civil society came together, it is apt to see this as a revolutionary moment in which an avaricious and apathetic political class has been humbled by people united by suffering. While external observers see this as a moment of truth for authoritarian leaders, power-hungry politicians and their ilk, it remains to be seen if political leaders in Sri Lanka themselves have drawn any lesson from it. Reports suggest that jockeying for power is going on on one side even as images of protesters overwhelming offices and residences associated with the rulers are going viral. Sri Lankans may expect that a change of regime will mean a new order that would usher in constitutional changes, policy reforms and reverse the trend of public interest being sacrificed for political ends. The next President should recognise this legitimate aspiration and refrain from any attempt to maintain the status quo, cover up the misdeeds that led the country to the current crisis or preserve the ill-gotten gains of office.",

        "full_article": "The struggle to achieve gender equality and bridge the gap between men and women is a long and difficult one. India has got another opportunity to do much better for half of its population with the Global Gender Gap Index for 2022, released by the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, placing it at 135 out of 146 countries. But the new data \u2014 India\u2019s ranking in 2021 was 140 out of 156 countries \u2014 hardly brings cheer as India has fared the worst in at least one of the parameters \u2014 \u2018health and survival\u2019 \u2014 in which it took the last spot. The Global Gender Gap Index benchmarks the current state and evolution of gender parity across four dimensions: economic participation and opportunity; educational attainment; health and survival, and political empowerment. India ranks poorly among its neighbours and is behind Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Bhutan. Only Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan perform worse than India in the region. In 2022, coming on the back of a pandemic, war and economic crises, the global gender gap has been closed by 68.1%, which means at the current rate of progress it will take 132 years to reach full parity. Among all the regions, it will take the longest for South Asia to reach the target \u2014 197 years \u2014 \u201cdue to a broad stagnation in gender parity scores ... in the region\u201d.There have been enough numbers from the ground to indicate that India, with a female population of approximately 66 crore, has faltered on the road to gender parity. In the pandemic years, as incomes shrank, women faced hurdles on every front, from food, health, and education for the girl child to jobs. The latest NFHS data (2019-2021) show that 57% of women (15-49 age bracket) are anaemic, up from 53% in 2015-16; though 88.7% of married women participate in key household decisions, only 25.4% of women, aged 15-49 years, who worked in the last 12 months (2019-2021), were paid in cash. Women having a bank account or savings account that they themselves use have increased to 78.6%, with schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana helping, but women participation in the labour force has shrunk. According to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, in 2016-17 about 15% women were employed or looking for jobs; this metric dipped to 9.2% in 2021-22. The best way to improve India\u2019s abysmal ranking is to do it right by women. For that, it is imperative to increase representation of women in leadership positions at all levels so that women get greater access to jobs and resources. It is up to the Government to move beyond tokenisms and help women overcome staggering economic and social barriers.",

        "full_article": "RBI this week initiated measures to allow rupee settlement of cross-border trade deals. It\u2019s still work-in-progress but the essence is that Indian banks can act as custodians of funds in international transactions settled in rupees. These measures need to be located in the context of the immediate need to cope with developments in the foreign currency market and the long-term opportunities present in the gradual shift in the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves.\nGlobal commodity prices have dipped since the level witnessed in May. For India, this augurs well. The average price of an Indian basket of crude in July was $106, about 9% below June. However, it has been partially offset by the weakening of the rupee against the dollar on account of global reallocation of capital after prominent central banks started increasing interest rates. Since January, foreign portfolio outflows have crossed $30 billion. In addition to market intervention, RBI adopted other measures to cope with the rupee depreciation. Last week, it liberalised forex inflows. Now, it\u2019s provided a window to settle trades in rupees.\nThis window serves two purposes. Right now, it helps India grab opportunities such as discounts on Russian oil.\u00a0 For example, India imported $1.3 billion of Russian crude in April, making it the fourth largest source. A year ago, there were no crude imports from Russia. Rupee settlement allows Indian firms to circumvent Western sanctions that bite because of their dominance over the global financial system. Long-term, there are likely to be more opportunities to internationalise the rupee on account of a shift in the composition of global foreign exchange reserves. The US dollar\u2019s hold is slowly receding \u2013 it\u2019s about 59% now from a level of 70% two decades ago.\nThis trend will continue as countries de-risk holdings. To illustrate, the Bank of Israel plans to reallocate a part of its US dollar holdings to currencies of Australia, Canada, China and Japan. India needs to seize the opportunity ahead. GoI now needs to complement the effort initiated by RBI through relevant policy tweaks.\n\n",

This was a bit odd \u2013 to use a Parliament-appropriate expression \u2013 as publishing such words has been happening since 1950s. The list is not a diktat, it\u2019s based on rulings by presiding officers in parliamentary and assembly proceedings in India and Commonwealth countries. And none of the words are banned, clarified LS speaker Om Birla. Presiding officers will expunge remarks they deem unacceptable. Therefore, it\u2019s not really a gag order. Also, there are easy workarounds for many words listed as unparliamentary. Some critics are exercised that words like \u201cincompetent\u201d have been deemed inappropriate. Why not say \u201ccompetence is in question\u201d instead \u2013 it makes the same point but doesn\u2019t sound like a sweeping judgment.\nThat said, while suggesting expunging of words and phrases, parliamentary secretariats should not entirely take a mechanical approach. House discussions must also reflect the liveliness that animates politics in a voluble and sometimes volatile democracy. MPs can also help by reminding themselves that the five minutes of news television coverage they get for using unparliamentary words do nothing for their legislative career.\nUltimately, a Parliament is judged by the quality of its debate and its law-making. Some of the recent sessions of Parliament have witnessed record \u201cproductivity\u201d, even exceeding 100%. That disruptions have been few is good. And when debates do happen, some MPs, on both sides, have made quality interventions. What\u2019s needed in greater measure is extensive deliberations in smaller parliamentary committees and deeper House debates on complex issues. Only this week the Supreme Court flagged a hole in the Juvenile Justice Act amended in 2015. This allowed trial of a minor as an adult for heinous offences. The law hadn\u2019t mandated preliminary assessment by a child psychologist, making SC wonder how judges or social workers can competently assess a minor\u2019s mental capacity and ability to understand consequences. Ensuring such legislative slips don\u2019t happen should be a first priority for MPs.\n\n",

        "full_article": "July 15 marks World Youth Skills (WYS) Day, and this year's slogan for the day is \"Transforming Youth Skills for the Future.\" WYS Day has been celebrated on July 15 every year since 2014 after the United Nations announced it. This time, the day is going to be observed amid concentrated efforts towards socioeconomic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and challenges relating to climate change, conflict, persisting poverty, rising inequality, rapid technological change, demographic transition, and others. The objective of this day is to \"celebrate the strategic importance of equipping young people with skills for employment, decent work, and entrepreneurship,\" according to the UN.\nBangladesh has been grappling with unemployment since its inception. According to the World Bank (2020), the unemployment rate is 5.30 percent of the total labour force. One of the underlying reasons for this issue is the high rate of school dropout, which accounts for 32 percent of the total population, according to the Labour Force Survey (2016-2017). About 80 percent of these youths live in rural areas. The dropout rate peaks in Class 8, when 14.6 percent of both boys and girls leave school (Unicef Bangladesh, 2017). These dropouts either join the informal sector or remain unemployed. Young jobseekers in Bangladesh face tremendous challenges in transitioning from school to work due to a lack of in-demand skills, experience, youth-friendly employment opportunities, and limited career guidance.\nWith this in mind, the project Community Partnerships to Strengthen Sustainable Development (Compass) by the United States Forest Service/International Programs and USAID established a Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) in Bangladesh. Through a six-month training, the programme engages underprivileged and marginalised education dropout youths to instil vocational and soft skills in them, while developing environmental stewardship and ensuring employment as well as entrepreneurial opportunities. The programme was modelled after the US Youth Conservation Corps, which is being implemented in different countries such as Honduras, Colombia and Cambodia. In Bangladesh, the project was contextualised with several year-long activities such as a virtual study tour to see global practices, a local stakeholder consultation workshop, and a youth and labour market study. The youth and labour market study was commissioned to understand the youths' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP), employment status, skills gap, viable income generating activities (IGAs), and long-standing challenges along with the impact of Covid and its way forward. The study used a mixed-method approach, which included a rapid assessment survey, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.\nAmong the youths surveyed, 194 (66 percent) of the respondents are currently unemployed, 77 (26 percent) belong to NEET, 15 (five percent) were previously employed but unemployed at present, and only eight respondents (three percent) are employed at present. This denotes that the youth are struggling to get job opportunities, which could implicate barriers and challenges for them.\nAmong the 294 respondents, only 51 (17 percent) stated that they had received training, whereas 243 (83 percent) had not received any training. This demonstrates a lack of training availability or awareness in training, and indicates a lack of presence of the government and NGO actors. This also explains why there is a large proportion of respondents who are unemployed.\nFurthermore, 279 respondents (95 percent) were interested in finding better opportunities for themselves, while 12 (four percent) said they were not interested, and three (one percent) said they would consider it. This portrays the eagerness and enthusiasm of the youth to improve their skills and learn new ones in the hope of obtaining better employment opportunities. The youths prefer to receive more training in soft skills development relating to communication, teamwork, time management, conflict management, professional motivation, and leadership development.\nExisting perceptions of local population\n\nOne of the challenges that a skill development programme encounters relates to the existing perceptions of the local population. Due to a lack of education and awareness, many people are unaware of the importance of mostly soft skills needed to thrive in the realm of business. Most business owners believe that having the bare minimum technical skills pertaining to their business is enough, and they ignore soft skills such as proficiency in literacy and numeracy, communication skills, conflict management, etc. Therefore, engaging local communities with the programme is important. Having outreach meetings and consultations with the community people, youths, local administration, and job providers would be an effective strategy.\nLack of youth motivation and confidence\n\nAnother challenge worth noting is creating and sustaining youth motivation, confidence, and perseverance. We found that the youths lack motivation and confidence if they are not given the correct guidance and support. Seeking job opportunities, especially at a younger age, and with the added responsibility of providing for the family, can be a daunting task. Those who participated in our project did not necessarily take the step forward in looking for employment afterward. Therefore, follow-up is crucial. We feel this includes mentoring support for six months after training. The YCC has created an alumni platform that facilitates follow-up and voluntarily offers employment linkage support.\nSocial constructs of gender\n\nThe manner in which gender has been socially constructed in our society is a barrier for both men and women to participate in IGAs. Based on interviews and focus group discussions with participants, both gender groups view certain activities to be specifically intended for particular gender groups. When asked what IGAs are best suited for women, the men in a focus group discussion claimed that sewing is most suitable for women as they can do it by staying home. They can't naturally carry out heavy labour work.\nEven after completing nursery training, the female graduates did not get family support to start a nursery because of their gender. To address this issue, the YCC engaged parents at the beginning when selected trainees chose their vocational trades/subjects. We also found that arranging for training in gender education gave confidence and motivation to the trainees as well as their parents.\nConnection with microfinance institutions (MFIs) and supply chain actors\n\nThe study found that 59 percent of respondents relied on family and friends, while 15 percent relied on personal savings to initiate their businesses. This reveals that there is limited access to funding; accumulating personal funds takes time, and taking loans from family or friends isn't necessarily the best option. The skills development programmes can connect the youths with local microfinance institutions (MFIs) to secure loans. On the other hand, many entrepreneurs struggle due to a lack of customers. Fluctuating demands and prices drastically affect their sales. Organisations can help enable connections with local restaurants and shops and create these forward linkages within the supply chain.\nLike other countries, the youth in Bangladesh had a difficult time during the Covid pandemic. As we recover from the pandemic fallout, youth skills development should be one of the major priorities to reinforce their presence in the job market. Promoting the IGAs and entrepreneurship through skills development training can be a strategy by the government and non-government sectors. After all, healthy and skilled youth is the future of a nation and the world.\n\u00a0\nMd Mofaq Kharul Taufiq is a development activist, currently working as YCC specialist for the US Forest Service, International Program.\nThe content of this article is the sole responsibility of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views of USAID, US Forest Service or the US government.\n",

        "full_article": "Almost every day on my way to work, traffic comes to a standstill as we approach Farmgate. The ongoing construction of Dhaka metro rail has significantly narrowed this main artery, although this does not stop the buses, cars, motorbikes, and pedestrians from rushing forward all at once, leading to further choking and more misery. But while people sweat it out in the heat, dust and smog, there are some youngsters who find \"opportunities\" in the relentless gridlock. With speed and precision, their slight bodies glide through the traffic, their eyes glazed and predatory as they look for the unmindful passenger talking on their mobile phone which they can snatch in an instant before disappearing into the crowd. Sometimes you can see them huddled under the foot overbridge, their faces deep inside dirty polythene bags, inhaling something called \"dandy\" or glue. The glue helps them forget their isolation, their anger, and most of all, their hunger.\nBangladesh has been cited by a global survey as the seventh angriest, saddest, and most stressed nation in the world. The report gives five significant contributors of global unhappiness: poverty, bad communities, loneliness, scarcity of good work, and hunger.\nI would add to this list a sense of powerlessness and frustration in a society that is grossly unequal in terms of wealth and opportunity, and devoid of role models and mentors. This could explain the regular incidents of young men and teenagers getting involved in crime, sometimes as heinous as murder.\nOn June 25, Jitu, a student of Class 10, beat a teacher to death with a cricket stump. He was angry because the teacher had reprimanded him for inappropriate behaviour on various occasions and decided to beat him up in front of everyone; he said he wanted to impress his girlfriend. It was a way for Jitu to establish his position, his power, regardless of the consequences.\nHasibul Bashar, a 25-year-old Chhatra League leader, was hacked to death on July 7, his throat slit by a group of assailants. Two of the main accused are aged 25 and 20. The gruesome murder was the culmination of a feud between Chhatra League and Jubo League members over who had supremacy in the locality. Being able to establish domination over an area is the prime catalyst that leads to such violent encounters. And unsurprisingly, when the \"big brothers\" (boro bhai) of a neighbourhood \u2013 young men who are members of a political party \u2013 engage in criminal behaviour that includes brutal and public killings of rivals, the \"younger brothers\" (chhoto bhai) will follow suit. It is a culture of toxic masculinity that glorifies violence and domination of others while scorning empathy. Thus, the rise of teenage gangs in major cities, the members of which become copycats of their \"mastaan\u00a0heroes\" who are invincible and untouchable by even the law of the land.\nIn 2020, teen gangs committing serious crimes such as rape, murder, and mugging made the headlines numerous times. A report in\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0revealed that there were as many as 40 teen gangs in Dhaka, and around a hundred in Chittagong. All these gangs have the \"blessings\" of \"big brothers\" and were engaged in drug peddling and drug abuse. Many carry firearms and weapons as a show of their strength, which manifest during \"turf wars\" with rival gangs.\nThe idea of \"supremacy\" is far more empowering than the aspiration to be an upright citizen, which does not seem to solve the constant financial anxiety and despair faced by lower- and middle-income groups. Psychologists have cited poor parental skills, narcotics, and deteriorating mental health \u2013 especially during the Covid pandemic \u2013 as adding to the stress of young people. During the pandemic, the only recreational activity for young people was to be engaged in social media. In an interview with\u00a0The Daily Star, Kamal Uddin Chowdhury, a professor of clinical psychology at Dhaka University and a researcher of adolescent mental health, said that this dependence on social media gave our youths \"a narrow sense of identity and culture, which they reproduce by forming groups in their real lives.\"\nMost of these teenagers, moreover, are from low-income groups with parents struggling to make ends meet. While making TikTok videos and watching films that glamourise violence and law-breaking provide some reprieve, in the real world they are confronted with the blatant divide between them and the boys/men from privileged sections who zoom through the streets in their flashy cars. Thus, anger, frustration, and resentment are their constant companions that may be acted out through aggression.\nWhich brings us to the popular development catchphrase \"demographic dividend,\" especially the one Bangladesh is enjoying at present. It is basically a window of opportunity a country gets when its working population is greater than its dependent population (children and the elderly) and has the potential for accelerated economic growth. For Bangladesh, this window will be open till around 2040. But to reap the benefits of this demographic dividend, the country must invest in all those sectors that affect the life of a young person: quality and affordable education, health and nutrition, safety, economic stability, recreational facilities, better skills, and better-paying jobs. At the same time, the state must promote the idea that crime does not pay, and those who commit crime will be held accountable and punished no matter who they are connected to. This demands a total cleansing within political organisations of members who engage in all kinds of crime, yet enjoy total impunity from the law. The definition of \"big brother\" needs to go back to being a mentor who brings positive influence to the lives of their young disciples and teaches them to be empathetic, fair, and honourable individuals.\nAasha Mehreen Amin\u00a0is joint editor at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A \"groundbreaking\" exhibition on post-Partition architecture in South Asia has just concluded on July 2, 2022, in one of New York City's most powerful cultural institutions, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), after a five-month run. Serving as a member of the show's curatorial advisory board, I had the good fortune of attending its premiere back in February. For me, the show, \"The Project of Independence: Architectures of Decolonisation in South Asia, 1947\u20131985,\" raised a set of provocative questions: What did the idea of independence imply for the built environment in the newly decolonised countries in South Asia, in the violent wake of Partition in 1947? Do elite Western cultural institutions continue to demonstrate what Edward Said called \"cultural imperialism\" in explaining the \"rest of the world\"? Most importantly, does this exhibition shed any new light on how people in South Asia process the lessons of history?\nAgainst the politically charged backdrop of these historical questions, the MoMA exhibition sought to examine how architecture and city planning served postcolonial development in Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan), India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). The show's six themes \u2013 New Cities, Templates for Living, Industry and Infrastructure, Political Spaces, Landscapes of Education, and Institution Building \u2013 helped weave a complex narrative on how political leaders, bureaucrats, architects, engineers, and other practitioners of the built environment in these countries collaborated to imagine the future of their respective nations.\nHaving seen the exhibition, I was both excited and disappointed. Excited because Bangladesh was represented prominently, although only through architect Muzharul Islam's works, Louis Kahn's Parliament building, and Kamalapur Railway Station. The absence of Constantino Doxiadis' TSC, Bashirul Haq's brick buildings, and Syed Mainul Hossain's National Martyr's Memorial surprised me. And disappointed because the MoMA, it seemed to me, failed to capture the rich array of political contradictions that informed South Asian cultural endeavours in the aftermath of Partition.\nWhy is Partition such an important marker in political and cultural histories of South Asia? The splitting in two of British India to make Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan \u2013 along with the further carving up of Pakistan into two parts separated by a thousand miles of Indian territory \u2013 resulted in one of history's largest mass migrations. Overnight, people abandoned homes, property, and the tenor of coexistence that had defined lives for centuries on the Indian subcontinent. Millions of Hindus and Muslims sought refuge in opposite directions. What emerged in the aftermath \u2013 besides bigotry and murderous mayhem \u2013 was the predicament of having to define oneself according to invented boundaries, lines that had been drawn by Cyril Radcliffe, a British judge assigned by the imperial authority to remake the regional map. Mahatma Gandhi described Partition as \"the vivisection of India.\"\nThe idea of independence was burdened, in each newly minted nation-state, by these tragedies and dilemmas of division, as well as by the complications of postcolonial uncertainty and uneven entanglements with notions of modernity. When India's first post-independence prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, referred to hydroelectric dams as \"temples of the new age,\" for instance, he deployed competing metaphors to present a national agenda for development. On one hand, he celebrated independence as a \"new age\" ushering in a triumphant future; on the other, that future could only be envisioned by invoking the historicity and religiosity of temples. The MoMA exhibition seemed to have missed an opportunity to represent the generative power of such contradictions.\nLet us consider Muzharul Islam, Bangladesh's first professionally trained architect, who came home in 1952 after receiving his Bachelor of Architecture at the University of Oregon. In a review for Places Journal I wrote: \"Like many secular-minded Bengalis, he was disillusioned by the imposition of a pan-Islamic polity, instrumentalised by officials to cement the idea of Pakistan. The draconian attempt to impose Urdu \u2013 the language of the ruling elite in West Pakistan \u2013 as the national language hurt the pride of East Pakistanis like Islam, who spoke Bengali and felt marginalised by the economic and political asymmetries already taking hold between the two parts of the new country. East Pakistan's agitation against West Pakistani military regimes eventually led to a secessionist war and, in 1971, to the creation of Bangladesh. Accordingly, unlike most Indians and Pakistanis, the majority of Bangladeshis enshrine 1971, rather than 1947, as the momentous year of their national history.\"\nMuzharul Islam's aesthetic politics was deeply nuanced. He articulated a modernist visual language \u2013 for instance in the Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka University (1953-56), represented at MoMA with a beautifully crafted model \u2013 that was intended to purge East Pakistani architecture of Islamist symbolism or Indo-Saracenic references, since these were likely to be seen as signifiers of political religiosity. In his other works of the period, also on view in The Project of Independence \u2013 the University of Dhaka Library (1953-54) and Chittagong University (1965-71) \u2013 Islam deployed a modernist idiom to bridge Bengali culture's syncretic approach to faith and embrace of universal humanism as championed by Rabindranath Tagore into the cosmopolitan sensibilities of a global citizen.\nDespite my unease with the MoMA's failure to highlight the nuance of diverse political contexts from which architecture and city planning in South Asia emerged after Partition, I felt that the exhibition could not have come at a better moment. It can serve as a potent reminder for our ethical responsibility to preserve the mid-century buildings that tell our stories and reveal the politics of nation-building. The prevailing culture, beholden as it is to swanky visions of \"smart cities,\" seems to view history as an aberration, and the demolition of cultural patrimony has been normalised as development. To encounter, in the MoMA gallery, the photographs of Daniel Dunham and Robert Boughey's Kamalapur Railway Station is to recall that one of South Asia's first examples of \"tropical modernism\" has reportedly been slated for demolition. A similar fate, I heard from a reliable source, awaits TSC too. It is heartbreaking and suicidal.\nWe must preserve our history narrated by our built heritage. If the global community values what we have in our midst and we don't, it would mean that the oft-repeated narrative of our national progress is not holistic. The cost of our asymmetric and uneven aspiration would be too great. As Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has shown, we can conquer a difficult river like the Padma with our own resolve and resources. Protecting our cherished history that some of our buildings embody should be a much simpler challenge.\nAdnan Zillur Morshed, PhD, is an architect, architectural historian, and urbanist.

        "full_article": "It's alarming that even after a decade-long drive of the government to put its administrative procedures online, many digital services are still poorly functioning\u00a0or exist only in name, thanks to slow servers, poor internet speed, as well as disruptive practices inherited from the analogue time. As a result, people are not getting the maximum benefit from 761 services that the government have digitalised. A number of those services can no longer be requested online, as per an official evaluation done on 67 digital services provided by 26 ministries and divisions. Many are suffering from myriad other problems.\nAccording to a report by this daily, the evaluation by the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), based on interviews with service providers and recipients, has brought out mixed findings: while most beneficiaries are positive about the digitalisation drive, they are facing different kinds of problems while requesting e-dockets, land mutation, e-passport, machine-readable passport, loan service, e-trade licence, etc. Either the websites through which the services can be requested are not updated regularly, or services are no longer operational because of a dearth of skilled manpower, or user interfaces are too complicated, or servers are down frequently. All this is causing delays and often escalating costs of the services sought.\nClearly, the digitalisation drive is still under the influence of the stubbornly analogue government work culture that it aspires to replace. That culture involved slogging through labyrinthine offices and huge paperwork as well as dealing with irregularities every step of the way. While this is no longer the case for many services now offered digitally, that work culture is proving harder to change. That said, there is growing evidence that if used properly, digitalisation can be a huge boon, as revealed in a recent study by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED). It showed that digitalisation of 66 percent of the services offered by six ministries/divisions has saved both time and money. Some 70 percent of the service-seekers said they faced no \"hassles\" of the kind that one would when those offices were run manually.\nThere are huge benefits to be derived if all administrative procedures are moved online or completely digitalised, and if the scope for analogue interventions is eradicated. Bangladesh may still be a technological backwater \u2013 with generally poor internet connectivity and digital literacy \u2013 but many of the problems facing government services are systemic, and can be resolved with proper guidance and motivation. We urge the government to go all out to make its digitalisation drive a success. It must properly equip all service agencies and fix loopholes that are still causing mismanagement and irregularities. Setting up a digital agency to oversee desired reforms can also be considered.\n",

        "full_article": "Amid gloomy developments such as high inflation, falling reserves and Covid resurgence, the workforce export has emerged as a silver lining on the horizon. Bangladesh, according to a report published in this paper on Thursday last, sent nearly 1.0 million workers abroad during the immediate past financial year (FY2021-22). The number was the highest in the last seven FYs. The official target was to send 0.4 million workers in FY'22, but higher demand, primarily from the Gulf countries, had helped the country send workers 2.5 times more. Gradual recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the rising oil prices together created a higher demand for workers. The Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET) people are hopeful about sending a more significant number of workers abroad with jobs during the current FY as they expect conditions to become more favourable in the destination countries in the coming months. The restart of hiring of Bangladesh workers by Malaysia will provide yet another boost to manpower export under a deal reached between the two countries recently. There is, however, a not-so-palatable side of the manpower export story. In FY'22, migrant workers reportedly sent home 3.74 billion less than the previous year. It could be because of the decline in wages or use of the informal channels for remitting money. Most Bangladeshi migrant workers are unskilled or semi-skilled, the supply of which is abundant in the global manpower market. Naturally, employers offer less to these workers. Other service conditions, in most cases, are also found to be unattractive. The wages are less in the Gulf countries where the concentration of Bangladeshi migrant workers is very high. Volumes have been said and written about developing the skill level of the would-be migrant workers keeping in view the demand in the most prospective manpower markets. The policymakers also talked about programmes and projects for skill development, but the relevant government/private agencies have done little in this respect. The availability of workers suitable for high-end jobs abroad is very few in numbers. Unless the number of such skilled workers is raised to a reasonable level, the remittance inflow would continue to be frustratingly low despite having a large workforce employed abroad. The government, to encourage the migrant Bangladeshi workers to send their money back home through formal channels, has been offering a 2.5 per cent cash incentive. It had worked well until recently. But the ongoing exchange rate volatility might have encouraged them to use alternatives that would fetch them higher returns. Given the falling value of Taka, the government should come up with more attractive incentives, in different forms. There is no denying that expatriate workers have not received benefits matching their contributions to the national economy. The government might point to its inability to pay handsome benefits to the migrant workers because of resource constraints. But the investment of huge remittance money that flows into the country every year in productive areas would have offered the government greater manoeuvrability in this respect.",

        "full_article": "Two flagship bridges of riverine Bangladesh, the Padma Bridge and Bangabandhu Setu, have revolutionised the country's communication. Of the two, the latest to have been opened to traffic is the bridge on the mighty river Padma known for its treacherous shifting soil at its bed. So engineers had to overcome the toughest challenges ever faced anywhere in the world for erecting at least a couple of pillars midstream of the river. Naturally the achievement is worth celebrating and the joy and euphoria have been increased many times over because of the accomplishment of the job with the country's own finance, thanks to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's courageous and sagacious decision. Already people of the south-western districts are overjoyed to have made their Eid journeys home free of the encumbrances and ordeals they had to suffer during the annual festivals each year. Time lapses on the road were almost non-existent because of the expressway up to Bhanga, Faridpur. The other news is that the number of visitors to the Kuakata beach in Patuakhali have increased manifold. However one piece of news likely to escape public notice concerns the number of vehicles that have crossed the bridge during three days starting from midday Thursday last week and the toll realised from those vehicles. During the three days 74,222 vehicles cruised past the bridge both ways and the toll collection from those stood at Tk 100.98 million. Comparably, 120,350 vehicles coursed on the Bangabandhu Setu opened to traffic in June, 1998 and about Tk 90.19 million was realised as toll. While the Padma Bridge had record toll collection of a little over Tk 40.19 million on Friday, the Bangabandhu Setu also had its record toll realisation of Tk30.35 million between Wednesday midnight and Thursday midnight.Now what is special about the large amount of toll collection? That toll collection will be higher at a time when the rush is at its heaviest is understandable. This does not necessarily mean that such a large number of vehicles will beeline the bridges in normal times but still the fact is that the highway connecting the Padma Bridge has already witnessed movement of 15 to 20-fold more vehicles. It is likely to go up rather than coming down in the future. The greater is the mobility of people the further the economic progress of a country. Again, the heavy traffic of festival time is a clear evidence of the highway's and the bridge's capacity to handle such emergencies. The third issue as raised by some quarters questioning the huge investment of $3.86 billion in a single project is the recovery of the invested money. Although the prime minister has claimed the money spent on the bridge and the subsequent maintenance cost will be recovered within 20 years, an initial estimate gives a time frame of 35 years for the recovery of the cost. However, these are concerns irrelevant to the objective and the multifarious dividends the country will be reaping, courtesy of the bridge. But the issues that are yet to receive enough attention are the complementary, supportive and allied infrastructure, facilities capable of taking the pressure off the capital. Some have raised their voice in favour of a four-lane highway from Bhanga to Kuakata. This will be useful no doubt but the argument looks not as strong as they claim because their prime focus is on facilitation of tourism at Kuakata. That Dhaka should not be as thickly crowded as it is and a hub of almost every human activity turning it into a terrible urban conundrum has caught the attention of both common people and policymakers. But Dhaka-centric planning has not shown any sign of relenting. The rivers around the capital are either choking or dying because of the excessive human activity and industrial pollution. But for the city's survival, the survivability of the rivers is a must. Now that the entire country has been connected with road and the railways are expected to follow suit, decentralisation of governance, means of production and employment have to be prioritised. People will leave this crowded and unbearable city to live in smaller but better liveable urban centres if facilities for standard education and medical care can be developed nearby. Under a decentralised system, regional development can be expected to be rational and on an even keel. Thus ICT city, specialised industrial and manufacturing villages after Silicon valley can be built away from the capital.There is no point investing in more mega projects for the capital. Its population needs dispersal rather than further concentration. True, its entry and exit points can be modernised with inter-city buses not cramming the bus terminals. Those buses must enter one way and exit other way without needing roundabout movement. This will facilitate highway journeys without creating 10-20-mile logjam on the approach roads to bridges. This done, the maximum dividend of highways and bridges like the Padma Bridge can be reaped. Festival times have ever remained a critical time for home-goers in this country. Because the railways have not seen their network developed and expanded, the bulk pressure of festivals' rush times had to be borne by the road transports and people of the southern districts mostly relied on launch journeys infamous for a most suffocating crammed condition. During this Eid, things have changed reasonably for the better. <[email\u00a0protected]>",

        "full_article": "The edible oil prices in the international market after reaching their record levels in May last, started declining and those are now about to return to 2020 levels. Traders are hopeful about a further slide in edible oil prices in the coming months. That is a piece of welcome news in these days of economic hardship. Very high edible oil prices have been hurting the consumers most.Newspaper reports about falling edible oil prices are only soothing to the ears of the poor consumers. Nothing more, as the prices of this essential kitchen item are still sticking to their previous highs in Bangladesh. Old habits die hard. Traders here have not moved an inch from their tradition---hike the prices of imported items, instantly, if their global prices are up, drag your feet as far as possible when the development is in the opposite direction. The commerce ministry, which is often accused of taking a stance favourable to traders, had asked the refiners before the Eid days to reduce edible oil prices by Tk.06 a litre. But the latter has not complied with that order. A litre of bottled soybean oil is still being sold at Tk 205. The situation is altogether different in neighbouring India. Traders of that country, in keeping with the declining trend in prices of both palm and soybean oils in the international market, have brought down their prices thrice since May 23 last. The price of soybean oil has declined by Rs. 31 a litre in that country. It is a pity that the commerce ministry is reluctant to take a tough stance when it comes to protecting the interests of millions of consumers. It did not bother to see whether its directive has been complied with or not. The situation remains the same with the Ministry of Food where millers are also getting an upper hand. Edible oil refiners are reportedly unwilling to bring down their prices because of the declining value of the Taka against the greenback. They claim that they are now forced to buy US dollars at a 20-25 per cent higher rate from the informal forex market. Higher shipping cost is another reason they cite in support of their inability to reduce prices of edible oils. Neither of the reasons does hold water. India is also witnessing an erosion in the value of its currency. But that could not hold back the Indian traders from cutting edible oil prices by a reasonable margin. Higher freight is also not tenable at this stage, for the shipping cost had gone up soon after the strike by the SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. It is not a fresh development. Inaction by the relevant ministries during such a difficult situation only gives rise to deep frustration among the millions of consumers. The government has cut duties on both edible oils and rice. But the onus is on the ministries of commerce and food to ensure a positive result from the cut in duty. It is not at all acceptable that importers/traders would enjoy the fruits of duty-cut while consumers are made to pay through the nose for most of the essential items. Visits by mobile teams, headed by executive magistrates, are unlikely to deliver results, as far as high prices are concerned. The government will have to deal with the biggies who call the shot, as far as import and supply of essentials are concerned. Relevant agencies should seek answers from the refiners/importers to a few pertinent questions. If they cannot give a proper reply, take them to task under the law of the land.

Another survey conducted by Aanchal Foundation says that a total of 61.2 per cent of youths (aged between 18 and 25 years) in the country are suffering from depression and 3.7 per cent have attempted suicide. The mental health issue is one of the underlying causes behind these tragic incidents. Most of us know it well that suicide can never be a solution. But many attempt it out of depression. They give up fighting pain, failure, loneliness and sorrow of their lives. Some reversals are really hard to overcome. But giving up is no solution. Rather, you have to love your life. You should give sometime to yourself or the things you love to do on a regular basis. You should build relationship with those who can think positively. You will find your life more beautiful and purposeful, and we all should enjoy it. Those who are suffering from mental health issues like depression should always be supported by their family, friends and society. They should not be insulted, humiliated or socially degraded under any circumstances. The way we can keep someone mentally fit is to accompany them because they need emotional support. It is time to take strong action before suicide becomes a social malady. Sakibul IslamStudent of Department of Social WorkJagannath University, Dhaka [email\u00a0protected]",
