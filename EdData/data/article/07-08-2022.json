The Government has averred that a new draft will be in sync with the principles of privacy, in line with Supreme Court guidelines based on the landmark judgment on privacy, i.e., Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India, and would consider the Joint Committee of Parliament\u2019s recommendations on the framework to regulate the digital ecosystem. The 2019 Bill had been rightly criticised by stakeholders, including Justice B.N. Srikrishna \u2014 he chaired a committee of experts that had authored a draft bill in 2018 \u2014 for overemphasising the national security angle, among other reasons. The 2019 Bill diverged from the Srikrishna Committee Draft in the selection of the chairperson and members of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) that shall protect the interests of data principals, and in the leeway given to the Union government to exempt its agencies from the application of the Act. The 2018 draft Bill allowed for judicial oversight in the selection process for the DPA, while the 2019 Bill limited the composition to the executive. The 2018 Bill allowed for exemptions to be granted to state institutions from acquiring informed consent from data principals or to process data in the case of matters relating only to the \u201csecurity of the state\u201d; it also called for a law to provide for \u201cparliamentary oversight and judicial approval of non-consensual access to personal data\u201d. In contrast, the 2019 Bill added \u201cpublic order\u201d as a reason to exempt a government agency from the Act, besides only providing for these reasons to be recorded in writing.By choosing to withdraw the Bill, it is unclear whether the Government would address the demand for a realignment of the legislation with the 2018 draft Bill that came about after extensive consultations with civil society. Or whether this would be more in line with the JPC report, which has also been criticised by civil society for retaining provisions that allow the Government access to private data of citizens without sufficient safeguards. Dissent notes to the JPC report, by Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for example, went on to criticise the leeway granted to the Government on exemptions and how the ground of \u201cpublic order\u201d and not \u201csecurity of the state\u201d was liable for misuse. It is not clear if the Bill\u2019s withdrawal is linked to opposition to mandatory \u201cdata localisation\u201d from multinational Internet companies. Meanwhile, the lack of a proper data protection law in the country is an anomaly when compared with major countries. If the Government is indeed committed to a comprehensive legal framework on data privacy and protection, it must revert to the baseline provided in the Justice Srikrishna Committee recommendations and enact a law within a reasonable timeline.",

The 2015 Paris Agreement requires countries to spell out a pathway to ensure the globe does not heat beyond 2\u00b0C, and endeavour to keep it below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100. The subsequent COPs are a quibbling arena where countries coax, cajole and make compromises on the cuts they can undertake over multi-decadal timelines with the least impact on their developmental priorities. While the end product of the COP is a joint agreement, signed by all member countries, the real business begins after, where countries must submit NDCs every five years, mapping what will be done post 2020 to stem fossil-fuel emissions. India\u2019s first NDC, in 2015, specified eight targets, the most salient of them being reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 33%-35% (of 2005 levels) by 2030, having 40% of its installed electricity capacity sourced from renewable energy, and creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through forest and tree cover by 2030. Being a large, populous country, India has high net emissions but low per-capita emissions. It has also, by participating in COPs for decades, made the case that the existing climate crisis is largely due to industrialisation by the U.S. and developed European countries since 1850. However, years of negotiations, international pressure and clearer evidence of the multi-dimensional impact from climate change have seen India agree to move away from fossil fuels over time.At COP 26 in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid out five commitments, or \u2018Panchamrit\u2019, as the Government references it, which included India increasing its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and achieving \u201cNet Zero\u201d by 2070, or no net carbon dioxide emitted from energy sources. However, the press statement on the Cabinet decision was silent on whether India would cut emissions by a billion tons and on creating carbon sinks. While India is within its right to specify its emissions pathway, it should not \u2014 at any forum \u2014 promise more than what it can deliver as this undermines the moral authority that India brings to future negotiations. India has expressed its intent, via several legislations, to use energy efficiently and many of its biggest corporations have committed to shifting away from polluting energy sources. Going ahead, these should be grounds for India, at its pace, to be an exemplar for balancing energy use, development and meeting climate goals.",

        "full_article": "The first nudist colony in the world was reportedly based in Thane in 1891. At The Fellowship of the Naked Trust, clothes were not allowed, though you were kindly permitted to wear your eyeglasses and dentures. I suppose, after seeing all the dangling bits clearly, they expected you to bite your tongue if it wasn\u2019t pleasing to the eye.\nFollowing in these bare footsteps, our latest nudist has caused an entire nation to put on their glasses to carefully examine his muscular frame.\nRanveer Singh\u2019s nude photographs have been the subject of an FIR and television debates. It has been turned into a meme with captions like, \u2018This is what happens after you buy a flat in Mumbai\u2019. There is even a musical parody floating around with the stellar lyrics, \u2018We can see his bum.\u2019\nHis bottom has infiltrated the zeitgeist to such an extent that when I was signing bank papers, and the official repeatedly stated, \u2018Ma\u2019am, please sign on backside also.\u2019 I was tempted to say, \u2018Yours or Ranveer Singh\u2019s?\u2019 before better sense prevailed.\nWhile parodies and memes are justifiable, the outrage and police complaints are bewildering reactions to a rather demure series of au naturel portraits. Ironically, a few months ago, a Man Ray print at $12.4 million tripled the record for the most expensive photograph sold at an auction. It featured a female nude who also had her posterior on display.\n\nThe role of gender in this equation cannot be disregarded.\nIf a man crossing the street sees a disrobed woman, he will immediately come to a halt. A woman seeing a winsome man in the buff will avert her eyes and quicken her steps. Conditioning socking biology in the gonads. A nude woman is an object of desire. A nude man signals danger.Queen Victoria seems to have agreed with this perspective. After a museum visit, she ordered a fig leaf to be placed strategically over a replica of the most famous nude in history, Michelangelo\u2019s David. There was no cover up demanded for Venus de Milo and the Aphrodite of Knidos. They just had to continue grinning and baring it, much like their living, breathing counterparts across all forms of art. Especially cinema. A study by the Geena Davis Institute found that women movie leads were four times more likely to be shown naked than their male counterparts.\nAn uncovered woman is a desirable commodity. A disrobed man, on the other hand, should not be seen or heard.\nMy mother-in-law would have probably aligned with this latter sentiment. A few years ago, Pommi bua, who still can\u2019t tell the difference between an audio and a video call, swung open the bathroom door and passed the phone to her 72-year-old husband while he was reaching for a towel.\n\u2018Mohan ji take this, Didi is calling from Bombay to wish you happy birthday!\u2019 At which point my mother-in-law promptly hung up, as she had more than her fill of Mohan ji looking resplendent in his wrinkled but squeaky-clean birthday suit.\nIn her study on reactions to nudes, Beth A. Eck of James Madison University found that an image of an unclothed woman makes the heterosexual male feel more masculine. Women see the images and consider it aspirational. On the flip side, women looking at pictures of naked men feel nervous and uncomfortable. For heterosexual males, looking at naked men made them worry about their perceived heterosexuality.\nWhen I ask my friends about Ranveer\u2019s photographs, it follows a similar pattern. There are embarrassed giggles and aversion of eyes from my girlfriends, and their answers fall roughly within the framework of, \u2018It\u2019s not like I kept staring or found it hot or anything. But there is nothing wrong with it.\u2019\nThe straight men, instead of responding to how they felt on seeing the photographs, began giving me a lesson on fitness. One adds, \u2018Arre, he should do more leg days.\u2019\nEnlarging Ranveer\u2019s pictures on my screen and mumbling when my son walks in that it was for purely research purposes, I see nothing beyond a man devoid of clothing. Unlike meeting him in person, where he usually seems like a basketball filled with kinetic energy, bouncing off generous compliments and kisses on blushing cheeks, in these pictures he was not projecting any constructs. Not even sexuality, with a subtle and maybe sock-stuffed hint of well endowment.\nHowever, as a performance, I would consider it one of his greatest. Instead of putting on layers, he discarded them all.\nIn \u2018Ways of Seeing\u2019, John Berger says, \u2018To be on display is to have the surface of one\u2019s own skin, the hairs of one\u2019s own body, turned into a disguise which, in that situation, can never be discarded. The nude is condemned to never being naked. Nudity is a form of dress.\u2019\nI suppose Singh\u2019s lawyer can use this in his argument, \u2018Milord, I object. He was dressed, you just can\u2019t see beyond his nudity.\u2019\nVidya Balan, who has been both the target of an obscenity case, and objectification like most actresses, said it best. When asked about her reaction to Singh\u2019s photographs, she quipped, \u2018What\u2019s the problem? Let us also feast our eyes!\u2019\nI can assure the morally offended that while we are not advocating starting our own Fellowship of The Naked Trust, a thumping majority of women and the queer community are not bummed out by these photographs. In fact, we have only one complaint. Instead of over-exposure, the photographs seem under-exposed. Even with spectacles, magnifying glasses and zoom tools, we are unable to spot any anatomical details, just a pool of shadows between two finely muscled legs.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Ranveer Singh\u2019s bold photo\u2019s sparked off a series of predictable and unremarkable reactions. Whether photos are sexy, sensual or sexually expressive and whether they are naked or semi-naked, they will trigger the ire of people who have been conditioned to react in defined ways. In India, sex is a million-volt topic. You are made to feel ashamed if you have sexual fantasies, embarrassed to have sexual feelings towards someone, guilty to indulge in pre-marital sex, depraved if you love having sex, \u201cdirty\u201d if you\u2019re open to sexual experimentation beyond missionary position and weird if you have any sexual preference apart from being heterosexual. If you choose to wear sexy clothes or pose sexily, it\u2019s seen as immoral.\nEven talking about sexual needs, foreplay and orgasms is considered embarrassing and unnecessary. Sex is the most natural experience. You\u2019re on this planet because your parents had sex. If you weren\u2019t meant to enjoy it, God wouldn\u2019t have designed the human body to receive pleasure. The lack of sex in marriages leads to extra-marital affairs, bad sex can lead to a relationship\u2019s demise. Sweeping issues under the carpet isn\u2019t an answer or long-term solution to healthy relationships. Talking about sex and sexual needs is essential. Men orgasm quicker than women but because it\u2019s not a topic to be discussed, a wife feels like a harlot for asking for an orgasm, and frees the husbands from the need or responsibility to give their wives one. Not being open about sexuality isn\u2019t a means to protect society. It\u2019s reflective of either patriarchy or religion-imposed morality. From an era of courtesans, multiple wives, brothels, men being \u201cstuds\u201d for bedding multiple women and women being \u201csluts\u201d for sleeping with multiple men, we are still stuck with a mindset that is permissive and even glorifies the sexual needs of men whilst frowning at women for the same. Men can go to dance bars, but how would women in India be perceived if they went to a male dance bar? Photos of semi-naked women abound in magazines and they were acceptable. But if men pose provocatively and women swoon it\u2019s a media storm. The irony is the same country will revere a Naga baba who walks around stark naked with his genitalia on full display and give him respect and money. The same country has pornography sculpted on it\u2019s temples walls, like Khajuraho. The same country is the origin of the world\u2019s greatest sexual bible, the Kamasutra. Erotica and nudity is very much Indian culture and we must come to terms with the fact that sex, sexuality, sexual needs and sensuality are normal expression. The law must recognise and protect an evolving moral compass because it\u2019s important for societal wellness to break out of prejudice, hypocrisy, control and narrow-mindedness. The same platform on social media shows a naked Kardashian and a Ranveer Singh. Nudity abounds on that platform. Why do \u201cmoral police\u201d target just Ranveer? Asking the right questions about sex and sexuality can only empower a society suffering the control and the moral standards of those who are self-serving and conditioned to upholding an antiquated fearful, regressive, agenda driven response.\nMy 19-year-old daughter has always been extremely shy and\nobedient, but recently I noticed that she isn\u2019t generous when it comes to giving away her things that could be useful to others. She tends to be miserly when it comes to giving to those in need or even about giving away things that she doesn\u2019t need. I don\u2019t want to criticise and put her down by pointing out her as she is very shy and sensitive. How should I deal with this situation?\nYou need to understand the root cause of her need to hoard. Small incidents that seem inconsequential to adults can be become a source of deep programming for children. Start by slowly giving away your own stuff and without making it obvious, make her a party to how wonderful the benefits are to the people who receive and the sheer happiness they experienced. Perhaps over time, chat about the concept of good karma and angels who exist in the form of humans. Try not to make your agenda obvious and if after a few months it still hasn\u2019t taken root, to perhaps sit with her and gently dig to understand why she would hold onto what she doesn\u2019t need to get deeper answers.\nI have always been a bit overweight, and my friends have always\npulled my leg for it. Recently, I met a guy who is extremely\ngood-looking and is super fit. He says he is interested in me, but I find it difficult to believe that someone so good-looking could be serious about dating me. I am 30 years old and not really in a space where I want to date casually. While I am tempted to give it a shot, I don\u2019t want my heart broken. What should I do?\nAll relationships aren\u2019t about giving your heart and for it to be a forever. Ask him what he likes that got his interest. What you first need to work on are self-worth issues and why your embarrassment about body weight overshadows all the amazing qualities and plus points you possess to make a great companion, lover, girlfriend or wife. And remember, relationships between two skinny people don\u2019t work out either. It\u2019s about what is shared and respectful that leads to lasting relationships. Great if he\u2019s into fitness, working out together can become an agenda that takes you from strength to strength.\nI am a female college student from a conservative Maharashtrian family. I have known this girl (my classmate) for the last couple of years. She is a nice friend but of late I have felt a different vibe from her. I think she is attracted to me. She has never come out about her sexual orientation and since I am not sure I cannot ask her outright, especially because I feel she is in love with me. I am straight but I love her as a friend and do not want to hurt her. What should I do?\nStart a conversation about the most amazing romantic moments in different films that triggered an \u201cI want that for myself\u201d moment. Let the conversation steer to the different kinds of love; like for family, pets, kids, friends \u2026 But how only a man can make that part of your heart beat with \u201cromantic love\u201d and then discuss the masculine qualities you are attracted to and look for in a man. If she has an agenda, it will stay with her, and either way, enjoy the friendship you share. If she makes you uncomfortable, you are always entitled to start maintaining a distance that gradually grows each week.\n\n",

Gukesh now has 8/8 wins, probably unsurpassed in Chess Olympiad. He has now likely crashed into the world Top 20 and is likely behind only Vishy Anand in India rankings, going past P. Harikrishna and Vidit Gujarathi.\nThe top-ranked US team has the world # 5 (Caruana), 6 (Levon Aronian) and 7 (Wesley So), but it was brought down by India\u2019s B team (as host India is fielding three teams) which has three 16 year olds (Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Raunak Sadhwani) and an 18 year old (Nihal Sarin). Pragg and Nihal drew their games against Aronian and So, and Sadhwani took down Dominguez. Each American was ranked higher than his Indian opponent. This is a stunning result.\nGukesh incidentally is the second youngest GM in chess history, becoming one at 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days \u2014 missing beating the record held by Russia\u2019s Sergey Karjakin by 17 days.

        "full_article": "We're alarmed by the government's decision to increase fuel prices by up to 51.7 percent, the highest such increase in the country's history. At a time when people are already undergoing tremendous hardship because of sky-high food prices and galloping inflation, this will make life much more difficult for them. As per the new price chart that came into effect on August 6, each litre of octane now costs Tk 135 \u2013 an increase of 51.7 percent or Tk 46 from the prevrious rate of Tk 89. Each litre of petrol costs Tk 130 \u2013 an increase of 51.1 percent or Tk 44 from the prevrious rate of Tk 86. Meanwhile, the prices of diesel and kerosene reached Tk 114 per litre from Tk 80.\nOfficially, the reason cited for this extraordinary move is \"price adjustment\", which the government was \"forced to do\" since fuel prices in the international market were a lot higher than that in Bangladesh. A vague reference was also made to the threat of oil smuggling because of lower prices in the country. Unofficially, though, it has been suggested that this will help fulfil a key condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from which Bangladesh is seeking a USD 4.5 billion loan or \"bailout\", as some experts called it, amid the ongoing economic crisis. The IMF loan is apparently contingent upon, among other conditions, the withdrawal of subsidies from the energy sector.\nWhatever the reason, however, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, the government has struck an unbearable blow even though, mere hours before the announcement, the state minister for power and energy had hinted at a \"reasonable\" and \"bearable\" level of price increase. In recent times, the government has expressed increasing reluctance to bear subsidies in different sectors. In November 2021, it hiked diesel and kerosene prices from Tk 65 to Tk 80 per litre \u2013 which, however, led to a 27 percent increase in bus fares, and a 35 percent increase in launch fares. On June 5, wholesale gas prices were increased by nearly 23 percent. Last week, prices of urea fertiliser were hiked by 37.5 percent, in a blow to farmers, many of whom suffered losses from recurring floods and low crop yields. Prices of water, electricity and gas are likely to rise further soon.\nUsually, when the government talks about the burden of subsidies, somehow it is always shifted onto ordinary consumers, as if it is their fault, even though the pressure can be largely offset by saving money wasted in corruption, mismanagement, \"system loss\" and ill-planned projects. The latest price hikes also make little sense because international fuel prices are currently on the decrease, a trend that experts say will continue. Why, then, would the government take this anti-people move? It will no doubt cause further inflation, shooting up already-high transport fares, prices of essentials, and production costs. People will have to further tighten their belts. And the pain that all this will cause is indescribable.\nWe urge the government to reconsider its decision and follow the suggestions of experts to undertake pro-people deficit adjustment reforms.\n",

        "full_article": "It is very difficult to find any logic behind the government's sudden decision to hike fuel prices, especially since global oil prices are starting to come down - this week, US oil prices fell below USD 90 per barrel, from USD 120 just two months ago. The government justified its decision by referring to previous global price hikes, as a result of which Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) incurred losses amounting to around Tk 8,000 crore. However, it should be remembered that when the price of oil was globally low in the past, prices in Bangladesh were not reduced. At the time, the government saved a sizeable fund from profits earned - around Tk 47,000 crore over a few years. Why, then, did the government not adjust this gap with the funds it has saved up from previous profits, which exists only because the people paid more than what was necessary for the fuel they used?\nWhether IMF conditionality is a reason behind this rise in prices is not something we can confirm with any certainty, but it is certainly a possibility. Whenever the IMF gives loans to countries, it almost always comes with some common conditions and a certain style of crisis management. The same straitjacket is fitted onto every country. One of the main aspects of this is an increase in the prices of utilities such as gas, electricity, oil, water, and sometimes even education and healthcare, regardless of how important the reasons are for the government to invest in these sectors, or how much of an impact price hikes might have on ordinary people. These conditionalities are imposed in the name of getting rid of fiscal deficits, but the objective is to protect different global, capitalist interests. So it is not illogical to speculate that the Bangladesh government is taking this dangerous decision due to pressure from the IMF.\nBefore raising prices as a reaction to global changes, one must think of the consequences. In a country where inflation is already high and the prices of essentials are soaring, high oil prices are guaranteed to have a knock-on effect on almost all other goods, as well as transport costs and rent. Ordinary people have already reduced consumption, and their debts have started to pile up. Keeping this context in mind, there are a number of alternative paths the government could have chosen.\nOne was to use the profit the government received when they were importing oil at low prices and selling it to the people at high prices. Another alternative would have been to simply lift the duty levied on imported oil, which would have reduced prices. Also, last week, the PM shared the information that we have sufficient stock of octane and petrol in Bangladesh as by-products of gas extraction. If this is the case, then why should the volatility of the global market have any impact on us? Given that there are zero production costs when it comes to by-products, why are prices not falling instead? There are a lot of inconsistencies for which the people deserve answers.\nAs a long-term policy, Bangladesh also had the option of safe and cheap gas exploration for greater energy sovereignty. The deal with the American multinational corporation ConocoPhillips is an example of the state of this sector. In 2009, we objected to a contract for gas exploration and production with ConocoPhillips because it held provisions for export. We argued that we should reserve the gas extracted for our own needs, but the government argued that the need to extract gas was so urgent that no consideration could put a stop to it. Our protests were dispersed, often with violence, the contract went ahead, and ConocoPhillips' share value went up. They went on to give a sub-contract to another company, which after a while changed their minds and left. And in the last 13 years, that gas has remained unexplored.\nAt the time, the alternative model we suggested was a bit like the Padma Bridge one. We could work with foreign companies in the fields where we have limited expertise, but we opposed any contracts that would give them authority or ownership over our resources. We wanted to build our own national capacity, not only in terms of gas extraction, but also in terms of tapping into renewable energy sources. I believe if the government had gone down that route, then the situation in Bangladesh would be completely different right now. Instead, the government played into the hands of interest groups in favour of importing LNG, and our focus also shifted towards coal and nuclear energy. The country became dependant on imports, foreign loans and foreign companies for our energy needs, creating an unsustainable system that not only made us vulnerable but ultimately contributed to environmental destruction as well.\nWhat happened in Sri Lanka is a warning for us. There are certain similarities between our two countries, such as taking on mega-projects without due process, loan dependency, lack of transparency in decision-making processes, monopolisation by a few groups, a lack of accountability, etc. Bangladesh's main advantages are high remittance and export earnings, which are keeping us afloat despite capital flight and widespread corruption. However, policymakers are continually failing to deal with the root causes of the crisis that we are now being faced with.\nIt is dangerous to be so dependant on imports when there is such high pressure on foreign exchange reserves. But what created this pressure in the first place? Capital flight, or the laundering of money abroad by influential persons, now stands at around Tk 70,000-80,000 crore, according to international estimates, although some independent analysis suggests the amount could be twice as much. Stopping or at least controlling it should have been a priority for us. Yet, in the last budget proposal, the finance minister gave a green signal to these money launderers by making a provision for legalising money laundered out of Bangladesh in exchange for only 7-15 percent tax. High-cost imports for mega-projects are also putting pressure on forex reserves. In this scenario, stopping unnecessary imports, controlling unsustainable mega-projects that operate without transparency, and controlling capital flight should be the government's main priorities.\nIf the government takes the IMF loan and continue in this vein, the crisis we are facing will not be resolved. Without a solution to corruption and excess and with growing privation and commercialisation, it is the people of this country who will bear the brunt of the government's wrong choices. The negative impacts will be potent for the country's huge majority including informal workers, many of whom fell further into poverty during the pandemic. This vast and extremely vulnerable population will be forced to cut household costs, which will then go on to have wider impacts on nutrition, education and health, especially for women and children. Ultimately, the government's irresponsible, illogical and unkind decision to raise fuel prices will harm people in every section of society and ultimately injure economic productivity as well.\nAnu Muhammad is a professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University.

        "full_article": "We're concerned to learn about the amount of debt taken by Dhaka and Chattogram Wasa over the last one decade to fund projects meant to improve their overall service. According to Prothom Alo, while Dhaka Wasa has taken up seven such projects taking Tk 21,000 crore as foreign loan, Chattogram Wasa has undertaken four projects with foreign loan amounting to Tk 6,288 crore. Although some of the projects have been completed by now, their effect has been mostly limited thanks to mismanagement and poor planning. Experts fear that even the projects that are now underway are also unlikely to bear much fruit.\nMeanwhile, both the Wasa administrations are repeatedly raising water tariffs despite their generally poor services. Dhaka Wasa, for example, has increased its water tariff a total of 15 times since 2009.\nThe question is, why are they burdening consumers with increased water tariffs, and also putting pressure on our economy by taking up these big projects, if they cannot deliver expected results? Take Dhaka Wasa's Padma-Jashaldia Water Treatment Plant (phase-1) project, which was completed three years ago. The Tk-3,670-crore undertaking was meant to ensure better water supply to some parts of the capital. But one-third of the plant's production capacity reportedly remains unused, due to a lack of pipelines. Now, Dhaka Wasa wants to take up another project to solve this problem!\nThe condition of other ongoing projects is also not much different, as many have had their deadlines extended several times while their costs also escalated over the last few years. One of them is the Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply project, launched in October 2013, which is still incomplete. Since all these projects have been implemented or are under development with foreign debt, the Wasa authorities are required to pay off loans in big installments. Reportedly, in the FY 2021-22, Dhaka Wasa's annual loan installment amount was Tk 400 crore, and it will increase further in the coming years. The question is, can they burden the consumers with increased water tariffs to pay off loans? Definitely not.\nBoth Dhaka and Chattogram Wasa have taken up such projects despite them not being realistic or sustainable from an economic point of view. They should be held accountable for their inefficiency and failures. The two institutions must stop increasing water tariffs to make up for their own mismanagement, and find a way to repay loans based on discussions with all the stakeholders.\n",

Or, went to the NRB Commercial Bank branch to pay your road tax only to be told to come back another day since the server is not working?\nIn this age of digitalisation, there are many advantages of this transition to the brave new world but it also comes with a few thorns. If there is load shedding in your area, or you have a bad internet connection, the challenges of carrying out simple transactions sometimes become a burden.\nIn Bangladesh, the recently published preliminary report of the Population and Housing Census 2022 indicates that around three crore people over the age of 18 do not own a mobile phone, while 6.5 crore people from the same group do not use the internet. As a result, it is easy to see that all people are not fully benefiting from the push toward \"Digital Bangladesh\". According to an editorial in The Daily Star (July 31, 2022), the frequency of lack of server access, poor user-friendliness of the apps and system, and slow internet speeds have created headaches for those who are seeking to use the 761 digitalised government services that are nominally available.\nA research survey conducted to gauge the impact of Union Digital Center (UDC) in Companiganj Upazila of Sylhet found that the availability of electricity is a big problem in the upazila. The households can't use their computer or mobile when they need to use them because of load shedding. To quote, the \"research survey also found the internet speed problem. They are still using mobile networks. Some people were satisfied with the mobile network, but some said their internet services are not good. There aren't high-speed connections in the study area like broadband connections. Some people complain that they face long internet loading times when they need to receive the services. It makes them bored. And internet costs are high.\"\nHere I must mention though that some of the issues that we find in the rural areas of Sylhet can also raise its head in the USA. Server down, poor network speed, and denial of service (DOS) are still a headache in many urban areas of developed countries, not to speak of in remote regions. Add to that the perennial problem of the \"digital divide\" where only the privileged can have broadband access or a 5G network. On top of that, we all know about how network failures or system downtimes due to performance issues can make life difficult for those who have to rely on 24/7 service: air traffic control, transportation, healthcare, or banking.\nLet us take another extreme but a real-life situation. Imagine a scenario where all transactions are done using digital currency. In this world, you don't need to carry any cash to buy goods nor can you use cash to purchase your everyday needs. In fact, today you can use Bkash, Venmo or many other varieties of digital payment methods/apps to buy and sell. And then one day, when you go to the store to buy your daily groceries, you realise that the checkout counter only accepts cash. There is a big sign which insists, \"Cash only, no credit cards accepted.\" And readers, believe me, this is what I have occasionally faced at my local grocery stores!\nIn Bangladesh, the trend toward digitalisation has provided a pathway to deliver useful government information and various government services to users by using the internet and mobile technologies and enabled us to overcome weak physical infrastructure barriers and to increase accountability throughout the system. However, I have also heard that in many government offices, the online system is frequently out of order, and \"the server is down\" has become a much-dreaded sign. Clients who want to pay their electric bills or road taxes are turned away due to power outages, no connectivity, or other technical issues. What does that mean? The impact can be profound or temporary. However, these failures also provide the unscrupulous middleman or corrupt officials an opportunity to make a quick buck. I have written frequently about this issue and everyone is familiar with the increased \"cost of transaction\". A birth certificate, road license, NID, or other documents become a major expense for those who do not have the skills, training, or street smarts to beat the \"digital\" system.\nSo, what is the solution? There are very well-known and time-tested principles that need to be built in to create a computer system that is dependable, and stays operational even during power failures. Similarly, system designers need to prioritise dependability and use metrics to track both the availability and reliability of service.\nFault-tolerant systems use backup components that automatically take the place of failed components, ensuring no loss of service. These include:\na) Hardware systems that are backed up by identical or equivalent systems. For example, a server can be made fault tolerant by using an identical server running in parallel, with all operations mirrored to the backup server.\nb) Software systems that are backed up by other software instances. For example, a database with customer information can be continuously replicated to another machine. If the primary database goes down, operations can be automatically redirected to the second database.\nc) Power sources that are made fault tolerant using alternative sources. For example, many organisations have power generators that can take over in case mainline electricity fails.\nIn a similar fashion, any system or component which is a single point of failure can be made fault tolerant using redundancy.\nSome important considerations when creating fault tolerant and high availability systems in an organisational setting include zero downtime, i.e., a highly available system has a minimal allowed level of service interruption. For example, a system with \"five nines\" (i.e., 99.999) availability is down for approximately 5 minutes per year. A fault-tolerant system is expected to work continuously with no acceptable service interruption.\nThe appropriate solution to create a fault tolerant system often requires careful planning, understanding of how elements fail and the impact of surrounding elements of the failure. Redundancy or a set of alternative means can ensure that there are no catastrophic failures.\nA very interesting analogy is the case of a failure in an aircraft and an automobile. In the case of an airborne aircraft, there is no room for a failure that brings down the aircraft. On the other hand, in the case of a car which has a flat tire, the car's operating system can be designed to limp along until the tire can be replaced.\nDr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company.

        "full_article": "We're alarmed by the government's decision to increase fuel prices by up to 51.7 percent, the highest such increase in the country's history. At a time when people are already undergoing tremendous hardship because of sky-high food prices and galloping inflation, this will make life much more difficult for them. As per the new price chart that came into effect on August 6, each litre of octane now costs Tk 135 \u2013 an increase of 51.7 percent or Tk 46 from the prevrious rate of Tk 89. Each litre of petrol costs Tk 130 \u2013 an increase of 51.1 percent or Tk 44 from the prevrious rate of Tk 86. Meanwhile, the prices of diesel and kerosene reached Tk 114 per litre from Tk 80.\nOfficially, the reason cited for this extraordinary move is \"price adjustment\", which the government was \"forced to do\" since fuel prices in the international market were a lot higher than that in Bangladesh. A vague reference was also made to the threat of oil smuggling because of lower prices in the country. Unofficially, though, it has been suggested that this will help fulfil a key condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from which Bangladesh is seeking a USD 4.5 billion loan or \"bailout\", as some experts called it, amid the ongoing economic crisis. The IMF loan is apparently contingent upon, among other conditions, the withdrawal of subsidies from the energy sector.\nWhatever the reason, however, from the point of view of ordinary citizens, the government has struck an unbearable blow even though, mere hours before the announcement, the state minister for power and energy had hinted at a \"reasonable\" and \"bearable\" level of price increase. In recent times, the government has expressed increasing reluctance to bear subsidies in different sectors. In November 2021, it hiked diesel and kerosene prices from Tk 65 to Tk 80 per litre \u2013 which, however, led to a 27 percent increase in bus fares, and a 35 percent increase in launch fares. On June 5, wholesale gas prices were increased by nearly 23 percent. Last week, prices of urea fertiliser were hiked by 37.5 percent, in a blow to farmers, many of whom suffered losses from recurring floods and low crop yields. Prices of water, electricity and gas are likely to rise further soon.\nUsually, when the government talks about the burden of subsidies, somehow it is always shifted onto ordinary consumers, as if it is their fault, even though the pressure can be largely offset by saving money wasted in corruption, mismanagement, \"system loss\" and ill-planned projects. The latest price hikes also make little sense because international fuel prices are currently on the decrease, a trend that experts say will continue. Why, then, would the government take this anti-people move? It will no doubt cause further inflation, shooting up already-high transport fares, prices of essentials, and production costs. People will have to further tighten their belts. And the pain that all this will cause is indescribable.\nWe urge the government to reconsider its decision and follow the suggestions of experts to undertake pro-people deficit adjustment reforms.\n",

        "full_article": "The record hike in fuel oil prices, made effective from Friday midnight, has come as a severe jolt. Earlier on the same day, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources hinted at raising the fuel oils, power and gas prices. But none expected the prices to be set at such high levels. Most people are worried about the fallout. Even laypeople understand the implications of such an enormous increase in fuel prices on the overall price situation. Already hard-pressed by the soaring cost of most essentials, the people are now bracing for yet another bout of price increases. The government had raised the prices of diesel and kerosene in November last and spared other petroleum products. This time, only furnace oil, used in bulk for power generation, could escape the net. The government should know that the latest hike in fuel prices would not go well with the people. But the ground realities must have compelled it to go for such an unpopular move. The volatile international fuel oil market is one reason. The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), reportedly, has been counting huge losses in recent months because of the large gap between the cost of procurement of petroleum products and their selling prices. Unofficial sources, however, point to the government's recent approach to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for $4.5 billion in financial support behind the latest hike in fuel oils and fertilizer prices. The IMF reportedly has asked the government to execute several measures to be eligible for receiving the help. One measure is the reduction of subsidies on fuel oils. The government, it seems, is left with no option other than swallowing the 'bitter' pill, which, however, would help narrow the budget deficit in a difficult time. Yet the negative impact of the hike in fuel oil prices by such a big margin on industrial and agricultural production will be enormous. The hike in power rates, seemingly, is also not far away. Because of the higher cost of production, the export sector will lose its competitive edge. The country now needs more than ever higher export receipts to help compensate for the soaring cost of imports. Equally important is the cost of production in the agricultural sector. The price of urea fertilizer has already been enhanced. The latest diesel price will only add to the woes of the farmers who are busy transplanting Aman seedlings. Rice is now costlier than ever. Even import of the main staple at reduced duty has left no impact on the market. The higher cost of production will inevitably lead to a further rise in cereal prices. Last but not the least, the transport sector will encounter big problems due to hike in fares, an obvious outcome of the increase in diesel price. This time, the transport owners would demand a hike that was never seen before. If that happens, commuters will be in a soup. The government will have to show a very high level of efficiency in handling the situation that is likely to emerge following the increase in fuel prices.",

        "full_article": "Over the years, steps have been taken by the government to turn Bangladesh's sluggish debt market vibrant. Nevertheless, it all proved insufficient to achieve the end. Converting the non-tradable fixed-income government securities into tradable ones may be an option now. It is to be noted that debt market is popularly known as bond market and sometimes called fixed-income securities market or credit market. On this market, investors buy and sell all kinds of debt securities, mostly in the form of bond. Government usually issues bonds in order to raise money to repay debts and fund development projects. This is also known as deficit financing. Private firms issue corporate bonds to finance business- expansion projects and maintain ongoing operations. Currently, two types of fixed- income government securities are available on the market. One is tradable, while the other is non-tradable. National savings certificates along with prize bonds, Sanchayabonds (The US Dollar Premium Bond, US Dollar Investment Bond, and Wage Earner Development Bond) and Special-Purpose Treasury Bonds are non-tradable on the secondary market. Notably, Sanchayabonds are available for non-resident Bangladeshi investors only. Tradable securities are treasury bills, which are short-term debt instruments of the government, and treasury bonds, which are long-term ones. Statistics available with Bangladesh Bank show that the combined value of annual secondary transactions of these short-and long-term government fixed-income securities came to Tk 2077.88 billion (or Tk 2.07 trillion) in FY22 which was 1377.70 billion (or Tk 1.37 trillion) in FY21. Thus, the secondary trading of treasury bills and treasury bonds jumped by around 50.82 per cent in the last fiscal year over the previous fiscal year. Earlier in FY20, the annual transactions of the tradable government debt securities on the secondary market were recorded at Tk 594.77 billion against Tk 183.10 billion in FY19. The gradual increase in the secondary transactions of treasury bills and bonds indicates that there is a growing demand for secure and risk-free investment tools. Nevertheless, the secondary transactions of these bills and bonds are confined mostly to institutional investors. Bangladesh Bank introduced the secondary trading of these securities through a market-infrastructure module within the interbank ecosystem which allows some banks and financial institutions to participate. Select banks are now authorised primary dealers (PD) to purchase the bills directly through auction conducted by the central bank. Other banks and financial institutions are allowed to purchase and sell the bills and bonds among themselves on the secondary market as a secure investment. Individuals can also invest in these fixed-income securities through PDs. To provide an opportunity to the individual investors, there is a move for trading in treasury bonds on the stock exchanges. Though over 250 treasury bonds are listed with the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DES), secondary trading in any bond did never take place. The date of starting trade in treasury bonds is yet to be finalised. There is also a lack of proper communication from the regulator regarding the mode of trading. Besides the treasury bills and bonds, it is also time to bring the non-tradable fixed- income government securities in the secondary market. Like the treasury bills and bonds, the government needs to allow the savings certificates to be tradable on the market initially by using the central bank's existing platform. Later, savings certificates should be listed with the stock exchanges so that individual investors can buy and sell these fixed- income securities freely. Making the savings certificates tradable on the market will also help the government to reduce the interest burden as the market will ultimately determine the returns on investment. Currently, yields or profit rates on the savings certificates are artificially high. For instance, annual weighted average yield of 5-year treasury bond was 7.80 per cent at the end of June this year. At the same time, 5-year Bangladesh Sanchaypartra offers 9.35-percent profit at the end of first year while the rate rises to 11.28 per cent at maturity on completion of the five-year tenure.  The government, however, introduced a slab system offering different profit rates on investment in these securities. For example, if the cumulative investment on 5-year Bangladesh Sanchaypartra goes above Tk 15 million, the annual rate will be 8.58 per cent and if the invested amount goes above Tk 30 million, the profit rate at the end of first year will be 7.71 per cent. The reduced rates on higher investment in savings certificates indicate that there is a slow move to make the yields market-oriented gradually.  Though savings certificate is considered a shield against inflation for fixed-income people due to its higher rate of returns, it is higher-income people who are reaping the benefit by purchasing the fixed-income non-tradable government securities. The net result is big accumulation of government's repayment liabilities. In the fiscal year 2020-21, outstanding amount of the savings certificates reached 11.20 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). In the same fiscal year, outstanding amount of the government tradable securities was 10.34 per cent of GDP while the ratio of external public debt to GDP was 16.30 per cent. Statistics available with Bangladesh Bank also revealed that the outstanding domestic public debt from the banking sectors through treasury bills and bonds in proportion to the savings certificates declined steadily from FY13 to FY18. In the later years, the ratio started to be reverse, and in FY21, outstanding savings certificates were 52 per cent of the government borrowing against 48 per cent of the tradable securities.  Once the savings certificates are tradable on the secondary market, it will help to turn the country's debt market deep and vibrant. Government may initiate a study to find the pros and cons of making these securities tradable.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Many sympathising people feel puzzled over the fate of the newborns, thosewho lose their mothers immediately after their birth. In most of the cases, the mothers and the babies are victims of various types of road accidents. The mothers die leaving their babies in a strange world; mostly at the mercy of people who nurture at least a semblance of kindness for the unknown children. In general, these newborns remain deprived of the love of their 'fugitive' fathers.In some recent cases, kindhearted strangers have been found taking these orphaned children into their care. The child which has lost its mother as they met a road accident in the capital is kept in a hospital's children's ward. The hospital's nurses arrange milk for the baby. In a recent case, after a few days, there was none found nearby to take the responsibility of the baby. Finally, a childless mother unofficially adopted the orphaned the baby. In this vast city, dozens of underage children get lost every day. Besides, many of them are left in the streets at the mercy of destiny. Finding the trace of a safe 'shelter house' thus makes many feel uplifted. Located at Azimpur in the heart of the city, a government-run shelter is said to be an ideal abode for the tiny tots aged between 'one month and seven years'. These babies have been enrolled on the facility upon being located as 'lost' or 'abandoned'. According to a report in a print media outlet, the shelter has seven branches across the country. It is said to provide the babies with all the needs required for their proper physical and mental growth. Twenty-six staffers are said to be working for the shelter for carrying out various jobs. The orphaned infants' shelter carries elements of surprise and curiosity for many. Lots of people living in the Azimpur area since the early 1960s have expressed their utter surprise at the 60-year existence of such a magnanimously noble children's project in their broader neighbourhood. Most of these people have heard of the government-run maternity hospital, as well as the Salimullah Orphanage and Farid Uddin Siddiqui High School. But they draw a blank on being asked about the start of 'ChotomoniNibash'. Many have queried if the authorities concerned on the management of the home want to keep it limited to a small number of kids. But the country needs dozens of such facilities in the districts or upazilas across the country. Perhaps in its bid to provide personalised quality care to these hapless children, the Azimpur centre has opened five branches in the divisions of Chattogram, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Khulna and Barishal. But with the increase in poverty and destitution amid the corona pandemic, the nation may need scores of more such child facilities.A nearly similar scenario unveiled in the post-Liberation War Dhaka. Hundreds of women assaulted by the Pakistani occupation army were seen taking their 'war babies' to missionary houses in Tejgaon and Sadarghat. They had no other way, except leaving their babies in the care of nuns at the missionaries. The news spread like wildfire in a number of European countries. The scenario that followed was the childless wealthy European families rushing to the said missionaries. Hundreds of Bangladeshi baby girls and boys found their 'parents' in the couples living in the European countries. Upon reaching youth, many of these 1971 babies rushed to Bangladesh in search of their lost parents. The searches of some proved a success as they were able to reunite with their aged parents and close relatives. It was Facebook in the main which had made the 'nearly impossible' missions possible.The number of safe shelters for orphaned and abandoned babies ought to be increased without let-up --- given the insensitive treatment being dealt to them by society.[email\u00a0protected]",

Even the parents who have their own cars rather choose school buses for transporting their children to school and back home. These buses, equipped with safety features, not only reduce traffic and pollution but also they are cheap and safe. However, it is unfortunate that we in Bangladesh have not yet been able to introduce a proper bus service for our students. Lack of designated buses has not only exposed students to unsafe journey, accidents, harassment and misbehaviour from transport workers in the capital but also increased education costs due to rising travel expenses.The affluent citizens of Dhaka city generally send their children to school by their personal car. And, often, one car carries only one child. This creates a rush of privately-owned cars during school hours, bringing the main roads of the city to a standstill. Some of the residential areas in Dhaka have become difficult to live in due to day-long traffic congestions, caused by the cars parked on the roads. If all the schools in the city have their own buses for carrying students, the situation will significantly improve. Fewer cars on the streets will also mean better air quality. We urge the authorities concerned to look into the issue in earnest and introduce a safe school bus service for every school. Badsha Faysal, Jurain, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected] ",
