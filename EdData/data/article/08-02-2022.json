The Congress has been reticent in projecting a singular leader in any State, and has often taken the plea that it believed in collective leadership. The announcement of a CM candidate, though not unprecedented, is rare for the Congress, and in this instance necessitated by the uniquely volatile social dynamic in Punjab at the moment. Entrenched social alignments in the State appear to be unravelling, and the Congress is trying to knit together a viable electoral majority, with a Dalit face as its axis. Punjab has close to 32% population of the Scheduled Caste community, while the Jat Sikh population is over 20%. But since 1977, the State has never seen a non-Jat Sikh Chief Minister \u2014 be it of the Congress party or the Shiromani Akali Dal, indicating the political dominance of the Jat Sikh community. Giani Zail Singh was the last non-Jat Sikh Chief Minister of Punjab between 1972-77.The Congress has usually shied away from pronounced social justice politics, and in that sense, this is an audacious move which will have ripple effects in its strategy elsewhere too. Party leader Rahul Gandhi is driving a more accommodative caste politics, but the approach is evidently facing resistance from within the party and outside. Dalits in Punjab are not a homogeneous category. They are divided into 39 castes, clustered under different religions and sects locally called \u2018Deras\u2019. Mr. Channi belongs to the Ravidasia community of Dalits, which is a minuscule population of the total Dalits. Whether he can galvanise a larger politics of aspiration shared among all communities overlooked in the traditional power sharing models of the State remains an open question, but Mr. Channi does deserve the support he has found from the party. He has not been long enough in power to be judged for his track record as CM, but Mr. Channi is a good story teller and has a good story \u2014 which are essential ingredients for any successful politics. His prominence will in all likelihood set off reactions from Jat Sikhs and upper caste Hindus, considerable segments of whom have been with the Congress. Opponents of the Congress \u2014 the Shiromani Akali Dal-BSP alliance, the BJP-led alliance, and the Aam Aadmi Party \u2014 will all try to inflame the resentment among these communities to corner the Congress. The Congress is accused of playing caste politics by promoting a Dalit, and it is notable the rotation of power among the dominant Jat Sikhs for decades rarely caused such concerns. Perhaps that itself is proof that Mr. Channi deserved this chance.",

        "full_article": "In the wake of the intensifying \u2018Partygate\u2019 scandal in the U.K., five close aides of Prime Minister Boris Johnson have resigned, putting the Conservative Party and its leadership in a tight spot over their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and their adherence to the associated restrictions on public gatherings. The five senior members of Mr. Johnson\u2019s office, including Chief of Staff Dan Rosenfield quit last week, following an incriminating enquiry into multiple social gatherings that took place at No.10 Downing Street during the early days of the pandemic when tight lockdown regulations had been imposed across the U.K. limiting all such parties. The scandal gained momentum after U.K. media published reports, including photographs, of senior members of Mr. Johnson\u2019s team attending several parties held around June 2020, a time when gatherings of more than two people indoors were banned. Following the expected outrage in Parliament and the initiation of a police investigation, last week a report by Sue Gray, Second Permanent Secretary, was published. Her report found that 16 events took place between May 2020 and April 2021 including a drinks event in the Downing Street garden attended by Mr. Johnson on May 20, 2020, and a birthday celebration for Mr. Johnson in the Cabinet Room on June 19, 2020.The scandal has rocked the confidence of Conservative MPs in their Prime Minister\u2019s capacity to lead. Even though Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries insisted that a \u201cvast majority\u201d of them still support Mr. Johnson, some, such as Stephen Hammond, have said that they are \u201cconsidering very carefully\u201d whether he still has confidence in the PM, especially because \u201ctelling the truth matters, and nowhere more so than in the House of Commons\u201d. Mr. Johnson has written to all Conservative MPs committing to improving \u201cthe way 10 Downing Street works\u201d. But it appears that MPs are far from convinced that there was sufficient justification to hold these drinking parties at No.10 when the nation was facing lockdowns. Specifically, these events endangered public health, damaged public perception of the government and its commitment to pandemic regulations, and demonstrated failure to explore alternative, pandemic-compliant means to transact business. The most ominous sign of Mr. Johnson\u2019s deteriorating prospects of continuing as PM are the MPs who have reportedly submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, Chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. If 54 MPs submit such letters to Sir Graham, it will trigger a vote on Mr. Johnson\u2019s leadership of the party. Given the progress made by his government in terms of vaccine administration, putting the U.K. at the top of the global vaccination league tables, it would be ironic if Mr. Johnson\u2019s time in No.10 was remembered more for drinking parties and lockdown violations.",

        "full_article": "If I am asked to pick one song from a Hindi film that best encapsulates how the posterity would look back at the singing legends Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi, it would be \"Pagla Kahin Ka\" (1970), where they sing: \"tum mujhe yun bhula na paoge / jab kabhi bhi geet sunoge mere / sang sang tum bhi gungunaoge\". Translated loosely, it means, \"you will never be able to forget me, whenever you hear my songs, you will hum with me\". Interestingly, both Rafi and Lata sing the number separately in the movie.\nLata Mangeshkar, who died on February 6, 2022, epitomises the voice of all of us in the full gamut of our emotions. She is one of those few singers whose music mirrors the myriad of feelings under the sun\u2014filling our hearts with love and longing, welling up tears of joy and sadness, making our body often sway in happiness, or pushing us to introspection. Such was the depth and range of her voice that it never failed to thrall the listeners, cutting through the shifting sands of time and tastes of every generation. There is something for everyone, for every special moment in life, be it for children (\"bachche man ke sachche\"), one's first fling in life (\"solah ki baras ki baali umar\"), for nostalgia for an old flame (\"beeti na beeti raina and tere bina zindagi mein koi shikwa nahin\").\nIt's really a Herculean task to choose the best from the rich oeuvre of Lata Mangeshkar\u2014from the tribute to the Indian soldier (\"Aye mere watan ke logon\") she sang in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan that brought the latter to tears, the classical \"Mohe panghat pe\" in \"Mughal-e-Azam\" (1960), to the intensely romantic \"Ajeeb dastaan hai ye\" in \"Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai\" (1960), the lilting \"Baahon me chale aao\" in \"Anamika\" (1973) or \"Allah tero naam/Ishwar tero naam\" in \"Hum Dono\" (1961) which reflects the secular ethos of India.\nLata Mangeshkar sang not just in Hindi but in many other languages too, driving home the adage that music knows no physical or linguistic boundaries. Being a national cultural icon of India did not come in the way of her being the flag-bearer of her Marathi identity, as reflected by the song \"Jyoti kalash chalke\".\nSince her first recorded song in 1942 for a Marathi-language movie, when she just 13 years old, the Indore-born singer has earned many sobriquets along the way\u2014like the \"melody queen\", \"India's nightingale\" and \"the voice of the millennium\"\u2014with the common thread being her mesmerising voice. In a career spanning nearly 80 years, she sang an estimated 25,000 songs in 36 Indian languages, including Hindi, Bangla, Marathi, Tamil and Kannada, and across classical and other genres. The body of her work is overwhelming and impossible to fathom in one go. She was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in the field of cinema, and a host of other honours.\nLata's much-talked-about competition with her sister, Asha Bhosle, was the stuff of headlines and rumours. But the Mangeshkar sisters never allowed themselves to be distracted by such talks, nor did they bother to respond to claims about how they completely overshadowed other singers in the film and non-film playback industry. As is quite common in a cut-throat competitive industry like Bollywood, controversies could not entirely elude Lata Mangeshkar. There was her tiff with Mohammed Rafi over royalties and her brief fall-out with Raj Kapoor, but those were just blips in a long, prodigious career.\u00a0\nNot many know that Lata Mangeshkar's singing talent was an accidental discovery by Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi musician, when she was just five years old. But then, the untimely death of her father brought the family's financial burden on a 13-year-old Lata's shoulders. A family friend came to their aid and she started singing and acting in his father's theatre company.\nAs in the silver screen, life in the Bollywood music industry has strange twists and turns too. When Lata Mangeshkar went to Mumbai, she was rejected by film producer Sashadhar Mukherjee because he found her voice too thin. But destiny had a different plan for her. As Lata Mangeshkar recalls in Nasreen Munni Kabeer's documentary \"Lata Mangeshkar: In Her Own Words\", her song \"Aayega aanewala\" in \"Mahal\" (1949) became such a rage that people would enquire about the identity of the singer, forcing a radio station to contact the gramophone company HMV to ask who had sung the song. As the first line of the song predicted, a crooning star appeared in the Indian music firmament. A star that shone brighter and brighter until she passed.\nLata Mangeshkar's voice has helped Bollywood heroines rise to superstardom down the ages\u2014from Madhubala, Meena Kumari to Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta and scores of others in between. Such was the power of her voice emoting for actors across almost all eight decades. It was a sure guarantee of success and leading heroines down the generations would insist on giving their lips to her songs, often making it part of their contracts.\nThe 1950s belonged completely to Lata Mangeshkar who went on to work with eminent music directors like Shankar-Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, SD Burman, Hemant Kumar, Madan Mohan and Salil Chowdhury. These were also busy years for her. She would at times record six to eight songs in a day, go home, sleep for a few hours and then catch Mumbai's local train again to a recording studio.\nIn 1960s, Madhubala was once again the face for Lata's voice in the evergreen \"Mughal-E-Azam\" film, with the defiant \"Jab pyaar kiya to darna kya\" becoming the byword for many a never-say-die lovers. The decade also marked the beginning of her work with another Bollywood composer duo, Laxmikant-Pyarelal, with whom she would go on to sing over 700 songs over a period of 35 years, most of which became super hits. This was also the time when Lata recorded duets with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, and Kishore Kumar.\nThis was followed by the 70s which will be remembered for Meena Kumari's last film \"Pakeezah\" (recall the song \"Chalte chalte\") and \"Abhimaan\" in which Lata Mangeshkar sang some memorable songs. The 1980s saw her lending her voice in the films \"Silsila\", \"Chandni\", \"Maine Pyar Kiya\", \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", \"Prem Rog\", \"Ram Teri Ganga Maili\" and \"Masoom\". Fast forward to 1990s and 2000s, and there were Lata's songs in the Gulzar-directed \"Lekin\" and Yash Chopra's films \"Lamhe\", \"Darr\", \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" and \"Dil To Pagal Hai\". Lata's last full film album was \"Veer-Zaara\" in 2004.\nAmong her other unforgettable songs are \"Lag jaa gale\", \"Satyam shivam sundaram\", \"Ajeeb daastaan hai\", \"Hothon mein aisi baat\", and \"Pani pani re\".\nWith such a vast repertoire of songs for all emotions of all people, one cannot miss Lata Mangeshkar even for a day because our hearts hum with her voice. It is part of who we are.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya\u00a0is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India.\n",

        "full_article": "The word \"safety\" has multiple connotations when applied to hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In developing countries like Bangladesh, there could be concerns about structural integrity of buildings, personal security from assault, or even confidence in the financial system used for payment. These and other similar issues abound, but are easily discerned by many users of the healthcare system who can take precautionary measures against them. There is, however, one aspect of safety that people take for granted, or even fail to consider at all, when it comes to hospitals: their health. We assume that in an environment that caters to specialist healthcare, we need not worry about the intricacies of various diseases and their effects, as skilled practitioners are there to do that for us. But are we wise to do so?\nThe first issue of safety is recognition. It is reasonably straightforward to identify a sick patient\u2014this is what hospitals are for. However, how efficient are our hospitals in identifying a deteriorating patient? In other words, how effective are they in picking up the cues of active progression of pathology in an erstwhile well patient? Most facilities will have their nursing staff make regular observations and document these readings in the patient notes. This mundane task invariably turns into nothing more than a data collection exercise, and it is for this reason why the \"medical early warning scores\" have been developed.\nAn individual low reading of oxygen saturation or a high reading of heart rate may not trigger the mind to think that a patient's condition is changing, but when these vital signs are grouped together and attributed a score, trends of deterioration can be picked up. When, in a space of a few hours, a patient's early warning score starts to creep up, healthcare workers will know that they need to call for extra help when a pre-set score is triggered.\nThis leads to the second issue of safety: Who do you call for help? The wards or on-duty doctors are usually the first ones to be called when problems arise. Although capable, these doctors are on the lowest tier of the medical hierarchy and responsible only for dealing with minor healthcare problems of their patients. The more senior doctors do visit their patients during rounds, but are otherwise occupied with other commitments\u2014such as running clinics, performing medical procedures, etc.\u2014and so may be difficult to get hold of when matters take a turn for the worse.\nThere is also the issue of patients' condition deteriorating in a non-medical ward such as surgery or gynaecology, where the input of a physician is vital. At the critical end of the spectrum, hospitals in many countries have a \"code\" system in which a code blue is put out for a patient in extreme distress, and experts in the vicinity rush to help. Although an ad hoc arrangement, this can improve patient outcomes.\nHowever, to improve safety, hospitals need to invest in a dedicated rapid response team. This is a group of specialist doctors who are trained to deal with acutely unwell patients all across the hospital and are allocated to this task daily. They remain prepared throughout their shift and have access to emergency kit bags, which they carry with them to a call. The hospital selects the team from relevant specialties like medicine, anaesthesia, emergency, and critical care, and provides the team with regular training.\nIn most cases, there is a dedicated number to call to activate this team. In the UK, for example, 2222 is the standardised rapid response hotline. Having this number standardised, as well as prominently displayed in all areas, is essential not just for allowing the public to activate this call when faced with a hospital emergency, but it also ensures that despite staff turnover, all staff members are aware of what number to call.\nSo, how would you know if your hospital is invested in your safety? There are two tell-tale signs: 1) The presence of a well-displayed medical early warning score that is designed to trigger a response; and 2) Guidance on how to contact the rapid response team, situated on the other end of every accessible telephone. Setting this infrastructure into place does incur a cost. But the cost of averting a medical crisis is much less, for both the hospital and the patient, than dealing with a critical care emergency that was initially missed.\n\u00a0\nDr Mir Saaduddin Ahmad is a specialist in emergency medicine and academic director at Dr Nizam Medical Centre in Dhaka.\n",

        "full_article": "People around the world are grappling with inflationary pressure. Many have lost their jobs or are earning a lower income. Prices of daily essentials and fuel have spiralled, further draining people's purses. Businesses have also been affected, particularly small businesses, who are yet to recover from pandemic-induced shocks. Though countries are on the path to recovery, the emergence of Omicron coupled with the high inflationary pressure might slow down their recovery in the short term. Meanwhile, since global economy is recovering, demand has gone up while supply could not match the demand.\nBangladesh has been in the recovery trajectory, too. However, like other countries, high inflation has been a major concern for Bangladesh. The inflationary pressure on Bangladesh's economy started around June 2020 following the outbreak of the pandemic. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), point-to-point inflation rose to 6.05 percent in December 2021 compared to 5.29 percent in December 2020. Food inflation went up to 5.46 percent in December 2021, as opposed to 5.34 percent in December 2020.\nThe price hike in Bangladesh is often linked with the global price hike. Bangladesh is a net importer of fuel oil. It also imports edible oil, food, sugar, intermediate goods and raw materials for production. Therefore, any price increase in the global market is felt in Bangladesh almost immediately. This is a regular phenomenon and has been the case for decades. During periods of crisis, it becomes even more prominent. It may be recalled that during 2000-2008, increasing global fuel and food prices were transmitted into Bangladesh economy. The inflationary pressure started to ease following a global meltdown towards the end of 2008 and in 2009, which caused prices of major commodities to fall. However, inflation started to rise once the global economy started to turn around towards the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010. In the following decade, till the outbreak of the pandemic, the inflationary trend fluctuated.\nIn 2011, the global food price index increased significantly. After a decade, food prices are alarmingly high again. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the FAO Food Price Index in 2021 was 28.1 percent higher than in 2020.\nGlobally, the cost of logistics such as shipping and airlines as well as fuel prices have led to high prices of crops, even though global crop production has been as high as 2.8 billion\u2014a record production. This high cost of rice, wheat, soybean oil and other commodities is then passed onto the end users. People in the low-income countries such as Bangladesh are the most affected in this regard.\nOn the domestic front, supply shortage is one of the reasons for high prices. A key component of high inflation in Bangladesh is high food inflation in the domestic market. Since food comprises about 60 percent of the total Consumer Price Index in Bangladesh, higher domestic food price is a dominant factor for high inflation both in urban and rural areas. Lower production is a key reason for the high price. Before the harvesting season, there is a lean period when supply is relatively low. This is a time when prices tend to go up. However, often markets do not follow the rule of demand and supply. For example, vegetable prices continued to be high even after the winter supply came in. The impact of higher supply was not reflected in prices. The cost of transportation and other logistics also contributed to this. For non-perishable commodities, there are market manipulators, hoarders, and syndicates\u2014all of them take advantage of moments of crisis.\u00a0\nThe global prediction for agriculture production is not promising in view of the impact of climate change, which is manifested not only through flood and cyclones but also through drought and wildfire. In the absence of high growth and good agricultural production, the inflationary pressure will continue to prevail. Indeed, due to uncertain climatic conditions, high input costs and the ongoing pandemic, the FAO sees little hope for food market stability in 2022. This is a warning for the food importing countries. During a crisis, food producing and exporting countries would give priority to domestic demand and tend to impose ban on export of food grains. The importing countries will not be able to import from the global market, as it happened in the past. Even if they can, they will have to pay an exorbitant price.\nTherefore, Bangladesh needs to take measures well in advance. As a climate vulnerable country, it faces a high risk in terms of production disruption. On the other hand, the demand for rice and other food items is increasing. Hence, to have a proper market signal and price stability, a correct demand estimation for rice is needed. It is also essential to monitor the role of market players, including rice millers and importers, who control prices by manipulation.\nInflationary pressure always has an adverse impact on the consumers through reduction of their purchasing power and income erosion. High inflation, particularly high food inflation, affects the poor and people in the fixed income group. They are yet to absorb the burden of diesel price hike in November 2021. Now, with the continuous price hike of essential commodities, they find it difficult to live a decent life. The government's support measures in the form of direct cash transfer to the poor, social protection to low-income families as well as stimulus for the small businesses, can provide some respite in the short term. In the medium term, higher production through higher investment will help create jobs and income, which is crucial for absorbing price shocks.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).

        "full_article": "Myanmar authorities appear to be getting away with their crimes as global attention is focused on the pandemic and, more recently, the Ukraine crisis. February 1, 2022 marked the first anniversary of the brazen coup in which the ruthless military junta seized power and deposed the democratically elected government headed by the National League for Democracy (NLD). Citizens observed the day with a \"silent strike\" in Yangon, and demonstrated across the country to register their resentment over the junta's hostilities and the global community's inaction.\nSince the coup, the Tatmadaw has unleashed a reign of terror on Myanmar's people, killing 1,400 and jailing 11,000, according to the nonprofit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The security forces have been indiscriminate in their behaviour, targeting elected members of parliament, journalists, workers and ordinary people protesting against the coup.\nAll along, the world's attention seesawed between a soft approach through ASEAN leaders to get some sense into the rulers, and relatively harsher measures like imposing economic sanctions and blacklisting individual members of the ruling elite.\nMeanwhile, the solution to the Rohingya crisis, which has been festering since 2017, has not moved an inch. The internal situation in Myanmar\u2014economic, political and humanitarian\u2014has gotten worse, as the ruling clique finds itself almost unscathed while managing to flout all international and democratic norms. And it seems to be succeeding in its diabolical scheme to stay in power, while keeping its guns trained on unarmed civilians. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the country's democracy movement, was tried behind closed doors.\nSo how does the military keep on functioning so boldly?\nAccording to sources, Myanmar has been economically almost unharmed by foreign sanctions and diplomatic pressures. Businesses controlled by the army are using their rich natural resources to tighten its grip on the country, and slaughter freedom-loving citizens in the Kachin, Karin, Shan, and Rakhine states. The army, local businesses controlled by the dominant ethnic group, and foreign investors have teamed up to provide a lifeline to the various operations of the regime. This unholy alliance is using the oil and gas, gemstones, and timber industries to support the economy and provide foreign exchange to the military for equipment and supplies, and to defray the cost of maintaining the supply chain feeding the military-industrial-mining complex.\nMost of the extractive industry revenue in Myanmar comes from four big offshore projects producing natural gas. It is estimated that gas extraction is the source of about 50 percent of Myanmar's foreign exchange. Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is a state-owned company that operates with international partners such as Chevron and Total to channel billions of dollars into the pocket of the military. MOGE's purse is totally controlled by the military junta. The Myanmar Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry has forecasted that MOGE will earn USD 1.5 billion in 2021-2022 from offshore and pipeline projects.\nUnder international pressure, America's Chevron and France's Total repeatedly promised to wind down their operations in Myanmar. TotalEnergies is the largest shareholder and operator of Myanmar's biggest natural gas project, an offshore field called Yadana, providing energy for domestic use and export. Following the Yadana project, the USD-700-million Yetagun (\"flag of victory\") project was the second largest natural gas offshore project in Myanmar. Along with MOGE, the gas fields are jointly owned by Thai, Malaysian, and Japanese companies.\nIt is clear that enforcement of existing sanctions imposed on Myanmar is very weak. There is also no mechanism to take action against those who continue to do business with Myanmar in defiance of sanctions. Though TotalEnergies and Chevron, on January 21, finally announced plans to withdraw from Myanmar, it needs to be seen who steps in next to keep these gas fields operational.\nAccording to the UN, the Tatmadaw had been able to \"insulate itself from accountability and oversight\" through a network of conglomerate-owned businesses and affiliates. Two organisations\u2014Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL)\u2014have increasingly become key sources of wealth for the Tatmadaw, with stakes in everything from banking and mining to tobacco and tourism.\nAn Amnesty International (AI) report showed how MEHL and Myanmar's military units are linked. This information has implications for MEHL's many foreign and local business partners. \"By doing business with the conglomerate, they too are linked to these crimes and violations,\" according to AI. \"Because MEHL has shown no willingness to engage transparently with its business partners or reform its structure,\" AI urged these companies to disengage \"responsibly\" from MEHL.\nThe junta recently organised a \"Global Mini Gems Emporium\" in Naypyidaw to showcase the country's pearl and precious stones industry. Coloured stones from Myanmar have been prized in the West despite repeated sanctions by the US and other countries. Besides rubies, other precious stones include sapphire, jade, and spinel. Thailand, China, and Cambodia\u2014which are all authoritarian regimes\u2014have gone out of their way to provide moral and economic support to the junta ensconced in Naypyidaw.\nThe financial flows to the business entities in Myanmar have continued unhindered and unabated, and calls for asset-freezing, expulsion from SWIFT, and other economic sanctions have gone unheeded.\nHeidi Hautala, vice-president of the European Parliament, recently called on all EU members to extend sanctions to MOGE. There have been repeated appeals to other companies in the sector to take immediate steps to stop all payments to the junta by whatever means possible. For the US, UK, EU and the UN, it is now high time to step up their game and contain the bad actors in Naypyidaw using broader diplomatic pressure, tighter sanctions, intensified efforts to block arms shipment, and deployment of effective countermeasures.\n\u00a0\nDr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and serves as Senior Research Fellow at the US-based International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI).\u00a0\n",

They are not only aware of the importance of clean air for healthy living, but they have also taken all possible measures to plug the sources of pollution. This is one significant step towards good governance that the citizens expect from their governments. But, regrettably, in many developing countries, governments remain conspicuously insensitive to citizens' health issues arising from toxic air.\nBangladesh is one such country where air quality in most of its cities and big towns would fail to pass the \"acid\" test any day of the year.

Almost round the clock, pollutants are released into the air by small and large chemical factories, brick kilns, earth cutting and filling, ovens using wood as fuel, vehicles burning fossil fuel, diesel generators, etc.\nStamford University's Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) has found that since 2015, we have not experienced fresh air for even one week of a year. Yet, the government has taken no visible steps to address the deteriorating situation. A draft of the \"Clean Air Act\"\u2014prepared by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA) and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), and approved by the Department of Environment (DoE)\u2014has been gathering dust since 2019. The draft proposes that the DoE prepare a time-bound National Air Quality Management Plan to improve the status quo. It also states that the government must announce the names of critical areas which have high Air Quality Index (AQI) scores.\nIt is evident to anyone breathing in the poisonous air that we need a comprehensive clean air act on an urgent basis, incorporating provisions for air pollution prevention and control, and a mechanism for proper institutional management. We also need to ensure implementation of existing laws and High Court directives in this regard, which begins with holding government entities responsible for their consistent failure to monitor and bring to book the polluters.\n",

        "full_article": "We are shocked to learn that the government's special scheme to improve the lives and livelihoods of tea workers in the country has excluded those who need support the most\u2014the temporary tea workers. According to a report by The Daily Star, the government has started listing the beneficiaries for this special programme without taking into consideration the needs of the temporary and seasonal workers.\nReportedly, there are around one lakh permanent workers in the 166 tea gardens of the country, while the number of temporary workers is around 36,000. However, if we consider the combined number of temporary, seasonal and unemployed workers in the tea gardens, their number would be three times higher than that of the permanent workers. Leaving this vast population of tea workers out of the scheme will mean that they will slip further into poverty.\nThe temporary and seasonal workers have always been deprived by the authorities of the tea gardens, despite the fact that their work-hour is the same as that of the permanent workers. Although they get the same daily wage\u2014a meagre amount of Tk120\u2014they do not get any other benefits that permanent workers usually receive. And now, under this new government scheme, temporary workers will, once again, get nothing, while their permanent counterparts will get medical treatment, ration, homestead and provident fund benefits. This is a clear violation of the \"Cha Sramikder Jibanman Unnayan Karmasuchi Bastobayan Nitimala-2013\", according to which improving the living conditions of the vulnerable workers should get priority.\nWhile all our tea workers basically live a poverty-ridden life due to the low wage and a lack of basic facilities, it is the seasonal and temporary workers who suffer the most. Their living standards deteriorated further during this pandemic as many of them lost their jobs.\nThus, while we appreciate the government's initiative to help tea workers of the country, we urge them to include the temporary and seasonal workers in their scheme, since they are more eligible for the welfare scheme because of the precarious nature of their work. The government should also make sincere attempts to find out the real number of such individuals and give them extra financial benefits, if possible. Moreover, the tea garden owners must not also remain oblivious to their workers' needs. They should address the plight of the temporary and seasonal workers and provide jobs to those who are currently unemployed.\n",
