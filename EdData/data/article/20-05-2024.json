Accusations made by Ms. Maliwal against the aide, Bibhav Kumar, are of a serious nature. In a public statement, she has said that Mr. Kumar beat her \u201cbrutally\u201d and \u201cslapped and kicked\u201d her. AAP leader Sanjay Singh had in a public statement, on May 14, said that the aide had \u201cmisbehaved\u201d and \u201cacted indecently\u201d with Ms. Maliwal, when she arrived at Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s official residence to meet him. Mr. Singh went on to add that Mr. Kejriwal had taken note of the incident and that \u201cstrict action\u201d would follow. But that was not how events unfolded. The AAP did not act against Mr. Kumar and Ms. Maliwal filed a police complaint, leading to his arrest. In an abrupt change of tune, the AAP now accuses Ms. Maliwal, who has been an associate of Mr. Kejriwal for two decades, of being a \u201cpawn\u201d of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP has waded into the troubled waters, and the Congress has reminded Mr. Kejriwal that he had campaigned for laws that gave precedence to a woman\u2019s words in a case of assault.A media trial or a political tug of war cannot determine the truth. A professional, unbiased investigation can. The position of the BJP which is in power at the Centre and controls the Delhi police should not be allowed to influence the investigation. In fact, the BJP\u2019s outrage here is hypocritical, considering its muted reaction to more serious allegations against Prajwal Revanna, a sitting MP of its ally, the Janata Dal (Secular). Mr. Kejriwal also must speak up on the issue. Continuing silence or making rhetorical allegations against the BJP is not the answer. The AAP that rose to prominence as part of a response to the decadence of politics in India, is today facing the catalogue of charges it had stuck on all other parties \u2014 from corruption and nepotism to authoritarianism and toxic masculinity. Despite being around for over a decade, it remains insulated from public scrutiny or internal accountability. It has no organisational structures of decision-making, and often takes recourse to arbitrary measures. Irrespective of the outcome of the Maliwal case, and quite apart from the BJP\u2019s tendency to use enforcement agencies for political purposes, the AAP needs to do some serious introspection.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\npolice\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\narrest\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nJanata Dal - Secular\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nlaws",

        "full_article": "Two years after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland has stepped in to organise a peace conference, making a special effort to broaden global consensus on the war by enlisting those who have not joined the western coalition thus far. As a close partner of Russia, a member of the BRICS and SCO groupings, a leader in the Global South, and an aspirant to world leadership, India is, no doubt, at the top of the list. And the Swiss Foreign Secretary Alexandre Fasel\u2019s visit to Delhi this week, following closely those of two Swiss Ministers, and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba over the past few months, is evidence that the invitation to India at the head of state/head of government level is a priority. Of the 160 or so countries that invitations for the conference have gone to \u2014 it is to be held in the resort town of B\u00fcrgenstock on June 15-16 \u2014 about 50 have confirmed their attendance, mostly from the European Union, NATO alliance, G-7 countries and U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. Russia has not been invited, and Mr. Fasel made it clear that their diplomacy was hoping to bring over \u2018BICS\u2019 leaders (BRICS minus Russia) so they could convey the outcomes to Moscow, with a view to inviting Russia to a future round of talks. With Brazilian President Lula indicating that he would not attend, and South Africa\u2019s citing its general elections on May 29 to formally decline the invitation, all eyes are on whether Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if he is re-elected, or official nominees would attend.Convincing the rest of the world to attend a platform that appears stilted towards Ukraine remains a tall order for the organisers. While Switzerland prides itself on its \u201cneutrality\u201d, it has already chosen sides in the current conflict by imposing sanctions on Russia. Another venue may have appeared more impartial. The agenda for the conference is to build a framework for or road map to peace, and to discuss issues such as ensuring food security and freedom of navigation, nuclear safety and humanitarian issues. It seems unlikely that much headway can be made on any of these issues without both parties to the conflict at the table. It is also hard to foresee what else can be achieved as long as Russia and Ukraine believe they can make or consolidate more gains on the battlefield \u2014 a real negotiation begins when either one or both sides believe they have exhausted military options. If the aim of the conference then is, as Russian President Vladimir Putin says, to \u201cpressure\u201d Russia into announcing a ceasefire or ceding territory it has won, then it is hardly likely to succeed, given the UN General Assembly\u2019s failure to bring such pressure through multiple resolutions. New Delhi, that has thus far refused to join any statement that is overtly critical of Russia, and has not diluted ties with Moscow, may thus find it easier to hedge its bets, and only show its hand once a truly balanced and more inclusive peace effort gets under way.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nSwitzerland\n\n/\n\npeace negotiations\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nNATO\n\n/\n\nJapan\n\n/\n\nSouth Korea\n\n/\n\nAustralia\n\n/\n\nBrazil\n\n/\n\nSouth Africa\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\neconomic sanction\n\n/\n\nfood security\n\n/\n\nnuclear policy\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations",

In other words, there\u2019s no daylight between their strategic positions anymore.\n\nBack to Cold War? |\u00a0Russia and China criticised US for harbouring a Cold War mentality and destabilising global security.

SC was dismayed that tree-felling had started before forests ministry gave a prelim permission on March 1.

The abandon with which the triad of authorities in National Capital Region spanning Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana routinely sidestep SC orders, and work in cahoots with land mafia and illegal mining outfits to level the Aravallis and Delhi Ridge is well-established.

Nothing is stopping the loot.\n\nNo saving forests |\u00a0Compensatory afforestation, 100 trees to be planted for every tree felled, that SC has directed DDA to do, is a useless measure. Compensatory afforestation simply puts a price on trees, making them a commodity. It puts forests into a business model. But reality is that chopping down forest stretches destroys entire ecosystems of microflora and fauna, multiple species and habitats of tree-dwelling creatures. Afforestation is invariably a monoculture, and no matter how many saplings are replanted, they can never replace a forest. Compensatory afforestation is a dead-end.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In Europe, steam power evolved gradually and uncertainly over the course of the eighteenth century, with innovative peaks and long plateaus, from Thomas Savery's steam pump (1698) via Thomas Newcomen's reciprocating atmospheric engine (1712) to James Watt and Matthew Boulton's double-acting rotative steam engine with a separate condenser (1765-90). The first steamer to complete the journey from England to India, the Enterprize (an \"auxiliary\" paddle ship equipped with sails), left Falmouth on August 16, 1825 and arrived in Calcutta via the Cape of Good Hope a disappointing 113 days later, of which (due to bad weather and exhausted fuel) only 62 were under steam. Between 1822 and 1837, the number of steam engines working in Bengal rose from 2 to 67, and by 1845, according to the Bengal Hurkaru newspaper, there were 150 engines in use (mostly imported). By the end of this period, in 1844, the journalist J.H. Stocqueler could report that \"On approaching Calcutta, the smoking chimneys of steam-engines are now seen in every direction, on either side of the river, presenting the gratifying appearance of a seat of numerous extensive manufactories, vying with many British cities.\"\nDuring the early year of the 19th century, Bengal was becoming the epicenter of an imperial imagination in which steam in particular was firmly fixed as an engine that would diffuse European civilization. The public history of steam power in India begins with three remarkable scenes from the 1820s.\n\nGolak's engine was displayed at the Society's annual exhibition on January 16 at Calcutta's Town Hall. In its report, the Society further emphasized that Golak designed and built the engine \"without any assistance whatever from European artists upon the mode, of a large Steam Engine belonging to the missionaries at Serampore,\" for which the \"ingenious blacksmith\" was awarded a prize of 50 rupees.\nFirst, just north of Calcutta in the Danish colony of Serampore (Srirampur), on March 27, 1820 the English Baptist missionaries staged a demonstration of their new engine imported from Messrs. Thwaites and Rothwell of Bolton to assist with paper production for the mission press: \"The 'machine of fire,' as they called it, brought crowds of natives to the mission, whose curiosity tried the patience of the engineman imported to work it; while many a European who had never seen machinery driven by steam came to study and to copy it.\"\nThe second high-profile stationary engine in Bengal went into operation two and a half years later, on November 1, 1822, in Calcutta at Chandpal Ghat to supply water from the Hugli river via aqueducts to the streets of the city's \"White Town\" in order to keep down the dust.\nIn the following summer, \"At exactly nine minutes past four on Saturday afternoon (12th July) the first steam vessel, which ever floated on the waters of the East,\" the Diana Packet, \"left the stocks at Kyd's Yard, Kidderpore,\" with a more public launch following on the morning of August 9, when the Diana departed from Chandpal Ghat, \"stemming the rapid freshes of the river with a velocity perfectly astonishing.\" Bearing a party including Colonel Jacob Krefting, Governor of Serampore, and his suite, the Diana steamed to Chinsurah against a strong tide, making the journey in six to seven hours and then returning by way of Serampore, where an \"elegant entertainment\" had been \"prepared for the occasion,\" arriving back in Calcutta on the next morning.\nHere is the account reproduced by The Asiatic Journal in London from The Calcutta Journal in Bengal: (See Photo 1)\nAll the terms of the Romantic sublime are there, so we expect the minds of the beholders to be awed and elevated, yet their wonder is \"stupid,\" their fears \"superstitious,\" their amazement or astonishment, whether \"silent\" or \"loud,\" indifferently a sign of utter incomprehension. For Edmund Burke in his famous Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) and, especially, for Immanuel Kant in The Critique of Judgment (1790), what we call sublime does not reside in the object so described but rather in the mind that apprehends it. Kant is explicit that \"the judgement upon the Sublime in nature needs culture (more than the judgement upon the Beautiful)\": \"That the mind be attuned to feel the sublime postulates a susceptibility of the mind for ideas \u2026 In fact, without the development of moral ideas, that which we, prepared by culture, call sublime presents itself to the uneducated man merely as terrible.\" Unprepared by culture, the crowds of natives who gather to see the Baptist missionaries' \"machine of fire\" in 1820 experienced only an irritating curiosity, while now in 1823 \"the more ignorant natives\" experience only terror.\nHaving already noted that \"Almost all the heathen temples were dark,\" Burke, in fact, denominated darkness and blackness themselves as intrinsically terrible objective properties, citing the example of a boy who \"saw a black object,\" which \"gave him great uneasiness,\" and then \"some time after, upon accidentally seeing a negro woman, \u2026 was struck with great horror at the sight.\" In accounts of steam as sublime, accordingly, it is the European viewer whose mind is elevated and \"admitted \u2026 into the Counsels of the Almighty by a consideration of his works.\" Thus elevated, the European mind is prepared, as The Calcutta Journal concludes its depiction of the Diana Packet, to \"promote the cause of science and the arts, and add to the sum of human enjoyments.\" The native, on the contrary, like a dark, heathen temple, can be an object, not a subject, of the sublime.\n\nDuring the early years of the 19th century, Bengal was becoming the epicenter of an imperial imagination in which steam in particular was firmly fixed as an engine that would diffuse European civilization.\nThe crowds that came to witness the Diana dispelling the darkness recall the contrast established in the account of the Serampore engine between collective and childlike native curiosity, which \"tried the patience of the engineman,\" and the individualized and mature curiosity of \"many a European who \u2026 came to study and to copy it.\" One Indian not only came to study and copy it, however, but then proceeded to build a working engine based on its design. We do not know if Golak Chandra, blacksmith of Titagarh, immediately opposite Serampore, crossed the river on March 27, 1820 to join the \"crowds of natives\" curious about the new machine. But he did cross the river to study it many times thereafter: at its meeting on January 9, 1828, the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India resolved, \"at the suggestion of the Rev. Dr. Carey, that permission be given to Goluk-chundra, a blacksmith of Titigur, to exhibit on Wednesday next, a Steam Engine made by himself without the aid of any European artist.\" Golak's engine was then displayed at the Society's annual exhibition on January 16 at Calcutta's Town Hall. In its report, the Society further emphasized that Golak designed and built the engine \"without any assistance whatever from European artists upon the mode, of a large Steam Engine belonging to the missionaries at Serampore,\" for which the \"ingenious blacksmith\" was awarded a prize of 50 rupees. A contemporaneous account in the Calcutta Gazette echoed the phrase \"without any assistance whatever from European artists\" while adding its own praise for the \"native ingenuity\" and \"imitative skill\" of the \"ingenious Blacksmith.\"\nThe story of Golak Chandra's engine, for scientist and scholar Professor Amitabha Ghosh, demolishes a myth, making the \"plotting of Indian dependence as a function of technological incapability even in the era of steam a spurious fabrication.\" But something else is at stake too in the early nineteenth century. If we zoom out to the context in which this engine was exhibited in 1828, at an exhibition of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, we find, according to the Society's Prospectus, written by the Baptist missionary William Carey on April 15, 1820, a mere three weeks after the demonstration of the Mission's new steam engine, that \"It is peculiarly desirable that Native gentlemen should be eligible as members of the Society, because one of its chief objects will be the improvement of their estates, and of the peasantry which reside thereon. They should therefore not only be eligible as members, but also as officers of the Society in precisely the same manner as Europeans.\" A further reason why it was peculiarly desirable to associate \"Native Gentlemen of landed estates with Europeans who have studied this subject\" was that \"we should gradually impart to them more correct ideas of the value of landed property, of the possibility of improving it, and of the best methods of accomplishing so desirable an end.\" Such \"improvements\" would bring about \"the gradual conquest of the indolence which in Asiatics is almost become a second nature, \u2013 and the introduction of habits of cleanliness \u2026 in the place of squalid wretchedness, neglect, and confusion.\" Through the diffusion of western science to the native members of the Society, \"industry and virtue\" would replace \"idleness and vice.\"\nIn this light, the insistence that Golak's ingenuity was a form of \"imitative skill\" and the emphasis here on the \"improvement\" of native estates (Britons being forbidden from owning land) reveal a tension in the period between what historian Kapil Raj has called the later historiographical perspectives of \"diffusionism\" and \"relocationism\" with respect to the creation and transmission of scientific knowledge. According to the dominant diffusionist model, science is developed in the West and then spread to the East as \"the embodiment of basic values of truth and rationality, the motor of moral, social, and material progress, the marker of civilization itself.\" Knowledge and technologies are fundamentally stable in function and significance, adapting the new location to the universal values and progress they bear while remaining themselves unmodified by local environment or experience. The alternative \"relocationist\" perspective proposed by Raj, on the contrary, rooted in the New Imperial History's emphasis on asymmetric circulation and the mutual constitution of Britain and its empire, suggests that \"South Asia was not a space for the simple application of European knowledge\" but rather \"was an active, although unequal, participant in an emerging world order of knowledge \u2026 [T]he contact zone was a site for the production of certified knowledges which would not have come into being but for the intercultural encounter between South Asian and European intellectual and material practices.\"\nOn the one hand, then, Golak is a \"mimic\" engineer, copying a European imported prototype and demonstrating the native capacity, in the well-known language of Macaulay's \"Minute on Indian Education\" (1835), to become \"English \u2026 in intellect.\" And the same goes for the 500 native members of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society over the remainder of the nineteenth century, who, for Macaulay, would join the \"interpreter\" class \u2013 \"a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect\" \u2013 prepared \"to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.\"\nOn the other hand, the activities and language of the Society work against its diffusionist ideology: the \"first endeavours\" of the Society \"would be directed to the obtaining of information upon the almost innumerable subjects which present themselves,\" and \"Native Gentlemen\" would thus be essential not just to the civilizing process by which they would receive communicated European science but to the Society's own acquisition of a hybridized \"stock of knowledge\": \"the methods employed to raise crops, and conduct the other parts of rural economy must so vary with soil, climate, and other local circumstances, as to make it impossible for any individual to be practically acquainted with them all. Too much praise can scarcely be given to local establishments whether public or private.\" Carey, Professor of Bengali, Sanskrit, and Marathi at the College of Fort William and as devout a practical botanist as a Particular Baptist, was far less invested in assimilation and anglicization than the evangelical wing of the Church of England associated with Charles Grant, Zachary Macaulay, and the Clapham Sect, or than Alexander Duff of the Scottish Church Mission: above all, for Carey local circumstances (and languages) were always paramount. And finally, in a moment of reverse-diffusionism, the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India, founded in 1820 and shaped by intercultural encounter, translation, and local practices, then formed the model for the Royal Agricultural Society of England, founded in 1838.\nAs the convergence of steam power, science, and colonialism in early British Bengal shows, the relocation of technology undermined the equation between stable knowledge and the transfer of civilization from West to East. From the effect of the Diana's \"triumph of science over the elements, on some of the more ignorant natives\" to the display of Golak's engine before the annual exhibition of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India, the production of knowledge in the contact zone was always a form of hybridization bearing the marks of specific and unequal relationships of power.\nDaniel E. White\u00a0is Professor of English at the University of Toronto, Canada. His new book,\u00a0Romanticism, Liberal Imperialism, and Technology in Early British India: \"The all-changing power of steam,\"\u00a0is forthcoming from Palgrave.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is heartening to see conscious citizens take a strong stance against the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL)'s continued occupation of the Anwara Park near the Farmgate area. Their demand for the park to be returned to the people within 30 days is completely justified. Not long ago, Anwara Park used to provide breathing space to visitors and local residents. Today, it lies almost barren and cordoned off, with the only sign of its former self being on paper. The metro rail authorities have been occupying the space since 2018 for storage, parking and other purposes. But as the construction of the rail line through the Farmgate area has been over for some time, it is only right that they free up the space and return it as it was.\nUnfortunately, the DMTCL, despite having promised to do that originally, reportedly wants to turn the space into a plaza or shopping complex. This is not what the people want or even need. The question is, who gave DMTCL the authority to take such decisions? Even the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), to its credit, fought back against the DMTCL's ludicrous proposal, with the mayor making it clear that the park must be returned to serve its original purpose.\nWhat Dhaka needs most now are more open spaces such as parks and playgrounds, not more shopping malls\u2014which it already has plenty of. The implications of destroying what little open space is left in the city should not be lost on anyone, especially given the blistering heatwave\u00a0that has engulfed the country over the past few weeks. Unfortunately, government agencies often seem to be oblivious to this fact. Even the DNCC itself set a bad example when it recently allowed the Gulshan Youth Club to construct a football turf and other structures at the Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmad Park, restricting access for the general public.\nThe result of such activities is that people have increasingly less and less access to open areas which are essential for their physical, mental and social well-being.\u00a0This trend must end. We urge the DMTCL to take immediate steps to hand over the Anwara Park after necessary renovations. Moreover, all such parks similarly at risk of destruction or alternation\u2014in Dhaka and other cities\u2014need to be protected.\n",

        "full_article": "It is the number one complaint among social media users in Dhaka's traffic forums, and also one of the first solutions suggested by the masses when asked what could fix the anarchy on our roads. Going by internet discourse, it seems that rickshaws\u2014Dhaka's trusty old three-wheeled friend\u2014have lost the love of its citizens, at least those in cars.\nBy itself, this brewing sentiment would have been meaningless. But last week, Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader directed the authorities concerned to take steps to stop battery-run rickshaws from operating in the capital, lending credence to the view that rickshaws must go if the roads are to get safer and more efficient.\nBut how true is that? There must be a reason why rickshaws exist today and have existed for so many years.\nWhile battery-run rickshaws present more extreme versions of the same problems thrown up by an abundance of their pedal-run brethren in Dhaka, it's useful to consider them together when trying to understand what purpose they serve. The reason a ban on rickshaws on the main roads imposed in 2019 didn't survive post-pandemic and two bans on battery-run rickshaws in 2014 and 2021 were never really implemented is because, at the end of the day, rickshaws form a crucial link in the transportation hierarchy of Dhaka.\nThe transportation system in a busy metropolis like our capital is supposed to be made up of various parts, with public transportation like the metro system serving long-distance commutes, buses serving medium-distance travel or low-cost alternatives for long-distance travel, and walking and cycling being the medium of last mile delivery, taking people to and from their homes and destinations. If all of these components worked like they were supposed to, the roads would be empty enough for those in private cars and motorcycles to travel\u2014with relative ease\u2014distances that demand motor vehicles. However, this is not even close to the ground reality.\n\nBanning rickshaws in Dhaka is an easy solution to a difficult problem, but Dhaka's traffic is a complicated problem that needs multifaceted efforts to combat it. Rickshaws have been around for nearly a century, thus trying to get rid of them overnight is a rash and unwise course of action. Battery-run rickshaws pose a significant safety threat, so standardising these vehicles to make them safer and issuing licences for rickshaw pullers can be a more deliberative first step, until viable alternatives are presented.\nThe metro system in Dhaka is in its early days. Buses here are dysfunctional and extremely uncomfortable; they don't go everywhere, and when they do go somewhere, they go very slow. Cycling on major roads is risky given the lack of cycling lanes and other cycling infrastructure, and walking is difficult due to the dilapidated state of footpaths. People have reacted to this status quo in whichever way possible for them: those who can afford motor vehicles buy cars and motorcycles (or use ride-sharing services), and those who can't afford them are left to fight it out with the options remaining to them. Rickshaws are one of these options, and a particularly popular one at that.\nA significant segment of Dhaka residents are people who can't afford cars, but for whom cheap bus travel is not appealing either. These are people who typically travel shorter distances, and they would rather spend some extra money on a rickshaw than expose themselves to the horrors of Dhaka's public transportation. If our footpaths were wide and flat, shaded and clean, then maybe these trips would be made on foot. If wide footpaths were paired with safe cycling lanes, walking and cycling could replace Dhaka's rickshaws altogether.\nThe problem with banning a mode of transportation without creating suitable alternatives is that the demand for transportation isn't something that just goes away. People need to get places, and when their preferred, or in many cases, only mode of transportation is taken away from them, whether or not it is banned or illegal does not matter. Rickshaw owners know this well, which is why when the previous bans were announced, they did not shy away from flouting the rules. The number of rickshaws in Dhaka's roads may go up or down, but there is hardly a place in our city where rickshaws are never seen.\nSo, what is the outlook for the future? Will Dhaka be forever inundated with rickshaws? Are motorists in this city bound for eternity to match the speed of a rickshaw blocking an exit?\nThe answer is yes, if rickshaws are forever viewed as a problem in isolation and not as a part of a problem-stricken transportation ecosystem. If rickshaws must go, something must come and replace them. This something needs to be better in terms of speed, comfort, and cost. Considering the fact that Dhaka's neighbourhoods are anything but homogenous, these solutions must be formulated on a case-by-case basis. What is the reason behind battery-run rickshaws being abundant in Uttara and parts of Mirpur, while in most other neighbourhoods, they only come out at night? If rickshaws primarily serve as a method of travel within a certain area, then the replacement for rickshaws in that area must consider the population and size of the neighbourhood, consider whether the dominant class of residents is families with school-going children or younger professionals. If the roads in an area are so narrow that only rickshaws can use them, then banning rickshaws would mean reorganising the area in such a way that all essential services are accessible on foot.\nBeyond traffic and city-planning challenges, there is an economic challenge to banning rickshaws in Dhaka as well. According to a report in this daily, there are over 11 lakh pedal rickshaws in Dhaka, registered and unregistered. These rickshaws sustain the livelihoods of millions of rickshaw pullers and rickshaw mechanics, who in turn contribute over Tk 30,000 crore to the rural economy of Bangladesh every year. The prospective unemployment of such a large number of individuals cannot be taken lightly, and if any rickshaw bans are enacted, the gradual rehabilitation of rickshaw pullers into productive and long-term employment must be a part of the process.\nBanning rickshaws in Dhaka is an easy solution to a difficult problem, but Dhaka's traffic is a complicated problem that needs multifaceted efforts to combat it. Rickshaws have been around for nearly a century, thus trying to get rid of them overnight is a rash and unwise course of action. Battery-run rickshaws pose a significant safety threat, so standardising these vehicles to make them safer and issuing licences for rickshaw pullers can be a more deliberative first step, until viable alternatives are presented. The illegal power consumption by battery-run rickshaws must be curbed\u2014not by cutting them off from electricity, but by creating legal options for charging, and making sure that only registered rickshaws and licensed rickshaw pullers can access these legal, possibly cheap, charging options. Enforcement of traffic rules on the roads is paramount, not just for rickshaws, but for cars, buses, trucks, and all other forms of transportation.\nIf rickshaws are to be banned anywhere, analysing the routes where they are most common and deploying cheap, environment-friendly alternatives are a must-do. If a functional transportation hierarchy is established, demand for rickshaws within that system will slowly shrink anyway. But forcefully creating a vacuum in the amount of transportation options available to the public will only invite more anarchy, something that is in ample supply on Dhaka's roads already.\nAzmin Azran\u00a0is digital features coordinator at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "That Malaysia once again is set to close its labour market to Bangladeshi migrant workers starting June 01 next highlights the danger of Bangladesh's flawed manpower export system in which fraudulent recruiting agencies enjoy free rein to exploit outbound workers. Although the authorities cited an oversupply of workers as the reason for restricting the entry of Bangladeshi workers, stakeholders pointed out that market mismanagement could be the main cause. This is the fifth time Malaysia has imposed restrictions on the entry of Bangladeshi workers, with earlier restrictions implemented in 1996, 2001, 2009, and 2018. Of late, Oman and the UAE have also imposed similar restrictions due to the exploitation of migrant workers and malpractices in the manpower sector. Regrettably, the authorities responsible for overseeing the manpower sector activities have failed to learn any lesson from the past mistakes and address the problems. Their failures have not only made the expatriate workers vulnerable to exploitation but also affected the manpower export potential.Closure of several vital manpower export markets will have a serious impact on the foreign exchange earnings of the country on the one hand and the livelihood of the families of the job seekers on the other. Remittance inflow has been erratic for the past few months; it will be further affected by this unwanted turn of events. For the last couple of months, it has been frequently reported that about 0.1 to 0.2 million Bangladeshis who migrated to Malaysia, spending their last farthings, were thrown into tremendous hardships as they didn't find the jobs they were promised. Even a panel of UN experts voiced their concern over the miserable condition of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, putting the country under significant international pressure to uphold workers' rights. Since then stakeholders concerned started fearing that Kuala Lumpur would soon impose restrictions on the entry of Bangladeshi workers. The government agencies concerned were aware of the developments but unfortunately did not do anything tangible to avert the closure of this vital market.Malaysia reopened its labour market to Bangladeshi workers in 2022 following a two-year closure. At that time, it was expected that steps would be taken to streamline the recruitment system, but to no avail. A group of 100 Bangladeshi recruiting agencies allegedly formed a syndicate to send workers to Malaysia, charging each worker as much as Tk 0.5 million instead of the government-fixed Tk 80,000. About 0.4 million workers have gone to Malaysia since 2022, but a substantial number of them did not find the jobs they were promised upon arrival. Fraudulent manpower agencies in Malaysia were also involved in this scam, while regulatory bodies in both countries blindly approved the hiring procedures. Going by the promises made by the ministry concerned to set things right, everyone expected the situation would be better this time. But that didn't happen.Considering the importance of remittance earning by migrant workers, the problem and prospect of the manpower export sector come under discussion time and again. At a certain point, government to government (G2G) recruitment protocol was advanced to bypass the recruiting malpractices. Why was it stymied? It would be in the fitness of things to revive the negotiations on the G2G recruitment process for ensuring Bangladeshi workers' unhindered entry into that Southeast Asian stable and expanding job market.",

        "full_article": "Amid media reports that the ethnic Arakan Army (AA) has seized control of the Buthidaung Township of the Rakhine State near Bangladesh border with the Myanmar junta's army in full retreat, the Asian Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR) has called upon the United Nations, ASEAN and wider international community to take urgent steps to prevent mass killing of Rohingya population now under siege by the AA. APHR said that since Friday (May 17), Rohingya civilians in Buthidaung town and surrounding villages have been under heavy gunfire and arson attack on houses by AA. This raises fresh concern about the fate of the Rohingya population who remained in the Rakhine state of Myanmar following 2017's massacre at the hands of the Myanmar army that led to more than 700,000 of Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. In February this year, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged both the Myanmar security forces and the AA to take immediate measures to minimise harm to Rohingya and other civilians caught in the crossfire following the resumption of armed hostilities between AA and Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) after a yearlong unofficial ceasefire. Myanmar junta's attitude towards the Rohingya is well-known. They would miss no opportunity to abuse, torture and kill the Rhingya people. Alarming reports were already coming from foreign media sources on how the Tatmadaw was orchestrating Rohingya protest against the AA. A news website, The Irrawaddy, run by Myanmarese exiles based in Thailand, in its March 22 report said how the Tatmadaw was trying to sow seeds of ethnic discord in the Rakhine state. Tatmadaw was rounding up Rohingya villagers and forcing them to stage demonstrations against the AA and using those fake demos through the propaganda media under Myanmar military's control. It is not that the AA is unaware of it. Even so, this age-old policy of playing one social group against another works and can cause the intended damage. To all appearances, the damage has been done. The Rohingya are now facing two adversaries at the moment-the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA). In this connection, the chief of the UN Human Rights,Volker T\u00fcrk, last month warned that intensified fighting in the Rakhine State between the military and the AA was fuelling tension between the Rohingya and the ethnic Rakhine communities (majority of them being Buddhist) fearing that past atrocities might be repeated. Notably, even during 2017's Rohingya massacre members of the majority Rakhine ethnic community took part in the attacks on Rohingya population alongside the Myanmar military. As reported in April 2024 from UN sources, 15 out of 17 townships of the Rakhine State were affected by the fighting resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries and displacement of about 300,00 people. Being mainly Rohingya-dominated areas, they were obviously facing a grave risk. That was more so because, outraged by their defeat at the hands of the AA, the Myanmar military was forcibly conscripting, bribing and coercing the Rohingya men to join their ranks. That was evidently the cause for resentment of the AA and the majority ethnic group of Rakhine State against the Rohingya. Understandably, the development prompted the UN Human Rights chief to warn the international communities against the repeat of 2017 against the Rohingya community. The Rohingya people are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place. It is unfortunate that though the Rohingya community constitutes the second largest chunk of the Rakhine State's population after the Buddhist Rakhines, they are the worst victims of persecution in that country. What is troubling is that unless there is any rapprochement between the Rohingya people still residing in the Rakhine State and the AA, we might again witness another wave of these people seeking refuge in Bangladesh because of the persecution. In this context, can we expect any result from the call the Human Rights bodies including Parliamentarians from Southeast Asia has made urging UN bodies, international community and influential countries of the region to prevail upon the warring ethnic groups like the AA and the Myanmar regime for not starting another round of extermination campaign against the remaining Rohingya population in the Rakhine State of Myanmar? Since APHR has already (on May 18) reported on the indiscriminate attack by the Arakan Army on the besieged Rohingya population in the northern Rakine State, it is clear that the Myanmar military has succeeded in its mission to finish the task of annihilating the Rohingya from Myanmar's soil. It does not matter who does the work for them.Already overburdened with all the Rohingya refugees that came here since 1970s, let alone the influxes of the 1990s and 2017, any fresh inrush of refugees would be the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. With the situation in neighbouring Myanmar going from bad to worse every passing day, the prospect of repatriating Rohingya refugees to their homeland is getting dimmer. For any negotiation towards Rohingya repatriation to take place would require a stable government in Naypyidaw. So, there is no scope on Bangladesh's part to sit out the ongoing crisis in Myanmar. Strong diplomatic efforts keeping backchannels open would be required to watch over developments as well as making deals with emerging forces in Myanmar. This is not just for an amicable settlement of the refugee issue. The government has also a huge stake in seeing that we have a friendly neighbour on the Southeastern border. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "For two consecutive days \u2013 Friday and Saturday, two contemporaries have carried reports on unearthing of clandestinely stored chicken eggs in cold storages in Madaripur and Cumilla. In Madaripur, the haul was to the tune of 0.60 million and in Lalmai of Cumilla, the cache was even bigger at 2.1 million. Reportedly, in Madaripur, there is no poultry farm and hence people in the district largely depend on supplies from other areas. What is more, the egg market is under the control of two wholesale egg traders there. There is nothing to be surprised if the wholesalers of other areas of the country have also gone for similar hoarding of this popular item. Even the hauled eggs at the two places amounting to 2.7 million together, according to the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP), can create an artificial crisis of eggs in the market. That a dozen of eggs has registered a price hike of Tk 12-15 over the past week is not for nothing. The business syndicate is certainly responsible for this latest round of hike. The crafty wholesalers of eggs have been storing, reveal cold storage owners, since late Ramadan when eggs were comparatively cheaper after a spike earlier. Now the question is, cold storages where the eggs were stored are not meant for storing the item but for potato. Eggs are usually disposed of immediately after hens lay them in farms so that those reach the dining table in a fresh condition. Unwashed eggs stay good in normal condition roughly for two weeks and refrigerated eggs for three months. If eggs are stored in cold storage, there is a price to be paid for the facility. While in other countries, eggs are refrigerated only in time of production boom, here the trade syndicate hoards those in order to manipulate the market for an artificial crisis. In case of Cumilla egg haul, a team headed by an assistant director of the DNCRP, Cumilla and a magistrate of the district administration conducted the raid on the cold storage which unsurprisingly has no licence. A fine of Tk200,000 was slapped on the cold storage owner. At the same time, a sweetmeat trader who stored 24,000 kilograms of sweets was also fined Tk 60,000. Intriguingly, the cold storage owner could not or did not divulge the name/names of egg trader or traders who stored the eggs. That the storage owner does not know egg trader/s is unbelievable. There is a procedure under which at least some minimum documents are needed for a deal between traders and cold storage authorities. Although an order was given for marketing the eggs within 48 hours and the agricultural marketing officer of the area was instructed to submit a report whether the eggs and sweetmeat have been duly marketed or not, the move falls short of the need. The more important thing is to nab the egg traders who stored such a large number of eggs. A police case should be started in order to probe into the matter and catch the real culprit or culprits. A similar move should be initiated for the Madaripur marketing malpractice. If the unholy bunch is quizzed, maybe, a bigger racket will get exposed. The unholy alliances in businesses have gone too far to be contained. If one of those, for example, that of egg, can be broken by meting out exemplary punishment, others will think twice before playing their customary vile game of fleecing consumers. So the question is, if the administration is serious enough to punish the evil syndicates and give the ordinary people some relief from the outrageously manipulated soaring prices. Last but not least, marketing of sweetmeat hauled raises the issue of the food's shelf life. There was a need for ensuring that the sweets were safe for consumption before giving an order for marketing.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "I'm writing to draw attention to the big money problems in Bangladesh right now. We need to figure out how to fix them and make sure our country can grow steadily. One big problem is depreciation of our currency. This hurts businesses and regular people because it makes things like imports more expensive and causes prices to go up. Also, we're spending more money than we're making, which is a big issue. To fix this, we need to be smarter about how we use our money, like making better budgets and collecting taxes more efficiently. This will help our country's finances stay healthy and help our economy grow. Plus, with all the problems caused by COVID-19 around the world, it's even more important for us to find new ways to make money and make sure important industries like farming, manufacturing, and technology can keep going strong. In short, we need everyone - the government, banks, and businesses - to work together to solve these financial problems and make sure the economy grow strong. \nFahmida Akter Pothi Student North South University [email\u00a0protected]",
