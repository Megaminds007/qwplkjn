The Court has struck a blow for media freedom by ruling that the government could not term critical coverage or airing of critical opinions as \u201canti-establishment\u201d, and so initiate action. It said: \u201cThe use of such a terminology... represents an expectation that the press must support the establishment.\u201d The denial of security clearance to a media channel on the basis of views it was entitled to hold \u201cproduces a chilling effect on free speech and particularly on press freedom\u201d. The Bench also cited substantive grounds to allow MediaOne\u2019s petitions: that security clearance cannot be denied based on its alleged anti-establishment stance or a bald claim that its shareholders have links with the Jamaat-e-Islami. The Court has rightly found fault with the approach of the Kerala High Court, which had accepted material in a sealed cover on why the Home Ministry denied security clearance to the channel. It expressed surprise that the High Court did not explain how it felt the denial of security clearance was justified even after noting that the gravity of the issue was not discernible from the files.A significant aspect of the judgment is that it seeks to end the casual resort to \u2018sealed cover procedure\u2019 by courts by suggesting an alternative approach to state claims of immunity from publication in public interest. Drawing upon both Indian and foreign jurisprudence, the Bench has said it is now an established principle of natural justice that relevant material must be disclosed to the affected party, ensuring that the right to appeal can be effectively exercised. It acknowledges that confidentiality and national security could be \u201clegitimate aims for the purpose of limiting procedural guarantees\u201d. However, a blanket immunity from disclosure of all reports could not be granted and that the validity of the involvement of such considerations must be assessed by the use of relevant tests. It could be ascertained if there is proof that non-disclosure is in the interest of national security and whether a reasonable person would come to the same inference from it. In a bid to balance the public interest in non-disclosure with the one in ensuring a fair hearing, the Court has mooted alternatives such as redacting sensitive portions and providing a gist of the material given to the affected party. The Court could also appoint an amicus curiae, who could be given access to the material whenever the state claims immunity from disclosure.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nmedia\n\n/\n\ntelevision",

        "full_article": "Bhutan\u2019s fifth king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck\u2019s visit to India this week had both substance and subtext. After talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Droupadi Murmu, the joint statement detailed cooperation in many areas. India has agreed to support Bhutan\u2019s next development plans and extend additional standby lines of credit. Hydropower, the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of India-Bhutan ties, also received a boost, with the government agreeing to consider Bhutanese requests for expediting long-delayed projects (Sankosh and Punatsangchhu), revising upwards the tariff on Chhukha, the oldest project, and buying power from the Basochhu power project. New infrastructure projects include an integrated checkpoint for trucks at Jaigaon, a checkpoint for third country nationals and a cross-border rail link from Kokrajhar to Gelephu. Future partnerships could include space research, skilling, startups and STEM education, and a new Internet gateway for Bhutan, in keeping with the Bhutanese king\u2019s new \u201cTransform Initiative\u201d. The Bhutanese government is also worried about the number of Bhutanese migrating overseas as youth unemployment in 2021 reached 21%. India too needs to pay more attention to this brain drain, as, in the past, Bhutan\u2019s elite would have been educated in India. India stands to lose its edge in Bhutanese policy making and public narrative, and thus the projects outlined stand to benefit Delhi and Thimphu in keeping the talent within.However, it is the visit\u2019s subtext \u2014 after recent comments by Bhutan\u2019s Prime Minister Lotay Tshering indicating progress in China-Bhutan boundary talks \u2014 that must cause concern. In an interview to a European paper, he had said that Bhutan and China hope to agree on demarcating their northern boundary dispute in the next \u201c1-2 meetings\u201d. This must set alarm bells ringing as China has offered this demarcation as part of a \u201cpackage deal\u201d with Doklam, the area near the trijunction with India, and strategically sensitive given its proximity to India\u2019s Siliguri corridor. While Bhutan is clear that all talks about the trijunction would be \u201ctrilateral\u201d, India\u2019s concerns extend to any change in the area surrounding it, so there needs to be full clarity on the issue. New Delhi must also not allow hyper-nationalism and its antagonism with China to pressure Bhutan. India\u2019s time-tested ties with Bhutan have been predicated on not seeing each other in terms of the difference in their size but in counting each country\u2019s prosperity as a win-win for both. More importantly, they have always anticipated the other\u2019s interests before taking any step that could affect their long-cherished partnership.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBhutan\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nelectricity production and distribution\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nspace programme\n\n/\n\nstartups\n\n/\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\ntechnology (general)\n\n/\n\nengineering\n\n/\n\nmathematics\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\ninternet\n\n/\n\ninterview",

        "full_article": "By Ashok Vohra\nHanuman is said to be the greatest devotee of Ram, and according to scriptures, even Shiv states that no one is as blessed as him. Sita too blesses him thus, \u201cMay you become a repository of strength and virtue, dear son\u2026 and may the Lord of the Raghus shower his abundant grace on you. \u201d\nRam himself acknowledges: \u201cNo one endowed with a body \u2013 a god, human being or sage \u2013 has put me under such obligation, Hanuman, as you have done. Even my mind shrinks to face you; how, then, can I repay your obligation? Listen, my son: I have thought over the question and concluded that the debt which I owe you cannot be repaid. \u201d\nThe name \u2018Hanuman\u2019 is a compound of two terms, \u2018hanu\u2019 and \u2018maan\u2019. \u2018Hanu\u2019 means \u2018jaw\u2019 and \u2018maan\u2019 means \u2018prominent or disfigured\u2019. So, \u2018Hanuman\u2019 means \u2018the one with a disfigured jaw\u2019. Hanumanreceived this name when Indra hit child Hanuman on the jaw to free Sun God from his mouth. The linguistic variations of Hanuman are: Hanumat in Hindi/Sanskrit, Anuman in Tamil, Hanumatha in Kannada, Hanumathudu in Telugu.\nSome of the other synonyms of Hanuman referring to his physique are: Bajrang Bali \u2013 the one who has limbs as strong as vajra \u2013 diamonds; Mahakaya \u2013 gigantic; Mahabali \u2013 the strongest one; Vir or Mahavir \u2013 most valiant; and Panchavaktra \u2013 \u2018five-faced\u2019.\nReferring to his status, he is called Kapeeshwara, Kapindra, or Vanerendra \u2013 the lord of monkeys; Ram-doot \u2013 the messenger of Ram; Rambhakta \u2013 the devotee of Ram; Vanarkulathin Thondaiman \u2013 descendant of the monkey clan; and Lankadahi \u2013 the one who set Lanka on fire.\nBased on his power to alleviate fears,dangers, and hurdles of his devotees, he is called Sankat Mochan. The followers of Madhvacharya, the prominent Dvaitin, dualist, call him Mukhya Prana Devaru \u2013 primordial life giver.\nThe earliest reference to a divine monkey \u2013 Vrishkapi \u2013 is found in the Rig Ved hymn 10:86. The king of gods, Indra, treats the monkey as a friend and is willing to share all his wealth with him, and makes all efforts to live with him peacefully.\nThe origin and deeds of Hanuman have been narrated in the Puranas too. While the Shiv Purana sees Hanuman as an avatar \u2013incarnation of Shiv, all other scriptures mention him as the spiritual son of Vayu and an avatar \u2013 incarnation of Rudra.\nIn southern Indian literature, Hanuman represents the synthesis of Shiv and Vishnu. The seventeenth century Odishi bhakti poet, Dinakrushna Das,asserts in the Rasavinoda that the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh jointly take the form of Hanuman.\nJaina Acharya Vimalsuri in his version of Ramayan titled Paumacariya, also known as Padmacharit, mentions Hanuman not as a divine monkey, but as a Vidyadhara, a supernatural being, demigod in Jain cosmology. He is the son of Pavangati, wind deity, and Anjana Sundari. He is named Hanumat and Shrishaila.\nThough traditions may differ in the names, forms and origin of Hanuman, they unanimously agree that Hanuman is a paradigm of the synthesis of bhakti and shakti, strength, a bestower of positive energy, slayer of all evils and negativities, healer of all ailments, pains and sorrows and an example of courage, fortitude and excellence.\n\n",

A school boy simplistically described it as \u201cMilk goes to sleep at night. Wakes up in the morning tight. \u201d But it got more complicated recently. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) was clearly not \u2018full of the milk of human curdness\u2019 as Lady Macbeth did not say when she feared her husband lacked the gut bacteria to \u2018set\u2019 up Duncan. On March 10, the central watchdog had decreed that labels should use \u2018dahi\u2019 instead of \u2018curd\u2019.\nPredictably, MK Stalin shot back that southern states wouldn\u2019t take such an \u201cunabashed imposition of Hindi\u201d lenin down. He warned that forces guilty of such \u201cbrazen disregard to our mother tongues\u201d would be banished from the south forever. Even Tamil Nadu\u2019s BJP chief decided that discretion was the better part of swagger, and asked FSSAI for a rollback.\nSo, as of March 30, labels may use the term \u2018curd\u2019 with any local variant such as \u2018thayir\u2019, \u2018mosaru\u2019, \u2018zamuut daud\u2019 and yes \u2018dahi\u2019 suffixed in brackets. Parsi-Gujarati has an exasperated term \u2018dahi na kar\u2019 to tick off those making nonsensical arguments. However this literal playing out is arguably more legit than the absurd controversies currently curdling public discourse.\nLanguage riots have almost kept pace with our Babel nation\u2019s riot of languages. Tamil Nadu had always led the charge of the fight-back brigade. In 1937, the legendary Periyar volleyed and thundered against the cannon of Hindi being fired into Madras Presidency schools which had been mandated by the first Indian National Congress government \u2013 headed by the proud, erudite Tamilian, C Rajagopalachari ! But it was Tilak who first articulated the emotive pride, aka powder keg, of language. In an 1891 Kesari edit, he urged the reorganisaton of provinces on linguistic lines. This became a reality in 1956, but it hasn\u2019t yet silenced the vernacking of our state borders.\nThe recent dahi discontent is merely the latest example of this neverending ferment.\n\n",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s database on justice delivery indicators resides in silos, making it hard to derive a coherent big picture. India Justice Report 2022, a multi-organisation effort, pulls together 102 indicators to rank the capacity of states across four major justice delivery mechanisms \u2013 police, judiciary, prisons and legal aid. In the third edition of IJR, Karnataka topped the ranking. Five of the top six places are taken up by states from southern India. These positions aren\u2019t fixed \u2013 an important message of IJR 2022 is that small but consistent improvements lead to big jumps in ranking. That\u2019s how Karnataka jumped 13 places since IJR 2020 to the top in 2022.\nFormer CJI UU Lalit, who\u2019s written the foreword to IJR, fears that India\u2019s capacity to satisfactorily deliver justice lags its demand. The data in the report bears out his apprehension. This is the foremost challenge in the criminal justice system. To illustrate, 77% of India\u2019s prison population is made up of undertrials, people who haven\u2019t been convicted. On average, they are spending longer time in prison than before. Undertrials serving more than five years in prison have more than doubled to 11,490 in the period between December 2017 and December 2021. The message from the data has led IJR 2022 to conclude that while there are 50 million pending cases, the dismal fact is that they are taking longer to resolve. This will only worsen India\u2019s capacity to deliver justice.\nAccording to Lalit, 70% of litigants in criminal cases are below the poverty line. In this context, India\u2019s justice delivery system has been weakened by an alarming decline in legal aid provision. Between 2020 and 2022, IJR data showed that there was a 67% decline in legal services clinics. There were just 4,742 clinics at the end of 2022. This may well be an explanatory factor in deterioration of other indicators such as the average length of time spent in jail by undertrials. While debates about the collegium hog attention, the plumbing of the justice delivery system is being neglected. Our focus needs reorientation.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Bitter differences over the history to be taught in school textbooks are neither new, nor confined to India. But this debate has higher stakes here because school learning outcomes are poor and improving them is critical to empowering millions. A grounding in objective facts, and before that the idea of shared objective facts, is the minimum bedrock for India\u2019s progress. When textbook revisions take place in a way that suggests the facts of our dense history can be replaced by \u2018new facts\u2019 with every \u2018new mood of the nation\u2019, it entrenches the dangerous disease that goes by the name of \u2018WhatsApp University\u2019 instead of remedying it.\nWith the Yogi government notifying last week that UP board schools will fully teach NCERT\u2019s \u2018rationalised\u2019 syllabi from the 2023-24 session, these \u2018rationalisations\u2019 made last year have come under the spotlight again. Unfortunately, the quality that is standing out is lack of reason. When quizzed about the deletion of content on Mughal rulers or how RSS was banned after Gandhi\u2019s assassination or the Emergency\u2019s abuses of power or the 2002 Gujarat riots, the NCERT director has tried to offload all agency onto the \u2018expert committees\u2019 and called the debate itself \u2018unnecessary\u2019. But BJP leaders have done this defence no favours by welcoming how NCERT has moved \u2018Akbar, Babar, Shahjahan, Aurangzeb\u2019 from the history books to the \u2018dustbin\u2019.\nInterpretations change with time and with different social movements and political dispensations. This happens everywhere. As do changes in emphasis. In the US the critical race theory controversy has highlighted how differently different states teach the Jim Crow laws and the civil rights movement. The UK continues to be embattled in how much of the Empire\u2019s depredations to acknowledge inside the classrooms. But such interchanges have a very different shape than something that happens, for example, in Bangladesh \u2013 which leader announced the country\u2019s independence changes every time Awami League and BNP switch governments. Writing fresh narratives advances discourse. Simply deleting facts creates epistemic fractures that wound and ultimately disable conversation.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Tuesday's devastating fire at Bangabazar was not the first such incident recorded there, nor was it the only one of this scale. But it serves as a reminder \u2013 if new reminders were at all needed \u2013 that safety risks are built into the very model of urbanisation followed by Bangladesh, where building codes and fire safety regulations are seldom enforced. For example, before the Bangabazar market fire, which gutted nearly 3,000 shops full of clothes, building authorities were sent notices on 10 occasions over the last four years. The fire safety department also put up a banner there with warnings of fire risks. But business interests triumphed over safety requirements, to disturbing consequences.\nIn 2019, the fire service department carried out a survey on 3,786 institutions and establishments across the country, and found that 541 shopping complexes and markets were at high risk. Bangabazar was one of them. It is not just markets and commercial establishments, but a large number of residential buildings in major cities are also believed to be at high risk of accidents because of their lack of structural and electrical safety \u2013 either they were not constructed following buildings codes, or are poorly maintained, or have no fire safety system in place. The possibility of building fires or collapses literally lurks at every corner, as some of the recent incidents have shown.\nThe Bangabazar incident serves up several other lessons as well. For example, the risk of dilapidated buildings. Reportedly, a six-year-old city corporation initiative to build a 10-storey shopping mall at Bangabazar never saw the light of day because of disagreements over rehabilitation of traders for the duration of the construction work. The Dhaka South City Corporation had apparently finalised the design and even hired a contractor. But construction couldn't begin because of a stay order from the High Court. Had this issue been resolved and traders were rehabilitated to make way for the new building, Tuesday's tragedy could have been certainly averted.\nAnother issue brought forth by the Bangabazar fire is the declining number of ponds and wetlands in major cities, especially in Dhaka. While urban water bodies are filled to construct buildings and marketplaces, their absence is most acutely felt when there is a fire in one of those buildings and there is no water nearby to douse it, as it happened in case of Bangabazar. The irony of the situation is inescapable. Ponds not only play a vital role in dousing flames but also create a healthy atmosphere and ease waterlogging. Unfortunately, there are few ponds left in central Dhaka, which is an issue that will continue to put us in trouble if not addressed urgently.\nHaving witnessed the consequence of inaction or delaying action in case of fire safety, we really have no alternative but to act immediately. We urge the authorities to prepare a comprehensive work plan to address the safety of buildings and markets identified as risky by Rajuk and the fire department. They must try to find a way to overcome legal and logistical issues that are working as impediments. The safety of citizens must be prioritised.\n",

        "full_article": "This piece is not to contest but to contend, not to rebut but to debate, not to counter but to inquire, not to make sweeping judgement without facts, but to judge on the basis of facts, not to put labels because it suits one's point of view, but to categorise the issue as it confronts us. Most importantly, it is not to point a finger at others, but to point a finger at ourselves to ask what the state of our beloved profession is, to pursue which we risk our lives and livelihoods. Finally, this piece is to most earnestly and humbly encourage my fellow journalists to introspect, to ask, to search \u2013 in their work, but more importantly in their hearts and minds \u2013 as to where objective journalism ends and political journalism begins.\nThis piece is also to sincerely urge my fellow journalists to think most seriously about how to address the problems of mistakes that inevitably occur in print, electronic and online media.\nOn an average, the legacy media \u2013 others may do less \u2013 publishes nearly 250-300 reports every 24 hours. If we include photographs, cartoons (political types are conspicuously absent these days, leading to the question as to why), infographics, photo captions, etc, the number reaches nearly 350. If we add multimedia content to that, we climb to an even higher figure. To tackle such a huge number of items \u2013 from gathering facts, writing, editing, to page setting, inserting photos, caption writing, audio recording, filming \u2013 is a Himalayan task, to say the least. It is to the enormous credit of our journalist colleagues that mistakes occur only very rarely. If \"to err is human,\" then mistakes will occur however hard we try. And hence, we must address it urgently.\nThere are, however, tried and tested and universally accepted laid down rules to handle mistakes made by media outlets. These have come after many trials and errors and on the basis of decades of experience from across the world. Do we follow them? If not, should we not? And shouldn't we, the journalists, be at the forefront to demand adherence to said rules? Are we doing so? Or are we busy demonising our fellow journalists for mistakes that are easily explainable journalistically?\nThat should lead the journalists to this question: what triggered such frenzied activism among some of us to denigrate our most prestigious Bangla daily? Was the coverage of the \"mistake\" of\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0done journalistically? Was the search for\u00a0Prothom Alo's\u00a0so-called \"motives\" factually founded? Why did \"opinions\" start to be treated like \"facts\"? Why was a newspaper not judged by its long track record, but only by one or two mistakes, which were then interpreted according to the views of the critics without reference to facts? Would it be totally illogical on our part to conclude that no journalistic norms were followed while castigating\u00a0Prothom Alo? Would we be wrong to further conclude that it was not\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0that had an agenda, but others \u2013 and the agenda was to intimidate an independent voice and force it towards greater self-censorship?\nThe case in hand is as follows. The editor of\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0was sued under the anti-media Digital Security Act (DSA). Its Savar correspondent was literally kidnapped when, at dawn, law enforcement members mostly in plain clothes descended in a gang-like fashion on his house. They picked him up without a warrant, did not tell the victim or his family why he was being taken in, and where he was being taken to. He was kept incommunicado for the next 30 hours. He was then produced before a court and sent to jail.\nThe question before the journalists should have been: what was his crime? Misreporting? Which part of his report was false? The whole controversy centred around the use of a photo of a boy and the quote that belonged to a day labourer, which was clearly attributed. As journalists, do we not know that a reporter is neither responsible for the heading of a story nor for its display? In none of the statements, save that of the DRU, were questions asked as to why the said reporter was denied all his constitutional rights when he was \"picked up\" without any legal basis whatsoever. So do our rights stand for nothing when a high-up orders one of us to be \"picked up\"? Shouldn't journalists have asked that question?\nThe statements condemned\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0for \"damaging the image of the country.\" Shouldn't journalists raise their voice in unison that no citizen, let alone a fellow journalist, can be sued or arrested on such an imprecise, undefined and subjective notion as \"damaging the image\"? A law by definition cannot be vague. It has to be clear, unambiguous, and specific. Otherwise, it's not a law but an instrument of harassment and oppression, as the DSA has become.\nMore fundamentally, what is \"damaging the image\" to a politician could easily be \"investigative reporting\" to a journalist. Somebody can claim that reporting on Bangabazar fire, road accidents, adulterated medicine, air pollution, sound pollution, river encroachment, arsenic in water, unbridled corruption, most bus and truck drivers having fake licences and their vehicles having no fitness certificates, all directly or indirectly impinge on the image of the country. But is reporting on them demeaning our independence? If, as journalists, we do not see the public interest in all this, then why call ourselves journalists? We might as well close shop and open PR agencies.\nThe government, the ruling party, and those who have issued the recent statements have forgotten the role\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0played during BNP's rule in highlighting corruption and exposing the excesses committed by Tareque Zia and Hawa Bhaban. They have forgotten the newspaper's role in exposing the heinous attempt to divert the investigation into the assassination attempt on the present prime minister. Who exposed the \"Joj Mia\" ploy? Could any other paper do the expos\u00e9s that it did?\nThe accusers of\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0argue that it was not a mistake they made, but a deliberate action in fulfilment of their longstanding \"agenda,\" which is to destabilise our \"independence and make our Liberation War questionable.\" A quote from one day-labourer juxtaposed on a photo of a child can do all that? Are the claims based on facts or any content analysis of the paper? Where is this coming from? If the accusers are correct, then we must be reading different newspapers. According to\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0critics, after 50 years of establishment of our state, our Liberation War and our independence remain so fragile, so weak, so full of doubt that one report sets these foundational pillars tottering? Are they not making a mockery of everything we stand for? This is when we are about to graduate into the Developing Country status. Who is damaging Bangladesh's reputation?\nOn the other side, what is the long-term track record of\u00a0Prothom Alo? Ever since its inception, it has been a staunch supporter of everything Bangladesh stands for \u2013 our Language Movement, the movements of the 50s, 60s and 70s, our Liberation War, Bangabandhu's seminal role, secularism, democracy, political, economic and cultural rights of the people, etc. Its role against extremism is second to none. It celebrates our economic growth and every other success far more enthusiastically than many of its critics.\nThe government, the ruling party, and those who have issued the recent statements have forgotten the role\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0played during BNP's rule in highlighting corruption and exposing the excesses committed by Tareque Zia and Hawa Bhaban. They have forgotten the newspaper's role in exposing the heinous attempt to divert the investigation into the assassination attempt on the present prime minister. Who exposed the \"Joj Mia\" ploy? Could any other paper do the expos\u00e9s that it did?\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0exposed the BNP government's nefarious attempt to shield the unearthing of the plot behind the death of 24 Awami Leaguers, including the party's women's wing leader Ivy Rahman, in the same incident. Who exposed the voter list fraud? Who repeatedly wrote about the Hawa Bhaban and Bangabhaban connection during Iajuddin Ahmed's presidency? What was\u00a0Prothom Alo's\u00a0role during the BDR mutiny, which was clear and present danger to the newly formed Awami League government?\nProthom Alo\u00a0played the usual role that an independent media plays \u2013 that of a \"watchdog\" on the power of the day. The paper has played the same professional role during the Awami League's 14-year tenure. The Awami League leaders and ministers may forget that. But should the journalists?\nIt is my view that\u00a0Prothom Alo's\u00a0mistake (which can itself be debated in a journalism class. However, I am accepting it for the sake of my arguments) was turned into a political ploy to demonise a professional media outlet and pressurise it to change its independent stance. Otherwise, how can the \"Bashanti\" issue (concerning a photograph published in\u00a0Ittefaq\u00a0in 1974) suddenly come up. On what basis is the comparison being done with the recent piece in\u00a0Prothom Alo? It was deliberately done to drive fear and bring partisan political factors into play to confuse us.\nAll the talk of\u00a0Prothom Alo's\u00a0so-called controversial role on issues relating to our Liberation War, independence struggle and Bangladesh's economic success has no basis in facts. Whatever critical reporting the paper did and does fall within its moral and professional role of keeping power accountable. It is not for nothing that\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0has gained such public acceptance and adulation both at home and among Bangladeshis abroad.\nAs the heading of my piece states, only we journalists can protect our profession. Everybody else, in the name of helping journalism, wants to use us. When the government extends a helping hand, it wants journalists to toe its line. When the business community offers help, the price is to overlook their bending of the law. When law enforcers act friendly, they want us to soften our reports on their circumvention of the rules. When politicians praise us, it is only because they are not, at that moment, on the buttered side of the bread and are certain to sing the opposite tune once in power. And the story goes on. Nobody wants us to be independent, to be objective and say the truth. And that's where our challenge lies. And that's why we must be together in spite of our differences.\nThat does not mean we will not differ, sometimes even vigorously so on social, cultural and, most importantly, political issues. As journalists, we may hold diametrically opposite political views, but we can never allow those differences to affect our journalism. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a US senator from New York, once said, \"You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.\"\nI am in my twilight years of journalism. Perhaps only a few years of it are still left. I started with the\u00a0Bangladesh Observer\u00a0in April 1972, immediately on return from the most glorious phase of my life when, with millions of others, it was my proud privilege to be a member of the Mukti Bahini. After co-founding it, I have spent the last 32 years with\u00a0The Daily Star. So I can claim to have a modicum of experience as a journalist.\nSince my time is limited, it is my younger colleagues who will face the future, and it is to them I have addressed this piece. I unreservedly and unequivocally say that journalism is one of the noblest of professions there is. Like education, a society needs journalism to grow intellectually, democratically, equitably, and justly. It needs it to ensure fairness and to give protection to individuals and groups that power oppresses. It needs it to keep leaders in check and administrators accountable. Most importantly, society needs journalism to enjoy all the beauty that freedom offers.\nCondemn me to your heart's content if you find what I have said above unacceptable, but please don't fail to ask the questions I have raised, the most vital of which is: are we, as journalists, able to think freely, or are we being clouded by prejudice, politics and financial interest?\nThe answer to it will determine the future of our journalism. Please remember: only journalists can protect journalism.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Someone of Indian origin emailed me in 2014 with some queries from Saudi Arabia, where he was teaching at a university. I was then a PhD candidate at a university in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was interested in a PhD programme at the same university and needed further information. I sent him a detailed response, addressing all his queries to the best of my knowledge. I bumped into someone several months later in the corridor of our college compound. He said that he was the one who emailed me from Saudi Arabia. He thanked me for the detailed response and said, \"I've not met a non-native speaker yet writing so well in English.\" Flattered, I said smugly, \"I'm a composition professional.\" He burst my bubble immediately, \"Why do you need to learn to write? Machines will do that soon.\" I laughed it out. Writing is inherently a human attribute. Machines can't write.\nNeither can ChatGPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers). While grammar is a non-negotiable requirement, a piece of writing is not a syntactic structure. It's, instead, a semantic sculpture. There's always something elegantly unusual with an authentic piece of writing. Language and grammar are the two pieces of the big puzzle that writing is. Writing is the generation of thoughts \u2013 filtered through vision, imagination, and intuition \u2013 that touch and transform. Writing that endures doesn't replicate any model of thought and language. It renews language to create a new model of thought. Since the last week of November this past year, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, writing seemed re-defined. Flaccid prose that is clinically precise is being passed off as writing. And writing ability is attributed to machines without cognition and sensation. That's an egregious error as to what it takes to accomplish a piece of writing. There's nothing magical or mysterious about writing.\nChatGPT seems both magical and mysterious. Writing has never been instant and progressive. It has always been intermittent and recursive. With ChatGPT, which is a Large Language Model (LLM), writing is instant and progressive. The human language repertoire seems infinitesimal compared to the infinite source that this software draws from. Experts estimate that the human brain can process approximately 70,000 thoughts a day. The software ChatGPT, however, draws from 175 billion parameters, which are lexical chunks and units of thought. The software is fed on a massive amount of text \u2013 books, Wikipedia pages, newspapers, and social media posts \u2013 amounting to half a trillion words of text, as Steven Pinker claims in his recent\u00a0The Harvard Gazette\u00a0interview. It predicts patterns based on the parameters it is built on. Plausible prose emerges. The generation of prose, then, is reduced to looking for, locating, and enacting collocations. This is unqualified naivety!\nSteven Pinker claims in\u00a0The Sense of Style\u00a0that there's no algorithm to write a sentence. A sentence is an experiential entity given its Latin root,\u00a0sententia, which means sentimental thinking. The generation of a sentence presupposes an understanding of and engagement with the physical world. Plonking down words in a formulaic fashion severely falls short of the definition of a sentence, because one must understand the meaning behind those words. ChatGPT doesn't. It generates words based on a given input. Besides, Joe Moran claims in\u00a0First You Write a Sentence\u00a0that a sentence is more than its meaning. It's also a metrical structure, where logic and lyric as well as sense and sound meet. A sentence is music created by thyme, rhythm, and pausing. That music is heard only in the head, though. ChatGPT is a language model that has nothing to do with sound (and image). As such, what ChatGPT regurgitates is not writing per se. It's just a tantalising transcription.\n\nCompromising with the skill and quality of writing is indeed an existential crisis. Writing is not a single skill manifested. Writing is a cluster of skills deployed.\nSo, it snares. As they claim, ChatGPT is a deep-learning tool. Essentially, though, it's a toy for deep-faking, for Ian Bogost argues in his article, \"ChatGPT Is Dumber Than You Think,\" in\u00a0The Atlantic, that it's less about persuasive writing and more about superb bullshitting. It's logically dysfunctional and is terrible at maths. It cites false quotations and references. It's a half-baked app. Fixing it to the precision seems apparently unlikely, because the software is already a juggernaut. Even its creators don't know how it works and why. That's what Ian Bogost and Steven Pinker believe. ChatGPT, then, is a carefully crafted confusion. DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, urges caution against artificial intelligence in his interview with\u00a0Time\u00a0this past January. He warns, \"We are the guinea pigs.\" We're both addicted to and imprisoned by technology. Crises mount.\nCompromising with the skill and quality of writing is indeed an existential crisis. Writing is not a single skill manifested. Writing is a cluster of skills deployed. Writing presupposes immersive reading, deep thinking, and deft languaging. These are not the skills suddenly discovered. These skills are gradually developed. With ChatGPT around, no one needs to cultivate these skills. Writing is reduced to prompting. One even doesn't need to write a prompt. One can buy prompt. Prompt engineering is already a side hustle for some people, as Charlie Warzel claims in his essay, \"The Most Important Job Skill of This Century,\" in\u00a0The Atlantic. And it will be a booming cottage industry in the times ahead. Commodifying writing is akin to cannibalism. Writing is the metric of intelligence that sustains our civilisation. Francis Bacon, the 16th-century English philosopher, claims that writing makes an \"exact man\" (and, of course, woman). People armed with the ability to write are going to be in short supply because of ChatGPT.\nSo is quality prose. In his article in\u00a0The Atlantic, \"What Happens When AI Has Read Everything?\" Ross Anderson argues that good prose has never been in infinite supply in that good prose is one of the most challenging things to produce in the known universe. For the large language model that ChatGPT is, the generation of quality prose is contingent upon ingesting quality prose, which are books written by better writers. Anderson cites the finding of a research team led by Pablo Villalobos at Epoch AI that claims that ChatGPT will run out of reading quality material by 2027. Since the emergence of the printing press in the 15th century, humans have published approximately 125 million titles, as the researchers at Google Books find. The Epoch team estimates that approximately 10 million to 30 million of these books are digitalised to be machine-readable. When AI has read all the books ever produced \u2013 and our reliance on and obsession with ChatGPT becomes a routine \u2013 it can't ingest quality prose anymore. As such, ChatGPT will recycle the same patterns of prose created by itself. We're off to a prose wasteland. That sounds dystopic, but that's apparently likely.\n\nTherefore, the popularity of ChatGPT worries sceptics and scholars alike. It's a disruptive discovery. Banning it doesn't end it, because we can no longer uninvent it. Writing is a high-stake activity.\nNoam Chomsky, Ian Roberts, and Jeffrey Watumull, in their recent pitch in\u00a0The New York Times, disqualify ChatGPT as an authentic tool for generating quality prose as such. They claim that the crux of machine learning is description and prediction. The mark of true intelligence, however, is an explanation. Intelligence also consists of creative conjectures, creative criticism, and moral thinking. Any A1-powered system critically lacks these attributes. Language \u2013 and the ability to use language in a creative and ethical fashion \u2013 is genetically endowed. Because machines can't understand and utilise the sophisticated principles and parameters of creating an infinite number of sentences with a finite means of rules of syntax and word formation (that's grammar!), software like ChatGPT is built on the \"fundamentally flawed conception of language and knowledge,\" they claim. When, then, ChatGPT succeeds, we fail.\nTherefore, the popularity of ChatGPT worries sceptics and scholars alike. It's a disruptive discovery. Banning it doesn't end it, because we can no longer uninvent it. Writing is a high-stake activity. It critically determines professional success and intellectual excellence. Any quality prose implies knowledge internalised, and creativity excelled. Serious writing as such is exhausting. Now that there's a quick fix out there, people, students in particular, will gladly outsource the struggle of writing to machines. Countermeasures are emerging apace to watermark AI-generated prose. That perhaps means nothing. When we preach celibacy to a group of young adults, can we expect them to behave? ChatGPT, as it appears, is irresistible.\nWhen, however, it comes to writing, ChatGPT is a BIG nothing. Writing is not a revelation. It's not taking dictation, either. It's an intellectual achievement that takes a lifetime of preparation to develop. William Faulkner, who received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1949, said in his\u00a0Paris Review\u00a0interview that a writer needs three things: experience, observation, and imagination. Which one of these attributes does ChatGPT have? None! It's a passing fad, as all technologies are these days. The sooner we get disillusioned with ChatGPT, the better. Why? Because it has nothing to do with writing!\nDr Mohammad Shamsuzzaman\u00a0is associate professor at the Department of English and Modern Languages in North South University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Tuesday's devastating fire at Bangabazar was not the first such incident recorded there, nor was it the only one of this scale. But it serves as a reminder \u2013 if new reminders were at all needed \u2013 that safety risks are built into the very model of urbanisation followed by Bangladesh, where building codes and fire safety regulations are seldom enforced. For example, before the Bangabazar market fire, which gutted nearly 3,000 shops full of clothes, building authorities were sent notices on 10 occasions over the last four years. The fire safety department also put up a banner there with warnings of fire risks. But business interests triumphed over safety requirements, to disturbing consequences.\nIn 2019, the fire service department carried out a survey on 3,786 institutions and establishments across the country, and found that 541 shopping complexes and markets were at high risk. Bangabazar was one of them. It is not just markets and commercial establishments, but a large number of residential buildings in major cities are also believed to be at high risk of accidents because of their lack of structural and electrical safety \u2013 either they were not constructed following buildings codes, or are poorly maintained, or have no fire safety system in place. The possibility of building fires or collapses literally lurks at every corner, as some of the recent incidents have shown.\nThe Bangabazar incident serves up several other lessons as well. For example, the risk of dilapidated buildings. Reportedly, a six-year-old city corporation initiative to build a 10-storey shopping mall at Bangabazar never saw the light of day because of disagreements over rehabilitation of traders for the duration of the construction work. The Dhaka South City Corporation had apparently finalised the design and even hired a contractor. But construction couldn't begin because of a stay order from the High Court. Had this issue been resolved and traders were rehabilitated to make way for the new building, Tuesday's tragedy could have been certainly averted.\nAnother issue brought forth by the Bangabazar fire is the declining number of ponds and wetlands in major cities, especially in Dhaka. While urban water bodies are filled to construct buildings and marketplaces, their absence is most acutely felt when there is a fire in one of those buildings and there is no water nearby to douse it, as it happened in case of Bangabazar. The irony of the situation is inescapable. Ponds not only play a vital role in dousing flames but also create a healthy atmosphere and ease waterlogging. Unfortunately, there are few ponds left in central Dhaka, which is an issue that will continue to put us in trouble if not addressed urgently.\nHaving witnessed the consequence of inaction or delaying action in case of fire safety, we really have no alternative but to act immediately. We urge the authorities to prepare a comprehensive work plan to address the safety of buildings and markets identified as risky by Rajuk and the fire department. They must try to find a way to overcome legal and logistical issues that are working as impediments. The safety of citizens must be prioritised.\n",

        "full_article": "At a time when people are finding it difficult to bear even regular healthcare expenses due to the extremely high cost of living, it is disheartening to know that a syndicate of ambulance operators is holding patients hostage at public hospitals by forcing them to use their service, often with double the usual fare. According to a report by this daily, members of two ambulance owners' associations have combined to form the syndicate that operates in every public hospital of the country to make sure that no ambulance from outside their network can take patients to their destinations.\nFor instance, when patients from Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) want to go back to their respective districts, they are forced to use the services of these two associations, paying extra money. If an ambulance from outside the capital somehow carries any patient out of a hospital in Dhaka, the syndicate takes half the fare as its cut. This has become the general practice, with the hospital authorities turning a blind eye.\nAn ambulance owner from Kushtia told our correspondent that as soon as patients are taken inside DMCH from ambulances, they are driven out of the hospital premises by the syndicate members to eliminate competition. And a patient's father, who was trying to hire an ambulance to go back to Noakhali from DMCH, said that while an ambulance from Noakhali would cost him Tk 3,000 for the ride back home, the ambulances available in DMCH would charge him around Tk 6,000. This is nothing but extortion. At a time when people are already left high and dry by their increasing medical bills, the syndicate is just worsening their misery.\nIt should be noted that over the last decade, people's out-of-pocket spending on healthcare has increased significantly. According to the Bangladesh National Health Accounts (BNHA) 1997-2020 data, such expenditure rose from 62 percent in 2012 to 68.5 percent in 2020. This is in addition to the astronomical prices of nearly every commodity, food item, utility or service that people are forced to pay. Unfortunately, the government's effort in this regard has been nothing short of disappointing. Even though the government promised to bring down out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure to 32 percent by 2032, it is most likely to remain a pipe dream given the present reality.\nThe ambulance menace is just an example of how mismanaged and poorly governed the public health sector is. The question is, why would people have to struggle even to access basic healthcare? Why would they have to sell their assets or borrow money to come to the capital for treatment? Why can't patients get healthcare at affordable prices in their own districts? Clearly, the government has a lot to do to ensure that the middle and low income people can afford healthcare.\nAs regards the cartel of ambulance associations, we urge the public hospital authorities to take effective steps against them so that they cannot exploit patients. Patients must be spared the extra financial burden during these difficult times.\n",

        "full_article": "The soaring inflation hitting seven-month high brings home the rude message that things may even get worse in the days ahead. Official calculation has put the rate at 9.33 per cent in March--- way up the government target of 7.5 per cent (revised for FY 2023). The issue is not about the government's target found wrong, but the looming apprehension that seems too challenging to get over. Although it was not absolutely unexpected given the unabated price spiral of food and non-food products for the past several months in the domestic market, the government has now no choice but to put in the best to hold back the prevailing trend. According to the BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics), the food items to have become costlier are mainly poultry, beef, mutton and eggs, while non-food items that experienced unprecedented price-surge include medical and healthcare products, transport, clothing, footwear, among others. Price hikes of vegetables, sugar and cooking oil among the core food items, though not specifically mentioned, should have their important share. According to the BBS, countrywide food inflation was recorded at 9.09 per cent on a 12-month point-to-point basis in the past month, while the non-food inflation was calculated to be 9.72 per cent for the same period.Economists find both internal and external factors contributing to price hike leading to inflation. A series of adjustments to retail electricity tariffs increased prices by 15.7 per cent from January to March. Similarly, price of piped gas surged by 150 per cent for large industries, 154.7 per cent for medium industries and 178.3 per cent for small and cottage industries in February. As for external factors, oil price hike is considered an important factor. Oil prices have surged after several of the world's largest exporters announced surprise cuts in their production, with economists warning that higher oil prices could make it harder to bring down the cost of living in many oil import-dependent countries. The World Bank (WB) in its Bangladesh Development Update released in Dhaka this week said, \"Monetary policy needs to be fully dedicated to reining in inflation through the interest rate channels.\" The BB has raised policy rates multiple times in recent months to combat higher consumer prices. However, the World Bank said continued use of a lending interest rate cap introduced earlier has impaired the effectiveness of policy rates. The WB also said that pent-up demand increased aggregate demand, and a rise in the price of imported goods and subsequent rise in energy and transport costs exacerbated the inflationary pressure on other items. Import restrictions on some raw and intermediate materials are believed to have raised cost of production of commonly used finished consumer products.It is not, however, clear what the government is planning to tame the situation. Clearly, some measures, including the central bank's moves, have not been able to play any noticeable role in curbing inflation. All one hopes for is a well thought-out plan of action to address what by all means is a major crisis critically affecting lives and livelihoods of millions.",

        "full_article": "Broiler chicken has been making screaming headlines for sometime now. First, it was the record price hike of the cheapest source of animal protein and then because of the drastic cut in prices following a meeting between the Consumer Protection Rights Department (CPRD) and the big four poultry farm companies. Reportedly, the small and marginal farmers have been badly affected because of the latest move by the big companies to sell broilers at prices lower than the production cost. But why? Have the poultry sharks suddenly been imbued with the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan to become so generous as to do some charity service for the needy and vulnerable? The marginal poultry farmers complain that it is another kind of business syndication aimed at creating a trade regime where the small farmers go broke. If they are compelled to sell broilers incurring losses for sometime, it will be beyond their power to stay in business. It seems the members of the syndicate have a vicious trick up their sleeves. However, this particular variety of chicken has given rise to even more disturbing news and it concerns the safety of its meat. When the issue of food safety comes to the fore, usually adulteration, unhygienic preparation and use of harmful and non-food grade colours are brought under the scanner. Only rarely are the animal feed and hormone-enhancing antibiotic or substances placed under rigorous scrutiny. Also when laboratory tests come up with results showing presence of harmful substances in products or feed posing threat to public health, the issue is not pursued further and the news is killed somehow or other. What happened to the pasteurised packet milk following the alarming revelation in laboratory tests may be a case in point. There was just a brief news bite claiming that such packet milk of different companies proved safe for consumption in a laboratory test in Chennai, India. Are the tests in the country's laboratories, including that of Dhaka University, erroneous? It is against this backdrop, the latest study by a final-year student of Khulna University, as reported, hardly stands a chance of receiving the attention and having the follow-up it deserves. But it should. The dissertation titled \"Assessment of heavy metal in broiler chicken and its source tracking in Khulna City Corporation area\" prepared under the supervision of Dr. Abdulla Harun Chowdhury, Head of the Environmental Science discipline of Khulna University presents an alarming picture. His study carried out throughout 2022 finds the presence of excessively high amount of heavy metals like nickel, chromium, lead and arsenic in both broiler meat and poultry feed from 15 companies he collected from Nirala, Moilapota, Rupsa, New Market and Boira Bazar. The World Health Organisation (WHO)-recommended level of nickel in each kilogram of broiler meat is 0.50 milligram but his sample showed 128 mg in meat and 79 mg in bones. Similarly, against the WHO-recommended 1.0 mg of chromium, there were 12.5 and 10.45 mgs respectively in meat and bones. Again, against 0.10 mg of lead, meat and bones had 18.52 mg and 3.79 mg respectively. Thus arsenic's presence is 0.83 mg in meat and 0.37 mg in bones as against 0.10. The WHO does not recommend any level of heavy metals' presence in poultry feed. This means the feed has to be free of any such substance. But the highest level of nickel in poultry feed was found to be 1.93 mg, chromium 60.58 mg and lead 5.86 mg in each kg. The European Commission poultry feed regulations (2003) recommends no more than 0.05 mg of lead in a kilogram of such feed. Understandably, the problem is not with the broiler chicken; it is with the feed which uses ingredients that contain those harmful heavy metals. Even fish and poultry feeds made news when it was found that leather factories' rejects were used to prepare those. The question is, if companies follow the standard practice while producing fish and poultry feeds. The teacher of Khulna University, who supervised the study sounded condescending when he remarked that small farmers either unaware of the consequences or for higher profit might have used low quality feed. What matters here is the production of quality feed and its rigorous inspection so that substandard type cannot be marketed.The most important question here is to know if the feed-related hazard from broiler chicken is confined only to Khulna City or it is more or less a problem all across the country. To know this there is a need for an extensive study to be carried out by a competent researcher or research team under a reputed organisation. The rumpus over the soaring price over this cheap source of animal protein was quite expected but if it proves harmful to human health, remedial measures have to be taken urgently before the poisonous substances present in meat get circulated through the food chain and cause irreparable damage to nation's health. Standardisation of poultry feed which is the source of poisoning will be the key. Otherwise, the dangerous substances found in poultry feed will continue to, as physicians attest to the fact, damage liver, kidney and brain in human body.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "What could be the rates of growth of the economy this fiscal and in the next one? The answer seems to be lost in a maze of estimates and predictions made by the government and multilateral institutions. As usual, the government is toeing an optimistic line, while the latter are trying to be 'practical' amidst global economic uncertainty. The government had set the GDP growth target for the financial year (FY) 2022-23 at 7.5 per cent. It, however, in December last downsized the budget for the current FY and revised the growth target down to 6.5 per cent. Two key multilateral development financiers have recently downgraded the country's economic growth by a little over 5.0 per cent. The World Bank (WB) in its latest country economic update has lowered the growth projections to 5.2 per cent for the current fiscal. Another major development partner---the Asian Development Bank (ADB) --- has projected growth at 5.3 per cent. Until now, none of the two relevant ministries---the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning--- has made any comment on these projections. The WB has predicted a moderate rebound in economic growth in FY24 when the GDP is expected to grow at 6.2 per cent. But the MoF appears to be far more optimistic about the economy making a strong comeback. It has reportedly set the GDP growth target at the current year's level of 7.5 per cent even though the economy is facing a host of domestic and external challenges. There is no denying that the government has done well in handling the threat coming from the external sector in the past few months. But the uncertainty is not over. It might continue for some more time, though the situation has somewhat eased in the international energy market. Despite the uncertainties, the government is planning to implement a big budget involving a sum of Tk 7.60 trillion in the next FY. The size of the budget for FY'24 is expected to be higher by nearly Tk 1.0 trillion over that of the current FY. The government, undeniably, needs to make a big investment in development projects and productive sectors if it wanted to raise the growth level. But it might also need to spend a record amount on areas that do not always make a worthwhile contribution to economic growth. The next budget might be loaded with such elements. For instance, a sum of Tk 2.07 trillion is expected to be earmarked in the budget for interest payments, subsidies and cash loans. Also, there will be an allocation of Tk 1.30 trillion for safety net programmes in the upcoming fiscal. What however remains more important is that the government will have to mobilise resources in line with the budgetary expenditures. That is the area where lies the problem. The government intends to set a revenue target of Tk 5.0 trillion for the next FY. The bulk of it--- Tk.4.30 trillion--- would come from various taxes. The NBR target seems a bit unrealistic, given its revenue mobilisation performance until February of this FY. The target to be proposed for the tax revenues in the next budget will be 16.2 per cent higher than that of the current FY. Achieving that could be a daunting Task. The tax revenue collection during the first eight months of the current fiscal would substantiate that. The total tax revenues collected during the period was Tk 1.96 trillion as against a target of Tk 2.19 trillion. The NBR will have to collect Tk 1.74 trillion in just four months to reach the target at the end of FY'23.There was a notable fall in import duty mobilisation during the July-February period of FY 23. Restrictions on the import of many luxury and non-essential items because of the dollar crunch are responsible for imports going slow. If economic soothsayers proved right, the situation is unlikely to change radically in the next fiscal year. Given the inflation rate hovering around the double-digit mark, the monetary policy set to be announced in July next may not be expansionary. So, it is necessary to exercise prudence in setting the size of the budget.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Ramadan is one of the holiest months in the Islamic faith. The Muslims observe a month-long fast during the daylight hours of Ramadan, which is considered one of the five pillars of Islam. It is not just a month of physical abstinence from food and drink, it is also a time for spiritual development. The focus of this month is to strengthen the relationship with the Almighty through acts of charity, kindness, and self-reflection. This month teaches us self-restraint and purifies us. It also encourages us to live a simple life. It is the month when the Muslims try to observe more religious rites. Ramadan is also known as the month of mercy, forgiveness and salvation. The holy month of Ramadan comes and goes away every year but we do not seem to learn its basic meaning and adopt ourselves accordingly. The index of corruption is rising day by day. Teachings of Ramadan can help us stay away from committing anything that is wrong. The month of Ramadan is a time for spiritual purification achieved through fasting, self-sacrifice and prayers. Moreover, we can stand by fellow human beings in need in this month. Extending help to them is the best teaching of this month. As the Muslims, it is our sacred duty to follow the teachings of Islam and enlighten our children with the ideals of Islam.\nShah Muntacher Hossain Mihan, Student of Department of Social Work, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali, [email\u00a0protected]",
