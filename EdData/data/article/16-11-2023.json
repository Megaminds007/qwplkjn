Although only marginally lower than the 5% retail inflation in September, October\u2019s price rise pace \u2014 which is exactly the same as that in June \u2014 surely represents some relief for the third successive month from July\u2019s 15-month high pace of over 7.4%. Rural consumers still face a higher inflation of 5.1%, though. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food costs, has eased further and household services inflation dropped below 4% after several months above. The rise in prices of vegetables, which had surged over 37% in July, eased to 2.7% in October. However, the overall uptick in food costs for households stayed firm at 6.6%, virtually unchanged from September, as other essential edibles saw faster price hikes or remained at elevated levels. Some of these \u2014 like pulses (up 18.8%) and cereals (10.7%) \u2014 may be attributed to worries about the kharif output and uncertain rabi prospects as well as hikes in minimum support prices for crops. Pulses prices were up 19.4% at the wholesale level, signalling that more pass-through to retail prices is likely.The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India, which meets early December for its next review, will not be too swayed by the October tidings. As per its 5.6% average inflation projection for this quarter, down from 6.4% in the previous quarter, November and December may well see an average inflation of 5.95%, fractionally short of the central bank\u2019s upper tolerance threshold. Excluding edible oils, whose 13.7% year-on-year drop in prices played a key role in moderating the Consumer Price Index, would have meant a 5.6% rise in prices. Base effects from last year, when the Ukraine conflict had spiked edible oil prices, will start to dissipate in coming months. Similarly, while the 6.8% inflation recorded in October 2022 helped cool price rise last month, those base effects will surely ebb this month. Retail inflation had eased to 5.88% last November, with the food price index rising just 4.7%, from 7% in the previous month. The perceived retreat of inflation last month thus may only be fleeting. Households that seem to have adjusted to the continuous recent rise in living costs, by pulling back on discretionary spends and downsizing essential consumption as per industrial output trends, are likely to remain cautious rather than loosen their purse strings anytime soon. For an economy whose resilience relies on its domestic demand buffer against global shocks, reluctant or budget-cramped consumers are the biggest headwind for policymakers to strive to address. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

Instead, the standing committee on Home Affairs, despite submissions from experts and jurists on abolition, chose to make a bland recommendation \u201cthat the matter may be left for the government to consider\u201d. Its observation is limited to a remark that it \u201chas understood that the reason for a passionate argument against the death penalty is that the judicial system can be fallible and to prevent an innocent person from being wrongly sentenced to death\u201d. However, domain experts had made some persuasive submissions before the panel: that instances of trial courts awarding death were on the rise, whereas statistical trends showed that the Supreme Court of India was leaning away from capital punishment; that social scientists had demonstrated it had no deterrent effect and that global opinion was in favour of its abolition. The Court awarded the death penalty to only seven people from 2007 to 2022, while all death sentences were either set aside or commuted to life in 2023, as they did not fall under the \u201crarest of rare cases\u201d.Members who added notes of dissent to the report also highlighted the argument that capital punishment has been shown to be no deterrent; that imprisonment for the remainder of the convict\u2019s natural life will be a more rigorous punishment and provide scope for reform; and that most of those on death row came from underprivileged backgrounds. They have also made the point that the three Bills proposing a new body of criminal law are substantially the same as the existing IPC, Code of Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act. If at all, Parliament moves to enact the draft Bills, with changes suggested by the parliamentary panel, it will be in the fitness of things if it is used as an occasion to reconsider the need to retain the death penalty. The BNS has defined \u2018life imprisonment\u2019 as a term for the remainder of one\u2019s natural life, and this should be the default alternative to death sentences. The case for abolition will gain strength if the trend of seeking premature release of life convicts on political grounds is arrested and life terms without remission become more common. Remission should be a humanitarian act and never a source of political controversy. Removing capital punishment from the statute book and introducing a rational and universal remission policy will be a substantive reform in the justice system.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ndeath penalty policies\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\npolitics",

Thus, JRD dwarfed the ambition of Rai Bahadur MS Oberoi who had finally marched into the Taj Group\u2019s home turf, almost bankrupting his company to make his flashy new hotel the tallest tower of Mumbai\u2019s first Gotham. A year later, Air India had overshadowed it twice over, also dominating the frontage of Nariman Point. Rai Bahadur must be smirking in his super deluxe suite in the sky: the Maharashtra government is buying his b\u00eate noire \u2013 for \u20b91,601 crore.\u00a0\nAh bitter irony. In a replay of Shivaji\u2019s famed lament on losing his prized general Tanaji while winning the coveted Sinhagadh fort, \u2018Garh ala pan sinh gela\u2019, the Tatas have \u2018lost\u2019 the eponymous tower a year after they wrested back their long-nationalised airline.

Wasn\u2019t it among the 13 power towers targeted by Dawood\u2019s vengeful serial blasts of 1993? It remained so even when the Maharaja\u2019s udan khatola became an udan khatara.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd here\u2019s a bigger irony. The less governance they give us in Maharashtra, the more government offices they want. The logic is as hazy as the pall shrouding the once-spectacular view from the Air India building.

In one electoral term, we\u2019ve had three governments \u2013 none of which we voted for. So here\u2019s a cost-effective way to justify the latest \u20b91,601-crore splurge.

        "full_article": "Bangladesh may not be as litigious as the United States of America, thought to be the most litigious on the basis of the highest number of lawsuits, or Germany with the highest rate of litigations of 123.2 per 1,000 people, but its huge backlog of court cases continues to pile up. The Supreme Court cannot at times help ordering the trial courts to speed up disposal of cases. On Monday, the Appelate Division of the Supreme Court ordered the Speedy Trial Tribunal-2 of Dhaka to complete the proceedings within the next six months and this is the second such order for completion of the trial of a murder case filed 25 years ago. In his explanation, the trial court judge submits why he failed to complete the proceedings. It is the prosecutors' inability to present witnesses. Clearly, two highly important issues are involved, particularly where witnesses remain absent from deposition---one is for fear of security and even life where the accused are influential or dangerous; and the other is intrigues resorted to by dishonest lawyers with the ulterior motive of dragging trial for an indefinite period. How much time the trial court should grant for presenting witnesses must have a limit. The problem of insecurity of a witness's life, however, cannot be guaranteed against the murderous elements. Civil cases may look rather innocent but those are not, particularly when the moneyed and more influential parties exert an undue influence and even threaten dire consequences for telling court the truth that goes against their interests. No, not 'all men are created equal' nor are they entitled to equal treatment and justice when society is riven with atrocious economic inequality and yawning social disparities. The rich and the privileged consider it a right to exploit the poor and the underprivileged. Lawsuits involving parties across the divide always favour the former. Where the complainant and the defendant are from comparable socio-economic background, there is a possibility of the case receiving a fair hearing. Such complex issues apart, accumulation of cases happens on account of the inadequate number of courts and judges compared to the rising number of cases. The immediate past Chief Justice Hasan Foez Siddique's positive initiatives were of help in reducing the litigation backlog. But when the number of pending lawsuits stands at more than 4.0 million ---it was 4.2 million by March 31,2023, it is not easy to address the problem within months or a year. Only six judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court have to hear cases when the number of the piled-up lawsuits is 21,184. Similarly, 88 judges of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court are holding trial against 0.51 million pending cases. It is humanly impossible for a HC judge to oversee 5,876 cases. The recently retired chief justice also initiated a wonderful move to settle cases by activating the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) system. This could certainly go a long way in obviating pressure on formal courts to a large extent but for the mutual mistrust and absence of people who could be taken into confidence. Once a rural society, this part of the world relied mostly on village 'panchayet' for social dispute resolution. Poisonous politics has vitiated the poise and stability of village command. A trial run of a redesigned ADR system with members of the public as well as local administration can be introduced to see how it functions. In order to reduce sufferings of litigants and huge costs, the merit of such an alternative system is beyond doubt.",

        "full_article": "The Westminster form of government is often a surgical operation. And surgical operations are what efficient government is about. Governance is all about keeping the levers of government running in the interest of an entire nation.It is a truism which has once more been reflected in the decision by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to sack Home Secretary Suella Braverman, whose unpardonable sin was writing an article for a newspaper and accusing the police of bias in their actions. She had the pro-Palestinian march of last Saturday in mind and cheerfully referred to the marchers as a mob who ought not to be permitted to spoil the observance of Armistice Day.Braverman's mistake was in not obtaining clearance from 10 Downing Street for her article. Of course, there have been reports that No 10 suggested some edits in the write-up, which suggestion Braverman ignored. After that, it was only a matter of time before she would go out of government. And now she has gone, to sit as a backbencher in the House of Commons.Britain will go for general elections in a year's time. Sunak obviously had that factor in mind when he decided his Home Secretary should be dismissed and replaced with James Cleverly, till recently the country's Foreign Secretary. And into Cleverly's place at the FCDO has come former prime minister David Cameron, which was a bit of a surprise. But clearly Sunak needs to focus on internal politics, given that his Tories are much behind Keir Starmer's Labour in the opinion polls. He would like to leave foreign affairs to the known quantity that is Cameron.The beauty of the Westminster system is inherent in the form itself. Prime Ministers take swift action where appointments or dismissals of ministers are called for and where cabinet reshuffles are called for. In this system, ministers do not become entrenched in their positions but, more importantly, take their responsibilities on trust. Those who do not perform to the country's satisfaction are condemned to lose office or be sacked. Those who have been out of power may be called upon once again to serve in government. Cameron's is the latest instance of a lapsed politician called back into government.Cameron's return to office, this time as Foreign Secretary, is a reminder of an earlier era when a former prime minister was brought back into government as Foreign Secretary. Sir Alec Douglas-Home succeeded to No 10 when Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister in autumn 1963. In the elections of October 1964, his Conservatives lost to Harold Wilson's Labour. For the next six years, Home stayed in parliamentary opposition under his party leader Edward Heath. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970, Prime Minister Heath appointed Home as Foreign Secretary, an office in which he served with distinction till 1974, when Labour came back to power under Wilson.Under the Westminster system, therefore, opportunities remain for politicians to return and serve in government even after they have called it a day. At the same time, the system is unforgiving of politicians who make a mess of it. Liz Truss remains an instance of how to conduct government in a less than satisfactory way and then be compelled to walk through the exit door. At Westminster, there are the ways and means by which the ruling party, fatigued with the policies of a long-serving Prime Minister, will call forth the courage to demand the resignation of the head of government. Margaret Thatcher is the instance that comes to mind.There are nations where governments every now and then declare allegiance to the Westminster form of government but without imbibing the lessons of governance as they are followed in Britain. Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) is a regular Wednesday feature which not only has the Prime Minister, ready with his facts, respond to questions from both government and opposition MPs but also engage in a battle with the Leader of the Opposition. And all of this is done in absolute politeness. No one gets angry, no one hits another below the belt, no one questions the other's patriotism.In parliamentary government, a strong opposition keeps the government on its toes through raising questions on the issues of the day before the treasury benches. A significant aspect of the system is the preparedness of the opposition, from day one of the sitting of a new Parliament, to move into government at a future time. A shadow cabinet, with key opposition figures given responsibilities over matters relating to governance by the Leader of the Opposition, is ready to take charge on the morning after the election that the party looks forward to winning. Every new minister, having been part of the shadow cabinet, is ready to hit the ground running.The Westminster form of government abjures sycophancy on the part of ministers toward the Prime Minister. In the opposition, lawmakers are free to take their leader to task over policy issues. In Parliament, the governing party and the opposition engage in focused discussions over policy, which in turn educates the public on the manner in which the issues are being deliberated on by the political classes. The system, from such a perspective, is a cardinal lesson on how politics, the practice of it, can lead to informed opinion becoming part of the public response to the handling of contemporary issues.In the Westminster system, politicians learn humility. They remind themselves that they need to have a hands-on approach to local, national and global issues. It is not merely a matter of ministers doing their job or of ministers-in-waiting looking for the chance to step into the corridors of power. It is, in a fundamental sense, one of MPs spending time, preferably weekends, with their constituents, getting to know the problems they encounter and doing everything to neutralise those problems.Ministers, opposition politicians and lawmakers generally stay away from photo-ops and focus on the work they were elected to do. They stay away from seminars and inaugurating conferences. They have little time or inclination to present themselves before the media, for they know only too well that it is on their performance in public life that their future at the next election depends.The Westminster system makes for efficient government. It involves a continuity of parliament-people involvement. It recognises and acknowledges talent. It enables politicians to shape their visions of the future, all with the destiny of the people they serve in mind.The system has given Britain such figures as William Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, Harold Wilson, Hugh Gaitskell, Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, to name a few. It has done well. It is doing well. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

And it is responsible for around 20 per cent of the total premature deaths in the country, says a World Bank report. The global lender has also cited capital Dhaka as one of the most polluted cities in the country. However, cost-effective solutions to achieve clean air exist. China has already managed to control air pollution while India has recently launched an anti-pollution action plan. In case of Bangladesh, unfortunately, we see little has been done in terms of curbing air pollution that is not just a threat to public health but also a cause for economic loss. As winter approaches, the air quality of Dhaka city has been deteriorating due to dry weather and emissions from various sources. Dust emissions from construction activities, a key contributor to air pollution, have begun. The city is undergoing a massive transformation which requires the construction of infrastructure. Numerous private buildings as well as public projects such as the Mass Rapid Transit, roads and other utility infrastructures and construction sites have emerged as a major contributor to dust emission in the city. Demolition and construction activities that involve hammering, crushing, cutting, trimming, drilling, grinding, mixing, excavating, dumping and transporting are going on throughout the day. This leads to dust emissions, which, if not controlled, get dispersed in the atmosphere and get deposited on surrounding surfaces. As most of these construction sites are close to residential areas, they pose a threat to the health of children, the elderly and people with lung diseases. Dust is an unwelcome harbinger of winter for the residents of Dhaka. But our response to this menace is not at all an effective one. We need to contain the dust through concerted efforts. The High Court on January 13, 2020, directed the Dhaka's city mayors to ensure that spraying of water on the city's roads takes place twice every day during the winter months. However, city corporation authorities are reluctant to do this routinely even on some major roads. Besides, the authorities do not seem to take any action when construction materials are kept on the roads or pavements. It is not a tough task for the city authorities to reduce dust in Dhaka city. They can do it by sweeping roads and pavements regularly. Spraying water on roads and planting trees can also help. They also have to ensure that no one carries construction materials openly or keep them on the roads and pavements. If the dust from construction work could be managed, it would greatly help reduce air pollution in Dhaka city. We should think of transforming the building industry from its current state into one that uses modern construction technologies and practices that place controlling air pollution at the centre of planning and execution. Using drone technology to find out dust emission hotspots can help the city authorities in this case. Using this technology they can easily find the dust emitters. Standard operation procedures for builders can help reduce emissions from construction activities. Dust control is manageable in Dhaka city. And it can rid Dhaka of air pollution to some extent.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

They enhance the beauty of the environment. They eat various kinds of insects and keep crops free from diseases. A number of people in our country, however, do not have any sympathy for these migratory birds. In particular, the people of the villages are not sympathetic to migratory birds. They catch these birds and sell them in the market. According to experts, even a decade ago, more than 200 species of migratory birds used to come to our country. This number is declining fats every year. It should not be forgotten that birds are part of the environment. Undoubtedly, they can play an important role in maintaining the balance of the environment. Above all, public awareness should be created against the poaching of migratory birds. \nMd.
