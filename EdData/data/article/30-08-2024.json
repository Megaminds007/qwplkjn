        "full_article": "On August 27, a Bench of the Supreme Court of India found itself reaching, once again, for idioms over a matter involving misleading advertisements of ayurveda, siddha, and unani products. Earlier this year, another Bench had concluded proceedings against Patanjali Ayurved over its defiance of an order to not publicise unproven or unprovable medicinal claims attached to its products. Towards the end of that matter, various State-level regulatory agencies were finally roused to act against Patanjali Ayurved over these claims while the Court ordered it to publish media advertisements apologising for its actions. While the responses of the State bodies to the company are still evolving, the Court\u2019s own verdict seemed to embody a belief that nothing more could be done \u2014 and this belief casts the Court\u2019s current ire against the Ministry of AYUSH in a particular light. India\u2019s drug manufacturers and regulators are caught between ensuring high quality, which leads to higher manufacturing costs, while keeping consumer prices down so that patients can access the drugs they need. Unfortunately, neither regulators nor manufacturers have navigated this tension in the patients\u2019 favour. The AYUSH Ministry\u2019s actions have further complicated this scenario by allowing businesses to register all sorts of products as \u201cAyurvedic\u201d (as illustrated in the case of its licence, and later cancelled, to a Bengaluru-based company to sell milk as \u201cAyurvedic proprietary medicine\u201d) and by attempting to evade existing quality rules, presumably to grease the wheels of businesses. With the Ministry\u2019s cynical attempt now to sidestep Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945, which penalises misleading advertisements of ayurveda, siddha, and unani products, the Court confronts an old tendency in a new disguise. Public apologies and post facto action by regulatory bodies may have been the end of the line against one company. The Court may also seem sated by a demand, as it spelled out in its May 7 order, that all advertisers self-declare that they will not publish misleading advertisements. But similar concessionary measures will falter against a Ministry. Medicine quality and manufacturer inspections are disuniform, more so in the alternative medicines space, and regulating advertisements has emerged as a last-ditch backstop against bad products entering the market. In the face of progressively weakening protections against what is ultimately fake medicine, the most preferred outcome in the present matter would be for the Court to look at past declarations \u2014 self-made or otherwise \u2014 and into rectifying the quality-control regime, particularly to empower it, protect it from political capture, and bring alternative medicines under its purview. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nayurveda\n\n/\n\nsiddha\n\n/\n\nunani\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\npharmaceutical\n\n/\n\nbengaluru\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\npolitics",

        "full_article": "Earlier this week the Cabinet cleared a proposal, though without specifying a budget, called BioE3 or Biotechnology for Economy, Environment and Employment. Its thrust is to boost manufacturing in the biotechnology sector. Since 1986, India has had a dedicated department for biotechnology, and which deserves substantial credit. For instance, the progress in vaccine development, diagnostics and biologicals, that has bolstered India\u2019s reputation as a \u2018vaccine factory\u2019, is due to the initiatives of this department. However, biotechnology did not quite spawn the equivalent of the IT revolution. There is much more to an industrialised biotechnology sector beyond vaccines. There are billion-dollar conglomerates today that rest on high-value microbes, gene-modification technologies, bio-plastics, bio-materials, and high-precision medical devices. However, despite the know-how and human resource capital, only a few Indian biotechs have global resonance, as there are few local manufacturers who can supply Indian laboratories/startups with the ingredients and devices to make products. The reliance on imports means that India loses its international competitiveness. The BioE3 policy aims to correct this.In the last four decades, India has funded biotech research institutions but now sees that it needs to be going beyond and setting up companies, in public private partnership mode, to bolster biotechnology manufacturing. There are six verticals that this initiative envisages: bio-based chemicals and enzymes; functional foods and smart proteins; precision biotherapeutics; climate-resilient agriculture; carbon capture, and futuristic marine and space research. Futurists have been saying that the era of fossil-fuel industrialisation is over and humanity will have to rely on the natural world \u2014 for food and for making consumer products. This is to solve the global problem of non-biodegradable waste and carbon emissions. Future industries must be grounded in environmentally benign products, and this is impossible without sophisticated biotechnology. By setting up bio-foundries and bio-artificial intelligence hubs, the policy hopes there will be avenues for a variety of biotechnologists to congregate. Well intentioned this may be, but India\u2019s woes with manufacturing have chronic causes. Without establishing enabling grounds for long-term capital investment \u2014 and these have little to do with biotechnology per se \u2014 top-down initiatives will have limited impact. The BioE3 policy must be a deeply collaborative effort between Centre and States. Rather than expect quick returns, the government must provide financial and infrastructural support over the long term. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nbiotechnology\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "GOI\u2019s industrial cities plan will face challenges that other mega projects failed to overcome\nThe Cabinet\u2019s decision to approve 12 new industrial cities with an investment of Rs 28,602cr is impressive in intent. Spread across 10 states, the projects aim to boost domestic manufacturing by building greenfield cities, embodying \u2018plug-n-play\u2019 and \u2018walk-to-work\u2019 concepts. A million direct jobs and three million indirect jobs would be created through the initiative which is to fructify by 2027, govt has claimed. A follow-up to a budgetary announcement, the 12 cities would add to eight such cities that are already under different stages of implementation. That some success has been achieved in investment terms at four industrial cities that are in place is cause for optimism here. For instance, Tatas announced a mega investment of Rs 91,000 cr for a semiconductor fab unit at Dholera earlier this year. Reports say Hyundai has agreed to set up an automobile hub at Zaheerabad in Telangana, one of the cities greenlighted on Wednesday.\nTrack record uninspiring: But the larger govt agenda of boosting manufacturing has left a lot to be desired. Make in India, launched in 2014 with fanfare, was meant to increase manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP to 25% by 2025 and create 100 mn additional jobs. Those targets will not be met by next year. The earlier SEZ policy had also failed to achieve its objectives. How vigorously projects are pursued post announcements is a key factor here. There is also the larger issue of planning for the sector. For instance, we are yet to come up with a New Industrial Policy. Industrial cities work best when planned alongside larger urban development of chosen sites. This is the experience of China with SEZs at places like Shenzhen and Hainan. Several industrial cities govt wants to develop aren\u2019t large enough \u2013 one at Prayagraj is a mere 352 acres. Success of the initiative would also hinge on coordination with states, some of which are ruled by opposition parties.\nWhat about investment? Besides, there is the all-important issue of front-linkages for infra that is created. While govt has enumerated sectors in which it seeks investment, will companies be forthcoming? Investment by Indian companies is yet to pick up and FDI has been on a declining trend for the past two years. Creating infra is sound policy but a change in investment climate is a must if policy is to translate into results.\n\n",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s Big Plan\nThe Indian government has decided to build 12 new industrial cities across 10 states, investing a huge amount of money\u2014Rs 28,602 crore! These cities aim to boost manufacturing within the country. The idea is to create places where businesses can easily set up and operate (\u201cplug-n-play\u201d) and where people can live close to where they work (\u201cwalk-to-work\u201d). The government believes these cities could create one million direct jobs and three million indirect jobs by 2027. This sounds great, right? But there are some challenges.\nPast Problems\nWhile the government has had some success with four industrial cities already, the overall track record for similar projects isn\u2019t very promising. For example, the \u201cMake in India\u201d program launched in 2014 aimed to increase the manufacturing sector\u2019s share in India\u2019s GDP to 25% and create 100 million new jobs by 2025. Unfortunately, these goals are not likely to be achieved by next year. The earlier Special Economic Zones (SEZ) policy also fell short of its targets.\nWhy Did These Plans Fail?\nOne reason past plans haven\u2019t worked out is because they were not followed through with enough energy and attention. After the initial announcements, the hard work of building and developing these projects often slows down. Another issue is that these industrial cities need to be planned as part of a larger urban development strategy. For example, in China, successful industrial cities like Shenzhen were developed alongside the growth of the whole city, not just the industrial area. However, some of the new cities the Indian government wants to develop are quite small. For instance, the one at Prayagraj is only 352 acres. Also, good coordination with state governments is crucial, and some of these states are ruled by political parties that oppose the central government, which could create additional challenges.\nWill Companies Invest?\nAnother big question is whether companies will actually invest in these new cities. Even though the government has identified certain sectors they want to attract, will companies be interested? Investment by Indian companies has not picked up much recently, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been declining for the past two years. Building infrastructure, like roads and factories, is a good start, but it\u2019s also essential to create a welcoming environment for businesses to invest. Without this, the new cities might not achieve their full potential.\nConclusion\nWhile the plan to build new industrial cities is exciting and has a lot of potential, it will face many challenges. The government needs to ensure that these projects are actively pursued, planned alongside larger urban development, and that a positive investment environment is created. Only then can the goal of boosting manufacturing and creating jobs be fully realized.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Raising women\u2019s marriage age to 21 is a redundant & regressive move. Himachal must do a U-turn \nIt\u2019s a puzzle how Congress\u2019s Sukhu govt in Himachal passed a bill raising the age of marriage of women to 21 from 18. The measure is unsound \u2013 legally, politically, socially. It does anything but serve the purpose Sukhu\u2019s health minister declared as the bill\u2019s intention \u2013 empowerment of women by delaying marriage. The reality is early marriage is an outcome of lack of educational and economic opportunities for teen girls.\nLegally, politically untenable | GOI\u2019s bill on the same with similar intentions, introduced in the previous LS earlier this year, thankfully lapsed. Congress roundly opposed it. Which makes it odd that Sukhu would pass almost the same law within months. Surely he\u2019s aware Himachal\u2019s law can be rendered void? Central law provisions, which have age 18 as the age for women to marry, overrule state statutes. If the Himachal bill becomes law, it\u2019ll create unnecessary liabilities and court cases, a burden people, enforcers and courts can do without.\nSocially unsound | Himachal isn\u2019t among states with a high proportion of child marriages. So, why such\u00a0 law? Further, on what basis did policymakers conclude marrying at 21 is \u2018empowering\u2019, when none of the factors that lead to child marriages are improving? Yes, child marriage must be tackled. Girls with no education are upto 6 times more likely to marry before they turn 18. Child marriage is a symptom/ outcome/ endgame of several disabilities. Address those causes \u2013 poverty, poor access to school, nutrition and safety infra, patriarchy that denies young girls sexual choices. In her \u2018safety\u2019 lies family \u2018honour\u2019, however warped the notion, the perception remains reality. Child marriage is seen as a solution. Don\u2019t want girls marrying before 21? Provide them options. Ah, but the cost of infra required to ensure colleges, employment, economic and physical security is borne by govt. Cost of a bad law is borne by the people. This law is dereliction of state\u2019s duty, the sooner it\u2019s binned, the better.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The government in Himachal Pradesh, led by Chief Minister Sukhu, recently passed a new law that raises the minimum age for women to get married from 18 to 21. At first, this might sound like a good idea, but many people think it\u2019s actually not helpful at all. Instead of empowering young women, the new law could cause more problems than it solves.\nWhy Is This Law a Problem?\n\nIt Doesn\u2019t Empower Women: Sukhu\u2019s government says the law is meant to empower women by making them wait longer to get married. But in reality, the reason many girls marry early is because they don\u2019t have enough opportunities to go to school or find good jobs. If the government wants to help young women, it should focus on providing better education and job opportunities instead of just changing the marriage age.\nLegal Confusion: The central government (which makes laws for all of India) tried to pass a similar law earlier this year, but it didn\u2019t go through. The Congress party, which is also in power in Himachal Pradesh, opposed it. Now, it seems strange that the same party in Himachal would want to pass a similar law. Also, there\u2019s a legal issue here: if a central law sets the marriage age at 18, a state law that tries to change it to 21 could be overturned. This could lead to a lot of confusion and court cases.\nSocial Issues: Himachal Pradesh is not a state with a high rate of child marriages. So, why was this law passed here? There\u2019s no clear evidence that raising the marriage age to 21 will solve any real problems. Many experts say that child marriage happens because of poverty, lack of access to schools, and a lack of safety and opportunities for girls. Instead of changing the law, the government should focus on these underlying issues.\n\nBetter Solutions Needed: Instead of making new laws that don\u2019t address the real issues, the government should provide more options for young girls. This means investing in schools, creating job opportunities, and making sure that girls are safe and have the freedom to make their own choices. By tackling the root causes of child marriage\u2014like poverty and lack of education\u2014girls will have more reasons to stay in school and wait longer to get married.\nConclusion: The new law to raise the marriage age in Himachal Pradesh doesn\u2019t seem to solve any real problems and could create more confusion. Instead, the government should focus on improving education and opportunities for young women. This would truly empower them and help reduce child marriages in a more meaningful way. The sooner the law is reconsidered, the better it will be for everyone.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We congratulate Prof Yunus's government for joining the UN treaty on enforced disappearances. We also welcome the formation, last Tuesday, of an inquiry commission to investigate extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances and to report within 45 days. Headed by a retired high court judge, the commission will investigate the activities of the police, Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Special Branch (SB), National Security Intelligence (NSI) and the military's Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). Instead of working for the protection of the state, government, or society, these intelligence agencies became extensions of the government's policy of quelling dissent, obliterating the opposition and controlling the independent media.\nThis is one of the most urgent, important and pro-people initiative that the interim government could have taken, and we congratulate the relevant adviser or advisors for this initiative. We, from the media and this particular newspaper, wish the commission resounding success. We need not only to do justice to the victims but also ensure that it does not reoccur.\nIt is the latter task that engages us more. The practice of using security agencies to extend ruling party domination and especially to destroy the opposition is, sadly, not something that was started by Awami League. Although it can be said to have reached its zenith with the widespread practice of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killing under Sheikh Hasina's rule, it began with the entry of the armed forces into direct politics when Bangabandhu was assassinated. We know for a fact that when BNP was being organised in the late seventies, several security agencies were used to cajole, convince and compel politicians and civil society members to join it. This was followed by Gen Ershad's nearly decade-long rule, during which he also used them to form his party and control the opposition. We all expected that this notorious practice would cease with the restoration of democracy and representative government in 1991.\nRegrettably, this practice continued under the elected governments of both BNP and AL, reaching its most ignominious apex in the attempted assassination of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 21, 2004, in which security agencies were clearly and elaborately involved. A total of 23 people, including the head of AL's women wing, were killed.\nThus, over the last three decades\u2014since 1991, when we expected transparent, people-centred politics to replace behind-the-scenes manipulation\u2014the involvement of security agencies increased in proportion to the political leadership of the day losing public trust. Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule stands as a lesson in how a political party of AL's legacy, reach and organisation became increasingly dependent on security agencies. This dependency included allowing them into the inner workings of party operations, such as vetting candidates for nearly all tiers of the party, to the extent that aspiring leaders at the union and district levels sought the blessings of security agencies to achieve their ambitions.\nMany factors contributed to Sheikh Hasina's downfall, but perhaps the most heart-wrenching was, especially after 2010, the practice of picking people up from their homes and streets and then making them disappear for months or years without the slightest need to inform anyone\u2014including their families\u2014about their fate. Sometimes, their dead bodies would appear in the most unlikely places. Sometimes, they would return home but remain silent for fear of further repercussions. But most often, they would just disappear for weeks, months, or years, never to return.\nJust imagine the agony of their loved ones. Death, however cruel, draws the curtain on a tragedy. But disappearances represent a continuous suffering mixed with hope that one day the family will open the door and find their loved one\u2014father, husband, son, friend\u2014miraculously returned. Each knock on the door became both a flicker of hope and a sense of deep disappointment. Imagine this going on for years.\nOne of the fundamental responsibilities of a modern state is to ensure the safety of life and property\u2014we are leaving aside the question of liberty for the moment. This assurance was not provided in Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina's regime, especially since 2010. According to Odhikar, a human rights organisation that maintained a well verified record of disappearances\u2014despite facing significant challenges, including jailing of its chief, who is now an advisor in Prof Yunus's cabinet\u2014there were a total of 708 victims of enforced disappearances between 2009 and June 2024. Of these 708 victims, 57 percent returned alive, 13 percent were found dead and nothing has been known about the remaining 30 percent. The practice of \"picking up\" victims from homes or streets was carried as follows: 31 percent by Rab, 30 percent by the Detective Branch (DB), 22 percent by DGFI (mostly accompanied by Rab) and 14 percent by the police.\nAccording to a report by Zyma Islam, published on August 30, 2022, at least 522 individuals became victims of enforced disappearances between 2009 and 2018. Most survivors who returned home never spoke about their experiences for fear of reliving their hellish ordeals. However, a few who did speak confirmed our worst fears. One said, \"They attached two crocodile clips to my two ear lobes and when switched on, sent electric shock damaging my eardrums during interrogation.\" Another said his hands were cuffed behind his back throughout his detention, which varied from two months to two and a half years. According to the detainees, the cells were 2.5 feet wide, 4 feet long and 5 feet high\u2014too small to lie down or stand up. It was always half-sitting or half-lying. Such cruelty resembles medieval torture. Despite being underground, dark and without windows, the detainees were blindfolded throughout their captivity, even for basic needs and showers.\nThe stories of \"Aynaghar\" (House of Mirrors) represent another level of torture and cruelty that we have recently been exposed to. These constitute gross violations of human rights and reveal the existence of secret prisons that are completely unmonitored and devoid of legal oversight. They were run totally arbitrarily and at the whims of their officers. A retired army officer and a Supreme Court lawyer were kept in such secret prisons for eight years and would likely have remained there if not for the fall of the regime. Mikel Changma, a leader from the Chattogram Hill Tracks area, did not see sunlight for five years (2019-2024) of his confinement.\nWhile the inquiry commission on disappearances is expected to reveal its report within 45 days, immediate steps should be taken to allow families and rights activists to visit all 23 prisons that the DGFI has committed to opening to the public. All those who have been cruelly and illegally detained must be returned to their families immediately.\nWe must never fall into such depths of cruelty and inhumanity again. Enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings are a shame on our dreams from the Liberations War and must be eradicated forever. Too much power and arbitrariness have been allowed to security agencies in the name of fighting extremism. We hope the commission will lay down a clear legal framework so that nobody is made to suffer as we saw in the last 15 years.\nMahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "As floodwaters slowly begin to recede, a grim reality is emerging across the 73 upazilas of 11 districts that have been affected over the last 10 days or so. The flood has left behind a vast trail of destruction\u2014broken homes, crumbling roads, collapsed bridges, toppled electric poles, public facilities lying in ruins. The scars of the disaster are evident everywhere. Many have returned to their homes, or what's left of them, while others, whose villages are still under water, remain in the shelters. An uncertain future awaits them all. The thought of rebuilding their lives from the ground up can be daunting, yet this is what they must prepare for.\nAccording to an estimate, at least 52 people have died in the flood. The human toll, tragic as it is, is just one component of the widespread devastation caused by it as survivors now must focus on the painful process of recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction, with little help guaranteed. Many have lost their homes, livestock, and other belongings, and will need financial and institutional support to get back on their feet. A big part of the recovery also involves regaining livelihoods, especially for farmers, fishers, and other small earners. The government and private donors must ensure steady provision of not just food and clothes but also cash support, at least until some recovery is achieved. Another focus area is their health needs. Many in flood-affected areas are suffering from waterborne diseases including diarrhoea, skin infections, cold-fever, etc. So, ensuring adequate medical care is vital.\nUnfortunately, this is proving to be difficult because of the flooding of many health facilities, including the 250-bed Feni General Hospital, that left them severely compromised. The ministry of disaster management and relief has reportedly deployed 619 medical teams across 11 districts. But ensuring the full resumption of local health complexes is crucial for uninterrupted care. There are many other areas of rebuilding and reconstruction that the government also needs to focus on urgently. While we are yet to know the full extent of the damage caused by the flood, initial estimates are quite alarming: 6,542 kilometres of roads damaged, and 1,066 bridges and culverts ruined. Highways in affected regions are in no better shape. Many utility structures have been destroyed. There has been widespread littering, with piles of garbage seen in many areas.\nAll these issues will require prompt and proper interventions. We are told that rescue and relief activities have been hampered because of coordination problems, despite an overwhelming response from people to support flood-hit communities. This has been exacerbated by the ongoing administrative chaos caused by transfers and other issues. The absence of upazila chairmen and other public representatives is also causing problems and will likely continue to do so for some more time. This is all the more reason why the government must double down on ongoing efforts, ensuring full cooperation of all relevant state agencies and officials, so that flood-affected communities have an easier go of it going forward. It must repair and resume all public facilities without delay, and must help the affected in every way it can.\n",

Their demands were manifold, with one in particular\u2014that of banning battery-run rickshaws\u2014taking centre stage. From the outside, it seemed as if that was the entire procession. A demand for the ban on battery-run rickshaws that were posing an unfair competition, resulting in pedalled rickshaw pullers struggling to earn their daily keep.\nTo many on social media, this was the drama for the day, a \"clash\" between battery-run rickshaws and pedalled rickshaws. The situation on the internet soon devolved into mocking the protesters, labelling them as opportunists who were simply following the trend of making demands the same way HSC students and Ansar members had done before them. While some people debated the most prominent demand of banning battery-operated rickshaws, most looked at the whole situation with a touch of amusement.\nWhile the exasperation of being met with one protesting group after another is perfectly understandable, the reaction here felt particularly tone-deaf and uninformed. The reason is obvious, but the classism on display is hidden under layers of internet irony aided by ignorance of the plights of these workers. Their rights, through the thunderous roar of internet humour, have been brushed aside\u2014a fact made extremely ironic by the knowledge that mere weeks ago our battles were the same.\nThe 10 demands, they placed, require conversations since much of what they presented showcases their desire to not be swept aside and forgotten anymore.\nThe very first demand asks for state support for all the families of the martyred rickshaw pullers during the uprising that overthrew Sheikh Hasina's regime. The rickshaw pullers made a concentrated effort to remind us again that the working class have always been by our side\u2014and that the lives they sacrificed cannot remain invisible.\nThe next three demands ask for increased state recognition, provision of government facilities, as well as restrictions on work hours, and control on entry into the rickshaw-pulling sector. Among these, the second official demand on the list is of particular importance, as the demand references US labour policy and asks rickshaw pullers to be placed as top-priority labour workers in accordance to said policies.\nNumerous talking points arose from this particular demand. Questions are being asked as to how rickshaw pullers came to know of US labour policies. Yet again we find ourselves having to combat the classism we have internalised. Make no mistake, the working-class people are often not in the underprivileged states that they are due to a lack of education. Often, it is the circumstances and the systems run by the current political powers that make them take up the rickshaw-pulling job. To assume they are incapable of possessing knowledge further removes them from the personhood they are currently fighting for\u2014and that is something we as a collective can do better to remember.\nThe fourth demand, which states that there needs to be controlled entry into the sector, has also raised some eyebrows. This demand, in particular, suffers from a lack of clarity, as different groups have taken it to mean different things. Many fear that exercising control would result in having a high barrier of entry, which would result in new people being disallowed to work as rickshaw pullers, something which is already a last resort for many. Others fear that syndicates would take over, resulting in further diminished rights for the workers. The details of this demand remain hazy, and without further clarification from the protesters, not much can be said about it.\nDemand number five asks for support of elderly rickshaw pullers, something that should not require any debate. Demands six and seven ask for fair treatment, such as parking facilities on street corners and stopping abuse by police officers. Providing parking services is something many have gripes against. However, I will argue that as a country that very strongly depends on rickshaw pullers daily, we are not likely to get rid of them anytime soon. As such, does it not make sense to legitimise their parking spaces? It's clear that without spaces such as these, rickshaw pullers are bound to create traffic congestion by parking their vehicles in unauthorised spaces.\nDemand number eight is the one that ultimately turned the most heads. The demand does not outright ask for a ban on battery-run rickshaws but asks for these rickshaws to return to their previously designated areas.\nThere are multiple valid reasons behind this demand, but it's also difficult to look past the inhumane nature of pedalled rickshaws. From an outsider's perspective, I am inclined to say that a slow but steady transition of all pedalled rickshaws being converted to battery-operated ones with strict regulations would be the best outcome. As things stand right now, a way forward from this feels difficult, and creating a divide between different types of rickshaw pullers further exacerbates the problem of the rest of their demands not being taken seriously.\nDemand number nine is, once again, a straight-forward request to fix the left side of the road, which is the side where rickshaws most frequently make their lane. However, demand number 10\u2014which asks for rickshaw pullers to be consulted and allowed to participate in the country's reformation\u2014has raised several questions. Once again, it cannot be overstated that rickshaw pullers have been one of the earliest and most vocal allies in our effort to overthrow the previous regime, they have provided free rides to injured students and have stood with them on protests, chanting side by side against the oppression they all faced. To not allow them to have a say in the country's reformation would take us back to square one, where the workers return to having little to no rights. In the end, what would they have fought for? Just for things to stay the same?\nFinally, several sides have decided to raise questions such as, \"Why now?\" or \"Why not take this up officially instead of blocking roads?\" The premise for both of these questions is slightly, if not entirely, skewed. We are already beginning to forget the role rickshaw pullers played in our movement, and if not now, then there would simply be no other time to raise this issue and make their demands. The bottom line, thus, remains that the voices of those who serve as the backbone of our country should not, under any circumstance, be left unheard.\nRaian Abedin is final-year undergraduate student at North South University and a contributor for The Daily Star Campus and Star Books and Literature.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The uncertainty prevailing across multiple sectors of the country, particularly the economic sector, has become one of the most pressing concerns in the wake of the recent political transition. Financial irregularities, including monstrous misconduct in the banking industry, have compounded the already daunting challenges of high inflation, a fast depleting foreign exchange reserve, dwindling productivity, and a sluggish trade environment that has been persisting for some time. These factors, if left unchecked, could further deteriorate the situation, making it increasingly difficult for the interim government to restore stability and order. However, amid these troubling indicators, there are some encouraging signs. The Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce (MCCI), in its latest economic review for the last quarter (April-June) of FY 2023-24, has highlighted certain positive trends and opportunities, while also acknowledging the significant challenges that lie ahead. These signs, while modest, suggest that with decisive action and sound policy, there is a road to recovery.The MCCI review noted that although the overall economic environment remained strained due to several factors, there are positive indications to suggest that the economy may rebound with time. The chamber made projections on some selected economic indicators for the first quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal year (FY 2024-25). It said imports would increase in the next couple of months. August imports may rise to US$5.5 billion and those of September to $5.8 billion. Overseas remittance is also likely to grow reaching $2.18 billion in August and at $2.29 billion in September. Gross foreign exchange reserves may rise to $26.85 billion at the end of August and to $27.95 billion in September --- a heartening uptick for the waning reserves. The review said the rate of inflation may start declining from the next month, dropping below 10.0 per cent. The NBR's tax revenue collection grew by 14.86 per cent to Tk 3.24 trillion in July-May of FY24 compared with that of Tk 2.82 trillion in the same period of FY23. The services sector exhibited growth, with a 4.97 per cent increase in the third quarter of FY24, up from 3.06 per cent in the previous quarter. As for export, the review did not make any projection as the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) has suspended publishing data from June this year due to data mismatch.Noting the projections, the MCCI also warned that one of the most pressing issues is persistent high inflation. The 12-month average inflation rate for FY24 stood at 9.73 per cent, compared with that of 9.02 per cent in FY23. Food inflation slightly decreased to 10.42 per cent in June from 10.76 per cent in May. Meanwhile, non-food inflation marginally dropped to 9.15 per cent from 9.19 per cent. The quality of inflation data, compiled by the BBS and quoted by the MCCI, however, deserves scrutiny since the July data released by the BBS depict a different picture. Acknowledgement of the current shortcomings and preparation for the challenges ahead will help the interim government address some of the most pressing issues demanding urgent attention. Tackling inflation should be the top priority for stabilising the market and restoring public confidence. Additionally, fostering economic growth, ensuring social equity, and reinforcing institutional reforms will be essential in building a foundation for sustainable stability.",

        "full_article": "At a time students and people of various walks of life are battling elements to reach flood victims with a single-minded mission of rescuing and providing them with food and other relief goods, there are elements who are setting factories on fire and looting valuables. Aggrieved people unleashed their wrath on establishments owned by high-ups including ministers of the immediate past or earlier cabinets of the deposed Awami League government from August 4, the day before its fall. After the overthrow of the government, anarchy was let loose in the industrial belt of Ashulia and Gazipur. The army was called in to maintain security of factories there. However, not all industrial units could be protected and more than 30 factories of different types were reportedly torched, vandalised and looted between August 4 and August 27 last. The latest to fall prey to arson attack, vandalism and random looting are the manufacturing units of Gazi Auto Tyres and Gazi Pipe on August 25 and 26. Incidentally, these units sprawling on 45 acres of land in Rupganj, Narayanganj first came under attacks for four days between August 5 and 8, which left those partially damaged. But this latest attack has not only left those facilities to ruins but also claimed scores of lives presumably of those who entered the factories for looting. Here the mob mentality was at its cynical worst with one group searching for valuables to loot on upper floors and another group setting the first floor on fire all in a frenzy. Reportedly, after 32 hours battle against the inferno, it could be brought under control by the fire fighters but rescue operation for trapped people, dead or alive, could not be conducted for fear of its collapse as well as the overheated interior till Tuesday. There is little chance of discovering any survivor inside the factory. The management of the factories have made it clear that there were no employees inside because the factory had remained closed since before the latest attacks. Now members of families and relatives of the missing gathered there for information have enlisted 126 names who, they somehow came to know, went there and were untraced by the time the fire was doused. Again, it is students who are enlisting the names of the missing. Life lost in any incident of fire is tragic indeed but when such a large number of people are consumed by fire deliberately started, the magnitude of the tragedy weighs heavily on collective psychology. However, the anarchy set into motion that was responsible for the tragedy gives a bad taste in the mouth. Contrast this with the loss of 46 lives and injury to 75 others in a fire at Green Cozy Cottage Shopping Mall on Baily Road early this year, the feeling of a tug at the heartstrings is overwhelming. It is a twisted mentality to invade for looting manufacturing establishments owned by people who were parts of the power clique or had allegiance to the deposed government. Admittedly, when in power, many of the owners resorted to unfair and illegal means and tactics for pooling funds and acquiring lands. At the time the aggrieved parties dared not complain or file cases against the powerful industrialists. But this is no excuse for letting loose anarchy in industrial units and reducing those to ruins. They could go to court for redress. Factories and industries whether in public or private sector are national assets. Law, if allowed to take its own course, can take care of any irregularities that may have been committed at the time of establishing the units. In extreme cases, the court may order government takeover or change in ownership following a due process. Aggrieved parties may thus receive monetary compensation. This is nowhere near wholesale nationalisation that the communists and the followers of socialism opted for in order to do away with private ownership of agricultural land and industries.How far the anti-discrimination policy will be extended is yet to be known. But to reduce the yawning social disparities, at least the share of the workers in profits has to be enhanced several times over. The pittance most working hands receive cannot bridge the atrocious gap between their incomes and those of the management. Equally true is this for the pay package ratio between the lower grade employees and the top grade officials both in private or public sector. It is exactly at this point a more pressing issue involving the workers and employees of the factories burnt or otherwise crippled comes to the fore. As many as 2,650 employees and officials of the Gazi Tyre and Gazi Pipe have been rendered unemployed for no fault of their own. At a time the country's factories and industries are struggling to overcome the fallouts of adverse domestic and international developments, such attacks prove to be the last straw on the camel's back. The consequent rise in unemployment unfolds not just a bleak spectre but also one highly foreboding. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Several south-eastern districts of Bangladesh witnessed record flooding this month due to heavy monsoon rains in the area together with the northeast Indian states of Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya and the subsequent opening of the gates of hydropower plants, barrages and dams in the close-door neighbour. As a country prone to natural catastrophes, Bangladesh faces calamities almost every year, but this time the flooding has given us an opportunity to rediscover a missing characteristic of the nation - the united strength. The empathy the nation has shown for the flood victims is unprecedented. People irrespective of their political and ideological differences united against the adversity. Their wholehearted support lessened the plight of the affected people to a great extent. Who has not extended their helping hand? From affluent sections to disadvantaged groups --- all came up with cash, food and relief materials. Students raised around Tk13 million from pedestrians at TSC on the Dhaka University campus in a single day after the onslaught of the floods began. Media reports showed children donating all their savings in piggy banks and street beggars handing over their whole-day alms to students collecting relief. A man donated a piggy bank stuffed with taka 1,000 and 500 currency notes, narrating to the media that the money was saved by her late mother and the siblings preserved it as her precious memory. There were hardly any local communities where committees were not formed to collect relief. Volunteers - both trained and untrained - coming from different strata of society rushed to the affected areas to join the relief activities risking their lives, alongside the government efforts. At least one volunteer sacrificed his life in the relief efforts.Why has the entire nation shown these feelings to the people in distress and joined the relief efforts wholeheartedly? There may be several reasons behind it, but the most important ones are that people have rediscovered the unity among them as a nation and their abilities as human beings and that they have got back their sense of belonging. There is no denying that huge infrastructural development took place in the country during the last regime, but people lost many good things during that period - unity, freedom of speech, sense of belonging and courage. The mass uprising, orchestrated by anti-quota students, which culminated in the ouster of the Awami League government, has brought many of those back. People now feel that this country really belongs to them and they can say and do whatever they like as long as they are rational and legal.Human beings are inherently benevolent and empathetic to others. History suggests these virtues excel when they are more free and united and enjoy greater civil rights. People in the entire Western world, who enjoy more freedom and greater civil rights than any other people, contribute most to the welfare of the world.We hope we, as a nation, will be able to enjoy greater freedom and civil rights in the days to come. We also hope the political changeover, which has come through the sacrifice of numerous priceless lives, will be a great opportunity for advancing these virtues. If we enjoy more freedom and get united, combating disasters will be easier for us. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The recent decision in favour of cancellation of the postponed Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination, following demands from a segment of students in the capital, raises significant concerns. This examination was crucial for 1.4 million students, and it is perplexing how justified it is to annul the HSC exam based on the pressure from a few hundred students without a broader consultation.A swift online survey could be conducted to gauge whether students at large support the cancellation. The incident of intrusion into the secretariat and the realisation of demands under duress is unjustifiable. Students argued that the cancellation was necessary because examinees were not mentally prepared and many were still experiencing trauma. While these concerns are valid, and the exam has already been postponed, the necessity of outright cancellation remains unclear. Students could have requested additional time rather than calling for cancellation.Cancelling exams under such pressure contradicts the very principles of the recently successful anti-discrimination student movement. This movement, which has seen many students and ordinary citizens sacrifice their lives in the fight for merit-based evaluation, rule of law, and an end to coercion, should not be undermined by yielding to undue pressure. If previous patterns of yielding to pressure continue, it diminishes the value of the sacrifices made by many. How can merit be assessed without proper testing? It is crucial for the coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement to ensure that students respect the rule of law and uphold the value of the examination process.\nSafayet HossenAzimpur, Dhaka",
