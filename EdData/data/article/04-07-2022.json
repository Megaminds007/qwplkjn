The tragic disaster has been compounded by the debris of the landslide blocking the Ijei river, creating a significant welling up of water which could inundate low-lying areas if the \u201cdam\u201d-like structure is breached. While the administration has sought to ease the water outflow from the stored water, inclement weather has hampered the pace of the efforts and the government and disaster management officials must now take precautions to ensure that the consequences of the disaster do not snowball even further. The fact that such a disaster occurred in a railway construction site in a landslide-prone area should give development planners and government officials in the State pause. While the Himalayan States in northern India and other States with hill/ghat terrain such as Kerala have registered the bulk of landslides in the last decade or so according to government data, the number of such incidents in Manipur (20 between 2014 and 2020) is not insignificant. The relatively high number of casualties accompanying these landslides and the fact that the Environment Ministry has itself acknowledged that the disasters were \u201canthropogenically\u201d induced are a matter of serious concern for the State. The Ministry identified the causes of landslides in Manipur as \u201ca result of modification of slopes for construction, widening of road, quarrying for construction materials, fragile lithography, complex geological structures and heavy rainfall\u201d.As a post-facto exercise, the State government must look at whether sufficient soil and stability tests were done before choosing the site for railway construction work in the Tupul area. Researchers have corroborated the fact that the areas in western Manipur abutting the national highways fall under very high, high or moderate hazard zones. The severe landslide occurred in the Tupul area despite the government identifying susceptible areas in the State through the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping project. The uncertain nature of rains, with the monsoon being more intense this year compared to predictions, has added to the problem. An early warning system for landslides is still being developed and refined by the Geological Survey of India and this could help reduce the scale of such disasters, once deployed across vulnerable States. While it is understandable that States in the Northeast are keen on accelerating connectivity projects to uplift a relatively economically backward region, disasters such as the landslide in Tupul point to the dangers of not taking ecological challenges related to deforestation seriously enough. This is a wake-up call for governments in States that are prone to landslides regularly.",

Provisional output in May across the eight core industries, spanning coal to electricity, grew by an average 18.1% from the corresponding month in 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s second wave had badly disrupted economic activity. Core output growth was led by double-digit year-on-year expansions in refinery products, electricity, steel and coal, which together account for three-fourths of the index. The four sectors bearing weights of about 28%, 20%, 18% and 10%, respectively, posted expansions of 16.7%, 22%, 15% and 25.1%, respectively. Cement and fertilizers, too, saw robust growth of 26.3% and 22.8%. However, on a sequential basis, growth in output over April 2022\u2019s levels was significantly slower, reflecting the \u2018optical illusion\u2019 created by low production in the year-earlier period. While the index as a whole registered month-on-month growth of 2.6%, petroleum products expanded 1.9%, electricity grew by 1.5%, and steel by a relatively healthier 5%. Disconcertingly, cement, a key building material that reflects activity levels in the job-intensive sectors, actually saw output shrink 3.2% from the preceding month.The more up-to-date June PMI data separately show price pressures dampened manufacturing growth to the slowest pace in nine months. June\u2019s PMI reading eased to 53.9, from 54.6 in May, amid a broad-based slowdown in orders, production, exports and input buying as customers cut back on spending amid inflation worries. Inflation, in fact, so dominates companies\u2019 assessment of the outlook that it depressed business confidence to the lowest level in 27 months. A majority 95% of the purchasing managers at the approximately 400 manufacturing companies polled by S&P Global cited the elevated price pressures as the main reason why they foresee no change in output from current levels in the year ahead. The silver lining in the survey, though, is that manufacturers reported their first shortening of input lead times since the onset of COVID-19, a positive augury for businesses\u2019 ability to scale up production quickly once demand revives. The onus is on policymakers to ensure that both monetary and fiscal action is focused on reining in inflation. Anything less risks affecting recovery.",

        "full_article": "Remembering the activist on his\u00a025th death anniversary\nTwo hours from Kolkata, a group of 30 young girls and women, all in the age group 16-22, had gathered in a village in Baruipur. They were told that the visitor from Bengaluru would like to understand their work as the leaders of girls\u2019 collectives they manage in their villages. Language was a potential barrier in our communication, but none of them seemed worried. Two of the leaders spoke English and Hindi and decided to help me converse.\nTo make sure I leave with a thorough understanding of the Federation\u2019s work, they started by explaining how villages are dispersed and often have hamlets on the periphery. Fearing that girls from these hamlets might be left out due to lack of representation in the panchayat, cluster and block groups, the girls had decided to have a separate collective for each hamlet.\nAs I listen to these girls talk passionately about their work as a collective, I am transported to my days at the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA), where emphasis on collectivisation and cooperation was extensive. I think of Sanjoy Ghose, a visionary social activist, and an alumnus of IRMA\u2019s first batch of Rural Management programme who understood the power of collectives, of equipping people with tools and processes to find their voice and shape their development discourse. Today, 25 years after he was abducted and killed by ULFA, I wonder how these 30 girls in Baruipur, without knowing him or his work, exemplify the same spirit.\nAs they were talking about rights and fighting patriarchy, I enquired what they would like to do in terms of vocation or higher education. There were quite a few responses, with many wanting to be lawyers or police personnel. The latter is something I\u2019ve heard in several girls\u2019 collectives, but I was quite intrigued to see so many aspiring lawyers.\nTheir response was straightforward\u2014\u201cif we have to keep ourselves safe, we\u2019ll need to do this, no one listens to us otherwise.\u201d They narrated an incident about a girl who was raped and how the police refused to file an FIR. The federation, along with some women\u2019s groups, sat outside the police station for hours and through the night, before the officers relented. They also advised the cops on specific sections of IPC that should be used.\nThe Federation was acutely aware of their realities and how systems were not geared to support them. Each one knew how patriarchy creates barriers for them, at every step. They also had a good sense of how to untie some of these knots. Once they got into collectives, they found a space to discuss their issues. They realised there are several girls who face similar problems.\nThis open and fearless space was facilitated by a local NGO, which also conducted sessions on their rights, gender, discrimination, etc. Armed with this perspective and facts (the Constitution, IPC, etc.), the collectives went on to create knowledge for themselves. That\u2019s when they decided to act together and mount a resistance to patriarchal overreach in their own lives and their neighbourhood.\nCollectives have done wonders across contexts. For girls and young women, these create a much-needed space to discover, dream, connect and cut through the restraints that dot their lives. Intrigued by the power of collectives, I keep looking for examples where theory meets practice to create transformative experiences for people. That\u2019s something Sanjoy did really well. His work and ideas are far more valuable today perhaps when we\u2019ve become weapons to rip apart our social fabric. The way these thirty girls in Baruipur are raising uncomfortable questions, speaking up and working together, Sanjoy would have loved to spend time with them and learn from them.\nThe author is a development worker (Charkha Features)",

        "full_article": "As elections to certain Assemblies approach, the controversy over the pension schemes is simmering the poll cauldron as retirement benefits debate rages\nCome elections and the demand of reviving the old pension scheme (OPS) has again taken centre stage. Thousands of employees in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh hit the streets and organised their march to Dharamsala Secretariat demanding OPS implementation. The employees warned the Government that \u2018Mission Repeat\u2019 would not be possible if their demand for old pension is not accepted. Kangra district is not only the biggest district of the State, but also one of the politically most important districts. It sends 15 MLAs to the Assembly. During the last Assembly session, Himachal Government employees under the banner of New Pension Scheme Karamchari Mahasangh (NPSKM) staged similar agitation outside the Assembly complex in Shimla. The employees recruited after 2004 in Himachal Pradesh were not entitled to the OPS. They are being given NPS, which was a form of contributory pension. Financial experts have warned that if the State decides to implement the OPS, it will put a financial burden of `4,000 crore. In a game of political oneupmanship, the Congress has already announced that if voted to power, it will implement OPS.\nThe agitations on the issue of old verses new pension policy seem to be fast picking up in the entire country. The Rajasthan Government set the ball rolling when Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in his budget speech in Feburary 2022 proposed to go back to old pension scheme for State Government employees appointed after January 1, 2004. The elections to the Assemblies of both States are scheduled for this year. During canvassing for the elections, the Samajwadi Party (SP) had proposed a similar move if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh. There are indications that something similar is being contemplated in Chhattisgarh. Such populist moves may seem to be politically expedient in near future but considering the current environment of economic uncertainty, it would prove disastrous in the times to come.\nThe challenge is not confined to India. The entire world is facing the crisis of funding of Defined Pension Benefit Sheme (DPBS), which guarantees a pension on retirement. As the old live longer and retirees live even longer because they can afford better diets, healthy lifestyle and world class medical care, the demographic transitions reduce the number of young to pay for the old. The main question is whether States with limited fiscal resources at their disposal can provide for such a scheme? Certainly not. According to budget estimates, the debt of State Governments has risen from 26.3 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 31.2 per cent in 2021-22. Let us take the example of Rajasthan. The current number of pensioners/family pensioners in Rajasthan is about 5.6 lakh. This number will increase by about 30,000 each year up to the late 2030s. The Government spent about `23,000 crore on pensions in the current year and has made contributions of about `2329,000 crore to NPS. This expenditure will increase each year by at least 7.5 per cent up to 2030s. Other States also face the same situation.\nThe implementation of such populist scheme at the face of competing demands that range from the provision of health, education, public transport and infrastructural facilities to the masses is nothing, but suicidal. The decision of shifting back to OPS is illogical and devastating to the hardpressed economy. State Governments should think twice before giving in to such populist demands and implementing such schemes. It may be helpful in winning elections for the time being, but it\u2019d have a deep impact on the States\u2019 economy in future.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi-chaired Union Cabinet approved the National Education Policy 2020, making way for large-scale, transformational reforms in school and higher education sectors. The new policy aims to pave the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems. This policy has replaced the 34-year-old National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986. Built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability, this policy is aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aims to transform India into a vibrant knowledge society and global knowledge superpower by making both school and college education holistic. The new policy talks about establishing a single regulator for higher education in the form of National Research Foundation which would ensure funding for outstanding peer-review research and to actively promote research in universities and colleges.\nThe Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) should be governed by highly qualified independent boards having academic and administrative autonomy that would ensure the appointment of competent and experienced faculty and fill up institutional leadership positions on merit. The NEP vision envisages moving towards a higher educational system consisting of large,multi-disciplinary universities and colleges with at least one in every district and with more HEIs across India that offer a medium of instruction or programs in local/Indian languages. It will ensure revamping of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment and student support for enhanced student experiences.\n(The writer is a senior journalist and Chairman, Panwar Group of Institutions, Solan, Himachal Pradesh.

        "full_article": "Oil producers and refineries exporting downstream products have had a good run this year. Consequently, on June 30, GoI levied an indirect tax on them to capture a part of the windfall gains. The levy of indirect taxes in the form of cess on domestic crude production sold at import parity prices, and on export of petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel will accrue entirely to GoI. This is because a cess isn\u2019t part of the divisible pool of taxes that has to be shared with states.\nLast week, the GST Council had a two-day meeting where steps to reform the structure of the indirect tax by closing some exemptions and correcting inverted duties were approved. It\u2019s a welcome move. GST has withstood stress tests in 2020-21 when the economy contracted. It withstood the challenge and its resilience is now beyond question. However, GST remains a work in progress. For example, the Council needs to extend GST to important economic inputs currently outside its purview. Notably, petroleum products and electricity.\nOne of the aims of GST is to improve India\u2019s economic competitiveness by removing the cascading impact of taxes. Keeping petroleum and electricity outside GST will not help us realise this goal as input tax credit is unavailable when they are used in economic activity. States are reluctant to subsume these products into GST as they feel GoI has eaten into the divisible pool of taxes by resorting to cess and surcharge. They have a point \u2013 the share of cess and surcharge in gross tax revenue increased from 10.4% in 2011-12 to 15.3% in 2018-19.\nBoth levels of government face fiscal pressure. But if India\u2019s most important indirect tax reform, GST, has to live up to its potential all stakeholders have to take the long view. GST was the outcome of a grand bargain when states ceded unilateral tax powers over the major part of their base in return for a temporary guaranteed compensation to smoothen the transition. That phase is over but much needs to be done. The way forward is for GoI, the entity with superior taxation powers, to avoid frequent recourse to cess. It vitiates the atmosphere and limits GST\u2019s potential. Avoiding cess to persuade states to bring petrol, electricity and all of real estate into GST should be the next big target. Its direct impact will be on India\u2019s competitiveness.\n\n",

He is also right that such ideal functioning is made difficult by the party in office expecting judicial endorsement of every governmental action and opposition parties likewise expecting support for their causes. But judging by the parameters of constancy and transparency, it is perhaps equally indisputable that painful gaps remain in courts\u2019 answerability to the Constitution that are entirely of their own doing.\nFor example, despite Article 20(2) safeguarding against double jeopardy, and also an SC judgment that subjecting an individual to numerous proceedings on the basis of the same cause is violative of fundamental rights, the clubbing of multiple FIRs into one jurisdiction is yet to become a procedural commonplace. Nupur Sharma is just the latest to experience this. In a much more widespread malaise, the elemental concept of \u2018bail not jail\u2019 has yet to be internalised by the judicial labyrinth.\nOn the transparency front, judicial appointments themselves present the most glaring gaps. In a strongly worded minority opinion when SC struck down the NJAC Act, Justice Chelameswar had written that transparency is an aspect of rationality and the need for transparency is more in the case of appointment process. The judgment too had underlined the need to enhance the collegium\u2019s transparency. And yet, great opacity still persists in appointments, as also in case listing. Constitutional matters like challenges to the nullification of Article 370 sit delayed before multi-judge benches, with poor explanation. These are challenges that are very much within the judiciary\u2019s domain to address.

        "full_article": "Fifty years ago, in June 1972, the Watergate scandal broke out. Former CIA personnel had broken into the Democratic Party National Committee Office in the middle of the night at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. A Senate investigation ensued, and President Richard J Nixon resigned two years later on August 8, 1974 from US presidency. Nixon had to resign not for the break-in itself, but for his attempt to deny and hide the existence of taped records of White House discussion about planning the crime. The Republican Party's leaders in Congress then agreed that the president had to go, because getting away with a palpable \"obstruction of justice\" at the behest of the president would be a fatal blow to the institutions of democracy.\nIn June 2022, the US Congress is holding hearings to ferret out the facts about the insurrection on January 6, 2020 when a rowdy crowd invaded the US Capitol building, shouting death to Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The demonstrators were trying to prevent Congress from the required certifying of the presidential election results, in which Joe Biden had defeated Donald Trump by a difference of seven million popular votes. The violent demonstration that resulted in at least seven deaths is alleged to have been planned and encouraged from the White House.\nIn the Watergate case, an incumbent president, who had been re-elected for a second term, was obliged to take responsibility and pay the price of resigning in disgrace for what was regarded as gross malfeasance. Fifty years later, a former president is accused of conspiring a far more serious offence: overturning the presidential election results and supporting a violent assault on the Capitol building, the seat of the US Congress. But this time, the political establishment is so divided by party line that the large majority of Republican Congress and Senate members oppose even the investigation, which they consider a political witch hunt.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's support base among the public holds, and he wields great influence in nominating Republican candidates for the midterm election in November 2022 for the Congress and state-level offices. Political pundits believe that there are very low public expectations about morality and trustworthiness of politicians. Even the facts about the threat of a veritable coup engineered by Trump may not be enough to defeat Trump supporters in the midterm election in November.\nTwo-thirds of US residents (64 percent) think that democracy is in crisis and at risk of failing, according to a National Public Radio (NPR) and the global market research company IPSOS survey in January 2022. Only seven percent of young Americans thought the US was a \"healthy\" democracy, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics youth polling in December 2021.\nPolitical observers believe that the midterm election remains a toss-up, and will be decided by the voters' views on the Biden administration's handling of the economy and the danger of a stagflation that looms large after the pandemic and the Ukraine war. Donald Trump is even seen by many as a viable candidate for presidency in 2024, unless he is indicted and sent to jail. The attorney general of the Biden administration, Merrick Garland, who has to make the decision about pursuing indictment, is concerned about the political repercussions of such a move rather than the merit of the case. He is watching what the Congressional hearing brings out, and how the public reacts to the hearing. This does not augur well for democracy in the US. What does this tell us about the fate of democracy in the world?\nA group of American scholars have written about a clear and consistent pattern they see, which they call the Authoritarian Playbook (Protect Democracy, June 2022). Aspiring autocrats follow this playbook with minor variations to achieve their goal. The playbook lists seven basic tactics that the authoritarian leaders employ in pursuit of their aim. These are:\n1. They attempt to politicise independent institutions, such as undermining the independence of the election process.\n2. They spread disinformation \u2013 controlling media platforms to spread disinformation and undermine confidence in democratic institutions.\n3. They aggrandise executive power at the expense of checks and balances \u2013 influencing legislature and judiciary not to restrain the executive branch from exercising power in corrupt ways.\n4. They quash criticism and dissent \u2013 the authoritarian leaders and autocratic-minded state functionaries use the power of government to limit dissent.\n5. They specifically target vulnerable and marginalised communities \u2013 rallying populist support by attacking vulnerable communities and defining them as outsiders.\n6. They work to corrupt elections, such as the efforts in the US to overturn the 2020 election results, passing new legislation in states to limit voting rights and control the voting process.\n7. They stoke violence \u2013 deliberately looking the other way or even inflaming violence to provide political cover for restricting civil liberties and suppressing opposition voter turnout.\nDoes this list look familiar? If this list is about the global state of democracy, what can be said of the emerging and more fragile polities in the developing world \u2013 including Bangladesh?\nBangladesh is in a neighbourhood not particularly congenial to the flourishing of democracy. India, the behemoth, backsliding precipitously from its secular, pluralistic and democratic ideology, is not a good example or influence. We cannot but be impacted, directly or indirectly, by what happens in the region. But can Bangladesh be proactive in reclaiming its progressive, inclusive, egalitarian and just-society vision that inspired its charter as an independent country?\nThe next parliamentary election in Bangladesh in 18 months would come at the end of the third consecutive term of the Awami League-led government. It has been a period of economic growth and mega infrastructure projects, but also a period of democratic erosion marked by two rounds of seriously flawed national elections in 2014 and 2018, and growing economic inequality, further aggravated by the Covid pandemic.\nReversing the authoritarian trends and mindset that have sunk roots in the political culture cannot happen overnight. But a beginning in this direction can be the legacy that Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangabandhu, can leave for the next generation. Keeping the 12th parliamentary elections in mind, four actions can be taken: a) Ensuring that candidates are nominated because of their honesty, competence, popularity and record of public service, rather than the money and muscle power they can muster; b) Pledging to shun the use of mastans, muscle power, intimidation and violence by the ruling party and its candidates, and reining in the affiliated bodies such as the Chhatra League, Jubo League and Sramik League, observing strictly the rules for public representation; c) Pledging total support for the Election Commission to conduct a free and fair election, placing the government machinery at the hand of the commission for this purpose, and encouraging it to exercise its authority fully, including postponement of polling as needed; and d) Pledging to forego stoking factional, communal, sectarian, and religious divisions for political gains and reclaim the liberation ideals of justice, inclusion and human dignity for all \u2013 thus aspiring to be a model of liberal democracy in the region.\nConvincing the citizens of the sincerity of these intentions will be the surest way to seize victory for the ruling party at the polls, and at the same time of injecting vital life-blood into the democratic process. Only words will not convince the public. Actions will have to follow in the form of creating a level playing field for all political parties \u2013 not pushing for repressive laws, and not using government power to punish dissent and protests.\n\u00a0\nDr Manzoor Ahmed is professor emeritus at Brac University, chair of Bangladesh ECD Network (BEN), and vice-chair of the Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE).\n",

Both allow us to define potential ways to combat the climate crisis. But at the same time, these are causing some confusion and misunderstanding among the stakeholders working on climate action, which need to be demystified.\nLet's start with the NbS. To fight climate change, we must bring the global carbon emission down to net zero. To do that, in addition to inventing and using technologies to shift from using fossil fuels to renewables, we can also rely on nature and ecosystems. We can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, for example, by planting diverse mangrove saplings on the new chars along our coastline. Similarly, we can re-green degraded ecosystems, like the denuded hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), to capture carbon. We can also reduce the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by improving the ecologically-critical area around the Sundarbans or by sustainably managing Hakaluki Haor, for instance. Protecting nature can also help us survive the long-term impacts of climate change. If we conserve the hills' tree cover, it will ensure water supply even if there are more rainless days in the coming decades. And nobody knows better than Bangladesh how the Sundarbans and the coastal green belt have been protecting our lives and assets from cyclones.\nAll these ecosystem-based actions are examples of NbS. By protecting, restoring, managing and creating ecosystems, not only humans are getting benefitted, but biodiversity is improving too. But, as we can see, NbS is nothing new. It is rather something we have been practising for ages, such as floating agriculture at the central coast of Bangladesh. It is only a new framing to bring all nature-based activities under one umbrella. This new approach can help us to integrate nature into different actions to tackle diverse societal challenges, particularly climate change.\nLLA, on the other hand, takes place when at the lowest administrative level, local governments, communities, organisations and other local-level stakeholders identify, prioritise, plan, implement, monitor, evaluate, and learn from adaptation actions against climate change. Such interventions are supported by national governments, donors, civil society organisations and private sector agencies by closely working with the local entities. Bangladesh has long been part of the conceptualisation, evolution and consolidation of these people-centred approaches. Building on the lessons learnt from over the past couple of decades, LLA essentially looks at adaptation from a whole-of-society perspective and mainstreams principles of governance in all possible senses.\nBoth the LLA and NbS have strongly been appreciated and adopted by global agencies. Large money lenders of big infrastructure projects, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have embraced NbS. USAID's new Climate Strategy (2022-2030) has made NbS and locally-led development two of its five core principles to spend USD 150 billion in the current decade. Recently, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has launched a 120-million-pound programme called Bangladesh Climate and Environment Programme. Its first thematic area envisages improved climate resilience of the people of Bangladesh through scaling up LLA and NbS by protecting and restoring nature. Also in Bangladesh, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and the Bangladesh National Adaptation Plan (NAP) are two recent draft policy instruments which have explicitly adopted LLA and NbS as core approaches.\nDespite their humble, familiar origins, both LLA and NbS face a number of questions from the development practitioners, who sometimes struggle to understand and adopt new concepts and approaches every few years. Another challenge is communicating these new concepts to the stakeholders \u2013 from the local communities to the policymakers. It is also argued whether developing countries should adopt these concepts apparently coming from the West. These concerns may seem real, but are not justified. All these people-focused concepts and approaches may seem different, but in fact all are focusing on human well-being through sustainable development.\nBoth the LLA and NbS underscore the importance of knowledge and understanding of the context, challenges, uncertainties, opportunities, and solutions. They value and ensure people's participation in every step of an action following the principles on diversity, inclusion, equity, access, transparency, accountability, and empowerment. Both focus on responsible and flexible funding and programming, and promote learning by doing and adapting to ever-changing scenarios. They focus on sustainability, scaling up and scaling out of actions, which would build peoples' resilience and ensure their overall well-being.\nAs we continue planning, funding and implementing actions to build community resilience, we must invest time and efforts to understand novel approaches and tools. We shouldn't shy away from these concepts even if they seem overwhelming; rather, we should play our role in translating theories into practice and feeding our experience to the policymaking process. While doing so, we shouldn't adopt new concepts as they are, but should contextualise them matching our needs.\n\u00a0\nDr Haseeb Md Irfanullah\u00a0is an independent consultant working on environment, climate change, and research systems.

        "full_article": "Here's an image that will likely be seared into our memory for long: a teacher being forced to wear a garland of shoes around his neck. Watching the grainy video that surfaced on YouTube, you could almost mistake him for a leader as he emerged from a building, flanked by police, with his pressed hands high in the air, as if to greet waiting crowds\u2026 except it was not. Except the police there were just dummies. Except the crowds outside gathered to witness his ultimate humiliation.\nMoments like this can be strangely evocative. In 2008, when an Iraqi journalist threw a shoe in the direction of a US president, it came to represent the pent-up anger of a nation for an unjust war that the US had imposed on it. Pent-up anger was again at work when vindictive crowds in Narail sought to recreate that moment, and it was no coincidence that their target was a Hindu. Regardless of the contrasting symbolism of shoes, enabling heroism in one instance and villainy in another, moments like this, once you see them, are hard to unsee.\nWhat was Swapan Kumar's crime? He tried to save a student, also a Hindu, who wrote a Facebook post in support of Nupur Sharma, a now-suspended leader of India's BJP who had made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad. This made ideal fodder for their tormentors whose anger at a faraway enemy was, until that point, restricted to helpless outbursts on social media.\nBut if we're being honest, many things had to go wrong for a moment this disturbing to be born. Regardless of the communal undertone, it was actually the result of a complex interplay of several factors including the rise of the Muslim Right and shrinking space for diversity, a general anti-India feeling, crumbling of democratic institutions, and moral decadence in a society where long-cherished values \u2013 like respect for teachers or elders \u2013 are being playfully tossed about. Can we address one without addressing the other?\u00a0\nSwapan Kumar Biswas, who has been in hiding since that day, later admitted that after learning what was about to happen, he felt like committing suicide to save himself from the impending humiliation. \"But I couldn't do it thinking of my three children, my wife and my mother,\" he said. In hindsight, he would consider himself \"lucky\" to have come out of it alive. In India's Rajasthan, not long after, a tailor was beheaded purportedly for a social media post supporting Nupur Sharma. This debate that has caused so much outrage and counter-outrage simply refuses to be over, in yet another example of the deepening polarisations across the subcontinent.\u00a0\nBut should we be happy that the worst was averted in our case, or sad that even such humiliation is somehow not tragic enough? Robbed of their dignity, can teachers do what they have been historically expected to do? While any teacher can be in trouble in a vicious, lawless climate, minority teachers have had a particularly rough go of it lately, especially when the allegation is \"hurting religious sentiments\". Before Swapan Kumar, we had Amodini Paul, Hriday Mondal, Pabitra Kumar Roy, Shyamal Kanti Bhakta, etc. Last week, Utpal Kumar Sarkar was beaten to death by a student apparently incensed by his disciplinary measures. After that, the University Teachers' Network demanded an end to attacks on teachers.\nA fair demand, of course. But moments of grief should not distract us from the wider issues at play here.\nLet's face it. Teachers are being attacked not because they are teachers, nor are minority teachers the only ones subjected to the modern-day Inquisition, as evidenced, this Friday, by the brutalisation of Prof Ratan Siddique and his family. But there seems to be a narrow, ahistorical sense of victimhood, an illusion that things happen in a vacuum, isolated from other, larger developments. Journalists, political activists, rights defenders and social reformers have all felt singled out at different times. The truth is, in an environment where intolerance is encouraged from the highest seats of power, anyone using\u00a0their conscience or not toeing the line is fair game.\nIf there is an innate vulnerability in all this, it is the minority status in a majoritarian tyranny. This is as true in India/Pakistan as in Bangladesh. Islamophobic abuse in one country can result in Hinduphobic abuse in another. There are historical precedents going back decades that show how such reactions have been reciprocated, often with devastating consequences. When majoritarian emotions run high, minorities make easy targets. So in India, they tell Muslims and immigrants to go to Pakistan/Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, they tell Biharis and Hindus to go to Pakistan/India. The cycle keeps repeating itself. It's like we've never really come out of our collective Partition trauma.\nBut it is possible to defend one's faith or guard against assaults on religious sentiments without condoning violence. It is possible to consider Islamophobia immoral without making it illegal. Unfortunately, despite having the garb of a secular polity, our laws, most notably the Digital Security Act, make \"hurting religious sentiments\" a punishable offence. Often, though, those are used to serve majoritarian interests and, as in case of people like the Narail student, as a tool to calm frayed nerves.\nIt's like correcting a wrong with another wrong, only it doesn't work. Forget the right to freedom of speech. By enacting such laws and still letting zealots have their satisfaction before the law is allowed to intervene, we're basically trying to force-stop all ideological debates. We're so invested in the short-term gain of such tactics that we fail to realise that matters of the heart cannot be resolved by force, legal or physical. Our ideological differences will perhaps never go away, but we can learn to sit together and find a way through compromise.\nThe Narail incident shows how this simple wisdom is getting harder to follow with the whole state apparently set on a collision course with reason, civility and justice. Increasingly, police are indistinguishable from the criminals they're supposed to deal with; politicians are openly stoking hatred and divisions to serve vested interests; democratic institutions are run on an exploit-first-serve-later basis; and the judiciary is either ineffective or irrelevant or actively enabling a culture of impunity. A suffocating environment prevails in nearly every sector because of the corrupting influence of politics.\nThere is no one villain, or one victim, in the Swapan Kumar saga. All of good had to fail for all of bad to be successful. We need to fix this state of affairs before we have a chance of fixing how teachers are being treated.\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The first couple of days of the Padma Bridge's opening was chaotic, hilarious, tragic and outright ridiculous.\nAs I was rummaging through social media, and listening to the interviews that our colleagues from Munshiganj sent, I saw \u2013 as I guess almost all of us did \u2013 grotesque renditions of absurd actions from typical Bangladeshis.\nDespite all of these being illegal and dangerously unsafe, they broke fences, they stopped and got off everywhere on the bridge and made TikTok videos doing I-don't-know-what-that-is-even poses. Some even performed namaz. Overspeeding killed two; some urinated on the bridge. Then there was a guy who, after a good beating from the police, said with a broad smile that if he couldn't get onto the Padma Bridge, his heart would've shattered (the original Bangla version \"Koilja faitta moirai jaitam\" is way funnier). And then there was a 30-something woman saying, \"I always saw this bridge on Facebook and TV and everyone in the village was coming here. So, I got into a pickup truck too.\"\nWait.\nI think there's an actual glimmer of awe in the awkward and shy gaze of this woman. This was perhaps an actual experience of a lifetime for her. And, perhaps, inside all of those reckless bikers, rowdy pickup groups, political-bandana troupes, that girl who swam to see the prime minister, and that father-and-son duo with hilarious haircuts, there is a cathartic emotion of experiencing a monumental spectacle.\nAnd, why wouldn't it be such? The Padma Bridge is one of the most magnificent engineering marvels of the modern world \u2013 one of the greatest accomplishments of Bangladesh. And I guess no one in this country could remain unaware of each and every step of this megastructure's construction: from the first false accusations and erecting pillars one by one, to the grand opening of the new vital line of our riverine flatland.\nSo, was it surprising that people swarmed to the Padma Bridge?\nAlongside all breeds of media and corporations jumping on board the hype train, and those songs about Swapner Padma Shetu, the government even issued a toll-free service for 18 bridges on the inauguration day of Padma Bridge so that people could easily come to the ceremony.\nWas it at all surprising, then, that there would be mayhem on that day? That the crowd would disregard civility and break the law?\nBangladesh is now starving for public spaces and communal experiences. There is an alarming deficit of open theatres, playing fields, parks, lakes \u2013 anything recreational where the citizens can visit, create shared memories, spend a solitary evening, and grow a sense of belonging with the community, or even understand the concept of communal good. How can they know that if they do not have the civil decency to take care of public properties, all of us would be affected in the long run?\nIn Dhaka, and in most of the big cities in the country, this generation has lived the entirety of their lives inside rapid and scattered urbanisation, in absurd concrete labyrinths. The indoors are congested, isolating, barely liveable; and the outside is chaotic, filthy, and life-threatening. There's scarcely any place to take an idle breath, enjoy the moment, and have an anxiety-free engagement with the environment. Living here means scavenging, annexing whatever one can find.\nEncounters with the community mostly result in interpersonal power negotiations, or what I'd like to call a \"hedam culture.\" Suppose, you are to cross the road; in that very moment, a car and you enter in a hedam show-off of who has the stronger guts. If you have more hedam, the car will (hopefully) stop to let you cross, and if you don't, well, forget about ever crossing the road (or please take the nearest foot overbridge if there's one around).\nThis phenomenon is present in all aspects of our society \u2013 urban and rural. The laws seem different if you have a big car, are a powerful person or even pretend to know someone in the government. If you have bribes to offer, you are exempted from hassles. If you have political affiliations, you can beat up someone or secure a bed in the hospital. The mass never encountered absolute universality of law, and many distrust the law enforcement.\nSo, in this context, would it be surprising if the people regarded regulations as challenges to conquer, rather than as acts of communal duty?\nThey felt triumphant on the Padma Bridge after they elbowed ahead of the crowd, outran the police, ran across the road between two swishing trucks, completed an overtake, did not wear a helmet, unbolted some nuts, sneaked in without paying toll fees, and so on.\nThen there's those TikTokers and social media addicts. Is it normal whatever in this bizarre world they were doing? Well, to a surprisingly great degree, yes. The world is now finding new realities and new connections in the virtual realm. Under surveillance capitalism, with powerful devices in hand, and wondrous algorithms controlling our thoughts and actions, the youths have become virtual citizens. And every part of the world is trying to make sense of this whirlwind. (And governments, celebrities and companies are jumping on this train, because now here's where the money, data and power is.)\nEspecially in our society, where physical spectacles are non-existent and public spaces are repulsive, youths are leaning more towards the communities in the virtual world that taps into their fantasies for extreme machismo, the ultimate hedam, the hoarded extravagances, the grand spectacles. And they, too, crave for a spectacular place to shoot a video.\nAnd the Padma Bridge is one of the very few physically grand spectacles in this country. Of course, Padma Bridge is a functional structure, not a tourist destination. But how many non-functional megastructures do we have in our country? And functional or not, this bridge is euphoric to stare at, to go across. And through this mere functional structure, millions of lives will be changed. Even Durga and Apu came to see the new rail track in Pather Panchali, or those Dhakaiyas in the photograph from the 70s who went in hundreds and just stood there on a foot overbridge because it was something new.\nI'm not saying everything that people did on the Padma Bridge is acceptable, nor is the way this society is functioning. But did the two days of madness come out of the blue? We all knew. We were waiting for something to laugh at, something to gasp at, something to ridicule. And we felt triumphant saying, \"I told you so!\", \"Typical (uncivilised) Bangladeshis!\"\nWhen we say something like \"typical Bangladeshis,\" we somehow place ourselves in a higher position \u2013 like we are not typical Bangalees, we are civil, we have common sense, we'd never do that. They did that. They are ridiculous. This is the narrative that almost all those who hold credibility in our society put out, or at least cradle inside: journalists, policymakers, online celebrities \u2013 the educated bunch. With this, we are negating the voice and experience of the majority of the population. But have we ever thought that, if the law, the civilised narrative, the streets, the city, the new Padma Bridge alienates them, if beating them is a public spectacle, if ridiculing them is a national event, then they would, too, regard all things \"civil\" as alien, as not-their-headache, or at least an entity to struggle against?\nI confess that I, too, am using this \"us-and-them\" dichotomy. Let's be honest \u2013 the majority of the readers of this article are privileged; we are civil, we know what dichotomy or grotesque means (or at least have the sense to Google it); we don't do these unmindful activities; we keep our air-conditioned offices clean. We don't flock to Padma Bridge in extreme heat and sweat. We go to restaurants where the interiors are nice, maybe to a tourist destination or a foreign country. (Except when some Marvel movie is released or a new branch of Domino's opens. Then it's worth going crazy.)\nBut if we, and I'd like to believe the organisers, had the slightest hunch that this kind of chaos could have happened, that there'd be TikTokers trying to make videos, that people would never completely maintain the law on their own, why is it only them who are persecuted, ridiculed, or held accountable?\nAll of these could have been taken into account; there could have been a drive to effectively create awareness, make people understand the situation and maintain regulations accordingly, and of course facilitate the need for a public spectacle. But were these addressed properly?\nThe Padma Bridge is one of the firsts of many functional megastructures to be opened to the public in the next few years. Maybe next time, instead of laughing at the situation, we can refrain from reducing the people to mere objects of ridicule, and try to understand why this is happening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNaimul Alam Alvi is senior production executive in Star Multimedia.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We're appalled to learn that after being eight years in the making, and having spent Tk 727 crore of public money, the upcoming National Household Database is set to be a big failure, as per a report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED). The amount of money that has been spent on the project is enormous. And the amount of additional money that will likely be wasted as a result of it being a failure is even higher. For example, this year's safety net allocation of Tk 113,576 crore is supposed to be disbursed by using this database, which, according to the IMED, is \"unusable\".\nNothing about this makes any sense. This project required no large infrastructure development and no land acquisition, yet it is already delayed by five years. As a result, there have been four revisions which considerably raised its cost \u2013 by 112.75 percent, to be exact. For all that trouble, what we will finally have will not even be able to correctly identify the poor and bring them under the government's social safety net programmes. In other words, it is a complete waste.\nReportedly, 545 data entry operators were hired in 2016 but not given defined responsibilities. Several consultants were also appointed, but they failed to perform properly leading to a number of inconsistencies in the database. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) also did not appoint an experienced officer, and many of its IT consultants and senior programmers who were involved with the project didn't do any noticeable work either, which further contributed to this nightmare.\nAll of these issues should have been noticed beforehand. Apparently, there should have been at least 35 project implementation committee (PIC) meetings but only nine were held, leading to poor oversight and numerous delays in taking important decisions and also in the implementation process. This sums up the lack of concern and professionalism shown at stage of the project, which raises the question: Why did this happen? Why was such reckless mismanagement allowed in a database project long expected to save the government heaps of cash by reducing corruption in government aid programmes?\nIt seems like this project, and all the talk about how it will \"revolutionise\" the government's social safety net programmes, were nothing but hot air. That is not to deny that if done right, it can be a vital requirement in the service of the people. Therefore, we urge the government to figure out how to get it back on track \u2013 without burning heaps more of public finds \u2013 and a good starting point for that will be to hold those responsible for this disaster to account.\n",

        "full_article": "We're alarmed to see the latest iteration of the Global Rights Index by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) in which Bangladesh \u2013 for the sixth year in row \u2013 has been ranked among the world's 10 worst countries for workers. The report evaluated the labour rights records of 148 countries, and Bangladesh seems to have found a home in the comity of worst rights violators. While not an achievement to be proud of, this does give us an opportunity to assess what went wrong and why so.\nIn its evaluation, the ITUC highlights areas in which workers' rights continue to be \"severely curtailed\". It specifically mentions the garment sector, which employs over 4 million workers. Despite being the engine that runs this billion-dollar industry, their rights to strike and to establish or join trade unions are frequently violated. Often, attempts at forming unions are ruthlessly suppressed, and protests over unpaid wages met with extreme brutality, with police sometimes firing live rounds to disperse agitating workers. In 2021 alone, at least six workers were shot and killed by police during strikes. Many more were gravely injured.\nAs well as physical violence, threats to workers' rights also include mass dismissals, criminal prosecutions and heavy-handed bureaucracy, including an extremely burdensome registration process imposed on establishment of unions apparently to frustrate such efforts. A lack of opportunity to be unionised means a lack of opportunity for them to bargain for better wages and working conditions. The condition of workers in the export processing zones (EPZs) is particularly bad, as they are prohibited from organising any protest there.\nUnderstanding the plight of garment workers is key because all the problems facing the labour force in general can be seen here in microcosm. An important component of labour rights is safety: safety from occupational hazards, and from harassment at workplaces. Another component is the guarantee of decent wages. Yet another component is job security. Workers in almost all sectors \u2013 including construction, shipbreaking, etc. \u2013 seem to suffer on these fronts, with the administration and existing legal instruments seemingly favouring the interests of employers over that of workers. With as many as 182 businessmen elected in the last general election \u2013 or over 61 percent of all MPs \u2013 the power balance between employers and workers is heavily skewed towards the former. This manifests in increasing discrimination, abuse and rights violations. \u00a0\nThis is unacceptable. Labour rights are but human rights, and we cannot continue to ignore them for the sake of development. We urge the authorities to address this situation and create an environment in which no one takes advantage of the precarity of poor workers.\n",

        "full_article": "The news of Japan's interest in taking skilled manpower from Bangladesh comes as a remarkable booster to the country's manpower sector. Sadly, the sector has been in the doldrums for the past few years. For Bangladesh, the flow of remittance began plummeting alarmingly, with many workers declared out-of-job during the pandemic. Thousands have had to return, many disillusioned and empty-handed. The news of Japan's willingness to take skilled workforce, going against the prevailing trend of focus on just the manual labourers, opens up a fresh opportunity. Especially, because Bangladesh has also been looking for openings to send its newly emerging skilled workforce. In response to Japan's interest, Bangladesh has decided to send at least 3,000 skilled workers to that highly developed country. Currently, it may look like a small beginning but if the initial batch's performance is satisfactory, not only Japan but other develop countries may find in Bangladesh a reliable source for such skilled hands. According to different sources, foreign workers are in good demand in that country. That Dhaka will put in the best of its efforts to enter that market in a big way is implied. As has been learnt, the Bangladesh expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry and International Manpower Development Organisation of Japan in 2017 signed an agreement for training technical interns of Bangladesh in Japan. Simultaneously, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on recruiting Specified Skilled Workers (SSW) in August, 2019. These formalities point to preparations for years prior to putting into effect the programme of skilled Bangladeshi manpower export to Japan. This is hopeful news that by 2025, Japan will need around 345,000 foreign workers, with 3,000 skilled hands going from Dhaka. Japan, an Asian economic power, has been opening up to the outside world over the last few decades. Thus standing by Bangladesh in times of its phases of economic progress, Japan has emerged as one of the former's standout development partner.The deal between the Bangladesh ministry of overseas employment and IM Japan contains provisions for training Bangladeshi technical interns in Japan. Under its ambit 178 local youths have already left for Japan. In line with the MoC signed between the two nations, Japan is poised to hire Bangladesh manpower in 14 sectors and industries. There will be two categories: Technical Interns and the Specified Skilled Workers --- to be employed in care-giving sectors. The other areas include cleansing buildings, dealing with machinery and their parts, industrial tools, engaging in electrical and electronic goods gadgetry, ICT technology, ship-building, automobile and aviation sectors. Agriculture, fisheries, food and beverage have also not been excluded.For SSWs, proficiency in the Japanese language and skill in specific works would be deemed basic prerequisites. The deal on recruitment of skilled and trained workforce from Bangladesh by Japan is apparently progressing well. But seen from the past experience elsewhere, these splendid projects begin faltering midway due to training sessions' loss of steam. Skill-improvement training should continue without pause at both the manpower senders' and receivers' ends.",

        "full_article": "Political satire does more than take the Mickey out of politicians. It exposes the hollowness behind grandiloquence and reveals the bareness in the cupboard of resolve. What the actors on the world stage often forget is that in the crowd of believers, there will always be a child to point out the Emperor's new clothes. Except these aren't children but personalities such as sculptor Isaac Cordal or the creative team at Time magazine. Cordal was at his brilliant best in sculpting in Berlin world leaders debating Climate Change while the water slowly engulfed and put them under.Perhaps the Time team copied the format in a cover of Antonio Guetteres in knee-deep water. His caustic and matter-of-fact statement is pointed. \"We seem trapped in a world where fossil fuel producers and financiers have humanity by the throat. For decades, many in the fossil fuel industry have invested heavily in pseudo-science and public relations with a false narrative to minimise their responsibility for climate change and undermine ambitious climate change policies\".This is the latest salvo coming from the man that heads an organisation set up to prevent wars and promote equitable practices in the world. Having been re-elected for a second term, Mr Guetteres swallowed his pride at being left out in the cold during the pandemic. It was after the inevitable Security Council debacle over Ukraine that he became critical of the five nations that can and do make the United Nations irrelevant. Picking up on the insidious fall-out of the war, he was as blunt.\"..let's make sure the war in Ukraine is not used to increase that dependency (on fossil fuel markets)\". The closing line is the clincher that reveals the Emperor's new clothes. \"Today's most pressing domestic problems -- like inflation and gas prices /are themselves climate and fossil fuel problems\".The Cordals of the world have been suggesting as much as did Greta Thunberg in her famous reaction to the Col 26 meeting -- \"Blah, blah, blah\". During the pandemic, leading fossil fuel producers did their best to reduce their presence and investment in such carbon-based activity. These were efforts dashed by President Biden, turning to ramp up extraction from the United States' zealously guarded reserves of Shale oil. The entire world is hurting, some becoming bankrupt. Others, such as Bangladesh, are seeking preemptory loans. Countries are quietly scampering around looking to find Yuan and Roubles as China and India gleefully support Russia's navigation skirting the sanctions. Just in terms of fuel, China's imports from Russia have gone up 55 per cent making her the largest supplier. India has also upped its imports, taking advantage of cut prices. Russia has promised the BRICS partners Brazil, India, China and South Africa support. An Indian company has ordered $25 million of coal from Russia paying in Yuan (anyone surprised?). India is also buying crude, refining and reselling to ramp up flagging exports. The United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) debts are at an all-time high. Roughly US$28 trillion for the US and the UK \u00a31731 billion or 85 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It's lower than most European countries with France waltzing at 92 per cent. Having to foot higher bills, fund temporarily the Ukraine war and face galloping inflation, the G7 have now got a billion dollars pledged towards supporting pandemic-hit countries in the future. That's short of the $10 billion estimated. Then again, funds pledged to help the most vulnerable countries against Climate Change haven't materialised. That three non-G7 countries were invited to attend the meeting in Germany displays a sign of helplessness. That's magnified by the agreement to hold the next G-20 meeting in India's Kashmir. So much for the world's concern about minorities! Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momen's appeal to Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has met with the same upper lip as in Munich. No one wants the Rohingya. They must go home is the chorus. Choruses never enunciate the 'How'. In general, Ukraine was a fairly well-off country despite all its corruption. The refugees that have invaded Europe have been welcomed with open arms even as other, middle-eastern and African refugees are denied entry to Poland and being sent packing to Rwanda by the UK, in exchange for hard cash to that country. It will take decades to rebuild all that was destroyed in Iraq, Syria, Libya and now Ukraine. The proxy war participants will no doubt help, but not with their own money. And as we know, debt repayment mechanisms are all pointed in one direction. Subservience.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "A small country mostly so homogeneous could not perhaps be so divisive as it looks now. It is all because of the rise of extreme intolerance within society. At a time when the country was supposed to get united on issues concerning the national well-being, the crack is widening. So visceral is the antagonism between and among factions of communities that it is not only wreaking havoc with social harmony and humanitarianism which once was this people's plus point but also with the minimum basic common sense. When people lose understanding of and respect for fellow human beings, the fangs and claws of the animal in the guise of civilization get bared unrestrainedly. It is also preceded by degeneration of taste and vulgar exhibitionism in all possible forms. Unaware people stoop so low that it becomes a national shame. Thus rationality and logic become the number one casualty in the first place. One of the worst examples of this is perhaps the act of insanity/sabotage and vulgarity that has spoiled the euphoria of the nation over the opening of the Padma Bridge to traffic. What can prompt a young man, who has reportedly completed his higher study recently, to remove nuts and bolts from the bridge's railing on the very inaugural day is beyond any sane person's imagination. What was he actually up to prove by the mindless act? Was it that it was a bridge so fragile, the nuts and bolts came off with the slightest effort when the work has been barely completed? Whether he tried to maintain that credit goes to him for detecting this flaw so early or he tried to prove that the construction, by extension, of the bridge is of low quality and therefore it will not sustain and be risky is yet to be known. Questioning by the intelligence branch might reveal what his real motive behind the act was. That he had accomplices in the act is understandable. After all, the video clip had to be framed by someone else. There is no way of squarely blaming the man who took a few nuts and bolts off. The man behind the camera has been caught but the possibility of members of a gang involved in hatching a conspiracy behind this act cannot be ruled out. Maybe, evil minds got together to demonstrate an antithesis of national jubilation this way. While this act has drawn as much public attention as it demands, the other act is less discussed perhaps because of the vulgarity and ignominy involved. It is the urination by a man on the bridge also on the very first day of the bridge's opening to traffic. Minimum modesty demands that no person does this demeaning oriental act in public. No argument can be entertained in favour of the urgency of responding to the call of nature right on the bridge. The person did it deliberately perhaps out of what can be discerned as visceral loathing he has nurtured in this dark bosom. In a country where poisonous hearts prompt fathers (as reported in a handful of cases) on their own or with accomplices kill their sons and daughters to exact revenge on opponents by implicating the latter in the murder, such acts only expose the depth of blind rage and hatred within the soul. When the marvellous achievement has been extolled by almost all both at home and abroad, there are a few who were out to undermine the feat. Distorted values, aberration of taste and senseless antagonism have led them to give an account of their vile, vindictive, vicious and vulgar mentality. The apprehension is that the swelling of the rank of this uncultured, intolerant and aggressive section of people is widening the chasm in social fabric. It does not augur well for society. Let the culturally advanced and enlightened people come forward to launch a social campaign against the retrogressive trends now leaving society confused, dazed, detracted and degenerated. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Spending Eid holidays with loved ones has long been a common aspiration for Dhaka city dwellers. And every year, we see an exodus of city people towards their ancestral homes on the eve of Eid. But sadly, the home-goers face numerous obstacles during their journey. It usually starts from purchasing advance tickets of trains and buses. Thousands of people throng ticket counters at Kamalapur Railway Station in Dhaka and several bus terminals -- with many waiting overnight -- to buy tickets. Unfortunately, some tickets are always available in the black market although the Bangladesh Railway has introduced an online ticketing system. The tickets which can be bought from this site are often shown sold out, even several days before Eid journey. Sometimes, the server says it is down. Hassle for procuring Eid tickets is endless. When a crisis like server outage happens, people's frustration turns into anger. But many of them are forced to buy tickets at inflated prices from shops near the stations. In this situation, we urge the authorities concerned to identify those who are involved in black marketing ahead of Eid, and take stern action against them. Otherwise, the entire process of selling advance tickets for Eid holidays will fail.\nBadsha Faysal,Jurain, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected] ",
