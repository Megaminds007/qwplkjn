        "full_article": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) earlier this week updated its monsoon outlook from April. The latest analysis from the weather models that the IMD relies on suggests near-certainty of the development of an El Ni\u00f1o, a cyclical phenomenon of warming in the Central Pacific that six in 10 years is linked to diminished rainfall in the west, northwest and western parts of central India, especially between July and August. However, despite the certainty of an El Ni\u00f1o, the IMD has chosen to retain its outlook of a \u2018normal\u2019 monsoon, at 96% of the 50-year long-term average of 87 cm. Anything below 96% would have been categorised as \u2018below normal\u2019. Underlying its assessment is a calculation that another phenomenon, called the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) \u2014 a temperature swing between the western and eastern Indian Ocean \u2014 would favour rain development and offset the loss in rains from an El Ni\u00f1o. It is important to note that IODs are not as strongly linked to bountiful rains as the El Ni\u00f1o is to depressed rains. In 1997, India had a strong El Ni\u00f1o but received 2% excess rain because of a positive IOD. However, both have not appeared at the same time since that year, and this is the first time since then that both factors are expected to play out in the same monsoon season. The years India last reported a greater than 10% deficit in monsoon rainfall were 2014 and 2015 \u2014 both El Ni\u00f1o years.The IMD update also underlines that rainfed-agriculture zones of the country would be between 92%-104% of the average. While this technically qualifies as \u2018normal\u2019, it is also a very large variation and could mean long, dry spells followed by a period of incessant downpours. This might help meet the region\u2019s rainfall \u2018numbers\u2019 but will not be helpful for agriculture. While every monsoon has its own peculiarities whatever the models might say, it would be crucial to watch out for the monsoon\u2019s distribution, both spatially and temporally. Sharp deficits during July and August, particularly in central India, are likely to influence agricultural output. More accurate assessments of rain during this month are available through the IMD\u2019s extended range forecasts that give a fortnightly prognosis; and these can be quite dynamic. The monsoon is forecast to reach Kerala by June 4, and whether it sticks to this date or arrives a tad early or late has little bearing on the quantity of rain during the core monsoon months. This year, States and the Centre must redouble efforts to convey accurate, timely information to farmers, using all available information channels, down to the block level.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nrains\n\n/\n\nweather science\n\n/\n\noceans\n\n/\n\nAgriculture\n\n/\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "When Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, riding widespread resentment against the establishment amid economic woes, he was a political outsider \u2014 an Islamist in a system dominated by Kemalist secularists. Twenty years later, Mr. Erdo\u011fan is the establishment \u2014 the military, traditionally the guardian of the old order, is under his thumb, institutions are at his command and the AKP, with close links to the ulema, remains a hegemonic political machine. But the economic and political situation of 2023 is comparable with that of 2002. Faced with a deepening economic crisis and accusations of backsliding democracy and freedoms, there has been widespread resentment against his long reign. The Opposition united to capitalise on this anger and managed to deny him a first round victory on May 14, but in Sunday\u2019s run-off, he won 52.1% of the vote share, against Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 47.9%. Mr. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has accepted the outcome, but called the election process \u201cthe most unfair in years\u201d. He has a point. Mr. Erdo\u011fan and his allies controlled the big media, shaping the information flow. State institutions, including the religious directorate (Diyanet), which controls mosques and appoints Imams, amplified the AKP propaganda. The President accused the Opposition of having ties with \u201cterrorists\u201d as a mainstream Kurdish party was backing his rival. Mr. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, a former bureaucrat from the minority Alevi community, led a spirited campaign, but failed to overcome the AKP\u2019s Islamist populism.Mr. Erdo\u011fan, arguably the most powerful Turkish leader since Mustafa Kemal \u2018Atat\u00fcrk\u2019, has reshaped the country\u2019s polity and society over the past 20 years. Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, who abolished the Ottoman Caliphate and secularised Turkey, saw the clergy as a threat to his vision for the country. Tensions between Kemalism and Islamism have always been there in Turkey\u2019s modern history. But until Mr. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to power, no Islamist leader had managed to upend the system. While doing so, he amassed powers, rewrote the Constitution, turning it into an executive presidency, got himself elected as the all-powerful President, stifled dissent, stepped up the war against Kurdish rebels, and jailed political rivals. Yet, this election was his biggest challenge. That he had to go into the second round, and with a lead of just three points, should remind him that Turkish society remains polarised. The battered economy needs urgent attention. A new term is an opportunity for Mr. Erdo\u011fan, whose legacy has already been marred by his authoritarian tendencies and mismanagement of the economy, to right the wrongs and offer a new inclusive beginning. But it is unclear whether Turkey\u2019s Islamist leader is ready for such a change.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\n LinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nTurkey\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ncurrency values\n\n/\n\nmedia",

But peace won\u2019t be easy given the huge trust gap between the state\u2019s Meitei and Kuki communities. Addressing this deep polarisation will require long-term bridge-building between the communities. The state already has a strong tradition of women-led social groups who can play peacemakers.\nSo, it\u2019s welcome that Shah has already met a delegation of women leaders as part of his efforts to restore normalcy.\n\nHowever, the immediate priority is to halt the violence. While state and central security forces have been carrying out targeted operations against miscreants, soldiers can\u2019t be deployed at every location. Plus, Meiteis and Kukis continue to blame each other for the violence \u2013 Meiteis believe that Kuki militant outfits are instigating turmoil while Kukis put the blame on radical Meitei outfits like Arambai Tengol and Meitei Leepun. This in turn has led to some Manipur valley-based groups demanding that the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with Kuki militants be revoked forthwith. But doing so would be adding more policy fuel to Manipur\u2019s ethnic fire.\nThe SoO was inked between GoI, Manipur government and 25 Kuki militant groups in 2008. As per the agreement, the cadre of these outfits were to be confined to designated camps and their arms kept under lock.\nIn fact, during an inspection of the army and state police earlier this month, the arms of the insurgents were found intact. Thus, there is no good reason for Manipur government and GoI to revoke the SoO, a move that is not only likely to exacerbate the current situation in Manipur but also have repercussions for other peace negotiations between Northeast insurgents and New Delhi.\nRevoking the SoO could mean insurgents losing trust in the negotiationprocess. The last thing GoI wants, for example, is for the Naga negotiations to come undone. The Manipur government had viewed the SoO as a bugbear even before the current round of violence. It should forget this red herring and get down to fixing real policing issues.\n\n",

But the image that many on social media saw/ shared instead was that of Vinesh Phogat and Sangeeta Phogat widely smiling while taking a selfie with the police.\n\nSo, wrestlers who are determinedly pursuing sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan SharanSingh became, in this image, frivolous role players. A single image brought into question the social connect they had been building over months. Except, and this is the frightening bit, this image was soon revealed to have been morphed with an AI toolkit.\nWith its ability to completely undermine the public\u2019s access to truth, this is a dangerous phenomenon. True, photoshopping relates to a software created way back in 1987. And forgeries and fake news aren\u2019t recent inventions either. But with ChatGPT\u2019s supercharged adoption since November 2022 as an inflection point for generative AI, the world has entered an era of very easy, high-speed, inexpensive and sophisticated deepfakery. It no longer needs even minutes for a foe or mischief-maker to sabotage personal authenticity. Everyone is just as vulnerable as Vinesh and Sangeeta. And so are the biggest institutions.\nOne thing that can deliver some safety is social media platforms acting with more accountability to reality and truth. Big Tech should invest some of the riches being poured into generative AI in deepfake detection.\nConsider too that India and the US are headed towards big elections next year, with fresh AI advances set to leave earlier misinformation ploys looking like child\u2019s play. No political side shall be safe from cloned content. While the 2022 deepfake of Zelensky calling on Ukrainians to put down their arms was too crude for credibility, it made clear the abundant potential for manufacturing chaos in any society.\n\n\n",

And it couldn't have come at a worse time.\nIn simple terms, the downgrade \u2013 the first since Moody's began rating Bangladesh in 2010 \u2013 means a blow to our creditworthiness. Not only will it tarnish the country's image abroad but it will also have tangible effects on local businesses.

The fallout may extend beyond loans and investments as well. The cost of doing business may go up as banks may increase charges for import payments, known as letters of credit (LCs). Moreover, local banks may face tougher negotiations with global lenders regarding commissions and charges for settling foreign exchange transactions.\nThe question is, what prompted the downgrade? Reportedly, Moody's assessment is that Bangladesh's heightened external vulnerability and liquidity risks are persistent, as are its institutional weaknesses. \"Despite some easing, ongoing dollar scarcity and deterioration in foreign exchange reserves indicate continued pressures on Bangladesh's external position, exacerbating imports constraints and as a result energy shortages,\" it said. Additionally, the government's failure to fully reverse import control measures and unconventional policies, such as a multiple exchange rate regime and interest rate caps, is contributing to market distortions, according to a report issued by the agency. Persistently low revenue generation and rising interest payments have also resulted in weakening fiscal metrics, especially debt affordability.\nIn the coming days, there will be a lot of discussion about the downgrade and its implications. But as things stand, this is indeed a wake-up call for Bangladesh. To get back up from the downgrade or prevent further downgrades, it is imperative that the government takes this seriously and restores confidence by addressing our economic vulnerabilities through effective policy measures. The future trajectory of our economy will depend a lot on how it responds to this latest threat.\n",

        "full_article": "In the world of plants, orchids have a history more sensational than others. People made dangerous voyages to far-off lands in sail boats to look for orchids and procure them when possible. Orchid hunters fought with the natives, sometimes other orchid hunters, at times were killed by others or became casualties of natural forces. But they did not give up. Such was the obsession with orchids.\nOrchidelirium or orchid mania in the 19th century England was no less a craze than the tulip mania in 17th century Holland. Even today, orchid enthusiasts make long and difficult journeys just to see orchids in their natural habitats. Orchids are even celebrated in novels. The rare ghost orchid is the subject of Susan Orlean's\u00a0The Orchid Thief,\u00a0a book that served as the source materials of the Academy Award-winning movie\u00a0Adaptation.\u00a0To the best of my knowledge, no novel has ever been written or a movie made whose central theme was a flower, except perhaps the Black Tulip, which was based on a book with the same name written by Alexandre Dumas.\nOrchid enthusiasm in the modern era began in England in the early 19th century, when British naturalist William John Swainson sent a bunch of orchid tubers from Brazil which he had used as weeds to package other plant specimens. But to everybody's utter surprise, these tubers grew and blossomed with beautiful flowers unknown to everyone at the time. This was also an era when colonialism was at its peak, providing colonial powers rights to the natural resources of their colonies to which they had easy and exclusive access. Queen Victoria appointed Frederick Sander as the official Royal Orchid Grower. This proves that even the royalty supported the plundering of the natural resources of their colonies which included their plants.\nIn England, it became the craze to grow tropical orchids in the greenhouses of the upper classes. Orchid hunters and poachers were hired and sent from England to countries as far away as Indonesia. In her book\u00a0The Orchid Thief,\u00a0Susan Orleans indicated that in 1901, eight orchid hunters went on an expedition to the Philippines. Within a month, one of them had been eaten by a tiger, another had been drenched with oil and burnt alive, five had vanished into thin air, and only one had managed to stay alive. The lone survivor of this dangerous mission ended with a huge haul of Phalaenopsis, also known as moth orchids, and probably made a huge fortune through his looted plants.\n\nIn order to stop illegal international trade of wildlife, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), became effective in July 1975. CITES is a global agreement among governments to regulate or ban international trade in threatened flora and fauna. Unfortunately, CITES could not stop some orchid sellers and enthusiasts from collecting the native orchids from the wild and endangering their future.\nHired orchid hunters shipped millions of orchids back to England. But the delicate orchids could not withstand the saline environment of the sea voyage for so long, and most would perish. In fact, it is estimated that less than one percent of the plant cargo would reach the destination alive. As a result of this plundering, and uprooting from their natural habitat, some orchid species became extinct. While some orchid hunters undoubtedly cared about the beauty of nature, the uniqueness of orchids, and scientific advancement, most were after material profits and personal fame.\nIt is absolutely true that the magnificent orchids have always been a source of fascination and intrigue for plant lovers since their discovery (they are found everywhere except in Antarctica). But prices and the challenges of cultivation had kept orchids largely in the domain of the elite classes and out of the reach of the middle class. This changed dramatically when hybridisation became common around the mid-20th century. The hybridisation of orchids decreased the prices substantially, and middle-class enthusiasts had the opportunity to buy and grow these beautiful flowers in their homes.\nThough the nurseries and even the supermarkets are flooded with hybrid orchids at very accessible prices today, the native orchids remain the objects of expedition and subject of research among orchid growers. The mystery around orchids, their unique habitat, sensual growth habit and rarity intrigued and challenged orchid lovers. In some cases, owning and growing rare orchids in the personal greenhouses became an obsession. Consequently, rare species still remain prized and pricey.\nIn order to stop illegal international trade of wildlife, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), became effective in July 1975. CITES is a global agreement among governments to regulate or ban international trade in threatened flora and fauna. Unfortunately, CITES could not stop some orchid sellers and enthusiasts from collecting the native orchids from the wild and endangering their future.\nIn developed countries, native orchids are protected by appropriate laws and can be sold only by the government designated nurseries. But uprooting the native orchids is a regular event in the developing countries where these plants are not adequately protected by the relevant authorities. Bangladesh is no exception in this regard. Currently, Bangladesh has approximately 150 or so orchid species that naturally grow in the wild. According to research published some three years ago, in the\u00a0International Journal of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, 32 orchid species native to Bangladesh have become unavailable within its borders. In addition, some orchids are listed as endangered species and if not protected, there is a chance they may become extinct in the near future. There are two main reasons for this situation. First is rampant deforestation. Most orchids grow on bigger trees and simply cannot survive when the host trees are cut down. Second, there is widespread poaching of native and rare orchids.\nOur native orchids are amazingly beautiful and they thrive in their natural habitat, where they get adequate sunlight, rain, and air. It is very difficult to grow orchid species in the artificial environment at home and there is a strong possibility that these orchid species would eventually perish. The sooner we understand that uprooting our orchids from their natural habitat is a direct threat to their future existence, the better it is for our native orchids.\nWe need awareness among people and stricter laws to avoid these dire consequences and save our native plants. We often discuss climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution. But we must not forget that it is our foremost duty to protect and save our natural resources, our animals and, most importantly, our forests and native plants. This is a collective responsibility that we must all share, and to which citizens and policymakers must be fully committed.\nHasina Ahmad\u00a0is a retired administrator of a US university and a member of the American Orchid Society.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Although Dhaka and Kolkata, two major South Asian cities, are just 240 kilometres apart and share a common history and culture, not many comparative studies on these cities have been undertaken so far. Kolkata is the second largest city in India, while Dhaka is the largest city in Bangladesh. A book titled\u00a0How Smart are Cities without Adequate Finances?\u00a0attempted to improve our understanding about financing patterns of these two South Asian cities. Three university professors from Bangladesh and India \u2013 Simanti Bandyopadhyay, Firdousi Naher and Aishna Sharma \u2013 have compared recent city-level financial trends in Dhaka and Kolkata, which is not only refreshing, but can also lead to further research in the future. Bangladesh and India's West Bengal share a common history, heritage, socio-cultural norms and environment. Both Dhaka and Kolkata are densely populated and face similar challenges in delivering civic services to its citizens. Therefore, comparing the two local governments' financial situations makes perfect sense.\nA city needs to meet a number of fundamental criteria to become \"smart,\" the catchword used internationally these days to characterise urban areas in terms of their use of information and communication technology, operational efficiency, financial prudency, cost-effective service delivery, time-saving public transportation system, and aesthetic and environment-friendly development, all done under a progressive urban planning philosophy. Smart cities should also aim to promote social inclusion and community engagement to ensure poverty alleviation, gender equality and resilient societies.\nThe authors of the book made an effort to look at the \"smartness\" of cities through the lens of financial sufficiency. The urban development context in both Bangladesh and India are truly comparable due to their poor basic services like housing, water supply, sanitation, waste management, roads and drains, etc, and therefore, according to the authors, \"ensuring a sound infrastructure is the foundation for any smart urban agglomeration to emerge and this, in turn, hinges on the financial health of urban local bodies.\" Both in Dhaka and Kolkata, air and water pollution levels are alarming, and water supply, sanitation and solid waste management are poor.\nWhile we recognise the importance of smart cities, there is very little empirical evidence on how they function. As such, the book raises a pertinent question on development of sustainable cities in South Asia. The authors point out that \"most urban local bodies in developing economies suffer from insufficient generation of revenues and/or lack of financial power to invest in even the basic infrastructure.\"\nThe financial health of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) are compared in the book. The urban local government bodies have legally defined areas of revenue generation, budgeting and expenditure for development of infrastructure and services, operation and maintenance. It also includes detailed historical, demographic and socioeconomic background of both Dhaka and Kolkata and the evolution of the local government structure in the two countries.\nThe comparative analysis of the two cities in terms of legal mandates for revenue generation and expenditure decisions, tax and non-tax collection situation, and urban economic strength are the most noteworthy aspects of the book.\nIn both countries, urban local bodies generate revenue from taxes, duties, fees, tolls, etc. However, the municipal revenue generation is not encouraging, owing to poor assessment of properties, low tax collection rates, inadequate service delivery and limited attention given by local bodies to non-tax revenue sources for both. Added to that, intergovernmental transfers play a key role in supplementing revenues.\nThe book argues that low revenue collection in Dhaka and Kolkata affect their level of expenditure, which is less than one percent of GDP, despite both cities contributing highly to their respective economies. Data from DNCC and DSCC shows that own revenue constitutes the bulk of total resources \u2013 87 percent in DNCC and 79 percent in DSCC between 2012-13 and 2018-19. The government grant is relatively low, which comes from the Annual Development Programme (ADP). Property tax, called \"holding tax\" in Bangladesh, constitutes about 45 percent of total own revenues from both city corporations. There are some variations in per capita own revenue between the two city corporations, with DNCC doing better than DSCC. However, without further analysis, it is not possible to say what causes this variation \u2013 whether it is due to high tax effort of the DNCC or due its higher property value.\nIn Kolkata Municipal Corporation, own revenue constitutes 51 percent of total resources which comes from government grant, compared to DNCC and DSCC. But compared to Dhaka, Kolkata's per capita own revenue and property tax revenue collection are higher. Again, KMC's per person expenditure is $70 higher than the per person average expenditures in DNCC and DSCC.\nThe book tried to estimate own revenue to Gross City Product (GCP) ratios in both DNCC and DSCC. Using own revenue generated in 2017-18 in DNCC and DSCC at current prices, the own revenue to GCP ratio turned out to be only 0.3 percent in DNCC and 0.28 percent in DSCC. On the other hand, the GCP ratio in KMC has been 1.3 percent or higher in recent years. This implies that compared to the KMC, the DNCC and DSCC have higher potential for own revenue generation in future if property tax assessment can be improved, assessment to collection efficiency is raised, and non-tax revenue sources fully exploited.\nIf the DNCC and DSCC take note of the book's findings and make sincere efforts, they can increase tax revenue and utilise additional resources for better public service delivery. This will encourage city dwellers to pay taxes regularly and at higher rates. The book makes an excellent contribution towards filling an information gap in local resource mobilisation in the two most resourceful metropolitan cities in South Asia.\nDr Nawshad Ahmed,\u00a0a former UN official, is an economist and urban planner.\n\n",

Reportedly, Moody's assessment is that Bangladesh's heightened external vulnerability and liquidity risks are persistent, as are its institutional weaknesses. \"Despite some easing, ongoing dollar scarcity and deterioration in foreign exchange reserves indicate continued pressures on Bangladesh's external position, exacerbating imports constraints and as a result energy shortages,\" it said. Additionally, the government's failure to fully reverse import control measures and unconventional policies, such as a multiple exchange rate regime and interest rate caps, is contributing to market distortions, according to a report issued by the agency. Persistently low revenue generation and rising interest payments have also resulted in weakening fiscal metrics, especially debt affordability.\nIn the coming days, there will be a lot of discussion about the downgrade and its implications. But as things stand, this is indeed a wake-up call for Bangladesh. To get back up from the downgrade or prevent further downgrades, it is imperative that the government takes this seriously and restores confidence by addressing our economic vulnerabilities through effective policy measures. The future trajectory of our economy will depend a lot on how it responds to this latest threat.\n",

        "full_article": "Yet another alarm has been sounded about the repercussions of the continued use (read: abuse) of the Digital Security Act (DSA). This time, it was Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who flagged the law for its intimidating effect on people with critical opinion, and recommended its suspension until significant improvements are made to it. What Mr Schutter said, however, has been said many times before. Rights defenders have frequently highlighted all the problematic provisions in it, the plight of victims, and the culture of fear that it has created, but to little effect so far.\nLately, however, in the face of sustained criticism and potentially to convince voters ahead of the national election, the government seemed inclined to accept some of the concerns raised. But while it says it is open to make some amendments to the law, it remains adamantly opposed to the idea of repealing it, or scrapping two of the provisions as recommended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This is quite concerning.\nThe fact is, token amendments will neither assure voters nor build trust in the usefulness of the law, so we urge the authorities to pay heed to the UN call for suspending it for now. With the 12th parliamentary elections approaching fast, the next six or seven months are going to be crucial. We do not want to see the DSA being used as a tool to suppress critical opinions or punish journalists and political opponents. We want to see free flow of thoughts so that voters can make informed decisions.\nAny suspension, however, will be a stopgap solution \u2013 just to keep the political environment on an even keel till the elections. The ultimate solution is a complete abolition of the DSA. There are so many flaws in the law that mere amendments cannot save it. So the government must scrap it eventually, and go back to the drawing board to come up with one that truly serves the people.\n",

        "full_article": "With the development paradigm shifting towards human development rather than mere economic progress, Bangladesh's amazing socio-economic growth is now put to the toughest test ever. What was once a mystery or enigma behind the country's sterling performance, according to development partners and famed economists, on the development front stands to get unravelled slowly. Economic sustainability in the face of adversity was once the hallmark of the country's growth. That image is under threat following the global economic recession induced first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then made worse by the war in Ukraine. It is a time that has rudely exposed the weakness of overwhelming reliance on a sector that is more service-oriented than industrial in nature with its raw materials coming from outside of the country. Oliver De Schutter, special UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights during his visit to Bangladesh on Monday laid bare in his rather terse comments on Bangladesh's progress, fallibility of development policies and inability to respect freedom of opinion. The right to free expression, according to him, is not just one of the fundamental human rights but also inalienably related to economic issues such as employment, fair wages, elimination of hunger and poverty and even foreign investment. Lauding the progress made by Bangladesh so far, the international human rights law and legal theory specialist points out how a large number of people staying just above the poverty line before the economic shock are now emerging as a fresh category called the 'new poor'. This is because of the combined impact of loss of employment and high inflation. Although the economic crisis is not unique to Bangladesh alone, it is galling because it threatens to prolong and stymie the process of achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The UN rapporteur has been particularly critical of the government's 119 programmes under the social safety net. They are marked and marred by adhocism and bribery because of which many genuinely deserving people are left out. Much of poverty reduction could depend on reaching the genuine poor in need of food intervention. But the country's monopolistic market players are using the crisis period as an opportunity for profit making by way of market manipulation. The authorities' inaction or absence of timely intervention has encouraged the unscrupulous business sharks to spur inflation spasmodically for one or more items at some stages to an astronomical high. It is quite natural that a large number of people's food intake and living standard have drastically fallen with its negative impact on almost all development indices. The UN official has reiterated the oft-repeated overdependence on apparel sector for earning foreign exchange. He has warned of the danger of using cheap labour for doing so. In fact, the country's balanced development is conditional to all working-age people's involvement with standard productive activities. This calls for a minimum level of education and skills. On both these counts, which together form the core of human development, Bangladesh lags behind its neighbouring competitors. Unless the problems in this vital area are addressed seriously to reap the demographic dividends, poverty and underdevelopment will mar the country's journey on the road to prosperity.",

        "full_article": "The recent presidential election in Turkey has been a disappointment for Turkey's secularists. Kemal Kilicdaroglu came close to wresting the presidency from Recep Tayyip Erdogan but in the end it was Erdogan who forged ahead of him. There was, at a point in the campaign, a faint hope that Kilicdaroglu, speaking for those believing in a return to secular politics in Turkey, would succeed in showing Erdogan the door.The results were narrow, but in a broader perspective the election was demonstrative of the authority Erdogan, in power for the last twenty years, yet wields in his country's politics. The President has in these past many years clearly stamped his image on Turkey through his exercise of internal politics as well as foreign affairs. One must add here that Erdogan's politics has come with some rather thick streaks of authoritarianism, a characteristic which came out into the open during the abortive coup of 2016. The plotters failed to remove him, and once he was assured that he had survived, he went into the pitiless task of rounding up the conspirators, as also people not associated with the coup attempt, and carting them off to prison.In these years in which Erdogan has been at the top, the media in Turkey have not been happy owing to the restrictions placed on them. A few weeks ago, Ambarin Zaman, a prominent Turkish journalist now in the bad books of the Turkish authorities, told a seminar in London of the vilification she has been subjected to by the Turkish authorities, including the President. Zaman, daughter of Arshad uz Zaman, a Bangladesh diplomat who served as assistant secretary general of the OIC, was unable to travel to Turkey to attend the funeral of her Turkish mother. She is regularly trolled on social media because of her opposition to the government.President Erdogan has operated in the style of a strongman. His re-election to an unprecedented third term in office has had world leaders sending him congratulatory messages, for the good reason that in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine the western powers are in serious need of having the Turkish leader by their side. But on this issue of Ukraine, Erdogan has demonstrated independence of action. He has not only stayed away from joining the western chorus for a condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine but has also overseen a robust growth of trade between Ankara and Moscow. On the diplomatic front, President Erdogan has given out the unambiguous message that Turkey will not toe the EU and NATO line on Russia. His opposition to Finland's entry into NATO was proof of Ankara's independent stance on the situation.Erdogan has demonstrated a less than democratic streak in his approach to opposition and dissent at home. An example: under Article 299 of the Turkish Penal Code, insulting the President is a crime which carries a prison sentence of anywhere between one and four years. Journalists have had the law applied against them. But it is in the larger political arena that Erdogan has brought about radical change. The secular nature of the country's politics, where a modern republic had always been emphasised by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and all the leaders, barring Erdogan, who followed him, has been upended by the Erdogan government. Turkish women, once an epitome of western style lifestyles, today have large numbers of them attired in clothing prescribed in line with the Islamic code of behaviour.Hagia Sophia, a church built in Istanbul, or Constantinople as it was earlier known, in the sixth century, has through the ages alternately become a mosque and returned to being a place of Christian worship. Under Erdogan's presidency, it is once again a mosque and a cultural centre, obviously delighting Turkey's conservative social segment. Erdogan's emphasis on turning the country away from its secular moorings and toward an essentially Islamist direction has been a departure from the worldview of Ataturk. The Ataturk vision was firmly upheld by secularists --- Ismet Inonu, Suleyman Demirel, Bulent Ecevit, Tansu Ciller, Turgut Ozal, to name a few. And then there were the military officers holding office as President, notably Kemal Gursel and Cevdet Sunay, who would brook no interference with Turkey's secular structure. The military was a guarantor of secular politics in the country. Modern Turkey's history in the not too distant past was one of its soldiers stepping in whenever Ataturk's vision was perceived to be coming under threat.Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that culture has been made short shrift of. The state today is a clear departure from the goals set out by Ataturk in the 1920s. The military is today a tamed lot, unlike the force that launched two coups d'etat and then intervened twice to ensure that politics stayed on the right tracks. The abortive coup of 2016, where the plotters planned to capture Erdogan, was evidence of discontent in the army with his mode of governance. The failure of the coup attempt, and the public demonstrations of support for Erdogan at the time, gave the President an opportunity to reshape the armed forces in line with his idea of Turkey. He has done that and, at least for now, faces no threats from the soldiers. Erdogan's performance in the economic field has been satisfactory. His stress on Islam as a factor in politics has not come in the way of his belief that Turkey needs to come level with the developed world in terms of economic progress. His brand of religion-in-politics has had no room for obscurantism, as the progress of Turkish tourism shows only too well. The country, especially Istanbul, has become a destination for visitors from all over the world. Turkey's beaches are a target for western men and women, a sign that the government has not let its religious principles undermine Turkey's modern image before the world.The next five years will belong to Erdogan, if his health problems do not impede his governance. There will also be a time for the world to keep him within its sights, lest he reveal any ambitions of prolonging his hold on power beyond this new term.As for the secular opposition, it is to its credit that it came together under Kilicdaroglu to present a credible political alternative to Turkey's people. Reports of the coalition fragmenting now that the opposition has lost the election will disappoint those who seek a return to a liberal Turkey, one that Ataturk's followers strenuously upheld. With the country so obviously divided, as the vote has so conclusively shown, Kilicdaroglu's supporters will need to shape strategy for the election five years hence. As for Erdogan, pragmatism dictates that while he enhances Turkey's image in terms of foreign policy, he must stay away from any further deepening of religious conservatism as a factor in his politics. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Recently, she crossed the age limit fixed for entering the government jobs. And out of frustration, she set all her academic certificates on fire in a Facebook Live streaming. Her video of burning certificates went viral and caught the attention of state minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. He offered her a government job. And if everything goes right, she will soon join the Information and Communication Technology Division as a content development and social communication officer. This is apparently the happy ending of Mukta's story. But there are thousands of Muktas in Bangladesh. How many of them would burn their certificates and get government jobs? Education in Bangladesh no longer guarantees jobs. In fact, it is one of the countries, which has the highest rate of unemployed educated youths. Interestingly, it is easier to get a job in this country if one is uneducated or less-educated. According to a Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies survey, around 27 per cent of SSC graduates in the country are unemployed; so are 28 per cent of HSC graduates, 36 per cent of graduates and 34 per cent of postgraduates. Several other studies show that around half of our university graduates are currently unemployed. Many of them completed their university education three to five years ago but they are still unemployed in the absence of decent opportunities. Mukta's viral video of burning her certificates exposes a grim picture of our educated unemployed youth's frustration and anger for their joblessness. This frustration coupled with pressure to shoulder family responsibility can lead the youths to mental health issues and even attempting suicide. And so, Mukta's case makes us think again about the longstanding demand of jobseekers to increase the age limit of entry to government jobs to 35 years from the existing 30 years. Most university students in Bangladesh have to spend two to three years more to complete their education. Session jam is acute in the National University and DU affiliated colleges. For these students, it takes 27 to 28 years to complete their academic activities. Then they need years-long preparation for job tests. So, it becomes quite difficult for them to manage their preferred job before they reach 30. These youths need to be compensated for the loss of their academic life. And it can be done only by relaxing the age limit to jobs. If increased, it will expand the scope to get talented job aspirants, too. We should also keep in mind that there are many countries in the world, where there is no age limit to enter a job and qualified people can get jobs even a day before they reach their age of retirement. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The holy Eid-ul-Azha is around the corner. It is one of the largest Muslim festival after Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated in Bangladesh at the end of June. Muslims all over the world are all set to observe this Eid in commemoration of Prophet Hazrat Ibrahim's complete submission to the will of Allah almighty. The festival falls on the 10th day in the month of Zilhaj in the Hijri calendar. On the holy occasion, devotees will offer Eid prayers and sacrifice animals. They will also share the meat of sacrificial animals with their relatives and neighbours and distribute a portion of the meat among the poor. Given the demand for sacrificial animals, temporary animal markets will be set up across the country. The authorities concerned should take necessary steps to ensure that the places where these markets are set up will be cleaned immediately after Eid. Additionally, they must take necessary steps to ensure that animals are slaughtered at designated places, where the remains of animals are properly disposed of. This year, we do not want to experience unbearable stench of rotting remains and blood of slaughtered animals, which can also spread disease. People should also be mindful of their responsibility in fulfilling their religious obligations. We must follow precautionary hygienic measures while slaughtering animals and disposing of their remains. We must fulfil our responsibilities at individual, societal and governmental levels.\nSadia Afrin, Student of North South University, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
