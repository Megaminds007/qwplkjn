In three of the four Assembly constituencies and in the lone Lok Sabha seat for which by-elections were held, the ruling party in the State won, except in Bihar, where the RJD managed to wrest a seat. Ordinarily, the expectation is for ruling parties to fare better in by-elections. There are reasons for this \u2014 there is little incentive for Opposition parties to mobilise their voters in full strength if there is no chance of attaining power and ruling parties tend to get adherents to vote with a promise of development schemes in the constituency. This might not be the case when elections are held in the late term for a regime \u2014 these are litmus tests for its popularity as regular polls beckon. But except for Chhattisgarh, the bypolls in Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal were held in States where governments had barely reached or crossed their midterm since regular elections. In that sense, the Congress party, whose recent electoral performances have indicated its distress, will take solace from the Khariagarh result in Chhattisgarh. Its candidate, Yashoda Verma, won handily with a 53% vote share, wresting the seat from the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) and also garnering votes that were more than 12 percentage points higher than the BJP\u2019s candidate. Despite its facile win in the 2018 Assembly elections, the party\u2019s poor performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in the State and internal rumblings within the government indicated that its position was relatively fragile. But the by-election wins in Chhattisgarh and in Kolhapur (North) in Maharashtra, where it marginally increased its vote share from 2019, will give a lot of confidence to the beleaguered grand old party. In West Bengal, turncoat candidate Babul Supriyo, once a Union Minister in the BJP government at the Centre, won comfortably from Ballygunge as a Trinamool Congress candidate, with the BJP relegated to the third position behind the CPI(M). Actor Shatrughan Sinha had an easier triumph in the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency that was vacated by Mr. Supriyo as the Trinamool continued to consolidate the successes of the party. The bypolls suggest that the Trinamool has managed to weather the BJP\u2019s challenge and also benefited from a fragmented Opposition space. Bihar had witnessed a close Assembly election in 2020, in terms of voteshares, with the ruling NDA winning 37.26% of the votes, marginally ahead of the RJD-led grand alliance\u2019s 37.23%. The RJD\u2019s win in Bochahan indicates that, notwithstanding the BJP\u2019s dominance in the Hindi heartland, there are still quite a few pockets of resistance.",

        "full_article": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India\u2019s latest recommendations on the auction of airwaves identified for 5G services, particularly the pricing of spectrum, have triggered disappointment within the industry. While TRAI has proposed cuts of about 35-40% on the reserve prices at which the relevant frequency bands of spectrum could be auctioned, telecom services providers contend that the recommendations run counter to the spirit behind the relief-cum-reforms package unveiled by the Government last September. In acknowledging the extent of stress as well as the ripple effects that protracted distress in the industry would have on the economy, the Union Cabinet had at the time decided among other measures to increase the tenure of spectrum assignment to 30 years, from 20 years. The regulator, however, has proposed charging 1.5 times the reduced reserve price for a 30-year tenure on spectrum thereby virtually negating the proposed cut and undermining the Government\u2019s aim of making spectrum affordable enough to encourage greater participation in the auctions. Ironically, TRAI\u2019s recommendations cite a November letter from the DoT which had underscored the fact that only 37% of the spectrum on offer at the last auction had been sold, showing that the regulator was conscious of the need to further rationalise the reserve price. TRAI\u2019s reasoning for the reserve prices, an elaborate consultative process notwithstanding, appear steeped in a conservative approach that discounts the challenges the industry is currently facing as well as the significant capital investments needed to modernise the country\u2019s telecom networks.A look at some of the countries that have so far successfully rolled out 5G networks shows that Japan and South Korea avoided auctions and instead adopted the discretionary approach to spectrum allotment. True, this approach was abandoned by India after the Supreme Court in 2012 struck down the grant of 2G licences and mandated auctions as the best method to obviate malfeasance in the exercise of discretionary powers. Still, an auction would ensure that the resource being offered is actually bid for and utilised only if the price is viable for the industry. India\u2019s telcos point to the fact that even today their ability to invest in the infrastructure required to cover the length and breadth of the country and simultaneously ensure optimum reach and availability of signals in dense urban areas is somewhat constrained by the high cost of spectrum relative to the global average as well as one of the lowest realisations in terms of average revenue per user. For the Government to realise its goal of netting optimum revenue from the auction of spectrum even as it ensures that India does not end up lagging behind in the rollout of 5G telecom services, policymakers need to insist TRAI revisit its recommendations. The economy can ill afford any further disruptions in the linchpin sector.",

        "full_article": "Tall high-rise buildings dot the sea front of Galle Face. Most are international hotel chains, and one is a swanky upmarket shopping mall\u2014a nod to the fast-paced construction and development work that Galle Sea Face has witnessed in recent years. As the gaze sweeps out towards the Indian Ocean, the fluttering flags of the under-construction Colombo Port City catches the eye. Touted as the next Dubai or Singapore of the subcontinent, it is being constructed with Chinese help on land reclaimed from the sea. And a little distance away from it inland, at the northern end of Galle Face, overlooking the ocean, is the majestic yellow Neo-Baroque-style building: the Presidential Secretariat, the office of the president since 1983 and currently the heart of the protests that are roiling Sri Lanka.\nThe resentment against the Sri Lankan government's mishandling of the economy had been growing in the country since last year. Sri Lanka's two million farmers have been protesting for months against the government's decision to go \"organic\" and the subsequent order banning import of chemical fertilisers in April 2021. It reached a flashpoint in October, when they took their protest to Colombo and threatened to cut off supplies to the capital. By November, the government rolled back its earlier decision and allowed imports. Steep price rises of essentials like rice, lentils, flour, milk, eggs and cooking gas put a strain on most households. But the tipping point came when rolling power cuts, sometimes more than 10 hours a day, were imposed island-wide. Overnight, people were staring at crippling shortages, serpentine queues for petrol, diesel and cooking gas, and restrictions on the quantities of food items one could buy. Pharmacies, too, were running low on essential life-saving drugs as 80 percent of the medicines in the country were imported.\nAll this coalesced into a massive street protest of a million people calling for the president and his government to resign. A curfew was clamped in the western province, social media was blocked for almost 13 hours, and then a general public emergency was declared on April 1 this year. Sensing growing public defiance and anger, the president rescinded the emergency orders on April 5. April 3 saw his entire cabinet of ministers\u2014except the prime minister, who is the president's brother\u2014resign. Yesterday, a new cabinet was sworn in.\n\"Go Home Gota\" has become the rallying cry of the protesters. The massive protest has turned into an all-night vigil near the Presidential Secretariat. Protesters have braved heavy rain and thunderstorm to stay there. Temporary tents have been set up at the protest site that is now being called \"Gota-go-Gama\" (Gama is Sinhala for village). Crowds typically swell during the day and on holidays. Many come to the site after finishing work. Others bring their children to witness and be part of the movement. The aged and the infirm sit in wheelchairs holding placards. Protesters flank the road near the secretariat waving the Sri Lankan national flag, shouting slogans and holding placards that say \"Gota Go Home,\" \"Pissa (lunatic) go home,\" \"Bring our money back,\" \"Leave my future alone,\" \"You have messed with the wrong generation.\" In a city which barely sees any honking, cars passing through blow their horns in a show of solidarity with the protesters. The orderly behaviour of the crowd is almost surreal. Except for the torching of a couple of police vehicles on March 31, (when the police used force and fired tear gas shells), the protests have remained non-violent. The only persons in uniform present at the site are traffic policemen regulating the flow of traffic.\nThe protest site itself is a study in civic awareness. There is no littering. Empty plastic water bottles have been strung together to read \"Go Home Gota\" and hung on the fence bordering the promenade. The rest have been corralled into nets to be recycled later. Waste, too, is segregated and sorted at site. A couple of ambulances are stationed nearby to take care of any medical exigency. Free food and beverage is distributed among the protesters. All this is being managed through spontaneous and voluntary individual contributions.\nPeople from all walks of life, from all faiths and beliefs and from across the island, including the indigenous Vedda community, find representation here. Muslims break their Ramadan fast here with food and prayers. Buddhists and Christians have held vigils, and the Sinhala and Tamil people have marked their biggest festival, the New Year on April 14, together.\nSo how did Sri Lanka descend into this economic free fall? Today, inflation is at a record high of 18.7 percent, with food inflation at over 30 percent. The Sri Lankan rupee (LKR) shows no signs of stabilising. Within days of the government free-floating it, the rupee fell steeply\u2014from 203 rupees against a US dollar on March 7 to around 330 rupees against a US dollar now. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has announced its decision to unilaterally suspend external debt repayments of USD 51 billion. Additionally, it is seeking immediate help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to manage the balance of payment situation.\nAs an island nation, Sri Lanka was always dependent on imports to sustain its economy. But indiscriminate borrowings for big infrastructure projects, which typically have low yields and long turnaround time, have tilted the already fragile foreign exchange reserves against it. Fiscal mismanagement and Covid-induced economic downturn played its part. Sri Lanka has long relied on foreign tourists and remittance from its manpower exports for its dollar earnings. Covid effectively put a stop to that.\nA series of missteps by the incumbent government aggravated an already precarious situation. In its desire to become the first nation in the world to go completely \"organic,\" the government in April 2021 banned the import of all chemical fertilisers. The decision had catastrophic consequences. Farm yields fell by a whopping 33 percent and Sri Lanka, which used to be self-sufficient in paddy cultivation, had to import rice from its neighbouring countries to make up for the shortfall. Tea production and export, a traditional foreign exchange earner, also declined substantially.\nSri Lankan forex reserves fell to USD 1.93 billion at the end of March this year; foreign debt repayment of USD 4 billion is due this year. The Sri Lankan government has been forced to default on all its foreign debt repayments to preserve its forex reserves for essential imports. As it awaits financial assistance from the IMF, neighbouring countries have come forward to help Sri Lanka. Bangladesh offered credit worth USD 200 million in June 2021, which has been rolled over. India has opened a credit line worth USD 2.4 billion to cover essential imports of diesel, petrol, medicines, cooking gas and rice. The Singapore Red Cross has committed 100,000 Singaporean dollars for urgent medical supplies. Sri Lanka has also received USD 10 million from the World Bank to buy essential medicines.\nThe resolve of the Sri Lankan people at the protest site is almost palpable. They have rebuffed calls from the prime minister for talks and find it difficult to believe when the president says that the current situation was not his making. Their concerns echo in former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's message to the president: resign or explain to the people why you won't.\n\u00a0\nAnindita Sarkar\u00a0is a freelance writer based in Colombo,\u00a0Sri Lanka.\n",

        "full_article": "Price hikes of essential goods during Ramadan has become a regular occurrence in Bangladesh. It is justified, from an economic point of view, that the prices will rise to some degree as demand for some particular goods increase during the holy month. Most often, however, the dominant reason seems to be that syndicates of opportunistic traders and importers raise the prices in several phases, before the government steps in to ensure fair prices. The opportunistic profit-seeking motive provides an ideal backdrop from which to discuss the justice of the pricing mechanism. Price hikes hurt consumers and change the relative distribution of resources and, as such, there is an inherent issue of justice that needs to be deliberated on.\nEconomist Bruno Frey and Werner Pommerehne found in a random survey that a rise in prices to cope with a situation of excess demand (such as that during Ramadan) is considered unfair by almost 80 percent of the respondents. These results demonstrate that people make normative assessments of price changes that are sensitive to factors beyond economic rationalisations.\nThe notion of just price has drawn the interest of economists since the medieval times. One of the more fascinating aspects of recent debates about just pricing has been the view that market price is the just price, except in extreme situations. According to this view, just price will simply be a function of the average of relevant previous exchanges and will vary according to shifts in the markets. However, there is a problem in accepting market price as the just price under the conditions of sustained shortage. In Ramadan, for instance, the market prices for necessary goods such as grain and meat shoot up to a level that poorer members find hard to afford. These prices are much higher than what many would see as a just price\u2014namely the price which enables the majority of the population to afford these items.\nThe market price approach implies that when consumers purchase these goods at the increased prices, they do so if and only if they think it worthwhile to pay the requested amount. Thus, even if the consumers later discover that the vendor's wholesale costs were minimal and his profit large, they can hardly complain that what went on was an opportunistic decision that was unfairly made. This perspective is important as Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen argued in the context of famine, that famine is rarely a natural evil; his concern is with situations of sustained shortages wherein vendors charge prices that hinder universal access to these necessary goods. The significance of cases like Sen's is that the notion of market price as just is inadequate to the task of providing a plausible account of our normative intuitions regarding pricing.\nEconomic and political philosophers Adrian Walsh and Tony Lynch developed a motivationalist approach to just pricing solution, which focuses on the role of the profit motive in a market agent's motivational set, rather than the profit motive alone. According to this approach, the Ramadan price hikes are irksome to the consumers because of the inappropriately dominant role that the profit motive plays in the sellers' judgements, overriding other important moral considerations from a social welfare point of view. Such a motivationalist approach also explains what consumers find salient about pricing conventions in this area; a movement from the conventions uncovers motives that might otherwise be obscured from our view.\nAsymmetry of information also plays a crucial role in this regard, because from a consumer's point of view, ease of obtaining information regarding factors that lead to changes in prices vary with different types of goods. For example, it is easier to justify price differences in products like mobile phones, computers, etc, which have different specifications, and information regarding global supply is easier to obtain from the internet and other sources. However, price changes of necessary commodities during Ramadan are harder to justify. Consumers cannot be reasonably sure whether the price changes are being driven by ill-intentioned syndicates or global supply-demand movements.\nIn conclusion, relying on unfettered market prices during times like Ramadan is an ill-advised policy move, as consumers are not appeased by economic justifications. Intervention programmes such as the Family Cards provided by the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) will also have limited impact because of limited reach as well as the possibility that not all classes of people find it desirable to avail these cards due to social status implications. The dissatisfactions with rising prices can only be dealt with by taking steps to minimise opportunistic profit-seeking motives of the traders.\n\u00a0\nMahir A Rahman\u00a0is a research associate at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).\n",

        "full_article": "With Covid-19 cases receding worldwide, our lives are entering a new phase, where the \"normal\" perhaps means a strategic co-existence with an ever-present, maleficent viral disease. The novel coronavirus, unfortunately, is highly unpredictable, with new variants and mutations surfacing every now and then, at times wreaking havoc on communities.\nTake the case of China, for example. Despite pursuing a strict zero-Covid policy the last couple of years, the country is struggling to fight off new outbreaks of the Omicron variant, imposing blanket lockdowns in multiple localities, including the entirety of Shanghai (a city of around 27 million people), Beijing and Shenzhen, along with other major cities.\nOne of the variants found in the city of Suzhou near Shanghai\u2014although mild in nature\u2014does not match with records in the global variant database. The emergence of the Omicron sub-variant XE\u2014a blend of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 strains, also termed \"recombinant\"\u2014first detected in the UK, and later found in India and even Thailand, has also drawn the attention of medical communities around the world. This new sub-variant\u2014currently the UK's dominant one, with more than 637 cases detected so far\u2014is thought to be highly transmissible, with early estimates indicating a 10 percent community growth rate advantage in comparison to the fast-spreading BA.2 strain. However, as of yet, there has been no indication suggesting that the XE sub-variant could be deadly. The events of the next few weeks would be important in understanding the nature and strength of the new sub-variant. While there is no need for us to panic, as conscious citizens, we should stay alert and follow the safety protocols.\nAnd with Covid evolving, new strains and variants are expected to surface in the coming months and years. Which means, in the long run, Covid is expected to transform into an endemic disease. This, however, does not negate the risk posed by the virus. For some, especially the elderly and children, and for those who have not been vaccinated, the risks would be higher.\nFor us in Bangladesh, with the economy gradually opening up and life reflecting a semblance of normalcy, it is important that we do not let our guard down. Unfortunately, the number of people who practise social distancing or follow personal hygiene protocols is only decreasing by the day. Not only in open spaces, but in cramped places like lifts, people are moving freely without a mask, exposing themselves and the others to the menacing possibility of catching the stealthy virus.\nWhile the falling number of Covid cases and subsequent low fatality rate is a blessing and a respite for us from the nightmare that we have had to endure over the last two years\u2014losing lives and livelihoods\u2014we cannot become complacent now. The government has done a commendable job of bringing in as many people as they could under the Covid-19 immunisation programme, but we still have to keep in mind that there are Covid variants that have the capacity to evade vaccine protection and infect individuals. And with Covid, one can never really be sure how and when one might catch the virus.\nFor us, the only way to dodge the risk of catching Covid-19 is by adhering to health and safety guidelines, such as social distancing\u2014following the space slots marked in lifts, public places, counters, etc that we often look down upon so disdainfully\u2014and strictly maintaining personal hygiene protocols, including wearing face masks when in public, among other prescribed measures.\nWe must also keep in mind that most children in our country are yet to receive their first shot of the vaccine. And they have only recently started attending schools in person after a struggle with online classes and subsequent learning loss of almost two years.\nA Unicef report suggested that the education of 37 million children in Bangladesh had been disrupted by the protracted closure of schools due to the pandemic. Moreover, 14,111 privately-run primary schools had to face closure within one year of the pandemic's outbreak in the country. The number of teachers and students declined by 83,268 and 1,461,634, respectively, within the same time frame, as per the Annual Primary School Census (APSC) 2021, prepared by the Directorate of Primary Education, and this figure is excluding the English medium schools or the Qawmi madrasas. The sheer numbers point to the heavy toll the pandemic has taken on our education sector.\nWhile it would take years to recoup this loss, we must make sure to keep the spread of Covid to a minimum, if our children are to continue in-person classes. One more outbreak, and our children would be back within the confines of home amid uncertainties, fighting a fresh emotional and logistical battle to adapt to and cope with online learning.\nThe same is applicable for our economic aspirations as well. After months of struggles and setbacks, the economy is finally reopening, trying to cover up for the losses of the last two years. And the forecasts so far have been encouraging. The World Bank, in its Global Economic Prospects report, in January 2022, suggested that Bangladesh's economic growth would reach as high as 6.4 percent in FY2021-22, and up to 6.9 percent in FY23, despite the deceleration of the global economy.\nRebound of the garments industry, along with strong remittance inflow and increase in demand in the domestic market are thought to be the key drivers behind this growth. However, to sustain this, we would need to ensure that this flow of economic activities remains uninterrupted and we can only do so by keeping the coronavirus at bay. If we become complacent thinking we have managed to wash our hands of the virus once and for all, we would be making a grave mistake.\nDespite all the strict measures taken by China, the country is now scrambling to minimise new outbreaks of the virus, and the new lockdown measures are expected to take a toll on the country's economic growth.\nWhile the situation in every country is different, we should not take this lull in the Covid scenario in our country for granted. The more careful we are, the safer our nation is, and the more protected our loved ones are. We are all responsible for the fight against Covid, and we must not fail ourselves in this.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "Prof Rehman Sobhan (RS) continues to amaze. Even at this ripe young age, his pace has not slackened, his gaze has not dimmed, his voice has not faltered as it retains its keenness, relevance, and moral clarity. He has earned his place as the elder statesman of our scholarly and activist communities\u2014a heroic, enduring and inspiring presence in our midst.\nHe has also become the pre-eminent chronicler of his times. This is always a tricky terrain to navigate, more so when important personalities and controversial issues are involved, where narratives become \"sacrosanct\" (Page 7) and discourage interrogation. In the hypersensitive and polarised environment of the country, writing contemporary history becomes not only a \"contested,\" but a \"risk-prone\" enterprise (Page 8). But RS \"pulls it off,\" and does so in style and with authority.\nThis is not accomplished because of his writerly craftsmanship, nor his political instincts learned and honed over the years, but by the qualities of scholarly integrity, personal humility and natural graciousness that are inherent in him, and reflected in the book.\nThe volume begins with that \"exhilarating\" and \"epic moment\" of his return to Dhaka on December 31, 1971. Little did he know that in less than four years, he would leave the same city and seek refuge in Oxford, UK. This is a brave and honest effort to come to terms with that tumultuous period in our history.\nThis is our story as well\u2014the generation of students at DU in the late 60s, who participated in the political and military struggle for freedom, and shared the same passion to build the socialist and democratic Sonar Bangla invoked by Bangabandhu and fervently embraced by us. But we failed. What happened? That question haunted us and, often, mocked us.\nIn the giddiness of victory and the idealism of youth, we had never actually understood the enormity of the task before us. We had assumed that the obvious economic and social problems we faced at the time were practical problems, which could be resolved through some effort, imagination and sacrifice. What we did not realise\u2014as this book explores\u2014were the political, psychological, administrative and other slippery slopes that had doomed the socialist \"moment.\"\nWhile this is a rich and provocative analysis of that entire period, it is really a discussion of THAT failure which speaks to our generation most compellingly. Hence, it is this aspect of the book which will be the focus of this essay, more as personal reflections rather than a \"review.\"\nReading the book makes us realise that there were deeper, subtler, more treacherous issues we did not understand, such as institutional jealousies, jurisdictional frictions, and leadership jostling (particularly the scramble for nearness to Bangabandhu). The lack of coherence and synchronisation was painfully reflected in persistent inter-ministerial wrangling. RS refers to the intense bickering, which he once describes as a \"gladiatorial contest,\" even between the ministries of planning and finance, while both were under the same minister, the perceptive and talented Tajuddin Ahmed.\nThis lack of coordination was both painful and hilarious. RS recounts the story of his trip to Chhatak Cement Factory, when he saw that large inventories of cement had been stockpiled because of patron-based distribution bottlenecks, while just on the other side of the river, work on the Sylhet Pulp Mill, being constructed on German credit, was at a standstill because they did not have enough cement to complete their project (Pages 195-196). His efforts at \"intervention\" resulted in complaints about \"overstepping jurisdiction.\"\nSimilarly, he was incensed when he realised that the housing project that had been planned in Mirpur had not progressed at all, and the allocations in the Annual Development Plans (ADPs) had been used just to pay for the hugely inflated price of the land controlled by influential people (Pages 175-178).\nThere were many such examples. They proved, as Burns had noted, that \"the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry\"\u2014particularly when the left hand of planning does not know what the right hand of implementation was doing.\nThe members of the Planning Commission also faced difficulties dealing with senior bureaucrats who resented their power (perhaps their abilities and ideals as well), as well as from junior officers given to traditional inertia, rather than the promptness and initiative the circumstances demanded. RS suggests that this distance may have been heightened by the members' own inability or unwillingness to build bridges either because of their egos, their access to Bangabandhu, or their political inexperience.\nBut it was not merely management inefficiencies and institutional gridlock that haunted the transition to a socialist economy. The book appeared to confirm the impression long suspected\u2014that the concept itself had not been clarified to the larger body of political stakeholders, nor its \"ownership\" distributed more widely. It became a word or a slogan, but not a programme or a strategy for which the nation had been mobilised.\nMoreover, there were questions about what the concept meant. It is possible that Bangabandhu (who had written admiringly about China after his visit there in the early 1950s, who may have disliked capitalism as an exploitative system, but whose references to socialism as an ideal had been a bit vague and infrequent) had, in all likelihood, visualised it merely as creating an inclusive and just society that would bring \"smiles to people's faces.\"\nThe Planning Commission had assumed that it involved the pursuit of nationalisation and redistributive objectives, where the \"commanding heights\" of the economy would remain under state control, which could all be accomplished through appropriate policy frameworks and institutional support.\nTraditional upholders of the notion had conceived it as a \"revolutionary undertaking,\" requiring a theoretical understanding of the dialectics of class struggle and the materialist conception of history, and difficult to achieve under an unprepared leadership with its petty-bourgeoisie background and orientations.\nBangabandhu's approach to the concept appeared to be emotional; to the commission, the challenge was intellectual; to the hard-line leftists, the commitment was ideological. They may have been reading the same book, but probably not the same chapter, and were certainly not on the same page.\nBangabandhu's public utterances on the subject became less vigorous. The nimble-minded and progressive Tajuddin was distracted by other concerns, and distanced himself from the commission. Political leaders were much too busy consolidating their positions and rewarding their followers in a rather free-for-all environment. Trade union leaders, considered to be the natural allies of the nationalisation policies, were consumed by internecine conflicts over power and privilege. Students, freedom fighters, and cultural activists faded away since their belongingness was neither activated nor even sought. Intellectuals withheld support either because the initial efforts were considered to be too radical by some, or too timid by others. Even Maulana Bhashani, with his long roots in peasant and populist activism, became more of a critic than a supporter of these measures.\nOpponents of the concept such as the new \"brief-case capitalists,\" the \"indenting entrepreneurs,\" and the \"dispossessed owners of the nationalised industries,\" became increasingly active and gained traction. Plans for agrarian reforms were completely shelved for reasons of \"practical politics.\" The commission note on the First Five-Year Plan, which contained the most comprehensive discussion of goals, benchmarks and policies, was hardly debated in parliament and given only a cursory reception in the cabinet.\nThe entire notion of \"socialism\" gradually began to be viewed as an \"academic\" exercise\u2014in the worst sense of the term. Some Awami League stalwarts began to believe that \"Bangabandhu was led down the garden path on the issue of nationalisation by the professors in the Planning Commission\" (Page 114).\nMoreover, it was widely believed that the nationalisation programme was a disaster. RS points out that in spite of various and obvious difficulties, its performance was really not too shabby. In Chapter 10, he details the aggregate success it achieved in several (though not all) sectors. However, the damage to its reputation had been done, and it was lethal.\nThe \"gang of four\" in the commission began to feel frustrated and alienated. Dr Nurul Islam, the liberal \"technocrat,\" Dr Anisur Rahman, the \"idealist,\" Dr Mosharraf Hossain, the \"pragmatist,\" and RS, the (incurable) \"optimist,\" were all disappointed with the level of support their ideas generated. Even the international solidarity that they had expected from socialist countries proved to be ephemeral and elusive (Pages 243-247). Consequently, they began to plan their exit strategies. By late 1974, nearly all had left or were on their way out. Their grand experiment had collapsed.\nBut while the concept of socialism might have been a bit complicated, and carried some baggage, the issue of democracy was simpler, and integral to the values and vision which defined the nationalist struggle. The reason why even that was largely abandoned through the institutionalisation of BAKSAL is clearly a more complex issue.\nThe book does not avoid it. Indeed, RS expresses his anxiety and dismay as those events unfolded. But it does not receive the same engaged attention as the unravelling of the economic plans does. His relative indifference to this issue is understandable, since this was not his area of expertise or focus, and the subject may be more delicate. But clearly both outcomes were related and had been prompted by similar factors and dynamics.\nRS also refers to the rising anti-Indian mood in the country. It would be difficult to determine if this had been caused by the pre-existing sentiments that had been nurtured as an article of faith during the Pakistani period and still resonated among many in Bangladesh, or by the challenges and failures of the state leading people to blame an external agent, or the attitudes and behaviour of India itself that deepened early suspicions and concerns. Similarly, whether people became more communal as a result of anti-Indian feelings or more anti-Indian because of their communal predispositions cannot be clarified. But both were palpable and contributed to the government's unpopularity, since it was considered to be too beholden to Indian interests. (Awami League's perceived over-closeness to India was mined and manipulated to cunning advantage by successive regimes and communal forces).\nIn the context of the corruptions, mismanagement, political tensions, bureaucratic infighting, law and order problems, the proliferation of \"bahinis,\" external pressures (the oil crisis in 1973, the rise of international food prices that led to the famine the next year), and the \"crisis of rising expectations\" (when people had expected too much and received too little), Bangabandhu may have felt a bit overwhelmed, besieged, impatient, and alone with his back against the wall. BAKSAL may well have been his cry of desperation and a plea for help from the public\u2014the one constituency he knew, loved and trusted.\nIn less than a year of BAKSAL, the father of the nation, the very symbol of our dreams and struggles, lay in a pool of blood following a dastardly and brutal attack on his entire family. The subtitle of the volume \"From Dawn to Darkness\" is, thus, both poignant and accurate.\nThis is a sad book. While it covers a lot of territory, presents characteristically clever insights and astute analysis, and is written in the inimitable style and dry wit of RS, it is ultimately a sincere and candid reckoning with the reality of some unsettling failures. Hopefully, this will inspire a fuller, richer and more objective discussion of how our soaring dreams turned into a grim nightmare so quickly.\nWhat is remarkable is that, in this book, there are no axes to grind, excuses to offer, fingers to point, beans to spill, canards to skewer, patrons to placate, demons to slay, or agendas to advance. It opens a window into that intriguing and chaotic period which gradually assumed the dimensions and character of a Dickensian tragedy (\"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times \u2026 it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair\").\nThis book should not only be read\u2014it must be studied.\n\u00a0\nDr Ahrar Ahmad\u00a0is professor emeritus at Black Hills State University in the US, and director general of Gyantapas Abdur Razzaq Foundation in Dhaka.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Leading up to the national budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year (which amounted to Tk 603,681 crore\u201417.5 percent of the GDP), all eyes were on strengthening the health and education sectors, keeping pandemic recovery in mind. Now, given the lasting impact of the Covid pandemic on the economy and the fallout of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the focus seems to be on coping with the incoming macroeconomic pressures. At a recent meeting of the Fiscal Coordination Council, presided over by the finance minister, the Finance Division proposed that the size of the national budget for 2022-23 fiscal year would be Tk 677,874 crore, or 15.4 percent of the GDP, which is 12 percent bigger than the outgoing budget.\nWe encourage the recommendation for the government to avoid hard loans and discourage the import of luxury goods as this may reduce pressure on our declining foreign exchange reserves. The revenue collection target of Tk 433,000 crore seems ambitious, and we doubt how realistic it would be, particularly given our poor track record regarding revenue collection in the past.\nWhile it is important to plan the upcoming budget with a mind to cushion the blow of the current global inflation, this must not be done by exerting pressure on the general public. One of the major upsets from the outgoing budget was that the allocation for the education sector had remained the same, despite how the pandemic had nearly demolished this sector. The government must not make similar mistakes this time, namely by \"slowly adjusting\" the prices of essentials such as power, oil, gas and fertilisers. At a time when a majority of the public is having to deal with the brunt of the increasing prices of essentials, lowering subsidies for power, gas and oil will only increase people's suffering. Instead, the government should look to reduce wastage to lower its budget deficit.\nWhat is needed is for the budget allocation to be used effectively and efficiently across the board, something the relevant authorities have failed to do consistently over the past years. Wastage of funds for large-scale projects\u2014due to corruption, time extensions, etc\u2014is something we witness regularly. Therefore, the focus should be on completing projects on time and by not wasting public money. Price hikes for essentials may be necessary to balance the budget, but this cannot be done by adding to the sufferings of the general public.\n",

        "full_article": "We felt a sense of relief in the last four months as deaths in the so-called crossfires stopped, coincidentally after the US imposed sanctions on Rab for its alleged human rights violations. There has been no news of such extrajudicial killings, although according to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), three people did die between January and March due to physical torture by law enforcement agencies, while an accused died of a heart attack in Rab custody. The brief lull has apparently come to an end, as a man was reportedly shot dead in what Rab said was a gunfight between officers and armed gang members in the Golabari area of Cumilla on April 17.\nThough the description of the incident as presented by Rab is slightly different, we have heard such narratives in the past. As such, we have to ask: Is there nothing for Rab to learn from such occurrences? From Rab's own account of the altercation in Cumilla, it almost sounds like they walked into a trap. When one criminal is shot dead and the others manage to flee, what is the net result? No matter which angle this is looked at from, it does not seem to be a professionally executed job. And besides giving rise to natural doubt as to what really happened, even if one was to believe Rab's version of the events, it should call into question why the mission was executed so poorly. Whatever happened to gathering intelligence before walking into a situation?\nThe person killed by Rab conveniently happened to be a wanted criminal\u2014who, nonetheless, deserved to face trial. Even if this is accepted, given the questions that have been raised over Rab's past record and how it has affected the image of the country internationally, there should be an independent inquiry into the matter to see if there was any foul play.\nIn Major Sinha murder case, we saw how certain law enforcement members tried to use the excuse of crossfire to get away with killing a man in cold blood. After the uproar that followed Sinha's murder, there was a period when we didn't get any report of crossfire deaths. Unfortunately, that did not last for very long. We hope we are not entering into the same state of affairs. Normalising crossfire deaths again would not help restore public trust in our law enforcement agencies and the rule of law, nor would it help with our image in front of the world.\n",
