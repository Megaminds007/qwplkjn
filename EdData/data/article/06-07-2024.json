        "full_article": "A day after a searing speech by debutant Congress Member of Parliament, Bimol Akoijam, who questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s silence on the situation in Manipur, Mr. Modi responded by making his first substantial remarks in Parliament on the ethnic conflict that broke out over a year ago. While acknowledging the crisis, he asserted that adequate steps had been taken to restore law and order and that several institutions were functioning normally. He spoke of the need to \u201cgo beyond politics and bring peace and stability\u201d to the State, but also blamed the Congress for the way it had handled similar incidents in the past, and suggested that the social tensions in the State are deep rooted. However, the effort must now be to focus on peace and not allow the stakeholders to continue to play the blame game. Mr. Modi has never shied away from claiming glory over achievements \u2014 his government\u2019s or those of others \u2014 but his stock response to embarrassing questions or crises that show the regime in bad light has been one of silence. While such gestures have helped build his image and deflect criticism, the absence of a concrete reaction by the undisputed leader of India\u2019s government to a crisis like Manipur has only exacerbated the problem. Albeit late, his remarks should revive the search for a way out of the crisis.Manipur, unlike what Mr. Modi asserts, is not any close to normalcy. The people displaced during the conflict remain so; a report by the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre says Manipur accounted for 67,000 of the 69,000 displaced in South Asia last year. Kuki-Zo residents in Imphal and Meitei residents in Churachandpur among other areas are still unable to return to their homes. Even government servants and legislators from these communities remain displaced, affecting governance, welfare, schooling and health services. Self-claimed \u201cvillage defence squads\u201d or armed vigilantes still roam the valley and the hill areas as the conflict has spread to hitherto peaceful districts such as Jiribam. The State government\u2019s remit has been supplanted by that of central agencies, as a de facto central rule, without the imposition of Article 355, seems to be in place even as Union Home Minister Amit Shah claims this has transpired with the \u201ccooperation\u201d of the N. Biren Singh-led government. Mr. Singh does not enjoy the confidence of his own partymen from the minority communities and any chance of a peace breakthrough or reconciliation remains difficult without any change in leadership. But neither Mr. Modi nor Mr. Shah has shown any inclination to effect it. Bluster and mere acknowledgment of the crisis will not solve the problems in Manipur and Mr. Modi has to become proactive in leading changes that will lead to peace and reconciliation.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nnational or ethnic minority\n\n/\n\nlaw enforcement\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nwelfare\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\nlaws",

        "full_article": "In his first speech after leading the Labour Party to its best ever performance in the U.K. general election, Prime Minister Keir Starmer was clear about the task before him: to \u201cbegin the work of change\u201d for national renewal and rebuilding the country. With a more than generous mandate \u2014 412 seats in the 650-member House, Mr. Starmer will be virtually unchallenged inside Parliament for his agenda on \u201cwealth creation for the working classes\u201d, taxing higher incomes, banning fossil fuel car sales by 2030 and building a new Border control agency. It should be equally clear that more than the Labour win, this is a Conservative loss. After its 14-year run in power, five Prime Ministers and considerable turmoil, the British voter clearly chose to punish the Conservatives led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for compounded errors: from the mishandling of Brexit and the economic crisis, a failure to support public services, especially health and schooling, to a series of scandals from \u2018Partygate\u2019, pornography in Parliament and the Post Office scandal. The rising cost of living was a major campaign issue, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of the Ukraine war and post-Brexit shortages, although Mr. Sunak said that the economy had turned a corner more recently. Immigration has been another big issue. While Mr. Starmer has disavowed Mr. Sunak\u2019s plans to send \u201csmall boat arrivals\u201d or illegal immigrants demanding asylum to countries such as Rwanda while they are processed, he will be under pressure to do more to cut down the numbers of migrants. The remarkable performance of ultra-right wing leader Nigel Farage, who won after losing seven times, and his party, Reform UK, that won more than 14% of the vote, albeit only four seats, will be a worry on this account, with its openly xenophobic rhetoric. For many in India, the defeat of Mr. Sunak will feel somewhat personal, given their pride in his being the first British Prime Minister of Asian origin, with Indian ancestry \u2014 a bond he affirmed as well. Despite attempts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Sunak, the India-U.K. FTA could not be taken across the finish line. All eyes will be on how quickly Mr. Starmer\u2019s government, that criticised the delay, would be able to do so, as its priorities will be in shoring up the economy. The India-UK Roadmap 2030, signed in 2021, will no doubt be tweaked. An early visit to India by new U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has already been outlooked by the Labour leadership, and it will be important for both countries which have completed their elections, to hit the floor running and frame their priorities for future ties. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nBrexit\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\neconomic sanction\n\n/\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nillegal immigrants\n\n/\n\nRwanda\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024",

The reason is that it is a state-sponsored event. As are many other big public shows. Then there are marches and processions taken out by netas and yatras to espouse causes and register protest which, while important, can be grim and boring. What we need more of are parades that celebrate modern life and culture, filling our streets with colourful costumes, music, dance and pageantry. Think of Mardi Gras in New Orleans, or Samba parades in Rio\u2019s Carnival. Closer to our borders, the Chinese New Year parades are a spectacle to watch and envy. Ditto for Esala Perahera, or the tooth festival, in Sri Lanka.\nWomen also invited | The annual carnival in Goa could well be the thing the rest of India emulates. By drawing people across communities, such parades would reinforce our secular culture. They would also foster a stronger sense of community. Religious festivals, of course, already bring a lot of enjoyment to our streets. Guddi Padwa, the spring-time festival, is a good example of this. The sight of women revelling on Mumbai\u2019s roads, some even on motorbikes, is as heartening as it can get in a patriarchal society like ours. If there is a caveat at all, it is that we must make public spaces safe enough for women to join the party without reservations.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "How identity politics works across democracies\nTwo years ago, when Rishi Sunak\u2019s party elected him Britain\u2019s first Asian-origin PM, the buzz was whether the country had entered a post-race era. Today, when voters have crashed Conservatives to a historic low, is it on account of Rishi being brown? Across the pond, is Democrats\u2019 reluctance to bump Kamala up the presidential ticket also racially rooted? We ask similar questions of voting blocs in different democracies \u2013 how Blacks or Dalits or white suburban women or banlieues are tilting. The questions are legit, reflecting how identity politics has deepened everywhere. But the answers are complicated, because one brand of politics, say leftwing or rightwing, can host different kinds of identities.\u00a0\nRishi is brown, but also rich, richer than his king. Keir Starmer is white, but was the first from his working-class family to go to uni, and he uses NHS. Class is as important a political identity marker as race or religion. Also, Conservatives\u2019 thumping has been on the cards since the Boris-Liz mess that made Rishi PM. But Kamala\u2019s identity is more of a millstone. She hasn\u2019t managed to make all her hyphenation cohere electorally, not to mention that US has never elected a woman prez. Over in France, identity politics has been shaped by the project of universalism disappointing both left and right. Neither is Marine Le Pen\u2019s chosen deputy quite cut to stereotype. He has Italian immigrant roots and grew up in a low-income, multi-ethnic Paris suburb.\nCommonsensically, we know the good of identity politics lies in its balance, when it helps the fight for representation and rights, not when it vitiates into hatred or violence. Plus, identity is a matrix. Wearing one aspect on the sleeve is a strategic choice rather than the whole truth. Beyond the need to see both those elected or electing through multiple prisms, this means recognising that human society is built on different group affinities. The wonder of democracy is how it keeps all these negotiating with each other.\n\n",

        "full_article": "How does it feel to live in a society that seems to be melting from the bottom up, as well as from the top down? On one end of the pendulum, you see one of your country's biggest loan defaulters, aka one of the \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" throwing a lavish wedding party in the Middle East. Then you witness common people groaning in front of the fish market, unable to afford anything except the throwaway guts and bones.\nThe \"division bell\" is responsible for creating a toxic climate in which our resentment for one another grows while our compassion for one another declines. Polarisation, rife with mutual fear and rage, is on the rise. Something dark and sinister is occurring. Our long-term sense of solidarity is fading; we are seeing a rise in isolationism and hostility. The problem is sociological. People blame rotten politics, social media, and moral or spiritual degradation for the venom's spread. It seems each group is on its own. We hardly give each other any thought until the issue flares close by.\nMany divisive problems that pit one group against the other clearly show how our society is disintegrating. Public university teachers are on strike, calling for the protection of their pension rights. Students and job seekers have taken it to the streets, seeking an end to positive discrimination under the quota system that looms over half of government jobs. The court has overturned a previous decision to end quotas for the offspring of freedom fighters. The time is tough. A troubling pattern emerges that masks the deeper systemic issues through a calculated orchestration of conflict. In the process, the focus shifts from the real culprits who have brought our economy to a halt.\nWhat do I mean by orchestration? The government's handling of the pension reform offers a case in point. Everyone welcomed the government's announcement last year of a universal pension package under four categories: Probash for expatriate Bangladeshis, Progoti for private service-holders, Surakkha for self-employed nationals, and Samata for those below the poverty line. The inclusion of Prottoy, a contributory pension scheme that affects new teachers joining from July 1, 2024, triggered the issue. This scheme is for all autonomous entities, among other bodies, funded by the government.\nOnce the details were revealed, the stakeholders found that they would be getting the short end of the stick. Why change the existing scheme and create a system through which incoming colleagues receive a different and disadvantageous payoff? Why separate the state-affiliated autonomous bodies from the state schemes? Why then, delay the pension scheme for civil servants by a year while maintaining secrecy about its details? The striking teachers have reason to believe that the intended parity and inclusivity promoted by the universal pension scheme are not universal after all.\nThe administration has made no secret of its intention to limit the scope of the teachers. Without consulting the teachers, authorities decided to implement a contributory pension scheme for new teachers, which does not include the existing one-time lump sum gratuity. This unilateral approach has not only sparked widespread outrage but has also further exacerbated the divide between the state and the educators who have long been the backbone of our society.\nThe policymakers have completely ignored the demands of the striking teachers. The finance minister, in charge of introducing a new contributory pension programme, called the protest \"irrational.\" The education minister echoed the government's stance, stating that his office has nothing to do with it and that all new teachers have to follow the universal programme. Assigned to hear the teachers' side of the tale, the minister for road, transport, and bridges called off his planned meeting on Thursday, saying he had to first speak with the prime minister. The government is well aware that these teachers are not like those battery-rickshaw pullers who created mayhem to press home their demands. Given their lack of support, the teachers are likely to eventually yield. They are unlikely to get public support as they have failed to publicly oppose numerous other social injustices. They are on their own.\nSo much so, there is no communication between the teachers holding sit-in demonstrations inside the campus and the students staging protests at Dhaka's Shahbagh, each man for himself. Adding fuel to the fire, we see the civil servants creating a new list of perks and benefits: scholarships for higher studies, allocation of land and provision for housing societies, car loans, and selection grades. Their constant disregard for the teachers' community, whom they perhaps hate for their academic freedom, was evident when they requested a university of their own. Already, we have seen military professionals create their own universities to rehabilitate their officers or provide them with degrees for post-retirement job opportunities. The current socio-political landscape is characterised by a perilous game of division and control.\nTeachers are now pitted against students, students against the government, and the mainstream media against anyone who dares to speak out. This coordinated conflict serves two purposes: it deflects attention from the rampant abuses of private entrepreneurs who use tax holidays and other incentives to launder money, and it diverts attention from the shortcomings of civil servants and military officials who are often involved in corruption scandals. It muffles the voice of civil society, which has the ability to speak.\nIn this climate of division, public anger and frustration have become palpable. This pervasive distrust has tainted our interactions with one another, whether on the road, in public spaces, or in our daily lives. A sense of betrayal and helplessness is increasingly driving us, unravelling the societal fabric.\nAs we navigate through this turbulent situation, it's crucial to understand the underlying issues: the systematic manipulation of social tensions to uphold the status quo for a select few, leaving the rest of us to bear the consequences. The consequences fall on the rest of us. The solution to these problems depends on a democratic climate that promotes openness, inclusion, and sincere communication.\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is professor of English at Dhaka University.\n",

        "full_article": "In January 2023, Bangladesh entered into a $4.7-billion IMF programme, spanning over 42 months, to fight the pressures on the macroeconomy and arrest the associated economic downslide. These pressures, triggered by a series of external shocks emerging from Covid-19, global inflation and the Ukraine War, had accumulated over a number of years owing to weak economic management. The policy corrections, therefore, involve macroeconomic adjustments, structural reforms and institutional strengthening.\nThe core IMF programme was broken down into six reviews, and the associated policy reforms were designed to become progressively more challenging. The government should take some comfort in successfully negotiating the release of the second review on June 24. While the government succeeded in ticking many of the conditionalities for the first and second review and convinced the IMF to be more flexible on some others, in substance, the two most important policy reforms implemented so far are the flexibility of the exchange rate and interest rate. However, fiscal correction has not happened, and the structural reforms in taxation, subsidies, state-owned enterprises, trade policy, and the banking sector have not made adequate progress.\nAgainst this backdrop, the IMF has identified nine specific risks and uncertainties that could jeopardise progress with implementation of the IMF programme and constrain the ability of Bangladesh to successfully stabilise the macroeconomy and resume the growth process on a sustainable path. Five of these risks are global in nature and four are domestic.\nThe global risks include intensification of regional conflicts, commodity price volatility, abrupt global slowdown, systemic financial instability, and deepening geoeconomic fragmentation. The domestic ones relate to failure to maintain a market-based flexible exchange system, failure to address banking sector reforms, insufficient international support in resolving the Rohingya crisis, and higher frequency and severity of natural disasters related to climate change.\nThe global risks are well identified. It is hard to quarrel with them. Regional conflicts and deepening geoeconomic fragmentation are of particular concern. Yet, it is fair to say many of these risks have prevailed over the decades. The main policy implication of these risks is to make an all-out effort to stabilise the macroeconomy and resume the momentum of sustainable growth as quickly as possible. Growing economic resilience is the best way to absorb external shocks and take corrective actions in the future.\nThe list of domestic risks is way too conservative and misses out some big-ticket items. Regarding the Rohingya crisis, this is more in the nature of an external risk. Bangladesh is doing its best to drum up international support. Progress with fiscal reforms will help create more space to fund Rohingya needs.\nConcerning climate-related natural disasters, this is more a long-term challenge, although admittedly, Bangladesh's response in instituting policies and programmes to build greater climate resilience so far has been weak. It is not clear whether the IMF programme's $1.4-billion climate resilience component has been very effective in strengthening this policy response, especially in regards to mainstreaming climate change policies in planning, budgeting, incentives and institutional capabilities. I would like to throw the ball back at the IMF's court and ask it to reassess this component to see if the programme design was adequate to secure substantial climate reforms with potential long-term benefit.\nThe two remaining domestic risks are both very relevant and fall in the high risk category. It has now been 18 months since the IMF programme was approved, and little progress has been achieved in the banking sector. If anything, downside risks have increased. The volume of non-performing loans and distressed assets continues to increase, and there is little sign that a reversal is coming anytime soon. Without meaningful progress on banking reforms, the overall quality of the IMF programme will suffer.\nOn the exchange rate, an encouraging beginning has been made with the reform on May 8. The unification of the exchange rate and adoption of the interim crawling peg regime is a sound reform. Steps must be taken to quickly move to a fully flexible market-based exchange system. The risk of slippage is high, but the IMF must remain vigilant in monitoring this risk and engage with the government to stay on track.\nSeveral substantial domestic risks have not been identified in the IMF risk matrix. These risks are not only high but present more immediate adverse consequences for the macroeconomy and resumption of growth momentum than the seven other risks noted by the IMF (the five global, the Rohingya, and the natural disaster ones).\nFirst and foremost is the weakness of fiscal policy. This is the Achilles heel of Bangladesh's development strategy, and progress has been faltering for a long time. The 18 months of the IMF programme has brought in some marginal progress, but most of the institutional and structural aspects of the tax reform programme have not been addressed.\nOf immediate concern is the consistency of the FY2025 budget with monetary policy for inflation control. At 4.6 percent of GDP, the budget deficit is way too high to allow the credit tightening that is needed to control inflation. There is a high risk that the budget will either crowd out private credit or cause a loosening of monetary policy thereby jeopardising inflation control.\nA big missing item in the budget is the absence of reform of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The financial return on investments in SOEs is very low and net budgetary transfers to sustain these poorly performing SOEs are way too high. Reform of SOEs is an easy win and surprisingly not emphasised in the IMF programme.\nOn the spending side, the budget subsidy target is too high while the allocations for health, education, training, agriculture, water, and social protection are too low. At a time when job creation is constrained, the economy is slowing down, and inflation is high, the low level of spending on social protection (0.8 percent of GDP excluding civil service pensions) is very disturbing and must be corrected.\nAnother major structural reform where very little progress has been made concerns trade protection. This again is a long-standing challenge. The tax revenue's excessive dependence on customs duties, including supplementary and regulatory duties, has prevented any meaningful progress with trade reforms even after 18 months of the IMF programme. Consequently, the anti-export bias of trade policy prevails, which constrains export diversification and growth of non-RMG exports. Indeed, the slowdown in export growth to a mere 2 percent in FY2024 is a hugely worrisome development for both the sustainable management of the balance of payments and recovery of the growth momentum.\nThe final missing risk area is governance and institutions. The high incidence of corruption, some of which have erupted openly in the public domain, especially at a time when inflation is high and the economy has slowed, is a huge threat to social and economic stability. The government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance for corruption. This is comforting to know but it must now act decisively to implement its policy of zero tolerance. It must dig down to the root causes of corrupt practices and implement the required institutional and regulatory reforms that eliminate/minimise the scope for rent seeking.\nDr Sadiq Ahmed\u00a0is vice-chairman of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI).

        "full_article": "A recent police intelligence report has confirmed what we have been warning about in this column for years: militants in prisons, far from being rehabilitated and deradicalised, are continuing their communications with members of militant outfits outside of prisons, possibly gathering strength and reorganising. This indicates that the soft power approach being pursued by the authorities in prisons are not working at all.\nMilitants in prison, like all other prisoners, need to be rehabilitated and shown a better path. But because of the way our prisons are presently operating\u2014with prisoners crammed beyond prison limits, inadequate resources allocated for them and very little focus on their rehabilitation\u2014they are doing the exact opposite. Only a year ago, this newspaper reported on how militant leaders have been taking advantage of gaps in surveillance to form new outfits and recruit members inside and outside prisons. By intercepting communications, intelligence officers also managed to learn that Neo JMB leader Saiful Islam Khaled, now on death row at Kashimpur High Security Prison for the 2016 Holey Artisan cafe attack, was contacting Bangladeshi IS militants in Afghanistan, asking for financial support to reorganise the militant group in Bangladesh. This, of course, should seriously concern the authorities. Unfortunately, it seems that has not been the case as surveillance gaps continue to persist in our prisons, according to police report.\nWhat is further concerning is that militants in prisons have apparently been able to smuggle cell phones into the jails with the help of some prison guards. Due to such neglect, even militant leaders living abroad are regularly communicating with jailed members in Bangladesh. With that being the case, it is difficult to imagine that the jailed members will ever become deradicalised. What then, will be the outcome when they finally get out of prison? Will they not again bolster the ranks of different militant groups? It seems that the government has no plan on what to do with these people. And the militant outfits are taking full advantage of that.\nHence, we once again reiterate the importance of cutting off the communication of these prisoners with outside militant forces. Authorities must put greater focus on deradicalising and rehabilitating them, and also increasing surveillance in prisons to ensure that these measures are actually working. After all, militancy poses one of the greatest threats to our national security, as well as our secular social fabric\u2014and strongly contradicts the religious values held by the majority of our citizens.\n",

Climatologists blame it on global warming, a symptom of climate for which human actions have a big role to play. A report of the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 ranked Bangladesh the seventh extreme climate-induced disaster-risk prone country in the world. Visitations by extreme heatwaves along with long spells of drought over the last couple of years in the country are the obvious symptoms of its climate induced-vulnerability. Amid the experience of hottest heatwave event in the last 52 years this summer when the temperature rose to as high as 43.8 degrees Celsius is the telltale sign of how global warming is impacting Bangladesh. A study conducted by a non-government body, the findings of which were revealed at a recent discussion held in the city, warned that in case the current trend of weather pattern with attendant heatwaves and the record high temperature persists, then by 2050 the country may experience a temperature level surpassing 46 degrees Celsius. Even in the near future, say, by 2030, the temperatures might exceed 45 degrees Celsius. That is a veritable doomsday scenario considering its devastating impacts not only on public health, but also on the country's agriculture, especially food production. In that event, experts fear, the nation's crop yields, those of rice and wheat, in particular, may experience a decline by 20 per cent. Already the eighth-most populated country in the world and struggling hard to grow enough food to feed its people, Bangladesh can ill-afford to encounter such a grim prospect in the future without the preparedness it requires. In fact, what this part of the world has been witnessing over the past few years points to a clear shift in weather pattern, thanks to climate change. The point is that this shift in weather pattern is not a passing phenomenon and, as such, it has to be accepted as a fact of life. So, it demands adoption of an appropriate strategy by the government to adapt to this changed condition of life. True, the rich and advanced industrialised nations are primarily responsible for the global warming attributable to human actions including excessive burning of fossil fuels by them at least over the past two centuries. Thankfully, at the international climate talks held from time to time, the industrialised nations of the northern hemisphere do take responsibility for the development (of global warming) with promises of financial packages for the developing world to fight its fallouts. Since Bangladesh is part of the developing world, it has a share of the climate adaptation fund the rich nations have pledged to provide. Unfortunately, changes in the climatic conditions are taking place too fast to wait for any external help to adopt mitigation and adaptation measures in response to extreme weather events like heatwaves with very high temperature.It would be worthwhile to note at this point that environmental governance is the critical first step towards mitigating and adapting to the extreme climate events like heatwaves, droughts, downpours, untimely floods and so on. Evidently, recent extreme heatwaves caught the nation quite unawares seeing that it could not come up with adequate mitigation measures, except some stopgap advisories, to protect crops as well as public health from their (heatwaves') onslaughts.To this end, the different government agencies including the Directorate General of Health Services under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the National River Conservation Commission, Bangladesh Water Development Board under the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to mention but a few, will be required to work in a coordinated fashion to combat the fallouts from extreme heatwaves as wells other impacts of climate change.",

        "full_article": "The ceramic industry is a deeply fossil-fuel driven industry, i.e. gas-dependent. It cannot be run on solar power. In fact, no heavy industrial production unit can for that matter. And while the government keeps harping about renewable energy as being the next big thing, industry suffers in silence or in mute protest that falls on deaf ears. The fact of the matter is that ceramic-making factories in key areas of Dhaka, Gazipur and Narsingdi have been \"struggling to continue production as they have been suffering from a severe gas crisis in recent times\" according to a recent report published in this newspaper.The ceramic industry's apex body, the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers & Exporters' Association (BCMEA) has every right to feel indignant at the situation. Ceramic making is largely concentrated on gas-fired kilns but due to not only a crisis of gas but the hike in gas prices too. Indeed, the recent increase in gas prices was opposed by the industry, but at that time, the concerned ministry had promised uninterrupted supply of gas which turned out to be a fallacy. Moving to the present situation, industry experts state that some 25 factories in this area have been suffering a \"production loss of estimated Tk200 million every day for the last one month due to the supply crunch of natural gas.\" It is only natural that ceramic manufacturers have been clamouring for sufficient gas supply in the areas of Mirpur-12, Dhamrai of Dhaka district, Tongi, Kashimpur, Bhabanipur, Bhawal, Mirzapur, Sreepur, Mawna (of Gazipur), Panchdona (of Narsingdi), Bhaluka and Trishal (of Mymensingh).Today, the ceramic industry is an important sector with about 70 factories in operation. Only a handful of factories in Habiganj and Bhola get the require gas pressure for production. As stated by BCMEA, manufacturing units need gas supply pressure at 15 PSI (pound per square inch) but affected factories are getting at best, 3 PSI, which is hardly conducive to production. Products include tableware, tiles, sanitary ware and bricks. For normal operation, factories need kilns to have access to gas 24 hours a day that burn at 1,200 centrigrade at the required PSI. Since a constant pressure is required, what happens when the PSI goes down? Wastage of all material inside the kiln. This is unsustainable from a production point of view. Because when production comes to a halt due to this wastage happening from lower PSI, a factory must wait 48 to 72 hours before resuming production.There is another matter that cannot be overlooked. The depreciation of the Taka against the US dollar, prices of inputs (particularly raw materials), i.e. a lot of the material that has to be imported has also shot up. Getting back to the price of gas, price per cubic meter had been raised from Tk 13 to 30 on the promise of uninterrupted gas supply. And this turned out to be a mirage. So, not only is industry paying more than double the price per unit, it isn't getting it at the required pressure level - resulting in unsustainability of production. Is the domestic market for ceramic ware to be left to importers in that case? What is to happen to the workforce engaged in this industry and what is to happen to the estimated Tk170 billion in investments that have gone into making this industry that has been touted as one of a handful of industry capable of competing in foreign markets in the near future?One cannot overlook the fact that domestic manufacturers cater to over 90 per cent of the domestic demand for the items produced by these factories and hence, its concerns for reliable primary energy supply cannot be ignored. There is literally no short-term solution to a problem that has been over a decade in the making. Recapping the folly of policymakers cannot be overstated with the emergence of the all-powerful import lobby for fossil fuel rose through the ranks of policymaking to convince the government that there was no need to explore domestic resources of natural gas (in what geologists have stated umpteen number of times as a natural gas-rich country). Today, the ceramic industry is finding out to its dismay what it means when the country doesn't have enough foreign exchange to buy natural gas from foreign markets. Industrialisation in the country is in danger of stopping in its tracks- not just for domestic producers but for foreign investors too because there simply enough gas to go around. In the midst of this crisis, active foot-dragging efforts are in play to arrest energy wastage in a number of gas-guzzling plants that have outlived their operational lives and are grossly energy-inefficient.What other proof does the State need to enact measures to improve energy efficiency across the board? Ample studies exist on what needs to be done to save gas, so that it may be diverted to industries that are starving of it, but does the political will exist to save industry? That is the question.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It was long overdue. The service should have been introduced much earlier. Lack of long-term vision was the main obstacle to go ahead. Though many people suggested taking the initiative, the authorities were indifferent. Finally, the government has taken a symbolic step, hoping it will be fully functional soon. In the last week, Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) formally launched a shuttle bus service at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. Initially, two buses are now operating. The buses will start from Airport Terminal-2 and travel through the airport roundabout, Jasimuddin Road at Uttara, Airport Railway Station, and Airport Terminal-3, then return to Airport Terminal-2 via the roundabout. The BRTC plans to increase the number of buses later.The shuttle buses are expected to facilitate the travel and luggage transportation of expatriates, domestic and foreign tourists and general passengers. Thus, the service is targeted to facilitate the incoming passengers who usually face many difficulties once landed in Dhaka from abroad. After completing immigration and customs formalities, chaos is almost everywhere when they come out of the airport. Inadequate space outside the arrival terminals makes it troublesome for cars and buses to collect passengers smoothly. Again, rental transport is expensive for many and those often exploits passengers. Some incoming passengers are forced to leave the airport on foot with baggage on their heads. They later rent CNG-driven auto rickshaws. Some even walk longer to get into public buses with a lot of hassle. For them, a well-planned shuttle bus service can provide a big relief. The concept of a shuttle bus service is not unique, and it is a popular and affordable option in many countries. The service is designed to be hassle-free, ensuring timely transfer of departing passengers to international airports and smooth transfer of incoming passengers to their destinations. By reducing congestion near the airport, the shuttle bus service offers a convenient and cost-effective alternative to private cars or microbuses, providing a sense of relief to the passengers. The move taken by BRTC is thus a welcome one. The air-conditioned shuttle buses have ample luggage transport facilities, security systems, free Wi-Fi, and special boarding and alighting arrangements for the elderly and people with special needs. This means that the BTRC is out to provide a good experience for its passengers. The ticket per person is Tk 20, and along with luggage, it is Tk50. It is also good to know that these two special shuttle buses were initially prepared with the BRTC's technical expertise at the integrated central repair factory in Gazipur. Several challenges are, however, there to make the service effective in the long-run. Operating only two buses initially means it is a trial run and the number of buses must be increased soon. Dedicated stops must be clearly marked so passengers can find where to wait for the bus. Access to the incoming zones, located on the ground floor of both terminals, is narrow and mostly congested. So, it may become a barrier to the service. Again, private car and microbus operators in the airport area may try to block the shuttle bus service for fear of losing their business. The airport authorities need to curb any such move. Over the years, commuters in Dhaka have witnessed some setbacks in a series of positive steps regarding public transport revamping. For instance, the BRTC circular bus service on the Dhanmondi-Azimpur route collapsed within a few months of operation. It is not desirable that the airport shuttle service also suffers the same fate. Instead, an extended airport shuttle service is necessary to reduce the hassle of both departing and incoming passengers.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The ongoing gas crisis, now spanning a month, poses a significant challenge and inconvenience for household, commercial, and industrial users. Refuelling vehicles with CNG is consuming 3-4 hours daily due to low pressure, which is especially burdensome for those who rely on personal transportation. Both export-oriented and local industries are grappling with reduced production and heightened costs, resorting to alternative energy sources. Consequently, operational expenses have surged across most industries, with productivity plummeting by nearly half in gas-dependent factories.Compounding the issue, our domestic gas reserves are depleting, while reliance on imported LNG proves inadequate amidst volatile global prices and foreign currency shortages. Urgent interventions from relevant authorities are imperative to mitigate the natural gas crisis promptly.\nRafid AlamMPM, DU",
