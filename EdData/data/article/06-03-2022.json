Just a month ago, India was reporting around 1,70,000 cases a day and the latest numbers suggest it has plummeted to around 6,000. India is now contributing to only 0.7% of global cases. Last year this time, cases were below 5,000 a day, encouraging several States and the Centre to claim that the pandemic was over, though within a matter of weeks there was a resurgence fuelled by the Delta variant which birthed a summer of catastrophe. There is, however, a crucial distinction between then and now in that over 75% of those over 15 years are now fully vaccinated in India. A small and growing number of those over 60 have had the third dose. Reports suggest that over 90% of Indians have been exposed to the virus over the last two years and, therefore, combined with the vaccination, are sufficiently protected against disease \u2014 but not infection \u2014 for many more months ahead. What bears emphasis is that avoiding vaccination makes one, particularly the elderly, vulnerable to serious infection. Balram Bhargava, Director-General, ICMR, said at a press conference this week that 92% of those who died of COVID-19 since January this year were unvaccinated, and underlined that vaccines and the wide vaccination coverage had played an important role in protecting hundreds of lives.India is fortunate in that it does not have to battle vaccine hesitancy in a large measure. The initial scepticism regarding the vaccines not having passed the typical stages of vaccine approval saw a certain degree of hesitation, but very soon it emerged, in April and May last year, that India\u2019s main problem was an insufficient number of vaccines. Though India today has administered nearly 178 crore vaccine doses and has several indigenously developed vaccines that have been approved in emergency mode by authorities, there are still serious questions on supply. Currently, vaccine demand is low and the vaccination drive is in \u2018mop up mode\u2019 and administering second doses. But were the pandemic situation to suddenly turn for a fourth wave to take shape, there would be a spike in demand for vaccinations for children, particularly those below 15, as well as booster doses for adults. The experience of Covaxin\u2019s manufacturer being unable to ramp up vaccinations in time during the crisis months ought to be a persistent reminder to other biotechnology companies that having vaccines is very different from being ready with a seamless supply chain. The Indian government has still not made public a timeline for when vaccines from Biological E, Gennova and Zydus Cadila will be practically available for mass use. Though the world is occupied with a different crisis, India must not let its guard down and should insist on companies being ready with a measurable timeline.",

        "full_article": "That policies change with governments may appear acceptable in a democracy, but no court will allow a transformation so fundamental that rights and entitlements that accrued during an earlier regime are abandoned or frustrated. In 2014, the Amaravati region was chosen as the site of the capital of Andhra Pradesh, the residuary State left after the creation of Telangana, but work was stopped after the present YSRCP regime took over. Instead, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy mooted the idea of \u2018decentralised\u2019 development, by which he meant that the State will have Amaravati as the legislative capital, while Visakhapatnam will be the executive capital, and Kurnool the seat of the High Court. In a stern rebuff to the \u2018three capitals\u2019 idea of the present regime, a Full Bench of the State\u2019s High Court has ruled that it cannot abandon the project to develop Amaravati as the capital city after over 33,000 acres had been given up by farmers and \u20b915,000 crore sunk in it over development expenditure. Holding the State government to its promise of developing the region into the capital city, it has directed the government to complete the required developmental work in Amaravati within six months. As a consequential relief to the farmers who had given up their land for the specific purpose, the court has asked the State and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority to develop the surrendered land and deliver reconstituted plots to them within three months.In political terms, the decision to locate the three organs in different cities was possibly motivated by a wish to undo a key policy measure of the previous TDP regime, as well as negate speculative gains the erstwhile rulers may have allegedly made by choosing Amaravati. However, it was projected as a measure to decentralise governance and take the fruits of development to all parts of the State. After farmers approached the court, the government sought to render the matter infructuous by repealing its decentralisation law, the one that it enacted in 2020 for spreading the capital city and proposing \u2018inclusive development\u2019 of all regions. However, the Bench took note of the government\u2019s intention to pursue its multiple capital cities plan and decided that it will adjudicate on the petitioners\u2019 grievances. It held that the State legislature lacked the competency to shift the organs of the State. The verdict, if undisturbed by the Supreme Court, may put an end to attempts to shift the capital city out of Amaravati. A welcome feature of the verdict is that it has invoked the doctrines of constitutional trust and promissory estoppel to prevent a regime from going back on its promises to citizens. It sends out a message that governance should not be buffeted by winds of political change or be held hostage to the passing whimsy of a particular regime.",

        "full_article": "Russia's military attack on Ukraine has unquestionably thrown the global economy off balance. Newspapers are full of stories about the long-term impact of this war. Obviously, I share many of the dire predictions being made, but for this article, I choose to address another equally burning and long-term issue: the role of rising interest rates. In simple terms, it revolves around the question: \"How high does the interest rate have to rise to dampen inflation?\"\nWe know that the interest rate determines the price of holding or loaning money. Banks pay an interest rate on savings to attract depositors. Banks also receive an interest rate for money loaned from their deposits. When interest rates are low, individuals and businesses tend to borrow more from banks, thereby increasing the money supply. As a consequence, inflation goes up. On the other hand, higher interest rates tend to lower inflation.\nWhile this is a very simplified version of the relationship, it highlights why interest rates and inflation tend to be inversely correlated.\nThere is growing concern among economists that the rate of interest that borrowers pay is soon going to shoot through the roof and short-circuit the post-pandemic economic recovery. So, why is the interest rate going up? How does it affect other macroeconomic variables, particularly the price level? Can rising interest rates really curb inflation? I cannot answer all these questions here due to space limitations, but hope to pique the interest of readers so as to enable them to pursue the riddle in greater depth over time.\nA central bank can use interest rate variations as a tool to battle inflation. It does so by setting the short-term borrowing rate for commercial banks\u2014known as the repo rate in Bangladesh\u2014and then those banks pass it along to consumers and businesses. That rate influences everything from interest on credit cards to mortgages and car loans, making borrowing more expensive. On the flip side, it also boosts rates on savings and certificates of deposit (CD), and encourages savings.\nDuring a period of inflation, a central bank aims to make borrowing more expensive so that consumers hold off on purchases, thereby cooling off demand and keeping prices in check. The biggest challenge is to find the right level so as not to raise it too much which will choke off investment and hurt the poor.\nAs we now see, interest rates in countries all across the globe are going up after a lull in recent years. The Bank of England has begun raising interest rates from their all-time pandemic low, and is under increasing pressure to raise the bank rate again. The US Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising the benchmark rate, known as the Funds Rate, at the next meeting of the Board of Governors on March 15-16. The European Common Bank might raise rates selectively, and it is a foregone conclusion that countries in Asia will follow suit, although there might be a slight lag.\nWhat's new about this upward trend is that many central banks in North America and Europe had brought down their respective interest rates to near-zero levels in an effort to achieve the targets of maximum employment and price stability. Unfortunately, inflation has recently reached a high level in the wake of rising demand and supply chain bottlenecks. The central banks have now decided to apply the brakes on aggregate demand and money supply to dampen inflationary pressures.\nThe critical question here is whether the observed movement in the two variables\u2014interest rate and inflation\u2014exhibit any causality, or is it merely a coincidence? Of immediate relevance is the question: Will merely raising the interest rate bring down the rate of inflation? In addition, how high and how fast does the interest rate have to rise to make an impact on inflation? For instance, if needed, can the Fed raise interest rates to 5 percent, 10 percent, or as in the 1980s, to 20 percent? Is this even calculable or predictable in advance? The answer to these questions is no.\nRaghuram Rajan, former chief economist at IMF and governor of the Reserve Bank of India, dismissed interest rate as a \"blunt\" tool in a situation where the real culprit is the creaky supply chain. Interest rate is a blunt tool also because aggregate price indices alone don't tell us specifically which prices are changing, for what reasons, or to what effect.\n\"The government should take action to protect the poorest through stronger price caps and direct financial support, while increasing investment in green projects to end our exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices, and dampening demand among those who can afford it through wealth taxes,\" Rajan adds.\nOf course, it will take some time for any action a central bank takes to impact the economy and curb inflation. That's why the policy-making groups need to carefully watch economic data to decide how much and how frequently to raise rates.\nAnd the biggest challenge is to find the optimal level of interest rate increases without pushing the economy into a slump. Treating inflation is like treating cancer with chemotherapy, as an expert said. \"You have to kill parts of the economy to slow things down. It's not a pleasant treatment.\"\n\u00a0\nDr. Abdullah Shibli\u00a0is Senior Research Fellow at the US-based International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI).\n",

        "full_article": "Although Ukraine's armed forces are outnumbered by those of Russian President Vladimir Putin invading our country, we take heart from the growing support we are receiving from friends abroad. Nobody should forget that this is not just an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine; it is an assault on the free world.\nPutin has been at war with the free world for decades. He has ordered the assassination of Russian exiles on foreign soil, in democratic countries such as the United Kingdom. He has interfered in democratic elections, both in the United States and across Europe. He and his cronies have looted Russia and laundered the cash abroad. He has propagated disinformation worldwide, and crushed dissent at home. In 2008, he sent Russian forces into Georgia, where they continue to occupy large swaths of that country. And most recently, he has occupied Belarus\u2014now a launchpad for his war on Ukraine.\nIn Ukraine, Putin's forces have exhibited appalling cruelty, bombing apartment blocks, hospitals, schools, and other essential civilian infrastructure that is critical to urban civilian life. The bombing of Freedom Square in Kharkiv and the use of cluster munitions in cities are unambiguous examples of war crimes. Russian troops are committing acts of genocide against the Ukrainian people.\nBecause Putin's troops have overrun sensitive sites containing radioactive material in Chernobyl and Kyiv, nuclear catastrophe is also already upon us. His decision last weekend to place Russia's tactical nuclear forces on high alert is another sign that he has no limits.\nThe longer Putin's assault on Ukraine continues, the greater the likelihood that other countries will need to step in more forcefully. It is no secret that Putin's objective extends beyond Ukraine. He wants a return to the 1945 Yalta Conference, when world leaders carved up post-World War II Europe according to Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Just last week, the Kremlin spokesman issued direct threats against Sweden and Finland\u2014two countries that, like Ukraine, are European but not members of NATO.\nThe free world has begun to wake up to the magnitude of the threat Putin poses. For too long, the global response amounted to too little, too late. But by barring several Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, freezing a significant share of Russia's foreign-exchange holdings, and supplying us with advanced military hardware, the free world is helping Ukraine drive Putin back.\nWe are grateful to Poland and other Western neighbors for doing all they can to accommodate Ukrainian refugees\u2014though we now understand that Russia is deploying paratroopers to terrorise these people and to close our western borders.\nTo resist Russia and save Ukraine, we need more help immediately. For starters, Western powers could enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to prevent the continued aerial bombardment of civilian population centres. Second, other countries must impose an oil and gas embargo on Russia, to cut off its primary revenue source. Third, governments should expel Russian diplomats, deny Russia landing rights, and ban all Russian media channels. And, finally, Russia's veto at the United Nations Security Council should be revoked, followed by a special war-crimes tribunal to prosecute Putin and other culpable officials for the crimes against humanity that have become a staple of Russian policy in Ukraine.\nPutin's terrorist army may inflict horrific damage on our cities, but it will never take control of Kyiv, our Ukraine's capital and spiritual home. He can try to erase our city from the map with bombardments, but we will never capitulate.\nAs I sit here on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukrainian politicians of all stripes have rallied together with civil-society leaders and foreign parliamentarians to counter Putin's outrageous attack on our country.\nWhile our brave armed forces and citizens are resisting Putin's criminal invasion in the cities and forests of Ukraine, we will continue doing what we can to defend ourselves. We know that we have truth and freedom on our side. All free countries must know that the fight Putin has forced upon us is not ours alone.\n\u00a0\nIvanna Klympush-Tsintsadze\u00a0is chair of Ukraine's Parliamentary Committee on Integration of Ukraine to the EU.\n",

        "full_article": "\"During school holidays, my coaching centre is closed. I encourage students to read books, play or do things they really enjoy. But most parents enrol them in some other coaching centres during their break,\" says a schoolteacher in Dhaka.\nMost parents in Bangladesh view success in exams to be the most important thing in their children's lives. This is not conducive to their holistic development. Children are also spending a disproportionate amount of time online. Many are developing problems with their eyesight and experiencing delayed speech development. It has become common that parents are often busy with smartphones and hardly have time to pay attention to children even when they need it. In this context, it is a welcome relief that children are visiting the Ekushey Boi Mela with their parents and buying books.\nReading books is essential for developing children's imagination, analytical skills, concentration, communication, etc. It can also be a joyous experience. Parents should start reading books to children when they are a few months old. Giving books as gifts during birthdays and festivals helps in developing reading habits from a young age. Children should be given the opportunity to read books that they are interested in, instead of being influenced to read texts of specific genres. Once they find reading to be a pleasurable activity, they will explore other genres of their own accord. Any questions a child may have about books should also be encouraged and entertained.\nParents decide all aspects of their children's lives including food, clothing, toys, leisure activities, etc. Hence, it is their responsibility to provide guidance to children on the optimum usage of electronic devices. In addition to reading, parents should engage children in sports and creative activities which will ensure the latter's holistic development. Moreover, parents and adult family members must limit their own use of electronic devices. Children should receive uninterrupted attention from parents, without the interference of smart devices.\nA lot of experimentation is going on worldwide with the size, shapes, illustration and overall production of children's books. Some are being printed on soft cloth to help babies and toddlers become familiar with the experience. Traditional fairy tales are also being rewritten to make them more appealing to the children of today.\nSome parents living in Dhaka have said that while their children read English books, they are not at all interested in Bangla books, as their content and quality fail to attract them. While it is important to read good-quality books published in other languages, we should ensure that children read books in their mother language as well. Children of different ages think and feel differently, and their reading speeds vary, too. New issues in society should be considered while writing books for children, so that they find them relevant and enjoyable. As such, books should be categorised by age. In addition to the content, the illustration and print must be of high quality. Children already have access to a lot of visual products, and books have to compete with digital imagery to appeal to them. Writers, illustrators, editors and publishers thus have to perform effectively to create good-quality content. Though a few publishers are trying to improve the quality of their products in Bangladesh, many children's books are of compromised quality.\nOnce publishers invest in improving the quality of children's books, parents must be willing to buy those. These days, many parents\u00a0 are spending a lot on their children's clothes, food, on eating out or for travelling. Why should they also not have a monthly budget for buying books, then? The right books can be just as rewarding and entertaining as a video game or a trip outdoors.\nThere are opportunities to make our Ekushey Boi Mela more child-friendly. Stalls' layouts should be done in a way that children are able to browse through the books easily. There should be facilitators who will engage children properly. The decoration of the stalls could also be done more creatively to appeal to them. Activities could be organised so that they can interact with their favourite and new authors.\nThe Boi Mela should offer a space to facilitate activities that will help children begin to love books. Events should be conducted where children can participate in writing and illustration activities, take part in storytelling, etc. They can also dress up like their favourite characters. But we should not have to wait for Boi Mela to promote children's books. Storytelling sessions and interesting activities centred around books should be organised in bookshops and other academic, social and cultural venues all year round if we are to create readers for our future. School- and community-based libraries could also play a vital role in developing children's love for lifelong reading.\n\u00a0\nLaila Khondkar\u00a0is an international development worker.\n",

        "full_article": "The southeast part of Bangladesh shares border with the Mizoram state of India and the Rakhine state of Myanmar. This part is covered with extensive hills ranging from 300 to 1,000 meters or even higher, with hardly any modern communication facilities in the tri-border area. It is also covered with a dense forest of mainly bamboos, making observation from ground and air fairly restricted. This is a perfect geophysical condition for insurgents\u2014who can hide away quickly\u2014and hence can be a nightmare for regular forces.\nIn this region, insurgents and separatist groups are hardly impacted by the borders recognised by Bangladesh, India and Myanmar. It's also interesting that these three countries operate from differing political viewpoints: one being a democracy, another being a struggling democracy, and the third being a military autocracy. So, reaching a political consensus is challenging. However, the separatist groups can collaborate with each other or peacefully coexist, and take advantage of the porous border when facing pressure from security forces at home or the host countries.\nThis tri-border area is sparsely populated with various ethnic communities who primarily survive on shifting cultivation. They are generally antagonistic or indifferent to the administration. In his book \"Troubled Periphery,\" Indian journalist Subir Bhaumik writes that the young boys here are absorbed in 3Gs (Girls, Guns, Guitars). Though India claims to have a peace deal with the separatist groups in Mizoram and Tripura\u2014bordering the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh\u2014it's not all that peaceful. And it's the same in case of Bangladesh where, though a peace deal has been in place with the PCJSS since December 1997, there are now PCJSS, PCJSS (Reformist), and UPDF armed groups.\nIn the Chin and Rakhine states of Myanmar, there are also groups like the Chin National Army and the Arakan Army. A peace deal was signed in Myanmar too, but now the Arakan Army is significantly powerful and thus a serious headache for the junta. The Arakan Army runs a parallel administration in most parts of Rakhine, while the junta mostly controls the cities. Having a relation with one may antagonise the other. In this conundrum, the Rohingya and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Rohingya armed group, are claimed by the junta to be destabilising Rakhine. On the question of Rohingya repatriation, Myanmar State Administration Council's Chairman Gen. Min Aung Hlaing and Arakan Army chief Major Gen. Tun Myat Naing have opposing viewpoints. Above all, there are geopolitics of the regional powers and global powers involved. So, how Bangladesh should navigate this murky water is a complex question.\nWhat are the chances of traditional threats (overt military challenges) to Bangladesh in its southeast region? Of its two neighbours, traditional threats from India are not expected for various reasons. However, traditional threats from Myanmar junta cannot be ruled out, especially to chase their separatist groups. The junta has been accusing Bangladesh of harbouring its separatist groups for long. The purpose of any military engagement would be to achieve a political aim, and Myanmar has exhibited her political aim quite clearly. So, it's very important to identify what the \"political end state\" of Myanmar is.\nWhat could be a non-traditional threat? What we are seeing now is a complicated combination of risks. Bandarban is the only district of Bangladesh that shares border with two countries. It is also possibly the only district where poppy and marijuana are cultivated with the patronage of groups operating there. Teknaf is the transiting hub of drugs. In addition, there are scopes for violent extremism and terrorism. However, these kinds of non-traditional security issues do not take place in a vacuum. Interestingly, they have the potential to destabilise bilateral relations and turn into traditional security threats.\u00a0Separatist groups themselves are a source of non-traditional security threats.\nAre there any threats lurking around the corner? The traditional and non-traditional threats to Bangladesh emanating from the secured environment in southeast are fairly easy to comprehend, as various agencies are more or less preparing to avoid surprise. It can be said that they are preparing based on what is happening now, and possibly not on what is lurking around the corner. There are more than 460,000 children growing up in the Rohingya camps inside Bangladesh without proper education, hopes and dreams. They have seen unimaginable horrors in their short lives. In 2017, many of them saw their mothers being violated. For them, there is no bottom line. By 2030, most will be adults\u2014homeless, with trauma in their minds and hatred in their hearts. Without education, hopes and dreams, it is unthinkable what monsters they might turn into if exploited, and if this issue is not addressed.\nThere are two options for us: we can address it now, or wait for it to be addressed later when it turns into a full-blown security situation. As a student of security studies, I understand that it is coming, and it is not going to be only Bangladesh's problem. It will have regional and global ramifications.\nSo what are the choices for Bangladesh? To address all traditional and non-traditional security issues in the southeast, Bangladesh should be able to foresee what is coming and prepare accordingly, rather than \"fire-fight\" events when they occur. The situation in southeast, especially the Rohingya issue, should not be taken in a business-as-usual manner. A dedicated meritocratic specialist team should be designated to handle issues with Myanmar, because the Tatmadaw\u2014Myanmar's military\u2014is a cunning, smart and meritocratic organisation. We have to read the military and political end state of Myanmar and devise appropriate courses of action.\nIndia has its own interests that may not align with ours. So, jumping on the bandwagon with India may be counterproductive. Then, there are the geopolitical dimensions involving China and Quad. Maintaining a balance is equally important to ensure the synergy of all lines of operations\u2014i.e. diplomatic, economic, political, cultural and military. In the military line, military diplomacy and developing a credible deterrence could be stabilising factors against the Tatmadaw's misadventure, if any.\n\u00a0\nLt Gen Mohammad Mahfuzur Rahman, PhD, is a retired officer of Bangladesh Army.\n",

        "full_article": "It is deeply troubling that official inflation figures in Bangladesh do not reflect the actual situation in the country, as a recent study has found out. The study, done by the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM), reveals that food inflation faced by the poor is more than twice what the official data claims. This is mostly because the state-run Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) still calculates inflation based on the old Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of 2005-06, which is really surprising given that the latest data of HIES 2016 has been available since 2017. Because of using data from the old base year, the stress that economically marginalised households are suffering in the wake of price hikes remains underestimated.\nAccording to the BBS, in January this year, food inflation in the urban and rural areas was 4.85 percent and 5.94 percent, respectively. But the SANEM study found that it was actually 11.36 percent in urban areas and 11.21 percent in rural areas. The study has found that the food consumption baskets of the selected marginalised household groups are concentrated on much smaller items than the food baskets used by the BBS. The consumption patterns of the households calculated by the BBS were derived from the HIES of 2005-06\u2014in which 422 commodities were included in the urban consumer basket, while the rural basket consisted of 318 food and non-food items. But the meal patterns of people have changed a lot since 2005-06.\nThe SANEM study also found that the average food consumption is 61.13 percent of the total consumption expenditure of urban marginalised household groups, and 65.36 percent of the total consumption expenditure of rural household groups. These are much higher than the food shares used by the BBS in their CPI (Consumer Price Indices) calculation: 45.17 percent for urban areas, and 58.54 percent for rural areas.\nThe danger of such inaccurate and exaggerated data cannot be overestimated, as official response almost always depends on the BBS data. It also means that while the pandemic has been continuously affecting people's income and employment, creating new poor and increasing their vulnerabilities, the poor are having to struggle with huge inflationary pressure. This is totally unacceptable. We urge the government to undertake proper assessment of the market's demand and supply situation. Also, the government's social protection coverage needs to be expanded to include all old and new vulnerable segments of population in its schemes.\n",

        "full_article": "The attack by Russians on a nuclear power plant in Ukraine early Friday has raised questions as to why President Putin would go for such an extreme action. We are sure a veteran statesman like him has a clear idea what a damaged nuclear power plant can do to the entire region's population and biodiversity. Putin and his military commanders must be aware of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster that took place in 1986 and its tragic aftermath. It too was located in Ukraine. Besides causing deaths to hundreds of citizens, it spread deadly radioactive contamination across Europe.\nWe are, therefore, shocked at the Russian decision to target the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant which caused a fire in a part of the building. The people in charge there, with the help of Ukrainian soldiers, have been able to extinguish the fire, and so far there has been no report of radiation leakage. It surely was a close call that otherwise could have been of nightmarish consequences. We are further alarmed by the news that Russian forces have seized control of the power plant after a battle with Ukrainian troops on the ground. Ukraine's nuclear establishments have been a major point of concern since the Russian invasion of the country. And the fear of damage to one of these establishments came true on Friday.\nThe Ukrainian president termed the attack as an unprecedented \"nuclear terror\" and his allies in the West accused Moscow of endangering millions of lives by launching a full-blown war on Ukraine. Many of them called upon Putin to withdraw all troops and engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the issues. But as the latest developments indicate, there is no sign of Russian forces withdrawing from any place under their occupation. Rather, they are carrying on with their offensive on multiple fronts and targets. Meanwhile, the number of civilian deaths is mounting, while refugee numbers have crossed over 1.2 million already. Bangladesh also condemns the unprovoked rocket attack on one of its commercial ocean liners, while left one of the crew members dead and the ship badly damaged. We are, however, relieved to learn that the rest of the crew members have been taken to a safe zone.\nWhile we strongly condemn the Russian action on the nuclear power plant in Ukraine, we insist that all nuclear sites everywhere be kept safe and secure so that no disaster like Chernobyl can happen ever again. With the memory of some tragic nuclear disasters still fresh in our minds, we urge President Putin and President Zelensky to give peace a chance by starting a dialogue sitting across the table.\n",
