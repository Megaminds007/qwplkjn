The Court has ruled that a three-member committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, or the leader of the single largest Opposition party, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI), will choose the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (EC) until a law in passed. As a constitutional body vested with plenary powers of superintendence, direction and control over elections, the ECI is a vital component of the republic that requires functional freedom and constitutional protection to ensure free and fair elections. It has been the practice that the President appoints the CEC and ECs on the advice of the Prime Minister, but the Constitution Bench has pointed out that the original intent of the Constitution makers was that the manner of appointment should be laid down in a parliamentary law. Article 324 says the President should appoint the CEC and Commissioners, subject to any law made in that behalf by Parliament. However, successive regimes have failed to enact a law. Justice K.M. Joseph, who has authored the main verdict, has based the Court\u2019s decision on \u201cthe inertia\u201d of the legislature and the perceived vacuum in the absence of a law.Few would disagree with the Court\u2019s fundamental proposition that the election watchdog should be fiercely independent and not be beholden to the executive; and there should be no room for an appointing authority to expect reciprocity or loyalty. The government\u2019s argument that the existing system was working well and there was no vacuum was quite weak, as, admittedly, the convention now is that the Prime Minister chooses a name from among a database of high-ranking civil servants and advises the President to make the appointment. However, a relevant question is whether the presence of the CJI in the selection panel is the only way in which an institution\u2019s independence can be preserved. There is no clear proof that the independence of the Central Bureau of Investigation Director, who is appointed by a panel that includes the CJI, or his nominee, has been preserved or enhanced. Further, the CJI\u2019s presence may give pre-emptive legitimacy to all appointments and affect objective judicial scrutiny of any error or infirmity in the process. On its part, the government will be well-advised to enact a law \u2014 but not one that seeks to preserve the current convention to get around the verdict \u2014 that is in tune with the spirit of the Court\u2019s emphasis on the ECI\u2019s independence. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nexecutive (government)",

        "full_article": "After the conclusion of two key G20 ministerial meetings, of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governers (FMCBG) in Bengaluru and Foreign Ministers Meeting (FMM) in Delhi, without consensus over the Ukraine war, diplomats and G20 officials must pause for a stock-taking exercise on the government\u2019s strategy for its G20 presidency. The FMCBG is part of the key \u201cFinance track\u201d of the 20 most advanced economies, set up in 1999 to help global economic coordination after the Asian financial crisis. The other, the \u201cSherpa track\u201d, works on the G20\u2019s goal setting process. With the experience India gained in Indonesia last year to bridge the Russia-West divide, the challenges for India\u2019s presidency, amid dynamic geopolitical changes, should have been clear. In Bengaluru, however, the surprise was when Russia and China refused to accept the language on the Ukraine war that they had agreed to just three months ago. As a result, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was constrained to issue only a Chair\u2019s summary and outcome document, rather than a joint communique. The government also decided to include the paragraphs that Russia and China had objected to, naming them in the document. This is something of a precedent, as last year, the Indonesian chair\u2019s joint communiques at the Leader level and FMCBG expressed the sentiments of \u201cmany\u201d and \u201cmost\u201d countries. After the brinkmanship in Bengaluru, it was ambitious, if not a bit surprising, that the government chose to attempt negotiations for a joint statement for the FMM. Eventually, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar issued a Chairman\u2019s summary and outcome documents too, citing differences over the two Bali paragraphs. This was a first, as FMMs have not attempted to issue statements at all.While the two meetings have given India\u2019s G20 process a rocky start, there is a long road ahead to the Leaders\u2019 summit in September. Mr. Jaishankar has pointed out that the bulk of the statements that pertain to the critical issues for the Global South, such as food and energy security and debt management, have been ironed out. Second, there is clarity that India cannot bank on the language of the Bali Summit, and Sherpas will need to iron out a new consensus language on Ukraine. This will require a keen ear and creative formulas that take into account Russian grievances with the language, as well as the western desire to retain its successes in condemning Russia\u2019s actions in the Bali document. As host, India is in the \u2018hot-seat\u2019 and will benefit from enlisting those countries in the grouping other than the entrenched camps of the G7, U.S.-led developed world, and the now-strengthened Russia-China combine, to ensure that a middle path is found.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nG20\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nUSA",

The decision of the Supreme Court to radically reform the method of appointment of chief election commissioner (CEC) and the two members of Election Commission is one such. The court held the President would no longer appoint the CEC on the sole advice of government. Instead, a committee of the Prime Minister, leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha and the CJI would advise the President. By wresting control of the appointment of members of EC from government, the court holds out the promise of free and fair elections, ensured by a truly independent watchdog. Democracy wins.\nBut when courts step in to legislate in such a manner, frustrated by Parliament\u2019s unwillingness to act for 73 years, democracy also loses. Article 324 of the Constitution is a simple provision \u2013 the President would appoint members of the EC till such time Parliament makes a law.\nRead full opinion on TOI+\n\n",

Neither the absence of a communique nor the unsettled nature of contemporary geopolitics is a reflection on multilateralism, which cannot always find a ready solution for deep-seated disputes. But it does provide opportunities to de-escalate and open the door to durable outcomes. The Delhi summit did just that through meetings on the sidelines such as the ones between the US and Russia, and between Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang.\nJaishankar was realistic in assessment of bilateral ties with China. He termed these abnormal and added that \u201cthere are real problems in that relationship that need to be looked at.\u201d Fatalities at Galwan in 2020 marked a turning point and China\u2019s attempts to paper over the issue or adopt an intransigent posture in talks don\u2019t help. Sensibly, India avoided a knee-jerk approach to trade in its reset of the bilateral relationship. Trade is dominated by supply chains that split production across countries. Consequently, looking at bilateral trade deficits in isolation is meaningless.\nTo illustrate, two critical imports from China are integrated circuits and plastic raw materials. China\u2019s just one link in the IC supply chain that feeds into India\u2019s burgeoning electronic exports. China contributed 13.8% of India\u2019s imports between April and December 2022, the largest source. That, however, will not hold back tighter integration among Quad members, who met yesterday. As the Quad joint statement pointed out, a rules-based international order encompasses respect for territorial integrity. It can no longer be business as usual with China. A forum such as G20 allows India to get the message across.\n\n",

These articles will be written by four educators \u2013 professionals who have vast experience in learning, teaching, publishing, and managing various aspects of a university both in Bangladesh and the United States.\nDespite some significant achievements in Bangladesh over the past few decades, some of the major problems that plague our education system make the graduates of our higher educational institutions some of the least prepared for the new age. The purpose of this project is to highlight the problems of low quality of education, lack of qualified teachers, lack of funding, low literacy rates, gender disparities, inadequate teacher training, limited use of technology, and limited access to higher education compared to the need. The authors will also attempt to help us look for solutions.\nThe Bangladesh government with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at its helm has launched a major initiative to turn the recent technological achievements of our nation (\"Digital Bangladesh\") into its next logical step \u2013 \"Smart Bangladesh.\" This is a laudable step. However, what needs to happen in order for this lofty goal to become a reality is precisely what this set of articles will be focusing on: recalibrate our education system to make it robust, responsive, vibrant and creative, with the goal of turning our workforce into a capable generation of Bangladeshis who can successfully participate in the fast-moving global economy. We certainly need to celebrate the spectacular economic growth of our nation over the past few decades spearheaded by the current government, but we must also recognise that unless we prepare our workforce for the 21st century, we'll risk falling behind in the race.\nAnother goal of this project is to create various forms of interactions between the academics, students, parents, administrators, and other stakeholders via live discussions, online seminars, on-campus discussions, and written correspondence to foster awareness and to encourage the stakeholders to assist with the government's goal of becoming a \"smart\" nation. The authors will themselves interact via all forms of social media to generate enough interest to come up with ideas to transform higher education.\nThe Daily Star\u00a0welcomes and encourages any and all thoughts, ideas and recommendations from our respected readers.\nMAHFUZ ANAMEditor and publisher, The Daily Star\nFor a person who, even as a child, has always wanted to be an educator, and has been one for all his professional career, being a good teacher has remained a dream, entailed a struggle, and encouraged an (elusive) quest. It is understood that a \"good teacher\" is not a finished product or a final condition, but a constant process of discovery and change. I am still taking notes.\nPreviously, we sought to explore, and learn from, the great \"masters\" and icons of education \u2013 Socrates, Confucius, Chanakya, Jean Piaget, Anne Sullivan, Paulo Freire, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Maria Montessori and others. We searched for the philosophical foundations, approaches and insights that would enlighten and guide us.\nToday, the question of being a \"good teacher\" generates a new vernacular (jargon), and a profusion of techniques, strategies and \"mechanistic\" pedagogical skills, which centre on new testing regimes that are standardised, information-based and memory-dependent. The \"goodness\" of teachers is measured and rewarded by their ability to get their students to pass these exams. William Butler Yeats (some say Plutarch) had warned us that \"education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\" Sadly, current educational practices defy that wisdom, and thereby squelch creativity and inspiration.\n\nIf there is one quality that defines great teachers, it would be \"caring\" \u2013 they care about\u00a0what\u00a0they teach,\u00a0who\u00a0they teach, and\u00a0why\u00a0they teach. The first would imply their humility and willingness to enhance their knowledge through research and scholarship; the second their commitment to the intellectual growth and betterment of their students; and third their belief in the transformational and moral power of education itself.\u00a0How\u00a0they teach would only form a subtext in the context of the first three conditions.\nThe attributes of a good teacher are universal. They must have expertise and enthusiasm about subject matter, be prepared and organised for every class, be willing to admit mistakes, consider different points of view and be flexible, and must recognise the autonomy and agency of each student in an environment where their safety, equality and sense of belongingness are guaranteed.\nTeachers must also be role models in terms of maintaining personal dignity, patience, professionalism, compassion, moral authority and fairness in all matters. They must remember that they are preparing students for life not for jumping through hoops, and that inculcating a civic consciousness and an inclusive world view, provoking them to ask questions, and encouraging them to be critical thinkers, remain their most urgent challenges. As Socrates indicated, \"I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.\" If one can do that, one is well on the way to achieving greatness as a teacher.\nIf there is one quality that defines great teachers, it would be \"caring\" \u2013 they care about\u00a0what\u00a0they teach,\u00a0who\u00a0they teach, and\u00a0why\u00a0they teach. The first would imply their humility and willingness to enhance their knowledge through research and scholarship; the second their commitment to the intellectual growth and betterment of their students; and third their belief in the transformational and moral power of education itself.\u00a0How\u00a0they teach would only form a subtext in the context of the first three conditions.\nDr Ahrar Ahmad\u00a0is professor emeritus at Black Hills State University in the US, and director general of Gyantapas Abdur Razzaq Foundation in Dhaka.\n\n***\n\nAn ideal teacher is an agent of change, transforming all who come into her/his ambit. As a sensei or guru, this \"mystery\" person is depicted by a long list of characteristics based on personality, knowledgeability, philosophy, professionalism, inimitability, and the like.\nThe ideal teacher is ultimately one's own creation, based on experiences, personal fancy, or even fantasy. For a fair number of students, interestingly, such a teacher is the one who gives good grades! This is indeed misdirected, calling for a need to recalibrate.\nPaulo Freire, a Brazilian educator, philosopher, and advocate of critical pedagogy, observed, \"The teacher is no longer merely the one who teaches, but one who is him/herself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow.\" According to Albert Einstein, \"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.\"\nWhile the two views focus on what a great teacher \"does,\" it is also important to reflect on what s/he \"is\" \u2013 a person who spans three concentric spheres expressing her/his essence, enhancements, and the extras: the 3Es. It is the \"is\" that fortifies, energises, and enables the \"does.\"\n\nThe ideal teacher is ultimately one's own creation, based on experiences, personal fancy, or even fantasy. For a fair number of students, interestingly, such a teacher is the one who gives good grades! This is indeed misdirected, calling for a need to recalibrate. Paulo Freire, a Brazilian educator, philosopher, and advocate of critical pedagogy, observed, \"The teacher is no longer merely the one who teaches, but one who is him/herself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow.\" According to Albert Einstein, \"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.\"\n\"Essence\" is reflected in a teacher's expertise, intention, authenticity, engaging spirit, a sense of fairness, respect for the learner, and creativity.\n\"Enhancements\" are embodied in preparedness, friendliness and empathy, clarity in communications, listening skills, entertaining deportment, enthusiasm, effective classroom management skills, and feedback quality.\nThe \"extras\" make it all come together through one's credentials, appearance, cleanliness, good personal hygiene, ease of making eye contact, and a clear and easy-to-follow voice. When absent, they are considerable distractors.\nInterestingly, there's an intrinsic dynamism we found in a study on what students seek in their teachers as they mature. In their freshman year, the teacher's\u00a0friendliness\u00a0and ability to\u00a0entertain, with\u00a0good communication skills\u00a0and\u00a0enthusiasm, stand out as students prepare for a long academic journey. Sophomores value\u00a0clarity,\u00a0organisation, and a\u00a0thought-provoking\u00a0time\u00a0in the classroom and beyond. Juniors seek a guide who allows\u00a0freedom to explore, create,\u00a0and\u00a0express\u00a0new ideas as they begin to strike out on their own. They also expect\u00a0fairness\u00a0\u2013 to be justly rewarded for their creative exploits. Seniors are looking for their lighthouse, their guru: one who is\u00a0authentic\u00a0and\u00a0knowledgeable\u00a0in her/his field,\u00a0inspiring\u00a0their imagination and\u00a0instilling\u00a0in them a desire to become trailblazers. In a profession that demands high integrity, enormous responsibility, and sustained hard work, I have tried to emulate some of my best and most inspiring teachers. In so doing, I have become a work-in-progress \u2013 learning, probing, questioning, discovering, innovating, and evolving. Along the way, I have also learnt to teach less, reach more \u2013 reach the mind, the heart, and the soul of the learner. The journey is an arduous one, sometimes thankless. For me, that journey and the inherent struggle continues.\nDr Syed Saad Andaleeb\u00a0is distinguished professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University in the US, former faculty member of the IBA, Dhaka University, and former vice-chancellor of Brac University.\n\n***\n\nI have long fancied being a student of two great university professors: Amartya Sen (1933-) and Edward Said (1935-2003). Each of them changed, in their distinctive philosophical ways, how we think about our world and its problems. Sen encouraged us to see development not merely as economic growth but as a challenge of social justice. Said enlightened us on how the West dominates the world not necessarily through military power but through culture. I wonder how such gifted professors as Sen and Said conducted their classes, treated students in the classroom, crafted their syllabi, and graded assignments. Were they as brilliant in the classroom as they are in their books?\nHaving taught both in Bangladesh and the US for three decades, I am haunted and stimulated by questions such as, what traits make a university professor great? Great for whom? Students? Colleagues? University? Humanity? Is the notion of \"great\" culture-specific or universal? Does it hinge on their capacity to expand the boundaries of what we can know? How do we mediate between the intellectual \"greatness\" and classroom \"effectiveness\" of a university professor?\nLet's picture the characteristics of an \"ideal\" university professor (we will call him The Professor) in Bangladesh's current higher education landscape, often plagued by an uninspiring learning environment. First, The Professor is comfortable with self-scrutiny and adept at crossing disciplinary boundaries. While an expert in her/his subject areas, s/he is relentlessly up-to-date on disciplinary challenges in that area. The Professor creates a vibrant classroom by inspiring students on how to think, not what to think. S/he makes students aware that they not only need to master the basics of their discipline, but also develop an inquisitive mind.\n\nHaving taught both in Bangladesh and the US for three decades, I am haunted and stimulated by questions such as, what traits make a university professor great? Great for whom? Students? Colleagues? University? Humanity? Is the notion of \"great\" culture-specific or universal? Does it hinge on their capacity to expand the boundaries of what we can know? How do we mediate between the intellectual \"greatness\" and classroom \"effectiveness\" of a university professor?\nThe Professor comes to class prepared, organised, and humble, and makes course contents interesting, delivered with depth, clarity, and humour. S/he treats all students respectfully irrespective of their backgrounds, does not tolerate any academic cronyism, and is gender-sensitive. S/he understands the zeitgeist, peculiarities, and the minds of current generations of social-media-conscious learners, who are often more tech-savvy than her/him.\nThe Professor refutes the false binary of teaching and research, and views them as mutually necessary for academic growth. S/he is collegial and willing to collaborate with colleagues even if they represent different pedagogical orientations. \"My teachers at Trinity were very fine economists and each original and inspiring \u2013 in their distinct ways. But they did not agree with each other,\" wrote Amartya Sen in his autobiography\u00a0Home in the World\u00a0(2021). This type of \"disagreement\" drives a university's intellectual health.\nThe Professor explains politics to students without being political and partisan. S/he knows how to choreograph the much valorised \"inspiration factor\" in the classroom. The American thinker William A Ward wrote, \"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\" Given the commodification of education in Bangladeshi universities, are \"inspired\" students enough? Inspired to do what? Accumulate wealth in dogmatic self-interest or try to make the world a better place? A great professor makes the latter an effortlessly obvious choice.\nDr Adnan Zillur Morshed\u00a0is an architect, architectural historian, urbanist, and professor. He teaches at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, and serves as the executive director of the Centre for Inclusive Architecture and Urbanism at Brac University.\n\n***\n\nIf you're reading this, you're probably also thinking:\u00a0Who was my favourite teacher? If you were really lucky, your heart must be warming at the thought of this great teacher!\nA great teacher inspires her/his students, builds confidence in their abilities and often lights a fire in their hearts such that it brightens the entire world.\nA teacher is a lot of things: organised yet flexible, disciplined yet empathic, a mentor yet a friend; s/he has the knowledge, yet s/he challenges the pupil to seek it for themselves; s/he is fluent in and uses educational technology, and yet alerts students that the technology is as good as the learner her/himself. A teacher is all these and a lot more.\nLes Brown is a world-renowned American motivational speaker, mesmerising in his ability to inspire millions into action and to help overcome odds. Born in an abandoned house, he struggled to survive and was a mediocre student at school. He had an exceptionally bright twin brother; so, the classmates nicknamed him \"DT\" \u2013 the \"dumb twin.\"\n\nGreat teachers inspire like no one else. They are special because they stand guard between the safe space of home and the brutal outside world. Great teachers see potential in us that others, even we ourselves, can't see. They seem to come along at just the right moment when we need them the most. Above all, great teachers give us the courage to find our own way to realise that nothing is impossible, if we just put our minds to it. And that's a\u00a0great\u00a0teacher.\nOne day, a teacher asked Les to come to the board and solve a problem. Les refused. \"I can't,' he said. The teacher encouragingly said, \"Of course you can.\" \"But I can't,\" Les insisted. \"I'm mentally handicapped.\" The classmates erupted in laughter, but the teacher walked over, looked him straight in the eye and said, \"Don't ever say that again.\" Something moved inside the boy and he never forgot those words. Throughout the rest of his life, Les overcame incredible odds, thanks to the trust and inspiration of that teacher, and embodied the phrase he became famous for:\u00a0You have greatness within you!\n\nActress Emily Blunt stuttered as a child; Maya Angelou was mute after being abused as a child, and in fourth grade, Bill Gates couldn't say a word in the class. Each was encouraged to become who they are today by an encouraging teacher.\nWhile there are some excellent teachers in our country, the majority are no good primarily because they lack training. Great teachers are trained and not always born. All teachers, especially primary level ones, must be trained to become inspiring and challenging.\nGreat teachers inspire like no one else. They are special because they stand guard between the safe space of home and the brutal outside world. Great teachers see potential in us that others, even we ourselves, can't see. They seem to come along at just the right moment when we need them the most. Above all, great teachers give us the courage to find our own way to realise that nothing is impossible, if we just put our minds to it.\nAnd that's a\u00a0great\u00a0teacher.\nDr Halimur R Khan\u00a0is a university professor and can be reached at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\n\n",

While Bangladesh is nearing the goal of full primary school enrolment, only about 41 percent of children with disabilities of primary-school-going age (6-10 years) are enrolled in schools. The difference is partly due to their delayed admission. The rate is lower than the national average of 97 percent, and enrolment sharply drops to 24 percent for the 11-16 age group. So not only do children with disabilities have a low school enrolment rate and a delayed start, but they also tend to drop out early.\nInclusive development is stipulated in our constitution. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also seek to leave no one behind in the process of holistic development. Thus, excluding children with disabilities from education is tantamount to denying their constitutional and humanitarian rights.\u00a0\nAn ongoing study by the Brac Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), in collaboration with researchers from Cambridge University, found that the parents of children with disabilities value their access to mainstream education. The greatest interest was observed in the households where both parents work. These parents do not have the opportunity to spend much time on their children's education and self-care needs. Most parents, particularly those working outside, often cannot make the necessary adjustments for a more inclusive household infrastructure due to financial limitations or simply the lack of knowledge and awareness. When both parents work, it is difficult to leave their child with a disability at home alone. Access to good primary education would not only enhance the skills of their children, but also provide reliable day-care support.\u00a0\nIn this context, Bangladesh has some commendable laws in place. The most important of those laws states that no school can discriminate against a child based on their disability in the admission process, according to the Rights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2013. The BIGD study found that government primary schools generally follow this policy. Substantial difficulties in educating children with disabilities still remain.\u00a0\nFor example, when a child with disability does not understand a concept or faces difficulties in class, without relevant training, the teacher usually struggles to deal with the situation. Also, teachers have limited time during each class to ensure that all children get quality education. It is difficult to pay attention to any child that needs special care, especially with the standard 1:35 teacher-student ratio. The special care could be related to the ongoing lesson in class (for example, frequently checking if the child in question is following the class), emergency healthcare, prevention of bullying, or even self-care needs (such as taking them to the bathroom). It gets difficult for one teacher to handle these multifaceted issues while keeping the quality of education intact. The parents of children with disabilities also raised concerns about these issues in school.\u00a0\nHowever, there have been some positive developments recently. To comply with the law and the SDGs, about 38 percent of schools now have entrances with ramps for wheelchair users and toilets with high commodes for ease of access. However, there are still gaps. For example, in some cases, schools with ramps still have the bottom frame (choukath) of the door, preventing wheelchair access to school buildings or classes without help. In many cases, accessing high commodes requires climbing steps, again making it difficult for a child who has difficulty walking.\u00a0\nOne could argue that given the resource-intensive nature of their education, special schools could be built for children with disabilities. But children get their first and most expansive exposure to the outside world at school. Keeping children away from mainstream education means hindering their connection to the real world. When they learn and grow with other children, they gain critical social skills, confidence, and networks. It also raises awareness and a desire for inclusion among teachers, other children, and society as a whole.\u00a0\nAchieving inclusive education in Bangladesh will require learning from the teachers, students, and parents most closely involved with dealing with children with disabilities. Teachers need to be trained regularly. Interactive sessions between parents and teachers are also necessary at the beginning of each school year to ensure that teachers are well aware of the needs of the children they teach.\u00a0\nEnsuring inclusive education requires substantial investment and continuous learning. So, the improvements are likely to be gradual. Getting the basics right should be the priority; the more challenging targets, such as introducing inclusive teaching materials like braille, can be addressed in the longer term. But it will require the sustained commitment of policymakers and an application of focused, clever strategies. We hope the government and other stakeholders strive to invest in inclusive education in Bangladesh.\nMaliha Noshin Khan\u00a0and\u00a0Marzuk AN Hossain\u00a0are research associates at the Brac Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD).\u00a0\n\nMd Kamruzzaman\u00a0is senior research associate at BIGD.\n",

        "full_article": "This week marks one year of the incumbent Election Commission (EC) in office, which also coincided with the National Voters' Day. Far from being an occasion for celebration, however, the reigning mood appears to be one of trepidation, with the general election less than a year away. The biggest worry is, will people again be denied the opportunity to exercise their franchise? As things stand, it seems unlikely that the EC will succeed in holding free and fair elections. Despite all the talk of creating a level playing field for the political parties, so far, it has failed to make any progress in that respect. The ruling Awami League has routinely gotten away with obstructing political programmes held by BNP in the most blatant of ways.\nWhile demands made by the ruling party have been given priority over the concerns expressed by the opposition \u2013 for example, over the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) \u2013 another factor that is of great concern is the negligible involvement of voters in the election process. Tussles between the main political parties have dominated the election narrative ever since this EC took over a year ago, just like they did during the tenures of the previous two ECs. And the role and space for voters have continued to shrink to historic lows. The appalling voter turnout in recent local elections and parliamentary by-polls illustrated the lack of confidence in the EC's ability \u2013 partly due to the partisan role of the administration and partly due to its own unwillingness to take firm action \u2013 to oversee a fair transfer of power. That, of course, should come as no surprise after what happened during the last two general elections of 2014 and 2018.\nBesides the endless political controversies, harassment and intimidation of voters, denying them the chance to vote for their preferred candidates and, in some cases, forcing them to vote for specific candidates, fraudulent voting in secret booths, ballot-box stuffing, and many other irregularities during the last two elections have all but destroyed our democratic process, as well as voters' willingness to participate in such farcical exercises. Unfortunately, despite initial promise, the current EC has been unable to reverse that perception with its questionable handling of election-related irregularities. Many have rightly raised the question that if the EC cannot control the administration and law enforcement personnel during local elections, what hope does it have of doing so during the general elections where the stakes are much higher?\nThe EC itself has done little to alleviate such concerns. And the recent statement by the chief election commissioner \u2013 that political parties should participate in the election of their own volition, as the EC cannot do anything more to persuade them \u2013 is deeply worrying. How can the EC expect that when the conditions it has created so far are nowhere near satisfactory? For the sake of our democracy \u2013 or whatever is left of it anyway \u2013 the EC must do more to fulfil its constitutional mandate. It must ensure that power is returned to the people after two controversial and largely non-participatory elections.\n",

        "full_article": "The government has gone for yet another round of power tariff hike -- the third time since January this year -- by 5.0 per cent at the retail level. With this fresh increase, taking effect from Tuesday (March 1), the weighted average price of power per unit (1 kilowatt-hour) will rise to Tk7.82 from the previous rare of Tk7.13 per unit. As a result, the monthly power bill for the common consumers will see another jump when their other monthly expenses have also been going up by leaps and bounds, thanks to the ever-ascending consumer price index. But the common power consumers' woes will not end here. For the Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) minister is learnt to have told the media that from now on such power tariff 'readjustment', a euphemism for increase, will take place regularly. The government's argument for raising power price in this manner is that the price of gas, which is the vital ingredient for producing power, has been skyrocketing in the international market. In fact, 52 per cent of the country's electricity is produced by gas-powered power plants. Against this backdrop, the gas price was hiked by about 179 per cent in February. And now that the government has again started to buy Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from the international spot market at an exorbitantly high price to meet acute gas crisis that is hampering industrial production including that of power, one can easily imagine what is coming next. Obviously, more expensive fuel to produce power means more expensive power. That is simple arithmetic and those running the power administration also want that the common power consumers should be able to reconcile themselves to this unpleasant truth. In a similar vein, they might also expect that the common consumers would be able to appreciate the intense pressure the government is under from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has offered it a loan worth US$4.7 billion, to abolish subsidies on power and other utilities. But the question is, why should the poor consumers always be made the scapegoat for any rise in power production cost or any cut in its subsidy? To reduce cost, the government can also take measures to address rampant corruption, system loss at both the generation and distribution ends of power etc; that are plaguing the power sector. Also, the power producers, the rental ones in particular, can and should share the cost burden of power. Most importantly, instead of adopting such an ad hoc measure to hike power tariff, the government should have a concrete strategy for fixing power price in which common users and other stakeholders would have their say. In fact, before the recent ordinance amending the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) Act-2003, the power regulatory body, BERC, would hold public hearings prior to effecting any increase in electricity price. But after the said amendment, the government has assumed the authority to increase power tariff through executive orders. The latest hike in retail electricity price is an instance of the Power Division's authority to do the job unilaterally. But when it is about fixing the price of a utility service such as power, taking the end-users' view is essential. If bypassed by any means, it can do more harm than good. Side by side with these measures, the government needs also to expedite the exploration of new gas and oil fields as well as installation of green energy facilities to reduce the country's dependence on imported energy.",

        "full_article": "Despite enjoying duty-free access to the UK market when it comes to non-readymade apparels, Bangladeshi growers, producers and manufacturers are failing to take advantage of the situation. This comes as a surprise since a large number of the Bangladeshi emigrant population has been living in the UK for many decades. Hence, it is very natural that different products of Bangladeshi origin will be in demand over there, particularly agricultural products. Since duty-free access to the UK market is granted to Bangladesh as a least developed country (LDC), why haven't non-RMG exports taken off to that market in a big way?According to a report published in this newspaper, RMG exports to the market more than doubled over the last one decade, but sectors like agro products and processed foods, fish--- particularly shrimp, leather and footwear, and light engineering products failed to extend their footprints. Obviously, something is not being done right. There have been problems with quality control of shrimps which has hampered export, but not many big questions centred around the quality of our leather products and footwear. What has come to light of course is that there exists a gap of information between prospective Bangladeshi sellers and UK buyers on demands for products from Bangladesh. There are unresolved issues on setting standards and market promotional activities. Hence, of the total export to UK reached a little over US$4.8 billion in the last fiscal, 93 per cent of the amount came from RMG. Other exportable items that should be going to that market (beyond what has already been mentioned) include ceramics, jute, carpet and home textiles. The situation is uninspiring. It is because the UK's 'DCTS Enhanced Preferences' allows duty-free access to countries like Bangladesh which is yet to reach middle-income status. Bangladesh could further benefit from the UK's Rules of Origin (RoO). What it all boils down to is that should Bangladesh take advantage of the existing rules, the country could seriously diversify its export basket by having unrestricted access to the British market, where its products (which would not be subject to tariffs), could earn precious foreign exchange for the economy. This situation needs to be thoroughly examined at the policy level to thrash out the problems associated with misinformation, not enough information and contention over establishing standards that would conform to UK requirements.Research and Policy Integration for Development (RAPID), a Bangladeshi think tank, believes that DCTS could be the sort of game changer Bangladesh needs, to break itself out of the RMG-only mindset when it comes to export. This is evidenced by a number of sectors that have been growing over the past few decades. Some Bangladeshi companies engaged in footwear (and now increasingly synthetic footwear) have both gained experience and reached the economies-of-scale to export their ware to the UK market. The footwear industry has had a long history of exporting their products to different continents, and it has become more imperative than ever to push for exports from every sector possible, if Bangladesh is serious about expanding into new markets with new products. While the UK market is hardly new, DCTS opens up new opportunities for Bangladesh business entities. Of course before any of that happens, a host of issues need to be resolved. As explained by RAPID, there is a major lack of awareness and information gap between buyers and sellers. UK buyers are unaware of the potential of Bangladeshi products and that is not their fault. With a lack of communication between our sellers and their buyers, there will always be a gap of information. It is something which needs to be worked upon using not only government investment in road-shows but through less-formal but continued exchange of information between the various chambers of commerce and trade bodies in Bangladesh and their foreign counterparts. The UK has in place strict standards and compliance rules which need to be adequately addressed. As RMG sector has shown by example, standards can be met, but this happens when a process is allowed to get going. The government and international organisations can collaborate to set standards which would allow for Bangladeshi products to meet requirements abroad. What is required, of course, is the willingness to take the first steps in that direction. Policymakers need to take a long and hard look at exports. The recent downgrading of the banking sector by Moody's will have far reaching consequences for the economy. It's now more imperative than ever to diversify the export basket and go all-out for expanding into foreign markets with goods other than RMG. That means giving sectors with potential success like footwear, etc. the same privileges that have been accorded to the RMG sector. Reducing local taxes to encourage more companies to abide by standards set by the UK, task of gaining access to this yet to be explored market is not beyond reach. A lot of work needs to be done - but it can be done with the right policy support. The question is, whether the policymakers are serious about the paradigm shift Bangladesh needs for the transition from a single-sector export basket to multiple-product diversification.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "What is the actual number of manually-driven rickshaws in the city of Dhaka? Unfortunately, nobody knows the correct answer. Though the two city corporations are responsible for providing rickshaw licences, many unauthorised rickshaws are also there. It is estimated that around 90,000 rickshaws are registered officially, although more than one million are plying the roads and streets of the city. Interestingly, almost all the rickshaws carry some kind of number plates, and these are provided by different rickshaw owners and workers' associations and unions and even a few organisations affiliated with the political party in power. Last year, Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor expressed his disappointment at the ever-increasing number of rickshaws. He said that the corporation would introduce a QR Code registration system to get rid of the situation. Little progress has been made in this connection so far.Unregistered rickshaws have increased over the years as the authorities have failed to bring discipline. The increase in rickshaws ultimately reflects a downside of the existing public transport system in the city. The slow-paced three-wheelers are undoubtedly the most popular and widely used transport across the country. Around 60 per cent of the residents in Dhaka use the pedal-powered vehicle for daily commuting. Though the non-motorised vehicle is suitable for moving on all roads, streets and lanes and is environmentally friendly, it is a slow-moving and less efficient transport. A growing number of rickshaws also contributes to unbearable traffic congestion on roads and streets. As the policymakers and city authorities have failed to provide efficient and decent public transport, a large number of commuters are forced to depend on rickshaws, motorcycles, and CNG-run auto-rickshaws. Those who can afford use their private cars. All these vehicles are less efficient and can only carry one to five commuters at a time. The net result is congestion and chaos on roads and streets.For years, the authorities have tried to keep main roads off limit to rickshaws in order to ease traffic movements. Without providing an efficient alternative, the restriction brings little benefit. There is a vital necessity to keep the main and busy roads free from all kinds of non-motorised vehicles. At the same time, it is also essential to ensure smooth and safe walkways and a better mobility system so that commuters can reach their desired destinations without any hassle. An increase in rickshaws also indicates a severe lack of decent jobs in the country. Rickshaw pulling is laborious work, and the rickshaw pullers live a substandard life in the city. Most of them stay away from their family for months. They come from rural areas as unskilled migrant workers in the informal sector and are deprived of basic facilities and labour rights. Moreover, the hard work rapidly tells on their physical constitution. Dhaka-centric unbalanced economic activities and growth are also behind the regular migration from the rural areas to cities. Those who come to Dhaka know that they can at least pull a rickshaw to earn some money, no matter how laborious the work is. A big rickshaw-centric informal sector has also developed where rickshaw owners, repair workers, slum and garage owners, local political leaders and goons become stakeholders. Thus, phasing out rickshaws from Dhaka is a daunting challenge. Better it would be to arrange for decent and comfortable public transport systems so that rickshaws automatically become redundant. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
