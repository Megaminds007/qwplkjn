No casualties were reported although several people were injured. No deaths and swift post-event action would have rendered this incident less significant if not for the recent spate of railway accidents across zones, spotlighting the oft-precarious conditions of trains, the infrastructure they need to operate, and the people and goods they transport. In the Kavaraipettai incident, officials said the passenger train received a green signal to enter the main line but it passed into the loop line, rear-ending the goods train. \u2018Kavach\u2019, the Indian Railways\u2019 train protection system of choice, is designed to avoid such incidents, and the government can install it across its entire network in a decade with as little as 2% of its annual capex. Of course the effects of its implementation will become clear in a similar span of time, not in a few months as some in the political class are demanding. This said, if the seemingly straightforward causes \u2014 due to which a naive decision to reroute a train can turn into the reason for a major accident \u2014 are a sign of the precarity of the railway infrastructure, \u2018Kavach\u2019 coverage plus overhauling existing signalling systems should be a national priority but cannot be considered a silver bullet.The long-standing delay in improving safety could be symptomatic of shortfalls in multiple areas. For example, the staff of the Railways matter for safety, too. Recent media reports have revealed deplorable working conditions for East Coast, Western, and Central Railways locomotive pilots, including 12-hour shifts, unhygienic resting facilities, and absence of toilets on engines. Even with \u2018Kavach\u2019, rail safety will require constant vigilance yet vigil is threatened by access to basic amenities competing for pilots\u2019 attention. Overall, the Railways\u2019 revenue growth has slowed while its dependence on budgetary allocation for capex has increased; its freight basket is dominated by coal (and thus vulnerable to the pressure on multiple sectors to decarbonise); both high-density routes and high-utilisation routes often report more than 100% network utilisation; and there are signs it has still to recover market share it lost during the COVID-19 pandemic to other passenger services. The Railways cannot improve safety in a vacuum but must address all these stressors in consonance. Finally, the government\u2019s response to recent accidents has included counter-terrorism investigators as well. While this is due diligence, their presence and involvement should neither distract India from the Railways\u2019 needs nor allow the government to hide behind a veil of secrecy.

        "full_article": "The Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to David Baker for succeeding in the seemingly impossible feat of building new proteins and to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper for solving the half-a-century old problem of predicting proteins\u2019 complex structures using an artificial intelligence (AI) model called AlphaFold that they developed. It used to take years of painstaking experiments to determine the 3D structure of a protein, which in many cases have only been partially determined. Determining structure is the first and most important step in determining protein function. Proteins are long ribbons in which the 20 different amino acid building blocks can be sequentially arranged to form innumerable combinations. Even if researchers know the sequence of amino acids in a ribbon, the ribbon can twist and fold in an astronomical number of possible shapes for each sequence, thereby making protein structure determination extremely challenging. For instance, if a protein consists of only 100 amino acids, the protein can assume at least 1,047 different 3D structures. Till a few years ago, of the 20,000-odd proteins found in humans, the structure of only a third was partially determined even experimentally. Hassabis and Jumper made protein structure prediction child\u2019s play. AlphaFold has now predicted the structure of almost all 200 million proteins from nearly a million species. Baker developed computerised methods to create proteins that did not previously exist and which, \u201cin many cases, have entirely new functions\u201d.In 2018, Hassabis and Jumper achieved an accuracy of 60% in predicting protein structure. In 2020, the AI model\u2019s performance was comparable with X-ray crystallography. Though still not perfect, the AI model estimates how correct the structure that has been produced is, allowing researchers to know the reliability of the prediction. The code for the AlphaFold model has been publicly available since 2021, and the AI tool has been used by more than two million people from 190 countries. Baker used his computer software Rosetta to generate new proteins that never existed naturally. Instead of predicting the protein structure based on amino acid sequences, he created new protein structures and used Rosetta to determine the amino acid sequence by searching a database of all known protein structures and looking for short fragments of proteins that had similarities with the desired structure. Rosetta then optimised these fragments and proposed an amino acid sequence. Like Hassabis and Jumper, Baker too made the code for Rosetta freely available so that researchers can develop the software and find new areas of application.

Investigations will eventually make the alleged killers\u2019 motives clear. The hitmen may have been Lawrence Bishnoi\u2019s. But, surely, \u2018friends with old foe Salman\u2019 is not entirely convincing a motive. The days ahead will perhaps clear the air, but for the political class, there is no shaking off the chilling effect of the murder. On the other hand, the days ahead may just foment fantastical conspiracy theories. High-profile political crime is narrative fodder.\nMumbai is no stranger to shootouts, or politicians being gunned down. But no matter how high the stakes in the upcoming assembly polls, such an ugly turn muddies poll waters, even if investigations show the killing or its timing had no overtly electoral motive. Crime in Mumbai has always been fairly secular, nexuses cutting across all party lines. In chatter already is the mid-1990s, when there were at least three Bombay constituencies influenced by dons \u2013 Chhota Rajan in Northeast Mumbai, Chhota Shakeel in South Mumbai and Arun Gawli in South Central. But it has been fairly assumed that the era of the underworld gunning for the political class was winding down, given not just the crackdown on mafia, but also politicians and vested interests having found a meeting ground of sorts. That Siddique was killed after having Y-level security, is scary \u2013 the assailants on foot effortlessly breached the protective cover.\u00a0\nAt the core of this time\u2019s electoral fight are redevelopment projects. The Dharavi redevelopment project is, CM Shinde hopes, his crown jewel. Siddique faced ED investigation in 2018 and properties worth a jaw-dropping \u20b9462cr were confiscated under PMLA on allegations he\u2019d misused his position as chair of the Maharashtra housing board. His switch in Feb to Ajit Pawar NCP, and Congress sacking his MLA son for \u2018anti-party activities\u2019, were grist for the rumour mills, for unsurprising reasons. Bombay\u2019s seasoned politicians know crime knows no community or creed. As the big guns look over their shoulders, expect a recalibration in each of the six parties in the fray. Shinde\u2019s first words were \u201ca gangwar-like\u201d situation had to be avoided at all costs. Opposition is lamenting Bombay\u2019s law & order situation.

But an increasing number of supposed \u2018health\u2019 foods, from sugar-free colas and cookies to sans-cholesterol snack, can do you more harm than good.\nA brand of zero-fat snack might bill itself as a super cholesterol buster that will not only not increase your count of the undesirable lipid, but if taken in sufficiently large quantities will actually bring it down to a number that rivals Donald Trump\u2019s IQ. But what is often left unsaid on the packaging is that while the product might be good for your cholesterol, its side effects could be bad for your BP, or your sodium intake, or your liver function.\nAs people become increasingly careful of what they ingest, a practice called \u2018health-washing\u2019 is reportedly becoming a market force.

Indian netas don\u2019t, but they sanction environmentally risky projects\nAhead of US presidential elections, a pair of hurricanes that has battered Americans in recent days is causing heated debates. Trump has slammed the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s rescue and relief operations. But what is making things more complex is the deluge of fake information that hurricanes Helene and Milton have brought in their wake.\nPolitics over hurricanes | Republican Trump supporters have been quick to spread conspiracy theories. They have accused the Biden-Harris administration of \u2018manipulating\u2019 the weather and \u2018sending\u2019 the hurricanes to Republican areas. Fake, AI-generated images of devastation have been used to create an impression of administrative apathy. Trump himself has repeated false claims about hurricane relief funds being spent on illegal migrants.\nDivided America | At the heart of the issue is the refusal of Trumpsters and other conservative Republicans to acknowledge the role of climate change in manifesting extreme weather. Scientific studies say climate change has made hurricanes more powerful and rainier. But the huge oil lobby in US would have one believe that it\u2019s all normal and any devastation wrought is due to official incompetence.\nIndian experience | Unlike rich US, India\u2019s disaster management response during cyclones has been praiseworthy. The impact of cyclone Nisarga, which hit India\u2019s west coast in 2020, was blunted with meticulous planning that saw 100,000 people being evacuated. During cyclone Fani in Bay of Bengal in 2019, a record 1.2mn people were evacuated in less than 48 hours. It helps there are no polarising debates about climate change in India. But govts across the board here continue to greenlight damaging actions that contribute to climate change. Be it parcelling off tracts of the Aravallis, the environmentally questionable Char Dham Pariyojana or tourist attractions in Western Ghats and Himalayas. Indian govts might be better at mitigating disasters, but they\u2019re also playing a role in creating them. \n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s Nobel Prize season. Since their inception in 1901, only 12 individuals of Indian origin have been awarded the Prize, with just five being Indian citizens. Among them, Dr C\u00a0V\u00a0Raman remains the sole Indian to have won in the science category, with his 1930 Nobel in Physics for the discovery of the Raman Effect.\nThe 94-year gap since Raman\u2019s achievement is concerning, especially when there have been Indian scientists who have made significant discoveries that went unrecognised. To position Indian scientists for future Nobel recognition, we must act now to foster an environment where ground-breaking research thrives.\nScience is the foundation of all technological advancement. The mobile phone which everyone uses today would not have been possible without at least a dozen Nobel Prize-winning discoveries behind it.\u00a0 Be it the transistor (1956, Physics), laser technology (1964, Physics), information theory (1965, Physics), integrated circuit (2000, Physics), conducting polymers (2000, Chemistry), semiconductor heterostructures (2000, Physics), fibre optics (2009, Physics), LED technology (2014, Physics), lithium-ion battery (2019, Chemistry), etc., each of these discoveries and several others were critical for the modern revolution we see in consumer electronics.\nIt\u2019s vital to remember that countries don\u2019t invest in science because they are developed; they become developed because they invest in science. Here are five steps to improve India\u2019s scientific output and pave the way for future Nobel laureates.\n1. Check engg rush and focus on STEM education:\u00a0Nobel Prizes frequently honour fundamental contributions that change entire fields of study. A strong foundation in basic research can unlock technologies that transform industries that drive today\u2019s digital world. To achieve this, India must focus on identifying and nurturing scientific talent early on. Providing scholarships, strong mentorship programs, and opportunities for research will ensure that gifted young minds are cultivated. We need to revive and scale-up schemes such as the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) in addition to launching significant other initiatives for identifying gifted children early on in schools. The current rush toward engineering careers \u2014 often at the expense of scientific curiosity \u2014 should be checked to allow students to pursue their strengths in pure sciences.\n2. Stop the brain drain:\u00a0India\u2019s scientific community remains significantly smaller compared to global standards. With only 260 scientists per million people, India ranks 81st globally in terms of researchers. In contrast, countries like the US and the UK have over 4,000 scientists per million. To improve India\u2019s chances of winning Nobels, expanding the number of researchers is essential. This will require a concerted effort to retain talent and prevent brain drain. Many promising Indian scientists leave for better opportunities abroad due to inadequate infrastructure, low salaries, and limited career prospects at home. The recent removal of financial incentives for high-performing scientists through awards and recognitions is a misguided step. Unlike other professions, the global nature of science means that scientists, regardless of their location, must compete with the best worldwide for their work to be recognised and accepted. To retain and motivate these talented individuals, it is crucial to treat them differently from other professions. China, for example, has set a good example in incentivising scientists to attract and retain top talent.\n3. Increase investment and build world-class research institutions:\u00a0America has invested heavily in science and deservedly reaps the rewards. It now has far more Nobels than any other country (see chart). Currently, India\u2019s allocation of funds to scientific research as a percentage of GDP remains lower than that of even other BRICS nations. A stronger commitment to research and development funding, both from the govt and private sector, is needed to fuel Nobel-level discoveries. India must focus on supporting its Centers of Excellence and creating new ones where cutting-edge research can flourish.\n4. Encourage international collabs: Many Nobel-winning discoveries are the result of collaborations across disciplines and borders. India must actively promote international collaborations by enabling its brightest minds to work with leading scientists worldwide, including Nobel laureates. We need to launch a \u20181000 Scholar Programme\u2019 to encourage our young scientists and students to intern with top research groups and Nobel laureates across the globe. Such initiatives will help bring the latest scientific techniques and knowledge to India.\n5. Don\u2019t play it safe:\u00a0One of the key barriers to producing Nobel-level research in India is the lack of a strong culture of risk-taking and innovation. Scientists are often encouraged to pursue safe, incremental research for the sake of securing research funding, rather than bold, high-risk projects that may lead to revolutionary discoveries. Excessive bureaucratisation of research management is another matter of concern in India.\nIf we want to join the prestigious Nobel club, it\u2019s time we made the effort.\nProf\u00a0Rao\u00a0is vice-chancellor for the BITS Pilani group of institutions and former director of IIT Delhi.

        "full_article": "Syed Waliullah's (1922-1971) debut novel Lal Shalu drew significant attention upon its release but faced mixed reviews, including outright rejection. Since then, it has been translated into multiple languages, adapted for the stage, and made into a film. Today, it is regarded as the first major modern novel by a Bengali Muslim writer.\nWaliullah, a novelist, short story writer, and playwright, was influenced by world literature, yet much of his work centred on the Bengali Muslim experience. Despite spending much of his life abroad, he captured the authentic experiences of Muslims in Bengal with remarkable precision. Before he began writing the novel, Waliullah was an aspiring writer and student, who wrote to Syed Afshar Uddin Ahmad, editor-in-charge of Sawgat, expressing his passion for writing about the 'Muslim Samaj.' His first novel reflects this ambition.\nWriting Lal Shalu\nSyed Waliullah published Lal Shalu at the age of 26. His first book, Nayanchara, a collection of short stories, was released in Calcutta in 1944 while he was still a student. Though he began writing Lal Shalu in Calcutta, he completed it in Dhaka after migrating due to the Partition of Bengal in 1947. The Partition, marked by famine, disease, religiously driven mass migration, and riots, created immense tension. During this turbulent period, Waliullah produced several significant short stories, including the renowned Ekti Tulasi Gachher Kahini (A Tulsi Plant's Tale), a distinguished work of Partition literature.\nUnlike many novels of the time, Lal Shalu was published directly as a book rather than first appearing in periodicals. After completing the draft, Waliullah would read sections at Ajit Guha's home in Wari, Dhaka, where literature enthusiasts gathered. He welcomed constructive criticism and was willing to revise the text based on feedback.\nThe novel was published in June 1948 by Comrade Publishers in Dhaka, entirely funded by Waliullah himself. Out of 2,000 printed copies, only about 200 were sold, with the remainder discarded as waste paper, leaving Waliullah with a financial loss. According to Syed Abul Maqsud, Waliullah had limited opportunities to promote the book as he moved to Karachi shortly after its release and faced difficulties in finding distributors.\nIn 1961, Syed Waliullah was awarded the newly established Bangla Academy Award, a highly prestigious honour at the time. Lal Shalu was translated into Urdu in 1960 and French in 1963, likely boosting its popularity. When Kathabitan Publications released the second edition in 1960, the novel gained widespread recognition, with six editions published within just seven years. The English translation, Tree Without Roots (1967), was supported by UNESCO and is best described as a transcreation by Waliullah himself, who also designed the cover. The novel's inclusion in school textbooks as a rapid reader further increased its recognition after its initial release.\nA.K. Nazmul Karim, a lifelong friend and sociologist, reflected on Waliullah's shift from short story writer to novelist, recalling their deep literary discussions during the creation of Lal Shalu. He wrote:\nWaliullah often expressed his desire to move beyond short stories and venture into novel writing, emphasising that his novel had to be grounded in realism. While in Calcutta, he worked at The Statesman, but, finding no similar newspaper in Dhaka, he took a government job at Radio Pakistan. We frequently met after work, where he passionately discussed his determination to lead a new wave of literary creation in East Pakistan. Our conversations often also included reflections on my studies in social science and rural life.\nThe opening section of Lal Shalu highlights what Nazmul Karim described as Waliullah's sharp observational skills in depicting rural life and its complexities. In this passage, Waliullah vividly portrays the intricate social fabric of Bengali Muslim village life, focusing more on narrative than dialogue. He explores the community's challenges, such as poor agricultural output, an overdependence on religious practices, and the reasons behind migration. This is encapsulated in one of the novel's most memorable lines: \"There are more tupis (prayer caps) than crops, and the bushes grow thicker than religion.\" Characters like Majeed, who uses his limited self-taught knowledge of Islam to build a career as a Pir, exemplify the complex social structures Waliullah sought to portray in the village of Mahabbatnagar. This complexity is symbolically reflected in the central image of Lal Shalu\u2014the red cloth draped over the Mazar.\nThe Plot of Lal Shalu\n\nThe story of Lal Shalu opens with Majeed's dramatic arrival in the village of Mahabbatnagar. Before this, he had been forced to leave his own village due to food shortages caused by overpopulation, harsh natural conditions, and river erosion\u2014similar to the situation in the Noakhali region where Waliullah's father was born.\nMajeed spent some time in the Garo Hills, working as a muezzin, trying to \"enlighten\" the \"illiterate\" and \"infidel\" locals. His life there was lonely and difficult, prompting him to move on, eventually settling in Mahabbatnagar. Upon arriving, he claimed an abandoned and dilapidated grave, declaring it to be the resting place of Modaccher Pir, asserting that he had been sent by the Pir himself through a dream.\nThe villagers, having long neglected the grave, were chastised by Majeed for their irreligious behaviour. Feeling guilty and repentant, they accepted Majeed's claim and were grateful that the grave of such a revered figure had been rediscovered. They quickly cleared the jungle around the grave, transforming it into a Mazar. With Majeed's guidance, the village saw improved agricultural yields and began practicing Islam more devoutly. His influence soon became central to the villagers' lives, with the Mazar serving as a hub for religious activity and social interactions.\nStrategically, Majeed formed an alliance with Khalekh Bepari, the village's most powerful figure, who controlled large tracts of land and wielded authority over local affairs. This partnership was mutually beneficial, as it allowed them to share power, with Khalekh overseeing worldly matters while Majeed presided over religious life. Together, they exerted significant influence, creating a balance between spiritual and practical leadership within the community.\nMajeed was ruthless and a master strategist, always prepared to eliminate any threat to his dominance. One of his boldest moves was to delegitimize a rival Pir who regularly visited nearby villages after harvest. Majeed exposed this Pir's un-Islamic practices, thereby tightening his control over Mahabbatnagar. A more subtle challenge came from Akkash, who sought to establish a school to modernise the rural population. During a village meeting to discuss Akkash's proposal, Majeed swiftly undermined him by questioning his authority, even pointing out that he lacked a beard. This effectively silenced Akkash, preventing him from voicing his plans. Instead, Majeed proposed building a grand mosque, encouraging the villagers to contribute either financially or through their labour, a suggestion that was enthusiastically accepted. However, two key events\u2014the rival Pir's arrival and Akkash's school proposal\u2014are notably omitted from the English translation Tree Without Roots.\nMajeed's wife, Rahima, was deeply loyal, viewing him not only as a powerful Pir but also as an exceptional husband. As a childless woman, she once expressed a desire to adopt Hashunirma's child, but Majeed disapproved, arguing that without a blood connection, adoption held no real value. Although he often desired Hashunirma, he restrained himself. Despite his elevated position and twelve years of dedicated effort, Majeed frequently felt insecure about his future and his accomplishments, haunted by an underlying sense of unease.\nUltimately, Majeed married Jamila in his quest for children, hoping to find fulfilment in his family life, economic ventures, and religious aspirations. However, the most unexpected challenge he faced came from Jamila in ways he could never have foreseen. After overcoming numerous external obstacles, Majeed now found himself grappling with internal conflicts following the arrival of his young wife.\nJamila was a joyful and vibrant woman who laughed openly and formed a warm bond with her co-wife, Rahima. She had a habit of going to bed early, which Majeed disapproved of, prompting him to pressure her into performing her Namaz regularly. Determined to exert control over her, Majeed leveraged his authority as the custodian of the Mazar to impose religious duties upon her. While Jamila did not intentionally defy Majeed, his attempts to dominate her ignited a rebellious spirit within her, albeit without any clear strategy. Throughout the story, Jamila never addressed Majeed directly, choosing instead to communicate through Rahima.\nIn a dramatic turn of events, even Rahima, Majeed's most loyal follower, dared to defy his orders when Jamila's life was at stake. Despite Majeed's insistence on prioritising the harvest, Rahima chose to prioritise Jamila's safety after Majeed had cruelly punished her by forcing her to spend an entire night alone in the Mazar during a natural disaster. In an act of protest, Jamila spat in Majeed's face\u2014an instinctive reaction that shattered his sense of control and symbolised the collapse of his external authority. The novel concludes with the ominous onset of heavy rains, thunderstorms, and the looming threat of catastrophic floods, foreshadowing Majeed's final reckoning with the self-deceptions he had constructed around himself.\nStyle and reception\n\nWaliullah masterfully depicts characters, events, and the natural world, all while subtly weaving in a positivist undercurrent when Majeed briefly contemplates exposing the Mazar as a fabrication. Majeed believes that if he reveals the truth, the villagers will recognise their folly, prompting him to consider leaving the village altogether. He is often taken aback by the sight of the Mazar, which he perceives as resembling the \"rear of a fish,\" standing as a testament to what he has achieved through deceit. This portrayal has led many readers to interpret the novel as a tale of a false Pir exploiting an uneducated rural Muslim community in Bengal for personal gain through a contrived Mazar.\nPoet Ahasan Habib wrote one of the earliest and most critical reviews of Lal Shalu, asserting that Waliullah attained the status of a first-class writer through this work. He particularly praised Waliullah's portrayal of Muslim life, highlighting the frustration and deprivation reflected in the mentality of the main protagonist, Majeed. He wrote:\nThe hallmark of a great artist is the ability to present their creation in its diversity and entirety. Majeed is portrayed as a complex figure, driven by greed and anger; while his ambitions stem from self-interest, his confusion in relationships is equally pronounced. He longs for a fulfilling life\u2014one abundant in love, affection, and wealth. To grasp how he strives to achieve his desires, one must consider not only Majeed's intentions but also the heart of a decaying society. Despite the reprehensible nature of Majeed's methods, he elicits a sense of pity, as the underlying tragedy of his life resonates deeply. This is where the skill of the character creator truly shines. Although Jamila's presence is fleeting, she is the lifeblood of Lal Shalu, and it is uncertain whether the novel would have endured without her.\nAhasan Habib recognised the importance of community and setting in Lal Shalu, which Waliullah vividly depicted. However, he contended that the writer's lack of deeper insight prevented him from fully capturing the entirety of human life in the novel. Nevertheless, Habib emphasised that Lal Shalu is undeniably the first historically systematic novel about the Muslim community authored by a Muslim writer.\nInterestingly, Waliullah spent little time living in villages throughout his life, making it all the more surprising how accurately he portrayed the deeply rural existence of Bengali Muslims. As a keen observer and a natural writer, he grasped the dynamics of village life through careful study, as noted by Nazmul Karim.\nIn 1954, Waliullah wrote to Anne-Marie Thibaud, asserting that it was unnecessary to reside in a village to write about village life; instead, he believed he could critically observe and articulate the experiences of the villagers from a distance. He understood their economic challenges, history, formation, future, and potential without living among them. Had he resided in the village, he would not have aimed to present mere literal or photographic representations of their lives. This perspective illustrates how he understood village life in East Bengal in his novel Lal Shalu, suggesting that his portrayal transcended personal experiences. In describing the essence of Waliullah's inner thoughts, Anne-Marie wrote of her beloved husband:\nAs a universal citizen, Waliullah viewed all world literature as his own, whether it was the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, the French philosopher Voltaire, or the Bengali poet Tagore. He absorbed their ideas and methods, applying them to his culture and the Muslim peasants of East Bengal. Through his writings, he endeavoured to eradicate poverty and backwardness among his countrymen. He once told me, \"I am a free person; the entire world is mine, whether the universe accepts me or not.\"\nNotably, Rashid Karim, a contemporary novelist of Waliullah, contended that the initial section of Lal Shalu was unnecessary, asserting that the novel would be an unblemished work of art\u2014Waliullah's finest\u2014without it. While most critics viewed the novel as a tale of a fraudulent Pir deceiving ignorant and impoverished rural people, who were blinded by their daily Islamic practices, he vehemently disagreed with this conventional interpretation. Rashid Karim believed that the villagers were neither as na\u00efve nor as easily duped as many suggested. Instead, they perceived Majeed's performative actions as a welcome change from their monotonous daily lives. He also emphasised that the most original aspect of Lal Shalu was its exploration of the complexities of man-woman relationships, a theme that Waliullah handled with remarkable precision.\nInterestingly, Anne-Marie Thibaud recalls their visit to Chattogram in 1969-70, during which a party was held in Waliullah's honour at a restaurant. A waiter at the restaurant approached him, asking, \"Are you the writer of Lal Shalu?\" This unexpected recognition filled him with pride. Yet, even 75 years after its publication, Lal Shalu continues to inspire more nuanced and intriguing interpretations.\nPriyam Pritim Paul\u00a0is a journalist and researcher.\n",

        "full_article": "The recommendation by a government committee to raise the entry age limit for public service jobs to 35 for men and 37 for women marks a major step in addressing a long-standing demand of some jobseekers. If implemented, this could provide relief to aspirants whose educational or career paths have been delayed due to various factors, such as the pandemic, economic downturn, political harassment, backlogs in public-sector recruitment, etc. However, while the proposal serves to address immediate concerns, it may open up new challenges that the government should carefully navigate to ensure that any decision aligns with our broader economic goals.\nIn Bangladesh, around 90 percent of employment is in the informal sector, while public and formal private sector jobs cover the remaining 10 percent. The growing fascination with public-sector jobs has as much to do with the struggling and largely stagnant private job market as with the security and benefits that come with public jobs, especially since the 2015 pay scale increase. However, the public sector, representing less than 5 percent of total employment, cannot accommodate the large number of jobseekers, leading to frequent demands for removing quota (which has been met) and raising the entry age limit. The last time the age ceiling was raised\u2014from 27 years to 30\u2014was in 1991.\n\nThe growing fascination with public-sector jobs has as much to do with the struggling and largely stagnant private job market as with the security and benefits that come with public jobs, especially since the 2015 pay scale increase. However, the public sector, representing less than 5 percent of total employment, cannot accommodate the large number of jobseekers, leading to frequent demands for removing quota (which has been met) and raising the entry age limit.\nAgainst this backdrop, the recommendation\u2014which may be placed before the Advisory Council for the final nod\u2014has been welcomed by some so long as it is approached as a \"temporary\" solution. Their guarded reaction can be attributed to several concerns. First, while it is understandable why a section of jobseekers would want the entry age to be raised, it is unfortunate that such a policy shift should occur under pressure rather than guided by research. Another concern is the potential swelling of the applicant pool, making it even harder to manage the recruitment process efficiently. There is also a concern that the accommodation of older candidates could further exacerbate the youth unemployment problem and discourage entrepreneurial pursuits for extended periods. The likelihood that raising the entry age may lead to a corresponding increase in the retirement age\u2014currently 59\u2014has also raised some concerns.\nGiven the circumstances, some experts have suggested a time-bound approach\u2014such as raising the age limit for a few rounds of the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) exams\u2014that would allow the government to evaluate the impact of the change without committing to permanent reforms. This makes sense from a practical point of view, as updating or streamlining all decisions related to recruitment, retirement and pension eligibility requires proper planning and preparation. Those arguing in favour of greater flexibility in the job entry limit, or removing it altogether, in line with the practices of some countries, also have a point. This is a direction that could help an administration aspiring to be meritocratic.\nThat said, we must recognise that the real problem for us is not the age limit or lack thereof, but the lack of jobs in general. High unemployment and insecurity in the private sector are driving more and more candidates towards government jobs, creating a very unhealthy and unsustainable environment. So, we urge the government to approach this issue as part of wider economic and administrative reforms that can fulfil the nation's aspirations for a more dynamic and inclusive job market as well as an efficient, people-centred civil service.\n",

        "full_article": "Following the July-August mass uprising, almost all service organisations, corporations, administrative bodies, and government offices in the country are experiencing significant changes, reshuffling, and overhauls. Previously stifled voices are now being heard, and we expect a new Bangladesh to emerge from the wreckage left behind by the Awami League government. The extent of embezzlement is staggering. Any honest person who envisions what could have happened if this money had been invested into the economy can't help but feel enraged by the fallen regime.\nTowards the end of the regime, Salman F Rahman, the former adviser to the former prime minister on private industry and investment, spearheaded an attempt to purchase 10 new aircraft from Airbus. The intent was brazenly clear: to embezzle funds. That chapter is now closed. It's time to look forward and build a new Biman founded on professionalism, efficiency, transparency, and accountability.\nThe aviation industry experienced an unprecedented lull during the Covid pandemic, followed by a tremendous boom. Despite this, Biman has underperformed, especially considering it has a relatively young fleet.\nIn the aviation business, the margin for error is extremely narrow. A single poor decision can lead to total chaos for any airline. An accident can damage an airline's brand image so severely that it may take months to regain passenger confidence. Building a brand is a slow and painstaking process, but it can ensure a return on investment. For effective branding of Biman, key areas require attention.\n\nA major complaint against Biman is its poor \"on-time performance\". In the recent past, the importance of punctuality has been largely ignored. The airline's vision and mission do not appear to be clearly communicated to its employees and departments. A concerted effort is essential to ensure flights are dispatched on time.\nAircraft serviceability is one of the most important areas for profit maximisation. Aircrafts must be serviceable and in good condition, including in-flight entertainment systems. An aircraft that sits idle is useless unless the airline's operations are so inefficient that it is cheaper to keep aircrafts grounded.\nAnother issue that needs focus is efficiency, which is essential in every aspect of the airline, from marketing and sales to dispatch, engineering, maintenance, pilots, and cabin crew. Investment in efficient human resources and systems is never wasted and is crucial to achieving efficiency. As such, it is essential to emphasise proper recruitment and training, especially of managers.\nA positive work environment is critical. Disengaged employees can cause significant losses. Responsibility and ownership are key contributors to an airline's brand image and efficiency. We need empathetic, knowledgeable managers. Certain problematic individuals must be removed from sensitive positions immediately.\n\nModern aircraft have the unique ability to communicate their health status to engineers, even mid-flight. However, we often fail to take advantage of this technology due to inadequate spare parts provisioning. Delaying repairs because of cost-cutting can be disastrous. Aircraft should not be left idle for days due to a lack of necessary parts.\u00a0The prospect of providing maintenance to more foreign carriers may be explored to expand the spares pool.\nMany of our international flights include short segments, such as Dhaka-Sylhet or Dhaka-Chattogram, before proceeding to the ultimate destination, which highly increases operating expenses. These short flights waste valuable engine, landing gear and auxiliary power unit (APU) cycles. A better strategy would be to operate point-to-point international routes, like Dhaka to Dubai, Dubai to Chattogram, then Chattogram to Jeddah and so on. This would not only avoid unproductive short sectors but also save on engine, landing gear, and APU cycles. The short-sector flights are choking off domestic operators. The national carrier should not monopolise the market at the expense of underperformance.\nCrew shortages should not hinder expansion or planning. Recruitment should be regular and recruitment numbers should be manageable within a set timeframe. Currently, because of crew shortage, and the reluctance of crew to stay over in Sylhet and Chattogram, direct flights from these cities cannot be operated. Inadequate crew numbers do not allow crew to take time off to attend to personal matters. Aspiring young pilots should be given the opportunity to join Biman, and current pilots who meet the requirements should be promoted in due time.\n\nBiman is a relatively small airline with few airplanes. So, it is very important to take advantage of any opportunity to optimise operations that come our way. For instance, the decision to procure Boeing 787s, despite their delayed delivery, was influenced by the ability of pilots to fly both Boeing 787s and 777s simultaneously. However, when the 787s arrived, the crew for both aircraft types were segregated, causing problems in planning issues and crew dissatisfaction. There are also issues with aircraft allocation in different routes that should be revisited.\nBiman must immediately focus on future fleet planning based on pragmatic business solutions and operational needs. Failing to plan ahead will lead to major operational problems. We are already in a stage where aircraft shortage is inevitable.\nAnother area is communicating delays. We often see passengers getting agitated at the holding area because of a lack of information regarding delays. Passengers readily accept a delay of less than 30 minutes or even more if they are updated about it along with the reasons. Biman traffic personnel needs training on providing updated delay messages to passengers without exception. Any delay of more than 15 minutes must be communicated to the passengers.\nLastly, sufficient executive power must be granted to the managing director and chief executive officer to hold them accountable for decisions. In recent years, the board and its subcommittees made almost all decisions, leaving central management unaccountable. This led to unnecessary delays, and in some cases, decisions were rendered ineffective by the time they were made.\nProper brainstorming will bring forth many more steps that can be taken for the advancement of Biman and improve its brand image.\nCaptain A M Maqsood Ahmed\u00a0is captain of Boeing 777 with Bangladesh Biman and a former member of the fleet planning committee, that did the groundwork for the purchase of 10 new generation Boeing aircraft.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Poverty, food insecurity, and malnourishment are significant and persistent problems in Bangladesh, with millions of low- and middle-income households across the country affected by some degree of hunger or malnourishment. In fact it would not be an exaggeration to say that ensuring food security for all citizens is the most pressing challenge facing Bangladesh amidst a growing population, economic slowdown and stubbornly high inflation. Against this backdrop, the report that Bangladesh has slipped three notches in the 2024 Global Hunger Index is worrisome. Bangladesh is now ranked 84th out of 125 countries, alongside nations with a 'moderate level of hunger.'According to the global report, jointly published by Ireland-based Concern Worldwide and Germany-based Welthungerhilfe, some 11.9 per cent of Bangladesh's population is undernourished, meaning that they do not get enough food to meet their daily calorie needs. The most unfortunate victims of poverty are the innocent and vulnerable children. As the report shows, nearly one-fourth or 23.6 per cent of Bangladeshi children below five are stunted or too short for their age due to chronic malnutrition. Besides, a staggering 11 per cent of children under five are described as wasted, indicating that they have a low weight for their height, with 2.9 per cent of such children dying before reaching their fifth birthday. The World Food Programme estimates that 24 per cent of the country's population and 46 per cent of impoverished households face food insecurity. The statistics may not fully reflect the situation on the ground, but they are staggering enough to warrant immediate action.Food insecurity is not about the scarcity of food. In Bangladesh, the greatest obstacles to food security stem from the unaffordability caused by widespread poverty and limited access to food due to inflation and unstable income sources. Prolonged economic stagnation, driven by both external shocks and internal political turmoil, along with frequent natural disasters, has worsened the situation. The double-digit food inflation over the past three years has had a profound impact, leaving more households food-insecure. This highlights that hunger is not an inevitable outcome; it is largely the result of human actions, shaped by a combination of political conflict, economic disruptions, climate extremes, poverty, and inequality. For a country like Bangladesh, the fight against hunger is complex, with no quick solutions. It requires a coordinated response from the government, non-governmental organisations, and the global community to eradicate poverty and address inequality. No one expects immediate change, but a determined step to eradicate poverty and hunger must be taken now. The interim government has a unique opportunity to begin adjusting policies towards more pro-poor, inclusive growth. There is also a need for increasing allocation and widening the coverage of social safety net programmes. Revamping the agricultural marketing system to ensure fair prices for farmers and growers will also help alleviate poverty in rural areas. Moreover, implementing school feeding programmes for underprivileged children can help combat malnutrition among poor children. There are some other hidden factors in poverty alleviation which are not discussed much. The social climate of a region or family matters, and families which follow liberal customs, adopt contraception and allow women to work outdoors will find it easier to free themselves from grinding poverty. The problem of poverty is as much economic as it is social.",

        "full_article": "The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an organisation created in 1933 at the call of Albert Einstein, helps rebuild lives of people devastated by disasters and conflict. It claims that farmlands destroyed by droughts and floods attributable to global warming and climate change are leading to global food insecurity. As a result, food prices are expected to rise 20 per cent globally by 2050. These issues including conflicts are a key factor behind manmade food crisis contributing to global hunger. IRC's report published in mid-August this year says that 1 in every 11 people in the world are going hungry and that 757 million people could not afford the food required for maintaining their basic health in 2023. As far as malnutrition and hunger are concerned, they go hand in hand. In fact, malnutrition is about the lack of required amount of carbohydrate and protein in the human body where former is the source of energy and the latter being the driver of physical growth (of a human body) including development of its brain.Around 45 million children under the age of 5 go hungry and hence suffer from acute malnutrition globally. And half of the children who die from hunger (about 2 million annually) are actually victims of acute malnutrition. Though malnutrition is treatable, only one out of five affected children get the required treatment.IRC further informs that global hunger has been reduced in the last 50 years. That means 1 in 11 persons (9 per cent of the world population) are hungry today whereas in 1970 the proportion was 24 per cent, that is, 1 in every 4 persons was hungry in 1970. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report published in July last by five UN specialised agencies in the context of G20 Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty Task Force Ministerial Meeting in Brazil, on the other hand, warned that the mission to achieve SDGs, particularly (SDG) 2, which aims to attain zero hunger by 2030, is significantly falling short of the target. The report shows that far from making a gain (in the fight against hunger), the world has rather lost 15 years so much so that the present level of global malnourishment is comparable to what it was in 2008-2009. Except some progress made in areas like stunting and exclusive breastfeeding (first six months in the life of a child when it is fed only breastmilk), an alarmingly large number of people across the globe are suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition as no progress could be made in the past three years in this area. The result has been that between 713 and 757 million were left undernourished in 2023. Region-wise, the number of hungry people is rising in Africa, while it is said to be stable in Asia. However, according to an estimate, in 2023, 19.1 per cent of the South Asian population was severely food insecure with 15.6 per cent being undernourished, the highest rate in the Asia Pacific region. Another piece of bad news is that one-third of the world's stunted children live in South Asia. And 25 million South Asian children are wasting which means they are too thin for their height. The reasons include poor level of nutritious food intake, illness, maternal malnutrition and low birthweight. Since Bangladesh is part of South Asia, what is the picture of hunger and malnutrition here?The Global Hunger Index (GHI), a measure of hunger globally, regionally and country-wise and prepared by European NGOs including the Concern Worldwide of Ireland and Welthungerhilfe of Germany, ranked Bangladesh 84th out of 127 countries in 2024 with a score of 19.4. According to the GHI scale that ranges from 0 or hunger-free to 100 (worst possible condition of hunger), Bangladesh's position on the hunger scale is termed moderate. However, last year's performance when it was ranked 81 st with a score of 19, Bangladesh has evidently fared worse than the previous year. What is important to note at this point is that the scores (especially, for child wasting and child stunting) on which the HGI for 2024 is based were not collected in 2024 (actually, those were gathered between 2019 and 2023). Notably, the values of the four component indicators of the GHI score are 11.9 per cent for undernourishment, which means 11.9 per cent of the country's population are undernourished. Worse yet, 23.6 per cent of the country's children under five are stunted, while 11 per cent of the children under 5 are wasted. What is heart-breaking about this report is that 2.9 per cent of the children in Bangladesh die before their 5th birthday.Disheartening as these figures for the components of GHI score for 2024 are, Bangladesh has still fared better than India and Pakistan. But that is cold comfort seeing that there is no letup in the inflation rate rise with attendant food price hike. Together the condition is being made harder for the low-income and, in some cases, the lower segment of the middle income people, to feed their children necessary nutritious diets to avoid stunting or wasting. Though harm to farmlands due to natural calamities including floods and droughts are a factor behind the overall food insecurity, it is not exactly the amount of food crops damaged annually that is main cause of hunger in Bangladesh. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), food insecurity in Bangladesh is attributable mostly to extreme poverty. And that poverty has to do with unemployment and underemployment and the marginal farmers' inadequate access to land to cultivate and social exclusion. Of course, natural disasters also play its part in the process of their pauperisation, but that is not the only reason for their poverty and the lack of access to foods that could keep them and their children healthy.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement has sparked significant debate on how it will affect employment opportunities for various demographic groups, including marginalised communities. The reform seeks to reshape the long-standing quota system in government jobs, which currently allocates a portion of positions to specific groups such as women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities. While the intention is to ensure fair competition and merit-based employment, the reform could have mixed impacts.For marginalised communities, the removal or reduction of quotas might limit their access to government jobs, which have been a key pathway to social mobility. These communities often face systemic barriers such as inadequate education and limited resources, making it challenging for them to compete on a purely merit-based system. Without reserved quotas, they could struggle to secure employment in an already competitive job market.On the other hand, the reform could create more opportunities for qualified candidates from the general population, particularly those who feel disadvantaged by the existing system. Many argue that a merit-based system would promote fairness and reward individual achievement, fostering a more competitive workforce.To strike a balance, it is crucial for policymakers to ensure that any reform maintains support for marginalised groups while promoting meritocracy. Comprehensive educational and training programmes are essential to enable underrepresented communities to compete on an equal footing. This will ensure that the reform leads to a more inclusive and equitable job market for all.\nRounak ShahrierStudentNorth South University[email\u00a0protected]",

The hypocenter of the bombing was Hiroshima, Japan. Commercial buildings, homes, and structures were destroyed instantly, 140,000 people died, and countless others were seriously injured. Biodiversity was devastated. Just three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, where 70,000 people perished, and thousands were injured, many of whom later died from the bomb's aftereffects.Yet some survivors of the nuclear attacks are still alive, bearing the painful memories. These survivors are called the Hibakusha. They founded the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, commonly known as Nihon Hidankyo. This non-profit organiwation, established in 1956 with its headquarters in Tokyo, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2024.Since its founding, the Hibakusha have been at the forefront of a global movement to eliminate nuclear weapons. There have been longstanding calls for a nuclear-free world, and Sweden's Nobel Peace Prize Committee responded to these calls, stating, \"The Hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons.\"Keiko Ogura, one of the Hibakusha, was only eight years old in 1945. I had the honour of meeting this living legend and nuclear weapon survivor at the Global Citizenship and Peace seminar in Hiroshima, Japan, in 2023, organised by the International Network of Universities. During her speech, Ms. Ogura posed critical questions to the audience: \"Why do many countries still stockpile nuclear weapons? How will peace come to the world?\" She made a heartfelt promise, stating, \"I want to see a world free of nuclear weapons before I die.\"Through personal testimonies like Ogura's, Nihon Hidankyo has made significant contributions to educating the public about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, embodying the motto: \"No more Hibakusha.\"Like every peace-loving nation in the world, we hope for a future free of nuclear weapons, where peace can prevail for all.\nMihir Halder, Instructor (General)Primary Teachers Training Institute, Khulna[email\u00a0protected]",
