While both these conferences can trace their origins to the Rio summit of 1992, the CBD does not get anywhere near the media attention COP commands. There are no world leaders and heads of state making grandiloquent commitments because the CBD largely continues to be framed as an \u2018environmentalist\u2019 concern, much like what COP used to be, until the forces of capitalism managed to reimagine the idea of a planet being inexorably slow-cooked in greenhouse gases to one that may yet be saved by renewable energy sources \u2014 and at the very least \u2014 make some entrepreneurs rich.Unlike cyclones and melting glaciers that have become visual aids to bring home the climate crisis wrought by invisible gases, biodiversity loss continues to be largely invisible despite its victims being extremely visible. Based on current trends, the UN reckons, an estimated 34,000 plant and 5,200 animal species, including one in eight of the world\u2019s bird species, face extinction. About 30% of breeds of main farm animal species are currently at high risk of extinction. Forests are home to much of the known terrestrial biodiversity, but about 45% of the earth\u2019s original forests are gone, cleared mostly during the past century. Yet, because much of this extinction is not finely accounted for as the rise in per capita carbon emissions or temperature swings, it fails to evoke the urgency it deserves. In this light, India\u2019s stance, i.e., of not wanting hard targets on proposals such as reducing the use of pesticides, given that their effects on impacting biodiversity are documented, and conserving 30% of land and sea, seems anachronistic particularly when it sees itself as a champion of conservation and living in harmony with nature. While India, adopting a negotiating tack from climate conferences, has argued that different nations have differing levels of responsibility towards biodiversity conservation (which requires richer nations to be more generous funders of global conservation efforts), it is well known that such demands are a dead end unless countries agree to definite targets. What cannot be measured, as the adage goes, cannot be understood or addressed. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Executive Secretary of the CBD, has described the negotiations as one that should result in a \u201cParis moment for nature\u201d; while this was not quite what happened, countries have agreed on preparing concrete road maps by 2024 and the richer ones, committing $30 billion an annum by 2030. But seeing tangible outcomes is a long time away.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations (climate change)\n\n/\n\nenvironmental issues\n\n/\n\ncarbon emissions",

On a delirious Sunday night at Doha\u2019s Lusail Stadium, it was Lionel Messi\u2019s turn to dominate and clinch the FIFA World Cup for Argentina. This was a summit clash for the ages as France twice reversed the deficit to draw level at 3-3 before Argentina prevailed at 4-2 in the penalties. Having seen 35 summers and multiple heart-breaks in his previous four World Cups, the latest final offered Messi one last chance at wresting the cup that was previously secured for Argentina by the great Diego Maradona in the 1986 Mexico edition. A nation\u2019s expectations, the world\u2019s gaze and his teammates yearning for the greatest trophy, all rested on Messi\u2019s magical feet. It is always difficult for an individual to flourish within a team-sport. It needs synergy, a common desire and an equitable distribution of skill sets. Messi prospered in his previous stint with FC Barcelona, has won four Champions League titles, seven Ballon d\u2019Or awards, led Argentina to a Copa America triumph and yet the World Cup remained elusive until Sunday\u2019s pulsating final against a doughty rival thriving on Kylian Mbappe\u2019s exploits. Through this World Cup and despite the shock loss to Saudi Arabia in its first match, Argentina found a throbbing spine in Messi.The captain was the indulgent patriarch, scoring goals but more importantly setting up assists that were soaked in magic realism. The pass to Nahuel Molina against the Netherlands and the way he sold a dummy to Croatian defender Josko Gvardiol before setting up Julian Alvarez, were incredible efforts that took the mesmerised opposition by surprise and fed the adulatory anticipation of his teammates. In the final, Messi was in the thick of action luring the defenders before blessing his fellow strikers with quick crosses. Di Maria, like Alvarez in the previous games, could weave in. Yet, in a match that witnessed Argentina\u2019s possessional superiority, France deserves credit for the way a comeback was executed. Mbappe and Messi, who turn out for Paris Saint-Germain FC, as expected dictated the flow of the game. Maradona, who died two years ago, and an ailing Pele have ideal successors in Messi and Mbappe. In a World Cup lit up by the exploits of African and Asian countries with an upset always around the corner, Argentina and France showed that pedigreed teams can last the distance through resilience and a hint of magic, like the one that shimmered from the boots of Messi and Mbappe.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\n/\n\nQatar\n\n/\n\nsoccer",

It was a case of nuclear sabre-rattling, said Burns and added that the concern expressed by the leaders of China and India had an impact on Russia. There are two key takeaways from this admission by the US intelligence chief.\nNo one wants the conflict to either escalate or even continue. Regardless of the differences over Russia-related economic and financial sanctions, all countries who matter are willing to chip in. The key point then is that a country needs to matter for it to play a positive role. There\u2019s been misplaced criticism from the West about India\u2019s refusal to toe the line on sanctions. Yet at a crucial juncture, India played a positive role. Absent India\u2019s willingness to keep all channels open with Russia, it\u2019s hard to see how it can intervene positively.\nAn important subtext of the Burns interview is that it\u2019s important to keep channels of communication and options open to hammer out a solution. Independently, the highest-ranking military officer in the US, Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, on November 16 observed that even the Ukrainian government said that eventually there needs to be a political settlement. He went so far as to suggest that a slowdown in the intensity of fighting during winter opens a window for Russia and Ukraine to start talking.\nThis is not the era of war as Modi said. Disputes need to be settled through negotiations. This, in turn, needs a conducive environment. India has been clear that attempts to change borders through force are not acceptable anywhere. But disputes cannot be resolved through crippling economic sanctions and isolation either. The Burns interview proves that India took a wise position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, not a cynical one.\n\n",

A contest that came alive in classical fashion \u2013 one team takes lead and the other, just as everyone writes off the possibility, comes back. Penalties are a cruel way to sort out winners, especially in contests as exhilarating as this. But they are also perhaps the only quick and pragmatic way \u2013 and they too are a test, of nerves, of skill. And in those moments Argentina found another hero, goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\nBut perhaps the script was pre-written and Messi would not be denied. La Pulga finally had the one trophy that was missing from his cabinet and the economically battered nation of Argentina could dream again \u2013 even if briefly. Suffering from decades of despondency induced by an economy on life support \u2013 inflation stood at a staggering 88% over the last 12 months and almost 40% of the country is estimated to be below the poverty line \u2013 Argentina perhaps needed that Cup more than France.\nNow carping critics of Qatar as a host of a World Cup should be good sports and congratulate the nation on pulling off a grand spectacle. The Qatar Cup brought the world\u2019s greatest sporting spectacle to a long-neglected footballing region. Football got a new flavour \u2013 from the hospitality of the local Qataris to the support for Palestine and the protests in Iran. Qatar 2022 was also the tournament that saw the best-ever performance by non-European and non-South American teams. Four Asian and African teams qualified for the knockout stage with Morocco making a fairy-tale run to the semi-final \u2013 the first African nation to do so. This World Cup surely proved that football is no monopoly of a select few. That\u2019s a lesson India \u2013 currently ranked 106 by Fifa \u2013 would do well to take to heart. A nation of 1.4 billion and a large, fast-growing economy should be aiming higher in this most enchanting of sporting endeavours.\n\n",

Aunts would shell peas and cut okra in huge thaalis sitting on the verandah steps and the men would be assigned specific tasks because if you were ladkiwallas you had Responsibilities and no questions asked. At night mattresses would be flung across the drawing room and extra manjis were brought and neighbours loaned linen and the mornings echoed with a litany of hurry-ups as we banged on the bathroom doors.\nIt was so much fun and home-cooked food would appear magically and on time and in the run-up to the big day sundry relatives would be offended and delegations would be despatched to manao them since no Indian wedding is complete without a few slighted folks martyred to some cause. One relative would also fall ill and there would be a ripple of anxiety but the ailment would resolve itself courtesy of some homegrown cure and in the evening there would be laughter and out-of-tune song sessions and rivers of teasing affection. Everyone did their bit.\nThat awesome togetherness has gone now. It is all so antiseptic and clinical. We land at 5pm for the baraat and leave for the airport by 10pm, catch the red-eye back, office tomorrow, sorry cannot stay for the reception, believe the sangeet was a great affair, just couldn\u2019t make it. Where once Chunnu, Munnu, Chottu and the whole caboodle fetched up and were welcomed now there is a singular representation.

The meals are now catered, so much more convenient, that being the overriding sentiment. Effort and inconvenience are synonyms where once they were the best part.\nWhen did it change? When did we run out of time for fam?

        "full_article": "It was, quite easily, the most extraordinary final in the long history of the World Cup. A nail-biting, end-to-end game, full of goals, early leads and dramatic comebacks. A cliffhanger, really, in a tournament full of similar cliffhangers, as the staggering intensity with which it was played stretched absorbingly into extra time, and then some more, to be finally decided through penalty shootouts.\nAs a football fan, you couldn't have asked for more. Because more doesn't exist. In a World Cup final, the stakes are usually so high that it inhibits performance. Yet, what a game this was. The final showdown between Argentina and France \u2013 equals in every way, each vying for that third star on their jerseys \u2013 didn't just live up to its billing; it surpassed it by some distance. And Argentina winning it is perhaps footballing justice, for what it means to them, the entire region of South America, and their World Cup-starved fans across the globe, including in Bangladesh.\nBut let's face it: in a few years, as moments melt into memories and narratives, the FIFA World Cup 2022 will be remembered less for what happened on or off the field in Qatar than for what it eventually came to represent \u2013 the crowning moment for a certain Lionel Messi.\nWithout taking away from the heroics and achievements of other players and teams \u2013 of which there were plenty \u2013 it can be said without hesitation that this World Cup will mostly be remembered as one in which Messi has finally become a world champion, and \"completed\" football. It will be a World Cup of Messi, by Messi, and for Messi.\nThere are some moments in history when hyperboles do not sound like hyperboles, and this is perhaps one of them. On Sunday, Messi rewrote his \u2013 and his country's \u2013 history as he held the most-coveted trophy in football after singlehandedly guiding his team to World Cup glory, matching the feat of his idol Diego Maradona who last won the cup for Argentina in 1986. \"Singlehandedly\" might be a bit of a stretch, as he had motivated lieutenants to support him, but there is no doubt that he was the general that held them all together, leading them from the front. In so doing, he made or broke some 15 records.\nFor Messi, it must be said, such performance is nothing new. This is what he has been doing for the last 16 years or so, with a level of consistency that few can or could rival. This is what he did when he reached the 2014 World Cup final, which he lost. He had won the Golden Ball then as he did on Sunday again. He had an average supporting cast then. By most standards, what he has in his winning team now is also an average supporting cast. What worked for him this time, then?\nThis is where we must take note of Messi's evolution, as a player, as an Argentine, and as a captain \u2013 a progression we can call \"Messi, Messier, Messiest.\" For most footballers, being just Messi would be more than enough. Just Messi is calm Messi, demure Messi, brilliant Messi. This Messi appears to be self-absorbed, aloof even. Messier is when we see him in terms of his relationship with Argentina, a country he chose to represent over Spain, one that gives him a greater purpose beyond the pleasure of breaking records. He is equally deadly in that role, if not as impactful in terms of trophies. It is his transformation as a leader that really made all the difference.\nThis supreme version of Messi, ironically, is more fragile but also more determined, more emotionally invested in what is happening in his team, and therefore more responsive to their needs. This Messi knows you are only as strong as the weakest member of your team. This Messi is not afraid to get down and dirty for them.\nAs Gabriele Marcotti, a senior writer for ESPN, has noted: \"Messi watchers place the turning point at the 2019 Copa America. Argentina lost in the semi-final to host Brazil, and after the game, Messi was decidedly un-Messi-like. He railed against the referee and showed an obvious, outward edge that few had seen before. He had taken over the captaincy a few years earlier, but this was a different Messi: This was angry Messi, snarly Messi, street Messi. (This was the Messi who would materialise after the game against the Dutch, hissing at Wout Weghorst: 'What are you looking at, Bobo?')\"\nWhat won this World Cup for Argentina is Captain Messi. After the final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, when asked to explain his Golden Glove-winning performance, said: \"I did my thing.\" Messi could have said the same thing, and it would have been wrong. Leadership was not his thing. He grew into it over time. The reward is three major international trophies in just a little over one year \u2013 a World Cup, a Copa Am\u00e9rica, and a Finalissima.\nThis new Messi is beautiful to watch, both on the field and off. Who knows what else Captain Messi can achieve for his team in the coming years?\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay is assistant editor at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "On December 1, the government issued an amendment to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) Act, 2003, empowering the power and energy ministry to set fuel and electricity prices under special circumstances. Previously, according to the law, the prices of energy commodities could only be fixed by BERC. This amendment thus alters BERC's position as the sole authority for fixing energy prices in the country.\nThe idea of a regulatory commission for checks and balances in the energy sector has come about from the well-known Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) of the US. Over the last two decades, many countries have adopted the idea of an authority to oversee the investments made in their energy sectors \u2013 to check if these are consistent with their national goals. In recent times, advocating investments to comply with the mandates of the Paris Agreement on climate change is one of the newer roles of such authorities. In addition to ensuring smooth and affordable energy supply and monitoring energy infrastructure investments, many countries have entrusted these commissions with the role of setting fuel and power tariffs. Since investments made in the energy sector have a direct impact on the tariffs, clearance from the regulatory commission in this regard is extremely important to keep the tariffs low.\nBERC's vision is \"to create an enabling environment, efficient, well-managed and sustainable energy sector in Bangladesh for providing energy at (a) just and reasonable cost, and protection of consumers' interest and satisfaction through fair practice.\" Among BERC's many missions are \"transparency in energy sector management, cost rationalisation and tariff determination, and enforcement of fiscal discipline in the energy sector.\" In light of this, the amendment raises several questions: why did the government do it? And how will it impact BERC's key role of tariff determination as set out in its mandate?\nThe quick and simple answer to the first question is that the government wants to have FULL control over fuel and electricity prices. The emphasis on the word \"full\" is important because the government already had a fair bit of control over BERC through the process of key appointments and other means. It should also be noted that the government never gave the function of tariff-setting for petroleum products to BERC. As a result, the prices of diesel and petrol could be revised whenever the government desired.\nTo understand why it was important for the government to introduce this amendment, one needs to understand the present mechanism of price fixation. To set energy prices, the government set up BERC as an independent body in 2003; its chairman and members were appointed by the parliament and they were given judicial powers. This commission would set the price of energy (mainly gas and electricity) without any interference from the government, using calculations and formulas following certain guidelines. One very important clause in the guidelines is that the commission\u00a0must\u00a0hold a public hearing before setting prices. Of paramount importance in the functioning of BERC is the sacred task of protecting consumers.\nBefore BERC was set up, tariff-fixing was done by the ministry with support from the utilities \u2013 Petrobangla for gas and Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) for electricity. The problem in this process is three-fold: 1) they may arbitrarily set high prices and try to earn revenue; 2) the process is not transparent, especially for consumers, whose opinions are not considered; and 3) those responsible for supplying the energy may be doing so in an inefficient manner and making investments that are contrary to lower energy prices.\nFollowing its establishment, BERC had the sole authority to set energy prices; if the government wanted to increase energy prices, they would have to go through BERC, who would first conduct a public hearing to solicit public opinion. It was expected that, through this process, consumers would be able to vent their grievances against utilities and in the process scrutinise their efficiency of operation. BERC was also tasked with closely scrutinising the tariff increase requests before declaring a new tariff. The entire process could take as long as six months, and in most cases the utilities would not get the price increase they asked for.\nIn this situation, every day that BERC would take to deliberate on the requests would add to the mounting losses. Since BERC needed to follow due process, they were not in a position to hasten their deliberations. In situations where the tariff increase requested is large, this delay in adjusting prices could result in huge losses for the utilities, which the government would have to subsidise. With the amended BERC Act, the government is now able to increase the price quickly, thus avoiding these losses.\nHowever, since the government can now increase energy tariffs by any amount without any sort of public hearing or accountability, consumer rights in various sectors would be seriously threatened. In fact, it would cease to exist, and for all practical purposes, BERC's role would be greatly diminished. The government will then be able to use energy commodities for revenue collection beyond what they are doing through the existing taxes and duties.\nIn the setting of energy prices, the financial performance of production, transmission and distribution companies come into play in a big way. If these companies do not perform efficiently and also make bad investments, electricity prices will be adversely affected. Without an independent regulator, these performance issues may never be questioned. Of course, these companies can claim they have strict performance criteria, but they are never enough to enhance performance mainly because the regulator now is the government, under which all these companies are operating.\nBERC has failed to control many wasteful investments made by BPDB. The principal reason for that is that BERC is not sufficiently empowered and independent. Nevertheless, even with BERC's limited power to keep tariffs down by forcing utilities to perform better, the commission over the last decade has been able to achieve a lot with respect to protecting consumers' rights. If nothing else, scrutiny of the production, transmission and distribution companies' performances by BERC and the people through public hearings has revealed a lot about the operational and financial weaknesses of the utilities. These companies have been forced in many cases to control costs, and in most cases BERC has not granted the price increases they requested. If there was no BERC or if it could be bypassed, the situation would have been far worse, and the ministry would accept whatever was presented by Petrobangla and BPDB. The new amendment to the BERC Act implies that the energy sector will lose the independent oversight, and the vital purpose of BERC's function of keeping energy tariffs low will be lost.\n\u00a0\nDr Ijaz Hossain\u00a0is former dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet).\n\n",

        "full_article": "The\u00a0unnaturally high number of Bangladeshi migrant workers who die in Gulf countries and return to us as corpses is too often swept under the rug. A report published by this daily on Sunday, to mark International Migrants Day, has revealed that the bodies of at least 45,301 male and female migrant workers arrived in the country between 2008 and June of this year. Among the six destination countries \u2013 Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar \u2013 a staggering 12,930 deaths have taken place in Saudi Arabia alone. While the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar have been highlighted as a human rights issue over the past month, given the country's lavish hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup using infrastructures largely built by migrant workers, other Gulf countries must also receive their share of the criticism.\nThe question that is foremost in our minds is: how do so many Bangladeshi workers die in these destination countries? While a few workers die by suicide or are killed, the causes of death mentioned most often \u2013 as per documents that accompany their bodies \u2013 are strokes and heart diseases, alongside workplace accidents. The curious thing is that a large portion of those who have died of strokes were young, or at most middle-aged. Unfortunately, there have been no attempts to investigate and publicise the underlying causes of migrant worker deaths by the host countries.\u00a0\nGiven the degree of reporting on the issue over the years and the narratives of migrant workers and their families, it is no secret that the working and living environments in destination countries are horrid. Not only are temperatures much higher than in Bangladesh, the work hours can extend to 12 or even 18 hours, while workers are always under pressure to send enough money home, leaving no opportunity for them to have enough rest \u2013 let alone any leisure. Given the lack of enforcement of any workers' rights, most Bangladeshis are also forced to do risky, often life-threatening jobs. Not to mention how badly some workers are treated, especially women migrants who work informal jobs in homes, becoming victims of verbal, physical, and/or sexual abuse, or even murder.\u00a0\nUltimately, it all boils down to the fact that Bangladeshis and workers from other origin countries are severely exploited by the Gulf states. The lack of transparency on the destination countries' part regarding worker treatment, coupled with the lack of enthusiasm of origin countries to hold them accountable has resulted in Bangladeshi migrant workers having to earn their bread in inhumane conditions, away from everything they know and everyone they love. Unfortunately, it is often seen that Gulf countries hold a higher ground as they can choose to take in more workers from other countries if one origin country imposes stricter conditions for their citizens.\u00a0\nWe demand that Bangladeshi authorities at home and in destination countries prioritise the lives of migrant workers. These are the people on whose labour and remittances our economy is dependent. So why is their well-being not given the utmost importance? The sight of families receiving the bodies of their loved ones, who have died in destination countries while trying to provide them with a steady income, needs to stop being a regular thing.\n",

        "full_article": "December 2021. It was around this time that the Evaly scam was coming to a head. The now notorious e-commerce platform had made many promises to its customers, but had failed to deliver on most, if not all of them.\nHowever, it wasn't only the organisation that was under fire. Countless customers came forward to sue not just Evaly, but the many celebrities who had worked with Evaly as brand ambassadors and partners.\nMany customers shared the same sentiment: if famous celebrities were involved in promoting the platform, then surely they could trust it. Celebrities like Tahsan, Mithila and Sabnam Faria were sued by one customer; all of them were eventually relieved of fraud charges by a Dhaka court.\nOn December 5, 2022,\u00a0The Business Standard\u00a0published an investigative report documenting how RF Builders, a real estate company, started the construction of an 18-storey building on a 110-katha plot in the Adarsha Gram area of Cox's Bazar in 2012.\nIn a similar fashion to Evaly, RF Builders heavily engaged in bringing big celebrities to associate with their operation. To this measure, they were able to get the likes of Ilias Kanchan and Shakib Al Hasan involved in the project, with the former joining as the project's director.\nAptly named \"White Sand,\" the project's site now lays empty, even though it was supposed to be complete in 2018. Like sand, the dreams of all those who invested their hard-earned money into this project slipped away from their hands.\nSimilar to RF Builders, some 10 other developers also engaged in similar scams, fronting their projects with the names of stars like Moushumi and Omar Sani, and public figures like Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and Planning Minister MA Mannan.\nIn Bangladesh, knowledge of high-level financial scams \u2013 particularly the ones backed up by large investments, companies and public figures \u2013 is very low. With how drastically development has taken place in Bangladesh, scams like Evaly and RF Builders have only come to the forefront in recent years. It is concerning that celebrities and public figures have continued to be involved in such devious projects, without anyone holding them accountable.\nYes, they aren't the ones who devised the scams. Most of them probably weren't even aware that these companies would scam their customers. However, as a general observer, it's infuriating to see that such big names love to pocket the cash, say some inspirational quotes about how whatever they are endorsing will solve everyone's problems, and then immediately duck out as soon as things don't bode well for them.\nIn the age of social media and scandals, accountability is hard to come by. But why is it that celebrities feel that they can use their brand and name to promote products for a paycheque and then immediately drop any accountability when push comes to shove?\nThe issue of influencers and celebrities endorsing dodgy products and services isn't only one that exists in Bangladesh. In October of this year, Kim Kardashian was fined USD 1.26 million for promoting a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax without disclosing that she was being paid for the endorsement.\nIn the US, a law was passed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2019, which required celebrities and influencers to declare when they were being sponsored to promote products or services by a certain brand on their social media platforms.\nBut in Bangladesh, there are no such regulations governing celebrity endorsements. As a result, celebrities can get away with endorsing scams, all the while preserving their goodwill with the public.\nAt the heart of the problem is the fact that celebrities in Bangladesh are yet to take any form of real accountability in such a situation. Without some sort of precedent being set, it is unlikely that they will come forward to accept blame.\nSimultaneously, public figures like our honourable politicians should also be put under scrutiny. Their social capital can be a large contributing factor behind why people invest in ventures or buy certain products. Public figures, particularly politicians, should not be allowed to endorse products at all. Their vested interest in projects can also mislead people to assume that these projects are bulletproof and guaranteed to succeed.\nThe government should step forward to put regulations in place, while also ensuring that, once in place, said regulations would be strictly enforced. If we don't act now, then this will continue, mostly with the rate at which internet infrastructure is developing in the country.\nCelebrities, too, should be angry over this issue. When a brand uses you to promote a product which is then revealed to be a scam, celebrities should be coming forward to clear the doubt around their own image.\nAt the end of the day, celebrities should not be allowed to make profits from their credibility and star power, while thousands of their fans pour their hard-earned money into whatever the biggest names in the country are promoting for a quick buck.\nAaqib Hasib\u00a0is a communications consultant and writer.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The\u00a0unnaturally high number of Bangladeshi migrant workers who die in Gulf countries and return to us as corpses is too often swept under the rug. A report published by this daily on Sunday, to mark International Migrants Day, has revealed that the bodies of at least 45,301 male and female migrant workers arrived in the country between 2008 and June of this year. Among the six destination countries \u2013 Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar \u2013 a staggering 12,930 deaths have taken place in Saudi Arabia alone. While the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar have been highlighted as a human rights issue over the past month, given the country's lavish hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup using infrastructures largely built by migrant workers, other Gulf countries must also receive their share of the criticism.\nThe question that is foremost in our minds is: how do so many Bangladeshi workers die in these destination countries? While a few workers die by suicide or are killed, the causes of death mentioned most often \u2013 as per documents that accompany their bodies \u2013 are strokes and heart diseases, alongside workplace accidents. The curious thing is that a large portion of those who have died of strokes were young, or at most middle-aged. Unfortunately, there have been no attempts to investigate and publicise the underlying causes of migrant worker deaths by the host countries.\u00a0\nGiven the degree of reporting on the issue over the years and the narratives of migrant workers and their families, it is no secret that the working and living environments in destination countries are horrid. Not only are temperatures much higher than in Bangladesh, the work hours can extend to 12 or even 18 hours, while workers are always under pressure to send enough money home, leaving no opportunity for them to have enough rest \u2013 let alone any leisure. Given the lack of enforcement of any workers' rights, most Bangladeshis are also forced to do risky, often life-threatening jobs. Not to mention how badly some workers are treated, especially women migrants who work informal jobs in homes, becoming victims of verbal, physical, and/or sexual abuse, or even murder.\u00a0\nUltimately, it all boils down to the fact that Bangladeshis and workers from other origin countries are severely exploited by the Gulf states. The lack of transparency on the destination countries' part regarding worker treatment, coupled with the lack of enthusiasm of origin countries to hold them accountable has resulted in Bangladeshi migrant workers having to earn their bread in inhumane conditions, away from everything they know and everyone they love. Unfortunately, it is often seen that Gulf countries hold a higher ground as they can choose to take in more workers from other countries if one origin country imposes stricter conditions for their citizens.\u00a0\nWe demand that Bangladeshi authorities at home and in destination countries prioritise the lives of migrant workers. These are the people on whose labour and remittances our economy is dependent. So why is their well-being not given the utmost importance? The sight of families receiving the bodies of their loved ones, who have died in destination countries while trying to provide them with a steady income, needs to stop being a regular thing.\n",

        "full_article": "The 2022 World Cup final, which ended in a dramatic victory for Argentina in the dreaded penalty shootout, produced the most fitting end to what has been a thrilling tournament. Despite all the excitement \u2013 and the controversies \u2013 in the lead up to the World Cup in Qatar, no one could have expected the tournament to pan out this well. So, first and foremost, the organisers deserve kudos for doing a superb job. The Qatari authorities and people also deserve appreciation for hosting the tournament so graciously, and for opening up their doors to the entire world in such a welcoming manner.\nLike all football World Cups, this one, too, captured the imagination of the whole world \u2013 and we have to say that the players did not disappoint fans' expectations. In fact, given the quality of the matches, and the football played by all teams, fans around the world have been more than satisfied by the grit, determination, and overall performance that were on display. The spirit shown by players from different teams, both in victory and defeat, has been fantastic to watch. And that is what football should be all about.\nThroughout the tournament, fans were on the edge of their seats, as teams that were not as highly touted, such as Morocco, Croatia and others, pulled off a number of awe-inspiring upsets against some of the traditionally strong teams. But ultimately, it was the two footballing giants, Argentina and France, that made it through to the final. And what a final it was. Already being described by some as one of the greatest football matches of all time, it produced some of the best footballing moments in recent history. The two superstars in opposing teams, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, surely saved their best for last. But ultimately, it was Messi's Argentina that edged out Kylian Mbappe's France in the most dramatic fashion.\nBut the French players deserve to hold their heads up high, even in defeat, as they pulled off not one but two inspiring comebacks to push the Argentine team to its limits. However, in a fairy-tale ending, Argentina proved that they were destined to be the victors of this World Cup. And that has surely brought much joy to thousands of Bangladeshis, who have been among the most passionate supporters of the South American nation in the world.\nFrom Morocco's great run to become the first African team to ever make it to a World Cup semi-final, to Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo becoming the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups, to Saudi Arabia breaking Argentina's 36 match unbeaten streak in one of the biggest World Cup upsets of all time, to Mbappe becoming only the second player ever to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, to Lionel Messi breaking Gabriel Batistuta's record to become Argentina's all-time leading goal scorer on route to ultimately lifting the trophy, there is no doubt that the real winners of the tournament have been the billions of fans around the world.\n",

        "full_article": "Sloth in implementation is a common complaint against projects under the Annual Development Programme (ADP) at the end of every fiscal year. But this time, it appeared, the projects were not getting anywhere since the very beginning of the current fiscal year. As the reports go, the rate of ADP project execution has been record-low during the first four months of this fiscal year so much so that, to take stock of things, the planning minister asked the top executives of different priority projects why the situation was so bad. Such projects included those under the Roads and Highways division, Railway ministry, Shipping ministry, Power and Energy divisions, etc.Going by the data provided by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED), during the July-October period of FY(2022-23), only 12.64 per cent of the total ADP project allocation worth Tk.12.56 trillion could be spent. This is lower than the project execution rate over the same period in the previous fiscal year (FY2021-22) at 13.06 per cent. Apart from the usual tardiness, other factors behind this fiscal's lower rate of project implementation included the government's adopting belt-tightening measures against spending on development projects in the face of the economic crunch. The government even stopped funding of projects categorised as least important, while others considered to be more important would get 75 per cent of the allocated fund. The foreign-funded projects, on the other hand, would get the highest priority regarding fund release, it could be further learnt.As the IMED data show, during the four months of current FY under review, a priority sector like the Bridge Division received the highest allocation, but it could spend only 37 per cent of the fund. But this was in marked contrast with the performance of, for example, the Shipping ministry which could use only a small fraction of its allocation (at 4.54 per cent). The reports of fund use were similar for the ministries and divisions that enjoy highest allocation. Those include the primary and mass education ministry, health services division, science and technology ministry, secondary and higher education directorate and water resources ministry.As it came out from the planning commission meeting, there are many projects that had been given the go-ahead a long time back, but their implementation was either stalled at a stage or it did not start at all. Even so, the expenditures for those projects continued in the form of the salaries and allowances of the project staffs, office rent, electricity bill and so on. These are obviously an enormous drain on the country's resources. A particular project under the Railway ministry involving procurement of a number of MG (Meter Gauge) diesel locomotives, for instance, has taken more than a decade to make even a start. First, no bidder could be found for the first and second phase of the project. That led to floating of a fresh tender after making some changes in the technical specifications of the project. And, as in most cases, it was the procedural complexity in project implementation that lay behind the lack of progress. The steps taken so far by the Planning ministry to delist non-performing projects is no doubt commendable. Hopefully, the government would hold meetings of implementing agencies often so the ongoing development projects could be executed in time.",

        "full_article": "Not long ago, many lower middle-income people in the country had started believing what the people in the higher authorities wanted them to lend credence to. The words would, in effect, revolve round the morale boosters that the wildly galloping market was set to be tamed down. The humble urban middle class in Dhaka and the large cities then looked to the days when the market of the essentials would be within their reach. Their expectations were met to some extent. They started visiting the kitchen markets and found the prices of some products were really on the decline. The price fall was nominal, with some finding the trend to be imperceptible. In a weird trajectory, the prices of some products began shooting up again, after remaining static for a few weeks. They included sugar, eggs and edible oil in the main.With this erratic price behaviour continuing without respite, the fixed-income people found themselves relapsing into their price entanglement. Apparently, in the last 10 months the prices of the staples and the other essential food items including vegetables went through a course featured by unpredictability. The chronically low-income people were the worst victims. Since the first detection of the price-hike, their queues have continued getting longer in front of OMS trucks, and those selling edible oil, sugar etc. The Open Market Sales (OMS) points were eventually found spread throughout the country's divisional and district headquarters.The heating up of the retail markets selling rice, atta, pulses, sugar, spices and also fishes and meat is a common phenomenon in the country. In the normal market scenario, especially during the post-disaster times and on the eve of festivals, syndicates are found busy working from behind the scenes. Their clandestine market manipulations start from hoarding products like rice, atta, oil and spices. An artificial crisis of these essential goods follows. It's after abundant imports of rice and wheat and increase in their acreage in the country, the markets are seen turning normal. This is part of a dirty game found at play in the poorer countries. Had it not for the impacts of the 2-year-long corona pandemic, and the fallout of the recent Russia-Ukraine war, the Bangladesh market would have remained quite free of negative developments.The two scourges have affected the country almost simultaneously. However, the nation could avert the major assault of a food crisis and weather the first phase of the shocks, thanks to the bumper production of two of its major food-crops including the Aman paddy. In spite of these crops' satisfactory yields, the creeping of the price hike of rice and wheat/flour still remains a quandary to market researchers. But they ought not to feel puzzled, as the other experts have plain interpretations of the whole episode. According to them, despite seemingly unlikely, the hoarders remained active from the start of the two crises; and they still are.Current affairs experts have yet to see any silver lining in the Russia-Ukraine war. With the intensity of the war increasing by way of additions of newer deadly weapons followed by casualties on both sides, the largely skewed war carries few chances of ending soon. Referring to this situation, war experts warn of many other new nations being sucked into the regional war. The war being fanned out to a wider front, the fear of the otherwise peaceful nations joining the armed conflict will result in a global phenomenon. That is feared to be followed by pockets of agro-economic depression. None can rule out such a situation for Bangladesh. A depression in economy leads, invariably, to the dreary times of destabilised markets, price hike, and, above all, fall in import of many essential food items. In spite of its 'avowed' neutral foreign policy, Bangladesh may not avoid being drawn to a camp opposed to another. Thus, the test of wartime policy balance stalks the nation. A wrong step in the act of faring through turbulent times may find the country in the soup.The ravages of worldwide Covid-19 have seemingly been over. But the pandemic cannot be said to have left the world. In order to see it beat a retreat, humanity has to wait till 2023, maybe more. The impediments to the smooth functioning of markets, domestic and international, still loom large. In the case of Bangladesh, the curse of price hike that keeps plaguing its middle and low-income people appears to have dug its heels in. Amid this confused state of the economy, dominated by price hikes and occasionally imperceptible price drops, the domestic retail market clients have few options but frenetically looking for OMS sales points. During the times of going through forced frugality amidst belt-tightening, nobody knows for how long, the situation gets on one's nerves. Mere blaming the market manipulators may not do. If there are proofs, these anti-people elements should be brought to book right away. The month of Ramadan followed by Eid shopping isn't too far. Despite warnings from the government against food price manipulation in the fasting month, the market racketeers barge into the scene after less than a fortnight. These elements shouldn't be allowed to rake in during the Ramadan and after.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The driver of both life and economy is energy. Animals get their energy from carbohydrates in their foods. Most factories, power plants and transports run on fossil fuel. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons. And the burning of hydrocarbons is the major source of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Moreover, hydrocarbon reserves in the world are not unlimited. Today or tomorrow, those reserves will be depleted. So, scientists have long been in search of an alternative source of energy that is cheap, non-polluting and the world has an abundant supply of it.The nuclear energy could be one such clean and inexhaustible source of energy. But the way in which nuclear energy is now derived from Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 as fuels in the nuclear reactors, it is neither efficient, nor cheap. And the supply of nuclear fuel in its present form is also limited. Moreover, as nuclear fuels leave radioactive materials as waste after use, it cannot also be said to be clean and safe. So, the use of fossil fuel as the mainstay of energy continues as before. And how dependent the world is still on fossil fuel has again become glaringly evident from the Ukraine war, particularly, with the supply crunch of natural gas and fuel oil from Russia. As a result, some countries in the West have even opted for the dirtiest kind of fossil fuel, coal. So, the question arises, if the world is shifting from its promise of gradually weaning itself from fossil fuel! But good news seems to be coming from a nuclear research laboratory in the USA. Five days back, scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California announced a breakthrough in nuclear research. In the experiment, scientists fired 192-beam laser at a tiny amount of deuterium and tritium, both isotopes of hydrogen, kept in a pea-sized capsule. It heated and compressed the capsule to a temperature of 100 million degrees Celsius (the kind of temperature created at the core of the Sun as well as the stars) and produced pressure equivalent to 100 billion times the atmospheric pressure. In the process, the deuterium and tritium atoms were fused to make a helium atom thereby releasing an amount of fusion energy that was more than what was put in through the laser beams. In fact, the lasers that bombarded the hydrogen capsule carried 2.5 megajoules (MJ) of energy. But the energy that was released from the fusion of the two types of hydrogen atoms was equivalent to 3.15 MJ. It is indeed a great piece of news for the simple reason that it is for the first time that scientists have been able to develop a process that is more than hundred per cent efficient at energy production. Why is the result at the NIF at LLNL so important? So far, fusion of lighter atoms has been possible only by way of using the heat generated by fission (breaking up) of the atoms of very heavy metals like Uranium and Plutonium. But the efficiency of the process was low as the fusion created less energy than that was put in through fission. Since the 1950s, hundreds of experiments have been conducted to achieve this 'holy grail' of nuclear fusion at different laboratories in the USA, in Europe and elsewhere. But this is the first-ever experiment that has claimed success. Will repeated LLNL-type experiments come up with the same result? If that happens, it would be an epoch-making event in science. It will be the ultimate answer to the problem of clean, safe and limitless energy for humanity. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, the residents of Satkhira's coastal areas are deprived of pure drinking water as many of them have to drink saline water. According to a UNDP survey, around 73 per cent people living in five coastal upazilas -- Koyra, Dacope, Paikgachha of Khulna and Assasuni and Shyamnagar of Satkhira -- have to drink unsafe saline water. Though the permissible salinity level in drinking water is 1,000mg per litre, those people, on average, consume water with salinity level between 1,427mg and 2,406mg per litre, reveals the survey. Shyamnagar is one of the largest upazilas of Bangladesh. About 1500-1700 families live there. But the people of this area have no access to clean and safe drinking water. There are some tube-wells. But all of them contain saline water. In the dry season or winter, the salinity level of tube-well water in Shyamnagar goes up to 6,600mg per litre, more than six times the permissible limit. And what is more alarming is that there is no deep tube-well for the people of this upazila. Some people buy water. But many cannot afford such water. Many spend more than two hours daily to collect drinking water. Sometimes, they have to walk more than a kilometre to fetch the water, either from a tube-well or from a pond.Drinking unsafe water can cause various waterborne diseases. There have already been notable health impacts, including high blood pressure, skin diseases, indigestion and diarrhoea among people of Shyamnagar. Therefore, we urge the authorities concerned to look into this problem and ensure safe and clean water for the people of Shyamnagar free of cost.\nAbdullah Almamun, Student of Department of Sociology, Jagannath University, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
