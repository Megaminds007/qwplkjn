The move has set in motion a new legal battle. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has decided to challenge the ordinance, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre has moved the Court to review its judgment. The National Capital Territory of Delhi Act (NCTD), 1991 created a unique administrative unit, and judicial interpretations have never completely resolved the conflicts between the Centre and the elected government of the NCTD all these years. The judgment held that Union Territories with a Legislative Assembly of their own are comparable to States, and their government\u2019s executive powers would extend to all matters on which they are allowed to make laws. In Delhi\u2019s case, law and order and land remained with the Centre, unlike other States. The Court also pointed out the absence of a law on services, and the lack of oversight by elected representatives over the officials under the present scheme. The ordinance purportedly removes the basis of the judgment by creating the National Capital Civil Service Authority. The Chief Minister is the chair, with the Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary, Home \u2014 both appointed by the central government \u2014 as members. The Central reclaimed all powers it lost in the judgment.The Centre is well within its powers to overturn a judicial pronouncement through legislation. Whether the basis of the instant judgment has been removed by the ordinance remains an open question, but the more pertinent issue is the political intent of the Centre\u2019s move. The Centre under the current BJP dispensation has been confrontational, rather than cooperative, with States in resolving governance issues. It has shown little regard for elected governments at lower levels, while claiming for itself all powers on the grounds of its electoral majority. Delhi being the national capital has to maintain a unique administrative character, and it should not be left to the exigencies of local politics. Equally, the voters of Delhi cannot be disenfranchised for extraneous reasons. The irony is that AAP itself has been a votary of centralisation, though it could swing to provincialism to suit its leaders in a changed situation. The AAP government had resorted to provincialist rhetoric in the past, also going to the extent of questioning the rights of people from other States to access health care and education in the national capital. It was also a cheerleader of the Centre\u2019s brazen move that dismantled the State of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. Democracy and federalism are threatened by an unprincipled hunger for power, and AAP is both villain and victim.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nexecutive (government)\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\neducation\n\n/\n\npolitics",

        "full_article": "A rural sport seen by courts for years as one inflicting cruelty on animals has now received judicial imprimatur. An upsurge in popular support for jallikattu led to legislative changes in early 2017, exempting it from the rigours of the law against animal cruelty. Six years after the amendments ended a Court-ordered ban, the Supreme Court has upheld the changes made by the Tamil Nadu Assembly, as well as the cultural sentiment behind jallikattu, a traditional sport in which men try to control raging bulls. There has been an endless conflict between activists and proponents of the game, which culminated in a 2014 Court judgment banning the sport. The activists argue that any sport involving a physical contest between man and bull violates animal rights, while the other camp contends that none should stop something that is part of the State\u2019s tradition and culture. The State government responded to the ban by amending the central Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, in its application to the State, and obtained the President\u2019s assent. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has now settled the issue, ruling in favour of jallikattu as a cultural event.The verdict of the five-judge Bench is anchored to two key findings. That the fresh regulations minimise the game\u2019s potential for cruelty and pain formed the basis for the 2014 judgment. Those conditions were no more prevalent. Second, the Court has accepted the legislature\u2019s view that jallikattu is a sport conducted every year to follow tradition and culture. It has accepted the legislature\u2019s wisdom on what constitutes cultural heritage, holding that the Court cannot embark on such an inquiry. However, it does not mean the Court has in any way diluted the part of the earlier Bench\u2019s verdict reading into Indian law the full import of international rules in favour of animal rights. Rather, it has deferred to the cultural sentiment underlying the legislative scheme by which sports such as jallikattu, kambala, a buffalo race in Karnataka, and bullock-cart racing in Maharashtra are not interdicted by the law preventing animal cruelty. This means organisers as well as the respective governments, still bear the burden to prevent infliction of pain and cruelty on animals. These sports also pose an undeniable hazard to humans too; to the participants mainly, but sometimes spectators too. It may be time for organisers to mandate protective gear for the participants and strictly enforce rules for proper barricades to keep spectators safe. Cultural assertion, and kindness to animals and adherence to safety norms need not be mutually exclusive.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nanimal\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nsport\n\n/\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nKarnataka\n\n/\n\nMaharashtra",

It needs to persuade the region that it \u201cstands for something and not just against something\u201d, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.\nThis is a challenge for a number of reasons, including Beijing\u2019s economic influence in the region, the varying preferences of individual Southeast Asian states, and lingering scepticism about the Quad\u2019s underlying purpose, with many regional states likely seeing the group\u2019s main purpose as being to counter the rise of China.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that the Quad leaders\u2019 summit in Hiroshima focus on securing greater consensus and support by streamlining its engagement mechanisms with Southeast Asia on issues where there is strategic complementarity and where it can efficiently deliver.\nThe Quad grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US has many things going for it. Scepticism notwithstanding, attitudes across Southeast Asia to the Quad are generally more positive than those towards AUKUS \u2014 in part because the Quad is more than a security and defence technology-sharing arrangement and, in part, because it promises to offer much-needed public goods for regional prosperity like vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn 2017, when the Quad was reborn, it was clear that it wanted to build resilience in the Indo-Pacific by working with existing regional mechanisms. To its credit, it has tried to go about it in many ways. For example, since its 2020 statement, Quad leaders have reaffirmed support for \u201cAsean centrality, Asean-led architecture and the Asean outlook on the Indo-Pacific\u201d to promote a stable and resilient Indo-Pacific.\nIt has looked for areas of practical cooperation, such as through the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which aimed to donate 1.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Indo-Pacific by the end of 2022 (though the initiative underperformed due to domestic shortages).\nOn maritime capacity building in Southeast Asia, the Quad has agreed to support Southeast Asian states through the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness initiative, which will connect regional partners and allies with technologies to provide greater maritime situational awareness in real time. This is a much-needed initiative; despite most states being littoral, Southeast Asian navies and coast guards struggle to monitor their seas and respond to seaborn challenges. These initiatives show the breadth of the ways in which the Quad can play a meaningful role in ensuring Southeast Asia builds resilience. Indeed, there are talks about covering other issues, such as climate change.\n\nSending the right signal: To succeed, the Quad must harness goodwill in Southeast Asia\nThis committee should focus on Quad-specific engagement while also monitoring how individual Quad countries are working with Southeast Asian states. Given that some Southeast Asian states may not feel comfortable engaging with the Quad as an institution, bilateral engagements are still likely to be important means of providing resilience-building support.\nThe Quad should also consider working more with existing Asean initiatives. Given that the Quad has stated its commitment to Asean centrality, it is important that Asean as an institution is not sidelined. For all its limitations, a stronger Asean ensures that Southeast Asian states are afforded greater strategic space.\nIt\u2019s important to ensure that the interests and needs of Southeast Asian countries are front-of-mind in any support that the Quad provides to the region. This needs to be the backbone of the positive agenda the Quad has tried to project. While many Southeast Asian states have concerns about the negative implications of China\u2019s rise, scepticism will grow if the Quad\u2019s regional engagement adopts an overtly anti-China approach.\nOf course, the Quad has many things going for it. For a start, it is not proselytising a bipolar world order; rather it demonstrates the growing reality of a multipolar one. Half its membership is Asian, and it is 100% Indo-Pacific. Through its actions and words, it should champion strategic choice and agency for Southeast Asian and other Indo-Pacific nations. It should promote a regional vision in which all capitals get to choose how they engage with a rising power in their neighbourhood.\nGreater strategic collaboration by the Quad with Southeast Asia\u2019s established mechanisms, and a strong focus on its priorities, could make a big difference by helping to strengthen resilience and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This should be top of the agenda when the leaders meet on the sidelines of G7.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\nGuha was as much an intellectual and thinker as he was a historian\nRanajit Guha ( May 23, 1923 - April 28, 1923) was an influential Indian historian and scholar renowned for his groundbreaking contributions to the field of Subaltern Studies. His approach to historiography has had a profound impact on the field of history, both in India and globally. His ideas continue to influence scholars, prompting critical examinations of power, agency, and resistance within historical narratives. Guha's legacy lies in his efforts to bring the stories of the subaltern to the forefront, challenging dominant historical interpretations and fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the past. In this interview with Priyam Pritim Paul, Dipesh Chakrabarty, one of the founding members of Subaltern Studies and the Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished Service Professor of History at the University of Chicago, provides insights into the life and significant contributions of Ranajit Guha.\nYou wrote that Ranajit Guha was your guru and friend. How does the relationship of guru and friendship mutually build or contribute to making thinkers like you and so many other historians?\n\nRanajitda had both the manner and the intellectual make-up of a guru-like teacher. He was clearly ahead of us in reflecting on several problems that dogged the received historiography of South Asia.He could demonstrate, through his own research and writing, ways of addressing these issues and had a vision of subaltern history that inspired us all. He also knew how to be a co-learner with us who were like his students. So being a \"guru\" did not necessarily mean any kind of oppressive hierarchy in our relationships. There was much friendship as well. Besides, he hand-picked the people he wanted to work with. None of us were formally his students. The only ingredient that bound us together was the excitement over the ideas that he had to share and his capacity to generate an intellectual conversation that created a sense of community among us. And because it was a group that was put together by him, it made you feel \"chosen.\" He was special in that way. He did not much care for institutional conventions \u2013 this was not always well received by others \u2013 but this way he could build a sense of a group with a historiographic mission that had serious implications about how to understood modernity and the modern-political in the context of South Asia.\nAmartya Sen said Guha was the most imaginative Indian historian of the twentieth century. Would you agree with him? Why?\n\nHe was original, imaginative, and brilliant, without a doubt. I would refrain from deciding if he was \"the best\" among his peers as that would once again take us back to another theme Sen has also elaborated on \u2013 the obsession with first-boys in the subcontinent. Originality was the hallmark of all of Guha's writings. A Rule of Property for Bengal insisted on and demonstrated the importance of ideas in colonial economic policy-making in India long before any other historian \u2013 with the sole and remarkable exception of Eric Stokes - turned to the subject. And you only have to read Stokes and Guha together to see the difference in Guha's approach. He was also the first historian in Indian history to seriously introduce \"structuralist\" ways of thinking. This gave us some very interesting means for thinking about that which, in India, seemed \"archaic\" in the very middle of the \"modern.\" This he achieved during his Subaltern Studies days. His essays like \"The Prose of Counter-Insurgency,\" \"Chandra's Death\" are brilliant expositions of his thoughts on reading the archives and the necessarily episodic nature of \"subaltern\" histories. You may or may not agree with his conclusions, but you would not be left in doubt of his creativity and brilliance. He was also a very gifted and self-conscious writer of prose in both English and Bengali.\nHow did he organise a group of young historians like you in forming the seminal Subaltern Studies group and what was his method of providing intellectual insight to those who were not his direct students?\n\nAs I said, he hand-picked people or they chose him. He started with two doctoral students at Sussex \u2013 David Arnold and David Hardiman \u2013 and two doctoral students at Oxford. The two Davids worked with Anthony Low who was later my supervisor as well in Canberra. The students from Oxford, Gyan Pandey and Shahid Amin, worked with Tapan Ray Chaudhuri for their doctoral degree. When I look back on this, I realise that this could not have been an easy situation for either Anthony and Tapanda but they were both temperamentally generous and intellectually secure enough to let their students draw inspiration from what Ranajitda had to offer. These four people formed the oldest nucleus of what became Subaltern Studies. By the time Partha Chatterjee, Gautam Bhadra, and I came into the group, its basic tenets had been worked out and given a form in writing. But we all found them exciting. The agenda for history-writing that the group had worked out and that Ranajitda had set down on paper acted as some kind of a manifesto for the group. It was also new and inspiring.\nWhy can his book Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency be considered a groundbreaking work that laid the foundation for Subaltern Studies worldwide?\n\nWell, even if it did not lay down a universal foundation for subaltern studies worldwide \u2013 that would not have been Guha's claim either, for he always spoke of \"convergences\" of agendas and aspirations of different historiographies. Guha breathed new life into the word \"subaltern\" and the concept of subaltern histories that were relatively independent of elite actions. But Elementary Aspects was undoubtedly a novel work. It was truly heroic of Guha to examine closely the histories of more than a hundred peasant rebellions in nineteenth-century India and then build up a model for understanding patterns in collective rebellious behaviour of peasants, and to develop some deep insights into the insurgent consciousness that, Guha argued, underlay such behaviour.\nHow do you perceive the philosophical trajectory in Guha's thought, which encompassed Tagore to Hegel or the Indian tradition with modern European thought?\nGuha thought of the discipline of history in the subcontinent as something that could not be separated, in its intellectual origins, from the history of the colonial state. For, colonial officials of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries wrote modern \"histories\" as part of administrative documents. Disciplinary history, for Guha, was thus what some might today call \"colonial knowledge.\" It was part of the discourse of the colonial state and could never be separated from statist concerns. He found Hegel to be the philosopher of such a statist idea of history, and he wanted to oppose to that tradition Tagore's thoughts on human pasts, thoughts that always saw the modern state as something profoundly alien to the spirit of \"Indian\" society.\nWhy has colonialism been his primary area of interest for a long time? Why did he shift his focus from Gandhi to peasants in order to gain a deeper understanding of them?\nThis has something to do with certain facts of his life: he grew up in the last twenty-five years of colonial rule, came under the influence of the Communist Party, understood the predicament of his own class, Bengali landlords and the bhadrolok generally, as being a result of colonial rules and policies. Gandhi interested him deeply \u2013 how could he not, it was Gandhi who connected the nationalisms of the urban and upper classes in India with the worlds of the peasantry. In fact, the last class Guha ever taught, as a visiting professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, was on Gandhi. He also would have retained a long-term interest in peasant movements, given the history of Bengal in the 1940s. But the interest in writing about peasant insurgency probably arose out of his interactions with young Naxalites of Delhi in 1970 when he and his wife spent a year in the country on sabbatical leave.\nWhich were his other areas of interest besides history?\n\nPhilosophies of history and language. Also, philosophies of Sanskrit grammar, theories of enjoyment in Sanskrit (rasatattva), Tagore, Bengali poetry and literature in general.\nHow do you assess his later works, written in Bengali from Vienna, concerning literature and philosophy?\nI cannot provide a thorough evaluation since I have yet to read them carefully. However, based on what I have seen, his works are filled with stimulating thoughts and questions.\nWhat was Guha's opinion on the idea and formation of Hindutva in India?\nLike many others, he would have been opposed to it, and opposed to their attempts at distorting history.\nWhat was Guha's perspective on the partition of Bengal in 1947?\nNever discussed this specifically. He was unsentimental about it and seemed to have accepted it as a fact of life. But when I visited him in March this year, I asked him if he thought of his early days in Barisal in these final years of his life. He said, \"a lot. I think of my childhood days in Barisal all the time.\"\nDo you believe that the extensive discussions about Guha's legacies following his passing will reignite a debate on historiography or the approach to writing history in South Asia?\nI hope it does. That would be the best outcome. Among all the tributes, however, there has already been a piece that I thought was particularly ungenerous, intellectually speaking. But that's how often South Asian academics argue, by putting people down, by dismissing their contributions, by ridiculing them. Maybe all this will eventually give rise to a debate that can elevate itself above the rhetoric of insults.\nHaving known Ranajit Guha for nearly five decades and being one of his close associates, considering Guha's life, what advice would you give to young historians?\nThat is a tough one. Best not to give any advice. An intellectual biography of Guha, if ever written, will make for a fascinating story of one very gifted Bengali-Indian intellectual and historian, living in self-exile for the majority part of his life but forever focused on the country he chose to leave, trying to make historical sense of life and politics as he had seen them. Perhaps others will draw their own lessons \u2013 not just academic lessons but lessons for life - from the substantial number of writings he has left behind. For at the end of the day, Guha was as much an intellectual and thinker as he was a historian. I think it would be wrong to reduce him simply to that last category. He looked upon History, the discipline, as a gateway to more general forms of thinking.\n\u00a0\n",

The US debt is soaring, hence America's current debt crisis. Yet, both Republicans and Democrats are missing the solution: stopping America's wars of choice and slashing military outlays.\nSuppose the government's debt had remained at a modest 35 percent of GDP, as in 2000. Today's debt would be $9 trillion, as opposed to $24 trillion. Why did the US government incur the excess $15 trillion in debt?\nThe single biggest answer is the US government's addiction to war and military spending. According to the Watson Institute at Brown University, the cost of US wars from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2022 amounted to a whopping $8 trillion, more than half of the extra $15 trillion in debt. The other $7 trillion arose roughly equally from budget deficits caused by the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTo surmount the debt crisis, the US needs to stop feeding the Military-Industrial Complex (MIC), the most powerful lobby in Washington. As President Dwight D Eisenhower famously warned on January 17, 1961, \"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\" Since 2000, the MIC has led the US into disastrous wars of choice in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and now Ukraine.\nThe MIC long ago adopted a winning political strategy by ensuring that the military budget reaches into every Congressional district. The Congressional Research Service recently reminded Congress, \"Defense spending touches every Member of Congress's district through pay and benefits for military service members and retirees, economic and environmental impact of installations, and procurement of weapons systems and parts from local industry, among other activities.\" Only a brave member of Congress would vote against the military-industry lobby, yet bravery is certainly no hallmark of Congress.\nThe US' annual military spending is now around $900 billion, roughly 40 percent of the world's total, and greater than the next 10 countries combined. US military spending in 2022 was triple that of China. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the military outlays for 2024-2033 will be a staggering $10.3 trillion on current baseline. A quarter or more of that could be avoided by ending its wars of choice, closing down many of the country's 800 or so military bases around the world, and negotiating new arms control agreements with China and Russia.\nYet, instead of peace through diplomacy and fiscal responsibility, the MIC regularly scares the American people with a comic-book style depiction of villains whom the US must stop at all costs. The post-2000 list has included Afghanistan's Taliban, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and recently, China's Xi Jinping. War, we are repeatedly told, is necessary for America's survival.\nA peace-oriented foreign policy would be opposed strenuously by the military-industrial lobby, but not by the public. Significant public pluralities already want less, not more, US involvement in other countries' affairs, and less, not more, US troop deployments overseas. Regarding Ukraine, Americans overwhelmingly want a \"minor role\" (52 percent) rather than a \"major role\" (26 percent) in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This is why neither Biden nor any recent president has dared to ask Congress for any tax increase to pay for the US' wars. The public's response would be a resounding \"No!\"\nWhile America's wars of choice have been awful for the country, they have been far greater disasters for countries that it purports to be saving. As Henry Kissinger famously quipped, \"To be an enemy of the United States can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.\" Afghanistan was America's cause during 2001 to 2021, until the US left it broken, bankrupt, and hungry. Ukraine is now in America's embrace, with the same likely results: ongoing war, death, and destruction.\nThe military budget could be cut prudently and deeply if the US replaced its wars of choice and arms races with real diplomacy and arms agreements. If presidents and Congresses had only heeded the warnings of top American diplomats such as William Burns, the US ambassador to Russia in 2008, and now CIA director, the US would have protected Ukraine's security through diplomacy, agreeing with Russia that the US would not expand Nato into Ukraine if Russia also kept its military out of Ukraine. Yet, relentless Nato expansion is a favourite cause of the MIC; new Nato members are major customers of US armaments.\nThe US has also unilaterally abandoned key arms control agreements. In 2002, the country unilaterally walked out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And rather than promote nuclear disarmament, as the US and other nuclear powers are required to do under Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the MIC has sold the Congress on plans to spend more than $600 billion by 2030 to \"modernise\" the US nuclear arsenal.\nNow the MIC is talking up the prospect of war with China over Taiwan. The drumbeats of war with China are stoking the military budget, yet war with China is easily avoidable if the US adheres to the One China policy that properly underpins US-China relations. Such a war should be unthinkable. More than bankrupting the US, it could end the world.\nMilitary spending is not the only budget challenge. Ageing and rising healthcare costs add to the fiscal woes. According to the Congressional Budget Office, debt will reach 185 percent of GDP by 2052 if current policies remain unchanged. Healthcare costs should be capped while taxes on the rich should be raised. Yet, facing down the military-industrial lobby is the vital first step to putting America's fiscal house in order, needed to save the country, and possibly the world, from America's perverse lobby-driven politics.\n\u00a0\nJeffrey D Sachs\u00a0is a world-renowned economist, academic, and public policy analyst who serves as the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University.\n\n",

There are concerns that CO2 levels are heading in the wrong direction at precisely the wrong time.\nMany measures can be introduced to reduce the environmental burden of garment production. The one thing they all have in common, though, is the cost. In some cases, there are exorbitant costs involved. There are several reasons for this. The first is the technology involved. The second is that it is often easier \u2013 and more beneficial \u2013 to build a completely new factory to the highest possible environmental specifications than to \"retrofit\" an existing production unit.\nIt is my firm belief that as global fashion supply chains are \"greened\" we will see more and more newbuild factories, with access to renewable energy, the latest and most efficient effluent treatment technology, and all other kinds of benefits.\nAnd yet, the cost of a newbuild garment factory is significant. These costs can vary around the world depending on various factors, such as location, size, construction quality, labour, machinery and equipment, and any additional features or requirements specific to the factory. To provide a rough estimate, this cost can range from a few hundred thousand dollars for a small-scale facility to several million dollars for a larger state-of-the-art factory. The latter is what we are looking at and what many of the world's leading garment factories (in terms of reduced environmental footprint) will spend to build.\n\nIn Bangladesh, we once had more than 5,000 garment factories. That number has diminished in recent years and I am doubtful as to whether we will ever reach 5,000 again. We have seen smaller operators go bust or find themselves unable to keep up with the pace of change. Sub-contracting has also reduced as buyers have demanded that less production is outsourced to poorly regulated operators. The pandemic also led to some factories falling by the wayside.\nThe relevance of all this is that it does raise a vital question: will the shift towards sustainable fashion supply chains lead to a corresponding consolidation of the industry? Will we see an industry which has fewer and larger players? In Bangladesh, we once had more than 5,000 garment factories. That number has diminished in recent years and I am doubtful as to whether we will ever reach 5,000 again. We have seen smaller operators go bust or find themselves unable to keep up with the pace of change. Sub-contracting has also reduced as buyers have demanded that less production is outsourced to poorly regulated operators. The pandemic also led to some factories falling by the wayside.\nBut I also think we could be starting to see a trend whereby garment production becomes more and more consolidated into fewer, larger factories that have the financial clout to meet the highest environmental standards. When one considers this issue logically, it is the only rational way forward.\nIt is worth pointing out that, in recent years, we have already seen some of the world's largest textile chemical companies merge. Joint ventures and acquisitions have become common in that segment as the cost of regulation makes economies of scale vital.\nI expect garment production itself to follow suit. I believe we could see the rise of the super-factory, not just in Bangladesh, but also in other textile production hubs such as India, Pakistan and Vietnam.\nIs this necessarily a bad thing? Is it wrong that only the largest players will be in a position to successfully compete while also meeting environmental and compliance issues? I think in the shift towards larger conglomerates, we may lose something along the way in regards to the rich and varied nature of our proud garment industry.\nAt the same time, size and scale might also bring benefits. Larger players are better structured at an operational level. They might have whole teams in place, whereas smaller factories may have just one person. They are more sophisticated in terms of human resource management, marketing, public relations and legal issues. In short, they have much more in common with the multinational buyers they are working with.\nThis, in turn, could ensure they are treated more fairly as equal partners than in the past when the buyer-supplier relationship felt unequal and adversarial at times. Another factor is that the more factories you have, the more likely there will be one factory prepared to undercut the rest on pricing issues. As the saying goes, you are only as good as your weakest link. At times, our weakest link(s) has often been our undoing as an industry. The vast, sprawling and often fragmented nature of our garment industry has probably worked against us when it comes to pricing and negotiating with buyers.\nBy way of contrast, a smaller batch of genuinely world-class operators is arguably a much better fit for our country moving forward. Such an industry will better suited to evolve, innovate and introduce the kind of continuous improvement and best practice programmes that our global client base is increasingly demanding as a prerequisite for doing business.\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "As the next parliamentary election approaches, it is becoming increasingly clearer that the promises of a \"level playing field\" for the opposition are nothing beyond mere rhetoric. Yet again, BNP rallies in at least four districts have allegedly been foiled by members of the ruling party and law enforcement agencies. According to our report, at least 40 people were injured in Khulna, and at least 30 people in Patuakhali town, with the police using firearms and tear gas shells during clashes between AL and BNP activists during the first two days of the latter's countrywide demonstrations. BNP members also alleged that members of the ruling party, aided by police, attacked them in Rajbari, Netrakona and Mymensingh.\nIn an inevitable unfolding of the narrative, law enforcers have claimed that it was the BNP activists who started attacking members of the ruling party and the law enforcement. They have already filed cases against 48 BNP activists and hundreds of unnamed people in Khulna, and are planning to do the same in other districts. We may have had doubts about the veracity of the BNP's claims, had similar incidents of provocation and violence not taken place across the country over the past year whenever the party declared agitations. At this point, it seems almost futile to ask what logic there might be in BNP attacking law enforcers and risking mass arrests at such a crucial time of their movement. It is even more pointless to have to point out the uncanny coincidence of AL holding counter-programmes at the same place and time as the BNP, resulting in inescapable clashes.\nSurely, the ruling regime understands that the more it attacks the BNP, the less reassuring its promises of ensuring a free, fair and participatory election appears to those concerned. If it cannot even provide space for an opposition to carry out its constitutional right of freedom of expression and assembly, how can we be confident that it can take a backseat and allow the Election Commission to do its job during the elections? The only way it can convince anyone of its commitment to a fair election is by engaging in fair play. Unfortunately, the AL and its prominent leaders seem more bent on playing their usual game of confrontation and intimidation, and in the process, proving the BNP's claims that a fair election is simply not possible under the present government.\nFor all concerned, particularly the people of this country, we urge the AL to respect the constitutional rights of the opposition. They need to have faith in their own programmes and pledges to the people, instead of needlessly engaging in confrontational politics.\n",

According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) started constructing a railway overpass in February 2017 to ease traffic congestion around that area. Although the project was supposed to be complete within a year and a half, it remains unfinished to this day. As a result, people's sufferings have increased manifold as they now have to face increased traffic jam due to the chaos created on the project site. Their misery is further compounded during monsoon, when parts of the area become waterlogged. In addition, local businessmen are said to be counting losses since customers tend to avoid the area often.\nSo, why couldn't the RHD complete this relatively small construction project \u2013 involving a 780-metre overpass \u2013 in six years? A local representative of the contracting firm in charge of construction has claimed that the slow progress was due mainly to complications in land acquisition. This may be a contributing factor, but it doesn't justify the unusually long delay, and it shouldn't certainly have been unpredictable for those who planned the project. Equally importantly, shouldn't the authorities have started physical work only\u00a0after\u00a0land acquisition and other preliminary tasks were done? People wouldn't have suffered unnecessarily had those tasks been timed judiciously.\nLike many other development projects in the country, this one too seems to have been plagued by poor planning, mismanagement and inefficiency. The possibility of corruption cannot be ruled out either. Reportedly, the duration of the project has already been extended four times, while the budget has also doubled. And now we are told that the RHD will apply for another time extension until December. This is totally unacceptable.\nWe strongly protest the manner in which government agencies have normalised such costly project revisions over the last decade or so. The RHD must be held accountable for its failure, and complete the Jamalpur overpass project without further delay.\n",

        "full_article": "While the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) finds the prevalence of poverty in the country dropping by 4.3 percentage points and extreme poverty by 3.2 points in 2019-2022, a substantial period of which witnessed corona pandemic, it does not fail to notice the emergence of the 'new poor'. The state-run institute places them under a new category. The fact comes from a presentation made by the BIDS on May 17. Apart from poverty, its extensive research touches upon varied socio-economic areas affected by the dislocations caused by the pandemic. It's true during the period mentioned, Bangladesh, like the majority of countries in the world, has passed through a series of major and minor social and economic uncertainties. Loss of livelihoods, particularly for day labourers and workers in the informal sector, on account of lockdowns for lengthy periods caused them immense sufferings. Coming to the point of the claims by a section of people that the country's poverty situation worsened significantly during Covid-19, the BIDS director general (DG) said that the organisation had examined the claims. The analysis of poverty dynamics reveals that urban chronic poverty is still there even in a fast-growing city like Dhaka.The study observes that about one-tenth of the urban population belongs to this category. It recognises that the emergence of the 'new poor' as a social class is a fallout of the pandemic. According to the BIDS, a total of 51 per cent people belong to this segment. The adversities stemming from the Covid-19 economic recession in the country have long been singled out. Apart from the comfortably ensconced affluent classes, almost all social segments have adversely been affected during the punishing times of the pandemic and its aftermath. Many families from middle and lower-middle class saw a sharp fall in their living standards due to shrinking income. During the corona period, the above-mentioned 51 per cent or around 15 million people have slipped below the poverty line after losing their income sources. If food intake was the first to be affected, the BIDS data don't fail to throw focus on a socially vital area --- children's education. As the survey has found, 23.5 per cent of extreme poor households reported that they had to stop their children's education --- 13.6 per cent for the poor, 10.3 per cent for the lower middle class and 8.0 per cent for the upper middle class. The study suggests introduction of a special education recovery programme for the poor urban families to minimise the students' learning losses.While presenting the BIDS research work, the head of the state think tank found the findings of some studies conducted during the pandemic not credible and 'temporary' in nature. Undeniably, findings of surveys done during the peak-pandemic time and later would differ. But what should be of serious concern to the policymakers is the one-tenth of urban population's slip into the category of the 'new poor'. Their priority task should be to help the hapless people gradually recover their lost economic status. The government should actively consider bringing them under the social safety net programmes.",

        "full_article": "The best indicator of any economy is the common people's standard of living. So, from that point of view, it cannot be said that the economy of the country is performing well. To be frank, the per capita income as measured by dividing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the country's population is an abstract figure and does not say much about the actual income of the common people. The latest figure on the nation's per capita income, for example, as told by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), is US$2,765. In the last financial year (FY 2021-22), it was US$2,793. This means, in the current fiscal, the national per capita income has dropped by US$28, which, in percentage, is equivalent to a reduction of 1.0 per cent from what it was in the last financial year. But even after the fall, which the BBS attributes to the depreciation of taka against US dollar, the figure for the country's per head annual income in local currency is still Tk298,620 (assuming 1 US$ equal to Tk108 as of May 17). Dividing it by 12, the monthly income of people comes to around Tk 24,885. But does this figure really reflect the actual income of an average citizen? Even if one accepts for argument's sake that the daily wage labourers, rickshaw and pushcart drivers, domestic workers, small traders (hawkers, for instance) and the fixed-income earners in the lowest income category (the so-called Class IV employees) really earn this amount of money every month, will it be enough to feed an average four-member family, let alone meet its other costs including house rent, healthcare and education for children? But the truth is the low-income people, who make up the overwhelming majority of the population, earn far below that amount. And given the galloping prices of essential commodities, rising transport fares and inflating healthcare costs, it is becoming increasingly difficult even for the average middle-income families to make both ends meet. In truth, it is the runaway inflation that is now the main concern of the members of the general public. At a recent discussion event organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), a multidisciplinary development-focused autonomous public research body, speakers stressed the urgency of bringing the inflation under control. When the inflation rate is falling in the global context, it is showing an upward trend in Bangladesh, they pointed out. In last March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to as high as 9.33 per cent, though last month (in April) it slightly fell to 9.24 per cent. Compared to last year (April, 2022), when the CPI was 6.29, last April's CPI figure at 9.24 registered an increase of 2.95 percentage points. This is as good as saying that the CPI in April 2023 increased by close to 47 per cent [increase in percentage points (2.95) divided by the base year's (April 2022's) CPI(6.29)].Of course, the depreciating taka against the US dollar (USD) is directly connected to the rising prices of imported commodities including food grains, edible oils and spices, which is driving up inflation. But food prices are falling, not increasing, in the international market. Even so, the prices of those goods in the local market are showing no sign of decreasing. One of the speakers, Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the private think tank, Policy Research Institute, held that difference in taka-USD exchange rate may account for 20 to 25 per cent increase in commodity prices. But the prices of edible oil and sugar both of which are mostly imported commodities have gone up by 100 per cent. How to explain it? So, there is no shortcut way of explaining away the inflation as the product of depreciation of taka, Ukraine war and so on and so forth. The falling forex reserve has evidently triggered an increase in the demand for USD, a factor driving down the value of taka. It is common knowledge that it (forex reserve crisis) has been falling due mainly to the decline in the volume of inward remittance through official channel and the earning from export staying at a moderate level. The government has already been exercising austerity, especially in terms of government expenditures in foreign currency as well as import control. Meanwhile, the current account is also running a deficit of US$2.21 billion during the last three quarters of the current fiscal year, though during the same period in the last fiscal it was enjoying a surplus of US$11.92 billion, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) records say. A negative current account balance is not in itself alarming, but it may not be so when the foreign currency earning is on the decline and the forex reserve is fast depleting. What is further concerning is that in such a situation businesses as well as individuals try to save US dollar thereby further depreciating the value of taka. Obviously, such behaviour on the part of some businesses and individuals leads to pushing up inflation. The 9.0 per cent interest rate cap, some economists suggested, should be withdrawn to make funds costlier with a view to taming inflation. But there is no silver bullet to address a problem as complicated as inflation. To be fair, leaving everything to the market is also not going to resolve the issue. So, the government will have to adopt a raft of measures to control inflation. A foolproof measure has to be put in place to deal with hundi-a major driver of taka's depreciation against USD as well as the fall in the forex reserve. To reduce hundi's demand, corporate management has to be strengthened. Also, transfer of remittance dollars should be made easier and faster.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The authorities are harping on the same tune for quite some time: if price of onion does not come down, arrangement will be made for import of this essential item. Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi tried to be a little more precise on Friday last when he stated that if price of the item does not drop within a day or two, onion will once again be imported from India. This is rather strange. Who does not feel that the prices of not only of this tuber-cum-spice-cum-vegetable on high demand before the Eid-ul-Adha have been intriguingly manipulated by business syndicates? They are the last actors to bring down the prices of all such items on their own ahead of the second most religious festival in the country. Already the price hike of onion has been almost two and a half times more compared to the time of Eid-ul-Fitr. When will the process of onion import get going? Isn't Tk 90 a kilogram of onion unreasonable enough for initiating some administrative measures either to contain the price or import the item? In the first place, there is no plausible reason for any increase in onion price. Bangladesh had record yield of onion at more than 3.4 million tonnes and the present stock is more than 1.8 million tonnes. Price slump immediately after harvest disappointed farmers as losses stared in their faces. Then what has happened by this time that the price will continue to soar unbridled? If the trend continues, soon it will cross the Tk 100 mark for a kilogram of onion. The happenings in the intervening period are nothing but intrigues by business syndicates. Quite clearly, once the growers have disposed of their produce at a very low price, the middlemen and trade syndicates started to take over. They built up their stocks in order to control the supply line and push up the price at will. In a record harvest year, this would have been impossible if the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection and the Ministry of Commerce monitored and intervened to bust the syndicate. The decision not to import onion from India which also had a bumper harvest has not protected the interests of farmers, rather it has given the handle to stockists and traders to play foul with the market forces. When price of onion was raised by Tk10-20 within a week, the authorities should have intervened to see where things had gone wrong. Instead, the litany of 'will import onion if price does not fall' (as if it will do so automatically!) has been going on endlessly. It appears, the business syndicates could not care less. The reason is quite obvious. When an overwhelming majority of businesspeople find their places in parliament, no minister can carry out popular agenda counter to the interests of the group of lawmakers. In India a kilogram of onion is priced at Rs 30-35 and had it been imported earlier, the trade syndicate could not take the consumers for a ride like this. It takes sometime to complete official procedures before import can be started. By the time it will be done, if the decision is at all taken in favour of import, the onion syndicate will have made an unearned income of billions of taka. Significantly before the Eid-ul Adha, other spices have also recorded price hikes twice as much. Zinger priced at Tk 180 before Eid-ul-Fitr, is now selling at Tk 300 at the lowest and, according to report, the imported Chinese variety at Tk 400 a kilo. Cumin seed has become dearer by Tk 300 a kilo within a week to register record prices at Tk 800-900 depending on their qualities. If this is not ploys of business syndicates at full play, what is it? This explains why some people are making too much money at the cost of the general public, the middle class and the low-income segments of which are now writhing under the artificially triggered oppressive market volatility. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
