Apart from a clear expression of its willingness to work with like-minded secular parties, the Congress has resolved to pursue a sharp social justice agenda, a paradigm shift for a party. While the party has always had a welfare agenda, it failed to accommodate the political aspirations of the subalterns who increasingly found other parties more suitable. The party adapted a separate resolution on social justice, and promised a dedicated ministry for the empowerment of the Other Backward Classes (OBC), creation of a National Council for Social Justice, publication of an annual \u201cState of Social Justice\u201d report on the lines of the national Economic Survey, reservation in higher judiciary for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and OBCs and a Rohit Vemula Act for students of disadvantaged sections if elected to power. Having lost out to regional parties in the post-Mandal era, the party is now aiming to woo the subalterns to its fold. So, as a start, it amended its own constitution to reserve half of the seats to the Congress Working Committee for SCs, STs, OBCs, women and minorities. The party\u2019s pious declarations at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir last year were almost immediately abandoned, and it will be watched for its adherence to the Raipur resolutions in the coming months.The party has promised \u201cSampoorna Samajik Suraksha\u201d, a social security framework that will have legal guarantees for minimum income and social security for the poor. It also promises a universal basket of entitlements to all Indians, namely right to basic income through Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay), right to health, pensions for single women, the elderly and persons with disabilities, a comprehensive Integrated Child Development Scheme in line with the National Food Security Act, and quality elementary schooling and maternity entitlements. A new welfare framework is being debated all over the world to mitigate growing inequities and other challenges such as unemployment and underemployment, and the Congress\u2019s ideas should spur a fresh, informed debate in India. Though the party had banked on NYAY or a universal income scheme before the 2019 general election, it did not gain any electoral dividends. The party now hopes that the promise of a better future with assured income, which also accounts for social identity, could counter the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u2019s Hindutva plus. By acknowledging the fact that inequality is not merely material, and discrimination is not only along religious lines, the Congress has taken the debate beyond the secular-communal binary that has worked to the BJP\u2019s advantage in recent years. For this strategy to be successful, the Congress will have to build a robust political campaign aligned to its new thinking, breaking away from its characteristic timidity.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn \n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nChhattisgarh\n\n/\n\npolitics",

It was Australia\u2019s sixth victory in what was the eighth edition of the tournament. Australia has also been the champion in seven out of the 12 Women\u2019s Cricket (ODI) World Cups. In Tests too \u2014 regrettably, there are very few of them for women these days \u2014 Australia has the best percentage of wins among all the teams. The Aussies had arrived in South Africa for the World Cup with a remarkable record in the T20 format. In three years, they had lost only once, that too in the Super Over to India at Navi Mumbai in December. It was India that ended an even more spectacular run by Australia: 26 ODI wins. And that victory in 2021 had come in Australia\u2019s own backyard. The Indian women had an excellent opportunity to stop their formidable rival\u2019s run at the World Cup in South Africa, too. In the semifinal, they were well placed in their chase of a challenging target until Harmanpreet Kaur was run out after her bat got stuck.The other semifinal, however, saw a major upset, with the host defeating England. There had already been excellent crowds for the tournament, but South Africa\u2019s presence in the final ensured a full house at the Newlands Cricket Ground. The South African women may have stumbled on the final hurdle, but their campaign was probably the real story of the World Cup. They had entered the tournament amid a controversy: the captain, Dane van Niekerk, had been dropped on fitness grounds (she failed to reach the two-kilometre running benchmark by 18 seconds). And they were stunned by Sri Lanka in the opening match. But, under the captaincy of Sune Luus, they bounced back admirably and went on to become the first South African team, male or female, to enter a cricket World Cup final. It should be a major impetus to the women\u2019s sport, not just cricket, in South Africa, a country that paid a heavy price for its apartheid policy. It may be pertinent to note that Nelson Mandela, South Africa\u2019s first Black President, had successfully used sport \u2014 the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which South Africa hosted and won \u2014 to unite a divided nation.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncricket\n\n/\n\nSouth Africa\n\n/\n\nTwenty20 World Cup",

        "full_article": "Governments must take note of CJI\u2019s observation that increased litigation on medical education signals the need for reforms. Courts indeed deal with a bewildering number of cases on exams or on allocation of seats in government and medical colleges, or disputes in admission and marking of quotas, or pleas from petulant private colleges. Many recent cases dealt with what in a well-oiled machinery would be a simple administrative matter \u2013 dates of exams for MBBS doctors to pursue specialisation, the NEET-PG. No doubt the pandemic threw the schedule into chaos as the 2020 exam had to be postponed. But it should not need another three years for the roster to right itself. That students have repeatedly had to move court is reflective of the poor administration at the National Board of Exams that conducts the test to fill 40,000 seats in over 6,000 government and private universities, as well as poor communication with central and state medical colleges.\nSimilarly, failure of the medical education system to accommodate students from warzone Ukraine highlighted its rigidity. Straitjacket can-do, can\u2019t-dos ensured no state or university could make place for them without falling foul of the regulatory regime. The students, therefore, moved court. Yet the same regulatory and monitoring framework, led by the National Medical Council (NMC), can\u2019t maintain standards when it comes to regulating medical colleges on infrastructure or faculty or fees. Court involvement does not always end with greater public good either. For instance, a Supreme Court panel inspection in 2019 found a medical college that NMC had cleared, unfit to train doctors and using fictitious patients. The fallout was that NMC stopped making public its assessment reports.\nThat said, courts too add to the caseload burden with adjournments and by entertaining pleas from private colleges with deep pockets. Every such college rejected by NMC, or the earlier Medical Council of India, moves court; the matter invariably gets mired in adjournments or review or a stay. It may thus be an idea also for courts to review the basis to admit those cases that may not warrant its attention.\n\u00a0\n\n",

Last year\u2019s murderous spree by terrorists had claimed lives of Kashmiri Pandits, non-Kashmiri migrant labourers, and locals who were seen as supporters of the administration. And although the J&K police had called 2022 a very successful year in terms of anti-terror operations \u2013 172 terrorists were neutralised \u2013 it\u2019s also true that targeted killings are a chilling reminder of what still haunts Kashmir.\nThe tragic sub-story is that Kashmiri Pandits are now prime terror targets again given GoI\u2019s focus on the resettlement and jobs programme for the community, and also thanks to terrorists\u2019 and their Pakistani backers\u2019 frustration at the success of the joint security mechanism. This had, post nullification of Article 370 in 2019, kept the security situation in J&K relatively stable. Terrorists switched to targeted killings using existing over-ground networks \u2013 many affiliated to these are juvenile and not on police watchlists. Experts are calling this hybrid militancy. Assassinating Kashmiri Pandits serves terrorists\u2019 dual purpose of communalising tragedy and undermining any sense of normalcy among locals. The only way to snuff out this threat is by cutting off oxygen to the entire terror-radicalism ecosystem. And that can\u2019t be achieved through security measures alone \u2013 in part because extensive combing operations, even when they catch the real bad guys, have their own negative impact.\nKashmir needs political representation \u2013 not just to give locals a chance to elect a new government but to check the spread of radicalism that has continued even after 2019. Politicians with a stake in the system are often effective influencers. But despite the delimitation exercise and revision of electoral rolls for J&K being completed last year, there is still no word on when assembly polls will be held. The Election Commission has a window as summer approaches and mountain passes melt. Remember, with Pakistan off the FATF grey list, cash flows to Valley\u2019s terror networks are expected to increase. J&K, therefore, needs a functioning elected government, and one which works closely with security forces.\n\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "It has been a year since the new Election Commission (EC) was constituted according to a law that has stipulated the qualifications of the chief election commissioner (CEC) and other commissioners, as well as their recruitment process \u2013 although the law itself is not above controversy. Since the new EC's appointment, the government and the ruling party have been relentlessly trying to pursue and convince everyone within the country as well as the interested international observers that this institution has the capacity and authority to conduct all elections in Bangladesh independently, ensuring fairness.\nHowever, the functioning and the activities of the new EC, including the election of the new president, local government (zilla parishad) elections and a few parliamentary by-elections during the last one year, have been the least convincing of that idea. The lone issue where the commission has proven its resolve is its tireless but irrational push for procuring Electronic Voting Machines (EVM), even in the middle of a severe economic strain that the nation has been facing. It appeared to be an attempt to please the ruling Awami League, which had been insisting on using EVMs instead of paper ballots in the next parliamentary election until they, too, accepted the reality that there was no money for it.\nPutting this EVM debate aside, let's look at the records of the elections the new EC has presided over so far. It must be noted that the EC's firm handling of the botched by-election to Gaibandha-5 constituency on October 12, 2022 showed some encouraging bravery on its part, when it suspended voting amid widespread irregularities four hours after it started. Those irregularities included people either illegally supporting or forcing voters to cast ballots, polling agents wearing clothes bearing the symbol of their nominees, and illegal entry into restricted rooms. CEC Kazi Habibul Awal and his fellow commissioners watched all these violations taking place from the EC office, Nirbachan Bhaban, in Dhaka, hundreds of kilometres away on big monitors through CCTV feeds.\nThough the Awami League leadership questioned the EC's decision, they promptly argued that the decision proved the EC had always been in control of elections in the country and the BNP's demand for a poll-time caretaker government was unjustified. The EC, however, ditched the CCTV project to monitor elections real time in all subsequent elections citing lack of resources, which only requires a fraction of the highly ambitious and exorbitantly expensive EVMs. Reports of widespread irregularities and malpractices in the recently held by-elections in Brahmanbaria, Bogura and Chapainawabganj were simply overlooked by the EC, which was a complete reversal of Gaibandha in 2022.\nOne of the worst failures of the EC, however, was not investigating the alleged disappearance of a candidate in Brahmanbaria and his agent. The alleged victim, Asif Ahmed, later told journalists that members of the ruling party were the people who would be able to explain his mysterious disappearance. The EC, however, chose to look away.\nBefore that, the disappearance of a contestant ahead of election day was unheard of in any election in the country. There are considerable concerns among observers and opposition parties that enforced disappearances for a shorter term could be a new tactic to be deployed in the coming general election. After all, from what the past experiences show, victims of enforced disappearance get so traumatised that they never dare to speak about their ordeals.\nIf these failures do not make one realise the new EC's inability to rise above partisan bias and its subservience to the government of the day, look at its latest goof-up in the election process for the new president. It's the question of following the procedure and its own rules. The election schedule announced by the EC stated the date for withdrawal of nomination papers to be February 14, 2023 till 4pm. But the returning officer, CEC Kazi Habibul Awal, declared the lone contestant and the ruling party Awami League nominee, Md Shahabuddin, elected on February 13. Nobody is suggesting that the president-elect would have pulled out of the race at that stage, but the question of complying with its own time frame by the EC is not a trivial matter. The EC and returning officers are bound by the schedule, even if the election is uncontested. As the Representation of the People Order (RPO) provides the basic guiding principles for all elections in the country, strict abidance of the schedule is quite crucial.\nWhat prompted such a technical but legally crucial failure on the EC's part? Doesn't it reflect badly on their competence? Was it their excitement for having an uncontested election for the top job of the republic? If ignoring election rules was not the result of negligence of its duty, the only other explanation that comes to mind is partisan behaviour.\nRegaining public confidence and trust in the Election Commission, which have been systematically destroyed by two previous commissions, is undoubtedly a tough task. Unfortunately, it seems the current EC, too, is failing us miserably.\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist. His Twitter handle is @ahmedka1\n\n",

        "full_article": "Playgrounds are necessary for the sound development of our future generation. However, due to various reasons such as occupation, renovation, and repurposing, Dhaka city has been fast losing the few playgrounds it has. Take the Lalmatia Block D playground, for example. Reportedly, for the past three months, the contractors in charge of its renovation have been saying that it will be open for all soon, but that day has yet to arrive. The deadline for finishing the project was June 2022. However, the subcontractors say that they have missed the deadline because of the pandemic. Currently, the caretaker of the playground refuses to let children in to play at the park.\nAdditionally, three other parks \u2013 Trikona Park in Lalmatia near Town Hall, Shahid Park, and Sonali Playground in Mohammadpur \u2013 are also \"under renovation.\" The project director had said that these three parks would be activated in the last week of February. However, when our reporter went to visit Trikona park recently, he found that development work was going on. The project director said that the delay was caused due to planning complexities. But, as the planners used up time pondering whether or not to build a footbridge, the children of the area (who came to know of this spot as their primary place for sports and recreation) suffered. Only the Sonali playground is now partly operational, giving some scope to the area's children for play.\nOpportunities for sports and recreation are instrumental in the development of children. Without access to playtime, the physical and mental growth of children can be severely hindered. This has become worse due to the pandemic. Yet, 25 out of 75 wards under Dhaka South City Corporation and 10 out of 55 wards under Dhaka North City Corporation do not have a single park or playground, according to the new detailed area plan (DAP). Even where there are parks, there are also efforts to snatch them away. For example, last year, the Tetultala playground in the capital's Kalaban was being planned to be used for constructing a police station. Thankfully, the higher authorities stepped in due to vehement protests by locals. But is this sustainable? Do children and other locals have to go on strike every time a new decision of eating up an open space comes about?\nOne of the major reasons for urban planners and psychologists of saying that Dhaka is unsuitable for children is the city's lack of playgrounds. In the last 22 years, however, the number of playgrounds in Dhaka has come down from 150 to only 24. We urge authorities to save the playgrounds that are currently in danger and to also create more spaces where our children can play freely.\n",

        "full_article": "Season 2 of Coke Studio Bangla opened with an innovative, colourful, and vibrant song:\u00a0Murir Tin. It's a phenomenal creation for so many different reasons. It challenges our educated, elite obsession with \"standardised Bangla\" (promito\u00a0Bangla), which has long been considered an indicator of socio-economic-cultural capital. Any deviation from the standardised Bangla or any regional accent has often been deemed \"unacceptable\" and \"inappropriate.\" As someone whose parents migrated from Rangpur to Dhaka and who grew up in in the capital, I never learnt how to speak the Rangpur dialect. My father has a strong regional accent. While growing up, I was taught to believe that my dad's accent was not cool and the right way to speak was in my \"standardised\" Bangla that I learnt in school and from watching mostly BTV. As an adult, I now lament the loss of a part of my Rangpur heritage.\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0blew my mind when I saw these young men writing songs and singing in their own regional dialects. They nurtured their heritage and made a conscious effort to circulate it.\nBangla music is increasingly getting more and more transnational.\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0is a creative fusion of local tunes and American bluegrass and rap music. Bluegrass music originated from the struggles of white working-class communities living in the Appalachian region of the US during and after the Great Depression in the 1940s. Bluegrass composers and listeners come from both conservative, old, white communities and progressive, young, diverse communities. The progressive turn in bluegrass music incorporated stronger themes around working-class concerns and criticism of powerful institutions (Harvard Political Review, 2020). Whereas most of the bluegrass musicians and listeners are white, rap \u2013 which is a part of the larger hip-hop culture in the US \u2013 originated in African-American and Afro-Caribbean as well as in some Latinx communities struggling with drug and gang-related violence in the 1960s and 1970s. With the advancement of globalisation, hip-hop culture has gone global and been localised to regional socio-economic-political struggles. Central to global rap music has historically been amplifying concerns of marginalised and minoritised communities (Young, 2016).\nIt is not surprising that a song like\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0that borrows inspiration and style from two prominent global working-class-focused musical genres would highlight class struggles.\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0talks about old, broken, crowded local buses and deplorable public transportation in general, the unbearable traffic that kills hours after hours, roads filled with potholes and defects, fighting over getting a seat especially for female passengers, as well as the daily struggles of workers in the transportation system. As Shayan Chowdhury Arnob rightly points out, \"The traffic is so stressful that humour is the only tool to cope with the stress.\"\nSince 2018, Bangladesh has observed a series of road safety protests led mainly by students and the youth. The protests called for attention to our failing road and transportation system, crashes, and fatalities that take away thousands of precious lives every year. Therefore, the song\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0is not just a testament to the historical clunky local buses roaming the streets in the 1980s. The public transportation system in Dhaka started with\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0(literal meaning: \"a can of puffed rice\") buses. After World War II, the leftover army trucks were sold in auctions at a lower price to wealthy, local business owners. The business owners\u00a0covered the wooden structure of these trucks with tin\u00a0and converted them into local buses. These buses were satirically called \"murir tin\" because of the rattling noise they made and the way they packed passengers to an extreme \u2013 just like a can full of puffed rice. As years passed, any bus that was old and crowded got the tag \"murir tin\" by the common public. The song\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0moved the nation not just because it brought forward a historical tradition and nostalgia. So many people were able to personally relate to the song because it is a testament to the continuing struggles of working-class people with public transportation.\nNevertheless,\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0specifically covered working-class\u00a0men's\u00a0experience. Almost all the characters featured in the \"Murir Tin | Behind the Magic\" video were men \u2013 except the Harmonica player and three backing vocalists. The lyrics were also composed by men based on their personal experiences, as mentioned in several interviews. Therefore, it's not surprising that\u00a0Murin Tin\u00a0talked about women's experience only in terms of \"ladies' seats\" being occupied by men. A 2022 survey found that 87 percent of women faced some form of harassment, including sexual abuse, in public transport at least once, and 36 percent experienced sexual harassment regularly in public transport.\n\nIt is not surprising that a song like\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0that borrows inspiration and style from two prominent global working-class-focused musical genres would highlight class struggles.\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0talks about old, broken, crowded local buses and deplorable public transportation in general, the unbearable traffic that kills hours after hours, roads filled with potholes and defects, fighting over getting a seat especially for female passengers, as well as the daily struggles of workers in the transportation system. As Shayan Chowdhury Arnob rightly points out, \"The traffic is so stressful that humour is the only tool to cope with the stress.\"\nViolence against women in public transport is not just a Bangladeshi problem. The 2012 Delhi gang rape in a bus and the feminist protests around the incident brought forward how unsafe public transport and public spaces have always been for women \u2013 something that was largely invisible in\u00a0Murir Tin.\nThe Coke Studio Bangla's YouTube channel describes the\u00a0murir tin\u00a0bus as a \"melting pot where the cultures and the people of Bangladesh come and go. Amid a crowd of common people, there lies #RealMagic.\" It further says that\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0is a unifying space for the people of Bangladesh where all share the same experience in terms of \"the journeys we take, the people we meet, the situations we encounter.\" Is women's experience of sexual harassment in a\u00a0murir tin\u00a0shared by men? Do men encounter the situations women face in public transport?\nAs a middle-class woman who occasionally used local buses in Dhaka, my experience was not as joyful and vibrant as the vibe the\u00a0Murir Tin\u00a0composition shared on stage. I did not have to rely on local buses all the time because of my class privilege. However, on some occasions, when I had to take local buses, the first thing I had to consider was how to save my body from unwanted touches, which meant trying to secure one of the very limited number of seats assigned for women, or trying to shield my body with my purse or backpack, or riding the bus with a group of friends who kept an eye on each other and protected each other if needed. Sitting in the last row and writing a song (\"pisur sidut boi ene lehir ei gaan\") would have been the last thing on my mind while riding a\u00a0murir tin.\nBoth bluegrass and rap have a male-dominated historical tradition. During bluegrass festivals, male musicians used to play tunes while their wives watched them from the sidelines. The bluegrass lyrics traditionally had a \"Madonna-whore\" complex that idealised mothers and maternal figures and justified violence against women committing adultery and/or anything that went against the norm of being a \"good woman\" (Levine, 2020). Later, some prominent women singers challenged the glass ceiling of bluegrass, and aspired to occupy the stage as bluegrass musicians.\nSimilarly, the rap industry has been historically male-dominated. Even though it brought forward class struggles, it primarily focused on men's struggles and involved hypersexualisation of and violence against women. Hypermasculinity, and often toxic masculinity, have been integral to being a male rapper. Many Black hip-hop feminists and singers have been trying to address this disparity and find a way to engage hip-hop sensibility with intersectional struggles.\nI was not surprised to see that\u00a0Murin Tin\u00a0\u2013 a composition inspired by bluegrass and rap music tradition \u2013 glamorised the hypermasculine performance of male rappers or ignored women's everyday struggles in public transport. However, the larger problem lies in the fact that major music roles in the industry \u2013 songwriting and production, in particular \u2013 are mostly occupied by men. The corporatisation of the local music industry has made it extremely difficult to bring radical changes within the existing structure that has already been profitable for music producers and their sponsors.\n\u00a0\nNafisa Tanjeem\u00a0is associate professor in the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Worcester State University in the US.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Playgrounds are necessary for the sound development of our future generation. However, due to various reasons such as occupation, renovation, and repurposing, Dhaka city has been fast losing the few playgrounds it has. Take the Lalmatia Block D playground, for example. Reportedly, for the past three months, the contractors in charge of its renovation have been saying that it will be open for all soon, but that day has yet to arrive. The deadline for finishing the project was June 2022. However, the subcontractors say that they have missed the deadline because of the pandemic. Currently, the caretaker of the playground refuses to let children in to play at the park.\nAdditionally, three other parks \u2013 Trikona Park in Lalmatia near Town Hall, Shahid Park, and Sonali Playground in Mohammadpur \u2013 are also \"under renovation.\" The project director had said that these three parks would be activated in the last week of February. However, when our reporter went to visit Trikona park recently, he found that development work was going on. The project director said that the delay was caused due to planning complexities. But, as the planners used up time pondering whether or not to build a footbridge, the children of the area (who came to know of this spot as their primary place for sports and recreation) suffered. Only the Sonali playground is now partly operational, giving some scope to the area's children for play.\nOpportunities for sports and recreation are instrumental in the development of children. Without access to playtime, the physical and mental growth of children can be severely hindered. This has become worse due to the pandemic. Yet, 25 out of 75 wards under Dhaka South City Corporation and 10 out of 55 wards under Dhaka North City Corporation do not have a single park or playground, according to the new detailed area plan (DAP). Even where there are parks, there are also efforts to snatch them away. For example, last year, the Tetultala playground in the capital's Kalaban was being planned to be used for constructing a police station. Thankfully, the higher authorities stepped in due to vehement protests by locals. But is this sustainable? Do children and other locals have to go on strike every time a new decision of eating up an open space comes about?\nOne of the major reasons for urban planners and psychologists of saying that Dhaka is unsuitable for children is the city's lack of playgrounds. In the last 22 years, however, the number of playgrounds in Dhaka has come down from 150 to only 24. We urge authorities to save the playgrounds that are currently in danger and to also create more spaces where our children can play freely.\n",

        "full_article": "Before every Ramadan, we see prices of essentials rising in our kitchen markets, in ways that defy logic. At a time when commodity prices are already sky-high, and people are suffering at an unprecedented level economically, the government needs to implement well-thought-out measures to curb commodity prices from rising any further. It is in such a context that the president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) recently commented that deployment of joint forces to keep watch on the essentials market during Ramadan would not yield the desired results. We believe that his comment should be taken seriously by the government in the interest of both consumers and the business community.\nThe joint forces were engaged in monitoring the market during the tenure of the last caretaker government. We understand that the business community is genuinely apprehensive about being harassed in the name of market monitoring. But at the same time, and more importantly, the tendency to artificially increase prices of essentials right before and during Ramadan must be addressed.\nThe government needs to conduct careful and detailed market analysis to solve the problem, instead of spewing arbitrary measures, hoping they would work. As the business community has said, to control prices from rising exorbitantly, the government must ensure the adequate availability of all items in the market. For that, import of essentials and their supply chains have to be made smoother. If the price of the dollar rises quickly, it is most likely that the business-people will transfer the additional costs onto consumers. The government, particularly the commerce ministry, has to keep a close eye on that.\nExtortionists often push up the prices of commodities in our markets. Such disruptive behaviours have to be reined in by the government. The hoarding of goods to fabricate their shortage must be stopped. Collusion among monopolists is another major reason why prices often go up more in the domestic market, as compared to the international market. The government has to try and increase the number of suppliers and increase competition to ensure commodity prices stay reasonable. Consequently, the government also has to make sure that its market monitoring mechanisms are well targeted. There have been times where we have seen traders colluding to artificially push prices up. Instead of harassing honest traders, the government's market monitoring objectives should be to identify such collusive behaviour and to punish those traders who try to manipulate the market.\nThe government does not have an easy task at hand here. Given our current reality, to prevent prices of essentials from increasing further, the government has to come up with a holistic approach. It should, therefore, involve experts, members of the business community, and all other stakeholders to come up with a comprehensive programme that takes all necessary factors into consideration.\n",

        "full_article": "Scheduled to be completed for operation by 2026, Matarbari deep-sea port is likely to unlock not only many times more the export-import prospect of the country but also become a port of call for neighbouring countries' mother vessels. The Chittagong Port Authority's (CPA's) chairman is not off the mark when he expresses his optimism that the port---one that is deep-sea in the true sense of the term ---will be the region's hub of export and import. But apart from the construction of a new port, the country's fourth, an access road to the port is also under construction. Besides, a coal-fired power plant is going to be set up along with developing an LNG terminal there. These are not coming up under a single project but these will call for coordinated management as if all are components of the same scheme. For maintaining ecological balance this would be a prerequisite. Perhaps it is on consideration of the implications of their combined environmental impacts that the chairman of the CPA has hastened to reassure that the new port and the other infrastructural facilities around would not be a cause for environmental damage there. An extensive plan has been devised to turn the port 'green' and 'eco-friendly'. The million-dollar question here is how? Vacant spaces there will have ample green cover with trees planted in a planned way. Well, if thick trees form a kind of woodland all around, it will certainly lessen to some extent the deleterious impacts of the large vessels with 16-18-metre draft that will berth there. How the thermal power plant will be eco-friendly remains unexplained. Of course, there are technologies that can significantly control pollution from coal-based power plants. These are FGD (flue gas desulfurization), ACI (activated carbon injection), FF (ACI with fabric filters), ESP (electrostatic precipitators) and DSI (dry sorbent injection). If all these are packaged in the form of an integrated flow solution, the pollution level can be brought down. But this is costly enough. The fact is, thermal power plant, LNG terminal and large ships using fossil fuels cannot be made eco-friendly beyond a modest level. No technology developed so far is hundred percent failsafe. Still the emission can be lessened and particulates arrested to a certain degree. If there are extensive tree covers, they will act as natural filters but still the environment will remain polluted. However, the initiatives considered for implementation is commendable because there is hardly any better alternative. There have been attempts to strike a balance between economic/commercial prerogatives and environmental compulsion. The hard reality is the inordinate time lag in cargo and container handling at Chittagong Port where vessels with draft more than 10 metres and 2,400 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) cannot berth. But when completed the Matarbari deep-sea port will allow vessels having draft up to 18 metres and 8,000 TEUs. That means several times more capacity enhancement of cargo and container handling. The target is to handle 4.0 million TEUs by 2033. It sounds good. If the new port becomes a regional export-import hub, it can help catapult the country's economy to the middle-income level by contributing 2.0-3.0 per cent to its GDP.",

        "full_article": "Even 2/3 years ago, the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh occupied a remarkable place in the world news media. After the Covid-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the Ukraine war, a fatigue appears to have gripped nations, especially those in the greater south and south-east Asian regions. Almost all of them have been hard hit by the post-corona economic impasse. Coming to the Rohingya crisis, many would like to describe the present situation as something like 'all quiet on the Rohingya front'. More than a couple of months after the Rohingya border guards' firing of shells visibly targeting the refugees, no major incidents occurred in Teknaf's Ukhiya area. The said area hosts 750,000 refugees who arrived in Bangladesh in 2017 fleeing the Myanmar Army's genocide in their native villages in the Rakhine state of the country.It's after a considerably long hiatus, that Bangladesh has raised the refugee issue. News reports have it that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on February 22 urged the United Nations to help Bangladesh in relocating Rohingyas to Bhasan Char, a coastal island in the Bay of Bengal. The Prime Minister made the plea while UN Resident Coordinator Gwyn Lewis called on her at her official residence Ganobhaban on the day. Elaborating, the Prime Minister mentioned that over one million Myanmar nationals, the Rohingyas, were now a big burden for Bangladesh. \"Their return to their homeland soon is uncertain. So I am requesting the UN to help Bangladesh relocate the Rohingyas to Bhasan Char,\" the PM said adding the island had been developed to provide better living condition to the Myanmar nationals.The PM said the forcibly displaced Rohingyas were living in an inhuman condition in Cox's Bazar amid uncertainty about their repatriation soon. Bangladesh has so far moved about 30,000 Rohingya refugees to Bhasan Char \"to ease crowding in the camps at Cox's Bazar.\" The Prime Minister's reference to the Bhasan Char refugees is set to give a new lease of life for the hapless refugees. On the other hand, many of them are reluctant to go back to Myanmar, and face fresh rounds of ethnic persecutions in the forms of killings, arson and sexual harassments let lose by the members of the country's military junta. Moreover, there is the anti-repatriation insurgent group ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) whose members have allegedly killed the pro-repatriation leader Muhibullah. Majority of the Rohingya refugees are peaceful and love to remain settled in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.With a view to making their life hazard-free, they wistfully looked to the democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Her role as a silent spectator to the Rohingya 'ethnic cleansing' has only appalled them. In media interviews at the refugee camps in Bangladesh, the Rohingya Muslim refugees seemed unanimous in their view that they didn't want to leave Rakhine. They have extended full support to Suu Kyi as their liberator. They were puzzled to find a different'democracy icon' in the later times.Many suspect that in spite of her humane and egalitarian policy, Suu Kyi used to oscillate between her youth's liberal humanism and her middle-age leaning towards extremism. Unfortunately, it has failed to save her. At the end, many feel like blaming Suu Kyi for driving a wedge between the common Rohingya Muslims and the Myanmar general people. It seems surprising that many countries around the world have extended their support to Bangladesh in its efforts to deal with the Rohingya refugee issue over the years; but finally they became less vocal. In the fast changing global scenario the Rohingya refugee issue began losing its relevance. In the meantime, the refugees still without regular shelters veritably swarmed on the Teknaf upazila's hilly areas and plain lands. Trees were felled indiscriminately and improvised huts built giving the neighbourhoods a shambolic look. It took a couple of years before the rehabilitation authorities were able to erect camps to house thousands of Rohingya refugees.In time Bangladesh realised that it had been caught in the soup. Some of the refugees were found involved in various kinds of illicit activities like human and drug trafficking, infightings and militant activities. Bangladesh had never thought that it would ever be sucked into a maze created by the Myanmar refugees. The case for the involvement of Bangladesh in the Rohingya imbroglio was not accidental. Watching the streams of refugees from the Rakhine state in Myanmar pour into Bangladesh to flee genocidal killings, Bangladesh welcomed them. Itself a developing country, it provided them with initial relief goods and shelter. Bangladesh had never thought that the Rohingyas would one day prove themselves to be the old man on the shoulders of the Sindbad. At present, few nations and organisations are by its side; it has to devise its own way in dealing with the Myanmar nationals. The Bhasan Char island-based shelter is one of them.Burdened with a total of one million Rohingya refugees including the earlier ones, Bangladesh now desperately looks for a way out of the deadlock. With few to turn to in these critical times, shelters on the islands may serve as a stopgap solution. It shouldn't stop Bangladesh or the regional powers from arranging meaningful talks with the Myanmar military junta. As a last resort, the nation can approach the West African nation Gambia to raise its voice one more time against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "This is the time of the year when the air is hot and dry. So, it is the perfect time for fire incidents. But as always, the awareness level of the public about possible fire mishaps remains as low as ever. The inevitable as a result happens. The fire service and civil defence as well as the two city corporation authorities did earlier declare that they would launch a drive to check if the city's buildings are maintaining the necessary fire-related and others safety protocols. Obviously, the fire department's collaborative move has seemingly been prompted by last week's (February 19's, to be particular) fire accident at a 14-storey apartment building in an affluent neighbourhood of the city, Gulshan. When this write-up was in progress, another report of fire came from the city's biggest slum, the so-called Korail basti, where a fire started at around 4:30 in the afternoon of Sunday and thanks to the timely intervention of the fire service team, the blaze could be brought under control without any report of casualties.However, slums are outside the purview of the fire service department's drive. So far as reports go, a day after the last week's Gulshan apartment fire that led two persons to jump to death from the high-rise, high officials of the fire service department visited the building that caught fire. Of the various safety flaws they could detect, the one that was striking was the lack of 'fire safety plan for the multistorey apartment. The building owner, however, could show a 'no objection certificate' from the appropriate authorities. It, however, would be an exercise in semantics to determine exactly where the fine line between the two kinds of certificates lies. For a question still remains unanswered. It is that the building owner could get away with the faulty, or even worse, non-existent fire safety clearance certificate and construct such a huge residential apartment complex under their (the fire service department's) very nose!And if the fire safety norms are so lax in such a wealthy district of the city, then what can one expect from the poorer quarters? The incident of 2019's Churihatta fire in Chowkbazar of the old Dhaka that took 71 lives has not yet faded from memory. Flammable chemical substances stored in the building triggered the devastating fire. There was yet another conflagration in 2010 at Nimtoli in Old Dhaka that claimed 124 lives. Again, chemicals for perfumery stored in shops helped the fire to engulf the entire area. But have those locations been cleared of the combustible chemicals including plastic factories as promised by the government at that time?The Gulshan fire may have been a wakeup call for the fire service and other authorities related to building construction in the city. What are they supposed to do? The members of the inspection team from the fire service and civil defence will be looking into issues like if the buildings have required fire safety measures in place, if the fire exits are wide enough and, perhaps, if the occupants of the buildings are duly responsive to the fire alarms. They will also see if the buildings are earthquake-resistant. The Rajuk will look into if building codes have been maintained. The defaulters would face penal measures. The drive at a point will be put off. The public and, maybe, the enforcement authorities, too, will forget about the issue. Then there will be another spurt of activity when, God forbid, another report of a major fire mishap comes.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
