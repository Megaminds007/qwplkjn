        "full_article": "The Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, a bloc of 28 parties that seeks to dislodge the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from power in 2024, appears unable to maintain a united front in the Assembly elections scheduled for November in five States. In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana, where the Congress is a key contender for power, no seat sharing with smaller constituents of the bloc has yet been announced. In Telangana, the Left, and in Madhya Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party (SP), feel let down by the Congress. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has been scathing in his attack on the Congress. The Aam Aadmi Party has gone ahead with its own plans in the election-going States, while its relations with the Congress in Punjab and Delhi continue to plummet. INDIA had to give up plans for a joint rally twice \u2014 in Bhopal and in Nagpur. All this is indicative of the headwinds that INDIA faces in translating the common interest of its partners into seat sharing and a joint campaign. The problems of unity are structural and tactical. Most of the regional outfits were born out of antagonism to the Congress, and despite a current common adversary, the trust deficit is huge.The internal dynamics within the Congress also create roadblocks to seat sharing. Rahul Gandhi and the central leadership of the party want to adopt a generous approach toward partners but State units in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana think otherwise. Meanwhile, the Congress in Rajasthan is also facing a challenge from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen which can capture a portion of its votes. Nationalist Congress Party veteran Sharad Pawar has suggested that INDIA partners should focus on the 2024 contest as varied situations make seat sharing difficult in regional elections. But the bad blood created in this election cycle could threaten unity efforts before 2024 too. The panels announced by the bloc at its Mumbai conclave in September to coordinate action on various fronts are stuttering. Constituents have diverging views on key issues being raised by the Congress such as crony capitalism of the BJP and caste census. The personal ambitions of leaders are also coming into play, a grim reminder of how coalition politics contributed to the ascent of majoritarianism, ahead of 2014. A front against the BJP will require a stronger Congress as its axis, and a deeper understanding and trust among its leaders that should also nudge them to look beyond their personal ambitions and outreach to parties such as the BSP which is currently not a part of the bloc. Antagonism to the BJP might be a glue, but a viable alternative will need a much more binding solution; it calls for a vision of nation-building.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nMadhya Pradesh Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nRajasthan Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nChhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nTelangana Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nSamajwadi Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nPunjab\n\n/\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\nBhopal\n\n/\n\nNagpur\n\n/\n\nBahujan Samaj Party\n\n/\n\nNationalist Congress Party\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nMumbai",

        "full_article": "At 10 a.m. on October 21, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) commenced the first uncrewed developmental flight of its \u2018Gaganyaan\u2019 human spaceflight mission from Sriharikota, designated TV-D1. The launch vehicle, a single-stage rocket, carried a crew module fit with a crew-escape system (CES) to an altitude of 12 km. There, the CES detached itself with the crew module from the rocket and climbed up to 17 km. In response to a command, the CES separated from the crew module, leaving the module to reorient itself before dropping over the Bay of Bengal. Its descent was slowed first by drogue parachutes and then by the main parachutes. Finally, the module splashed into the Bay a short distance from Sriharikota, where the Indian Navy hauled it out. The CES also splashed down farther down range. The flight tested the CES\u2019s ability to protect the crew in case the rocket malfunctioned, and collected data via sensors to inform future tests. The test\u2019s value will be based on this data. According to ISRO chairman S. Somanath, ISRO has many tests planned to develop confidence that the organisation can safely launch humans to orbit. Even the parachutes used for TV-D1 underwent 16 tests. Such fastidiousness is non-negotiable. TV-D1 was supposed to have been conducted at 8 a.m., when unfavourable weather pushed it to 8.45 a.m. Then, however, the automatic launch sequence held back the launch with a few seconds on the clock. Mr. Somanath subsequently announced that TV-D1 would be postponed. But ISRO personnel were able to quickly identify and resolve the problem, and the launch was rescheduled for 10 a.m.These checks and balances are expensive, but are in place to prevent greater costs later. Plans for the programme were first readied in 2009 at an estimated \u20b912,400 crore. The Union Cabinet granted its approval in December 2018 at \u20b99,023 crore assuming first flight by 2022. But the COVID-19 pandemic and other commitments have caused delays such that the earliest the first crewed flight can happen is currently 2025. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on ISRO to launch humans to the moon by 2040. Even with the requisite financial support, this would be a very tight deadline, but as with fastidiousness, contemporary geopolitics has also rendered returning to the moon non-negotiable. Fortunately, with \u2018Gaganyaan\u2019, ISRO has indicated how a balance can be struck: plan ahead, boost local manufacturing, test exhaustively, launch when ready. The deadline may be missed, but the mission can be undertaken with confidence while also improving local capabilities. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nISRO\n\n/\n\nspace programme\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\noceans\n\n/\n\ntechnology (general)\n\n/\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus",

        "full_article": "Tamil Nadu politics is set to see a custody battle of sorts. With the AIADMK and the BJP formalising their divorce \u2013 at least till the announcement of the 2024 general elections \u2013 which side would the other members of the alliance family go? Neither of the erstwhile partners is sure.\nGoing by the 2021 alliances, the DMK had in its fold 12 allies \u2013 the Congress, CPI, CPM, VCK, IUML, MDMK, Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi (KMDK), Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK), All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK), Makkal Viduthalai Katchi (MVK) and the Aathi Thamizhar Peravai (ATP). The AIADMK led a 10-party alliance that included, besides the BJP, PMK, TMC, Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK), Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam (MMK), All India Moovendar Munnani Kazhagam (AIMMK), Puratchi Bharatham Katchi (PBK) and the Pasumpon Desiya Kazhagam (PDK).\nWhile the DMK is likely to keep all its allies, the other side is in a state of flux. Last time, the Congress was the only party in the DMK alliance to contest seats in two digits (25). On the AIADMK side, the PMK got to contest 23 seats and the BJP 20. Besides the TMC, which tried its luck in six constituencies, all the others got just one seat each to contest. In fact, the troubled relationship between the AIADMK and the BJP had a semantic subtext over the name of the alliance. While the BJP preferred to call it the NDA, the AIADMK never lost an opportunity to call it the AIADMK-led alliance, while agreeing that it is part of the NDA at the national level.\nMost of the smaller allies of the AIADMK, especially those representing caste groups, may stay with the AIADMK for long-term benefits in the state. Given the stunted stature of the TMC, G K Vasan\u2019s chips would be down irrespective of the side he chooses. More interesting would be the way the PMK explores its options. The party, which can bring in some crucial vanniyar votes to any alliance, has been warming up to the DMK, but its entry into the league would be difficult as long as the VCK remains part of it. And if M K Stalin has to choose between dalit votes and vanniyar votes, Thirumavalavan is likely to stay put. That would leave Anbumani Ramadoss to choose between the divorcees.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBJP leaders agree that having the PMK would be beneficial in the northern districts where the saffron party has a meagre presence. And Anbumani\u2019s pound of flesh would be nothing less than a Union cabinet berth. BJP sources tell me that the leadership is unlikely to yield to that demand since Anbumani faces charges of misdeeds while giving approval for some medical colleges when he was the Union health minister in the UPA government. Without a minister post, there would be nothing much for the PMK to root for the BJP.\nFor Anbumani, the best case scenario would be winning in the company of the AIADMK (where he has slightly better chances than being with the BJP) and the BJP falling short of a simple majority at the Centre. If it has to go MP hunting post polls, the BJP may put realpolitik before ideals, and Anbumani\u2019s stakes may go up. For the BJP, 2024 is a watershed. If it wins this time, the government is likely to take up delimitation of Lok Sabha constituencies which will redraw electoral demography in such a way that the BJP brigade believes it will be unbeatable for at least another decade. Will the INDIA bloc upset the saffron applecart? Assembly elections in five states next month may give some indication.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In August 1900, a cycling venue in Paris, the V\u00e9lodrome de Vincennes, saw two teams play the first and so far, only Olympic cricket match. The two teams, Great Britain and France, were not even true national sides; the English being represented by the Devon and Somerset Wanderers club, then touring France, while the French were mostly English expats who played for the All Paris Club. In the two-day encounter, the English team routed the French, who managed just 104 runs in their two innings. It tells you something about how the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarded the sport that the winners, Great Britain, were presented not gold but silver medals while the French won bronze.\nA hundred and twenty three years on, when 90-odd members in the IOC session in Mumbai almost unanimously voted for the five new games proposed, including men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket for the 2028 LA Olympics, it was a totally different proposition. Nearly two billion people, between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh will regard this as an opportunity for not one, but a possible two Olympic medals. And the added interest will translate into not just increased viewership, but far more lucrative media deals for the IOC.\nThe truth is that this is a marriage made in heaven. The IOC is constantly looking to increase their core viewership. \u2018Good looking\u2019 sports like rhythmic gymnastics, and trendy new events like \u2018Breaking\u2019 have been added to appeal to a larger audience sitting on the cusp of sports and entertainment. And in 1992, the IOC campaigned to bring professional basketball players from the NBA to the Barcelona Olympics with the fabled US \u2018Dream Team,\u2019 which broke all viewership records. Even football, which was first an amateur sport, was later converted into a U-23 event. And in 1996, by allowing three senior footballers to join the U-23 teams, the likes of Messi and Neymar made football one of the most rated Olympic sports. Cricket just adds another huge market for the quadrennial event.\nPress rewind: The first-ever T20 international match was played at Eden Park, Auckland, in 2005. This format, which has led to an increased interest in the game, will now feature in the LA Olympics\nAs for the ICC, being in the Olympics just adds to the tremendous increase in interest in the game that really started in 2005. In February that year, the first ever men\u2019s T20 international between Australia and New Zealand was held in Eden Park, Auckland. The match was regarded less than seriously by the players, with many sporting retro moustaches and beards and the umpire actually pulling out a red card reminiscent of a football match when Glen McGrath pretended to bowl an underarm delivery. The Australian captain for that match, Ricky Ponting, famously said it was a format that was difficult to take seriously. But T20s, which cut the playing time to less than four hours, suddenly gave cricket a more compact product which the rest of the world could actually watch. The glamour and success of the IPL which started in 2008 took it to a totally different level. And Ricky Ponting now makes a very comfortable living as the head coach of an IPL franchise!\nAnd importantly, T20 cricket, unlike the cosy and exclusive club of Test and One-Day International playing countries, was open for all. Instead of the dozen-odd countries into the sport, interest sprouted in countries as diverse as Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Brazil. The Olympic Charter specifies that in order to be in the Olympics, the sport must be widely practised by men in at least 75 countries and on four continents and by women in no fewer than 40 countries and on three continents. ODI and Test cricket would never have had a chance.\nIn 2018, the Sony Picture Network paid a modest $12 million for the rights to broadcast the Tokyo Olympics in India. By 2028, that number is expected to rise a staggering tenfold. And increased access to a country that is expected to be the third largest economy in the next few years is something that would have been on the IOC\u2019s wishlist for a long time.\nIOC president Thomas Bach\u2019s batting efforts in an event in Mumbai on October 9, four days before the voting signalled that the inclusion of cricket in LA 2028 was nothing more than a formality, the decision had already been made.\nIn the general jubilation, there are a couple of discordant notes. Just six teams in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s events mean that Olympic cricket will be even more of an exclusive club than World Cup cricket, currently facing a lot of flak because of the lack of representation. Some top teams will necessarily miss out on the Olympics. And a single venue and the limited pitches might make the first-ever Olympic cricket tournament a bit of a hit and miss affair. But, all in all, T20 cricket\u2019s rise as a global sport closely mirrors India\u2019s rise in global significance. The signs look auspicious.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Heightened activities are taking place at a number of courts in Dhaka as numerous cases of arson and violence against BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami leaders/activists are currently being tried. According to a report by this daily, hearings in these trials are running beyond normal court hours, extending till about 8-8:30pm almost every day. This is a rare occurrence in the court system of Bangladesh, as defence lawyers representing the accused have pointed out.\nCases as old as even a decade, which remained dormant for long, suddenly came to life a few months ago. The law minister told this daily that the government had instructed the prosecution to take steps for quick disposal of old cases, but claimed that the instruction was not specific to cases involving opposition leaders. But the reality tells a different story. A mid-level police officer revealed to this daily that the police have clear instructions from the government to finish off trial proceedings against members of BNP and other opposition parties before the upcoming general election.\nWhy this sudden rush? Up until July, the courts could not proceed with these cases because prosecution witnesses \u2013 all of whom are police members \u2013 did not show up to record their statements, even risking non-bailable arrest warrants. This raises the question: is the sudden desire to dispose of old cases merely for the sake of justice? Or is there an ulterior motive behind it? BNP leaders say that these court proceedings are being rushed to keep them off the streets during their anti-government movement, as well as to thwart any prospect of them contesting the election.\nTheir claims are not entirely unsubstantiated: in July, leaked minutes from an emergency meeting of the police top brass revealed that they had decided to pick \"selective\" cases to bring a maximum number of potential election candidates from the main opposition under conviction, as per a report published in July by the New Age. Over the years, we have also seen how BNP men have been drowned under cases often deemed to be politically motivated. Against this backdrop, the High Court's observation \u2013 that no one sentenced to more than two years in jail can contest any election \u2013 bears special significance for opposition leaders now on trial.\nThe timing and political implications of these developments suggest that the ruling regime could be abusing the legal system to potentially gain an advantage in the upcoming election, should it occur as planned. This, we must say, goes against the spirit of democracy, and likely hampers any chance of the nation having a fair and participatory election. We urge the authorities to ensure that due process is maintained in all legal matters, especially in political cases, at all times.\n",

        "full_article": "Israel's catastrophic war on terror, after the Hamas attack, has reopened a bloody chapter of the region's conflict-ridden history. Global double standards are unravelling in front of our eyes, costing innocent lives in Gaza. The latest Netanyahu coalition government \u2013 waging this virulent response, displacing millions and killing thousands of Palestinians \u2013 is the most extremist government in Israel's history. The unsparing attacks on Palestinian lives require a historical understanding of Israel's gradual shift to far-right extremism, which serves as context to assess the possible consequences of the aggravating situation.\nIn a six-day war in 1967, after a series of manoeuvres by Egyptian President Nasser, Israel shocked the world by occupying the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Since the occupation, the \"two-state solution\" has been touted by the West like a broken record. With the scale of Israel's war crimes engulfing the Gaza Strip and its citizens to ashes, the two-state solution is truly dead today, if it ever truly was a possibility. The concept itself has always been fundamentally detached from the Israeli domestic environment, and the anti-democratic foundations of Israel. Till date, Israel has not adopted a constitution or equality laws as was required by the UN Resolution 181, the partition plan that caused the first mass displacement, ethnic cleansing and mass killings of an estimated 15,000 Palestinians by Zionist militia.\n\nFor a realistic peace agreement, Israel's current far-right government has to be forced, politically, to make a compromise by its long-standing allies, most importantly, the US.\nMany political analysts still believe the only possibility of the \"two-state solution\" was reflected in the Oslo Accords of 1993 \u2013 the peace agreement brokered by former US President Bill Clinton, and signed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat. The accords promised to create an independent state for Palestinians in five years, which never happened. There's a catch though: until Oslo, the international consensus supported complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. Essentially, PLO's agreement to the Oslo terms legitimised Israel's illegal pretence of possessing \"existing rights\" in the occupied territories. Even after peace negotiations, as Nobel Peace Prizes were extravagantly handed out, Israel's government continued to engage in mass arrests of Palestinians without reason, and abused the persecuted minority in administrative detention centres, as documented by Amnesty International at the time.\nThen in 1995, Prime Minister Rabin, who also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, was assassinated by an ultra-nationalist Israeli who opposed the Oslo peace initiative to share territories with Palestinians. Current leader Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 also the leader of the Likud Party at the time \u2013 was blamed for ignoring the incitement of extremists \u2013 a charge he has vociferously denied. Rabin's assassination marked a turning point in maturing the ultra-nationalism reflected in the coalition today.\nPreviously, extremism was a persistent problem lurking in the fringes in Israel since its inception. Yet the fascist turn was anticipated by prominent intellectuals in the Jewish society in the wake of the 1948 Deir Yassin Massacre, when members of the Irgun and Stern Gang Zionist militias attacked the village of Deir Yassin, killing at least 107 Palestinians. The likes of\u00a0Albert Einstein and Hannah Arendt had written a letter to The New York Times, castigating Herut, Likud Party's predecessor, as \"akin in its organisation, methods and political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist Parties.\"\nWhen Netanyahu first became prime minister in 1996, he demonised Rabin's efforts to compromise with Palestine, and groomed a generation of extremist leaders, such as Avigdor Lieberman, who called for the expulsion of 1.3 million \"Arabs of Israel\" in 2004. But Netanyahu has been a hawkish politician driven by self-interest over anything else. While appeasing his anti-Palestine national religious voters, Netanyahu also attempted an interim revival of the Oslo Accords to proclaim a farcical commitment to the two-state solution.\nThe Israeli government's predictable anti-terrorism rhetoric being used to wage war today, in which Palestinian terrorism is always the cause but never the effect of evil, has also played like a broken record over the past two decades. In 1998, Netanyahu and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum in Maryland, to facilitate Israeli withdrawals in the West Bank, on the condition that Palestine executes a specific \"action plan\" to combat terrorism. In this \"struggle between good and evil, the more repression the better: any restraints will impede the struggle,\" as Jewish Professor Norman Finkelstein wrote in 1998, criticising the Wye River Memorandum as \"securing occupation.\"\nThe sincerity of the 1998 Wye memorandum's \"peace\" objectives remain questionable; according to\u00a0The Washington Post, the Clinton administration had reportedly given Netanyahu an \"ultimatum\" to relaunch Oslo, though confidential letters revealed that the US committed to firmly \"oppose\" a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood. In presenting the memorandum, Netanyahu cleverly twisted the public discourse, tactically framing any withdrawal from occupied territories as concession rather than what it actually was: justice.\nChecks and balances from Israel's long-standing ally, the US, has faded since 1991, after the Gulf War, when the US emerged as the unchallenged external power in Middle East affairs. With that powerful shelter, Netanyahu gradually became a paragon of the far-right, posturing himself as the only messianic expert capable of facing the enemies: Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. His authoritarian tendencies go hand-in-hand with his oppressive policies towards Palestinians. After his resounding victory in 2015 elections, Netanyahu anchored the controversial Nation-State bill establishing \"Jewish settlement as national value,\" dooming Palestinians' hopes for freedom. He espoused all facets of authoritarianism, emboldening official policies to annex the West Bank, subjecting Palestinians to apartheid, while domestically silencing Israeli dissenters and taking control of the media.\u00a0\nPrior to elections in 2022, facing indictments on corruption charges, after 18 months of exile, Netanyahu cultivated relationships with fascist-religious parties to ride his way back to the Prime Minister's office. Netanyahu's appointment of extremist leader Itamar Ben Gvir \u2013 who was among a group of extremists indicted for celebrating the stabbing of a Palestinian baby by a settler extremist \u2013 as minister of national security drew widespread domestic criticism. Netanyahu's own repressive tendencies pale in comparison to his appointees, such as the currently appointed Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who was singled out as a \"bona-fide Jewish fascist,\" by Uri Avnery, the leader of the Jewish peace movement organization Gush Shalom and a former member of Israeli Knesset (parliament).\u00a0\nMonths prior to the Hamas attack, Netanyahu's latest government led a judicial coup amid public outrage, curtailing the Supreme Court's power to intervene in governance. And only four days before the Hamas attack, Israeli newspaper\u00a0Haaretz\u00a0published an editorial on how Israel's neo-fascism threatens Israelis and Palestinians alike.\nThe prospects of peaceful resolution are far unless Israel is left without fallback options. Normalisation of Israel's government with Arab states, which the US recently brokered, is a tried-tested method that has extensively failed before to improve the conditions for Palestinians. For a realistic peace agreement, Israel's current far-right government has to be forced to make a compromise by its long-standing allies, most importantly, the US.\nPrevious US administrations though were able to pressure Israel. Following the 1956 Suez Crisis, President Eisenhower threatened economic sanctions to force Israel to withdraw from Gaza and Sinai. In 1977, President Carter threatened to terminate US military assistance to Israel if the nation did not evacuate Lebanon and secured an agreement between long-time enemies Egypt and Israel. And the last of its kind, in 1991, the US Secretary of State James Baker rebuked Israel's far-right government's hard-line approach that eschewed dialogue with Palestine.\nToday the scope for accountability is moot. President Biden, who claims the US is a democracy champion, is supporting an outright authoritarian regime in Israel. During his unprecedented visit in Israel, he undiplomatically\u00a0embraced Israel's narrative on the Gaza Hospital massacre on October 17, while the US Intelligence was conducting preliminary investigation. The US also vetoed the adoption of a humanitarian pause in the UN Security Council, all of which, taken together, do not show signs of reversing back to the 1990s dynamic where the US could somewhat cast an influence in Israel's hard-line policies. In a video that has now gone viral, from\u00a01986, Biden had loudly said in Congress, \"if it were not for Israel, the US would have to invent an Israel to protect its interests in the Middle East.\" The enduring comment hovers over the US' position in Israel, only in its regional and national self-interest. The US' position as a global superpower currently dwindles with the rise of China, and as such, its own agenda in protecting Israel as an ally \u2013 even at the cost of providing military funds to a fascist government embracing militant Zionism \u2013 matter more than being on the right side of history.\nRamisa Rob\u00a0is a journalist at The Daily Star.\n\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events.

        "full_article": "Diaspora has become a crucial developmental issue for many countries. The growing interest in and recognition of diaspora engagement were mirrored in the endorsement of the Dublin Declaration, which was adopted at the Global Diaspora Summit 2022 held during April 1-5, 2022. Diasporas play a special role in linking countries, including integrating new waves of immigrants, acting as conduits for knowledge and commercial exchanges, and creating investments and opportunities for the countries involved.\nDiaspora policies cover a variety of government measures aimed at engaging, maintaining, or developing a relationship with the diaspora living abroad. The policies entail ensuring the rights and protection of diaspora members by reinforcing national identity or sense of belonging, fostering strong relations, and facilitating diaspora contributions to a country's social and economic development. Diasporas impact national economies in several ways, through remittances, foreign direct investments, entrepreneurial endeavours, facilitation of trade, and the transfer of knowledge/skills.\nBangladeshi diasporas from around the globe are contributing to communities in Bangladesh and abroad financially as well as with their specialised skills, knowledge, and technical capabilities. They have the potential to play an instrumental role in national development, contributing to both the economic and social dimensions. Country-branding, diaspora diplomacy, trade, diaspora tourism, and the establishment of diaspora networks are vital areas that can benefit significantly from the engagement of the diaspora, accelerating Bangladesh's global standing.\nThe Bangladeshi diasporas' diverse human, social, cultural, and economic capital represents new assets for national development in a connected world. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment has initiated a process of formulating the Bangladesh National Diaspora Policy 2023, which is in its final stage of getting the nod. The policy aspires to provide an inclusive and strategic approach to engaging the Bangladeshi diaspora. In the draft policy, the diaspora has been defined as \"Bangladeshi persons who have taken citizenship of another country or are in the process of getting it or living there permanently or those born or raised in another country as a Bangladeshi descendant.\"\nThe policy envisions diaspora development as both contributing to the development of the Bangladeshi diaspora itself and enhancing the roles of the diaspora in the development of Bangladesh. The broad measures of the policy include: a) enhancing diaspora diplomacy and capacity building, b) mobilising diaspora socio-cultural capital, c) promoting diaspora human capital, and d) facilitating diaspora economic capital.\nThe policy lays the foundation for building a respectful, reciprocal, and resilient alliance with the diaspora. It recognises diaspora contributions, and paves pathways for their physical and virtual return to be integrated into Bangladesh's development and for the endowment of domestic and diaspora resources for the welfare of Bangladeshis at home and abroad.\nHowever, there are challenges ahead to implementing the policy. Sustainable mobilisation of diaspora capital dawdles due to gaps in understanding of diaspora needs, nominal acknowledgment of their endeavours, and unavailability of diverse and dynamic platforms and channels to streamline their potential and contributions to the development trajectory of Bangladesh.\nThe institutional-related challenges stem from lacking a guiding, facilitative, and responsive mechanism to support the diaspora endeavours and proactively support them in case of vulnerabilities. Institutional systems are yet to adequately address dealing with diaspora return and reintegration in a mutually beneficial manner. It requires a formal system of regular, output-driven connection with diaspora networks. One core challenge is the absence of a well-coordinated diaspora-centric institutional mechanism.\nAdequate funding for different measures and well-coordinated efforts from the public and private sectors are needed to make the policy effectively functional. While the public sector can extend leadership in critical areas such as legislation, diplomatic services, social protection, and cultural heritage, it will have to adopt a facilitative role to ensure a blend of public and private sector actors in order to accomplish the objectives of this policy.\nTo encourage diaspora investment, effective reforms of the national capital market should be made to ensure an orderly and safe capital market. Diaspora networks need to be created for safe migration, tackling climate change, and for utilisation of human capital. Bangladeshi diaspora will also have to show up for socioeconomic development with their engagement, investment, and technology transfer while harbouring a patriotic spirit.\nThe Bangladeshi government needs to design a holistic plan of action for developing a sustainable system of diaspora engagement, which will serve as the roadmap for strategic planning and action to address capacity and institutional arrangements from the domestic to the global level.\nDr Nasim Ahmed\u00a0holds a PhD in Public Policy from Ulster University in the UK, and is currently working as an associate professor at the Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management.

        "full_article": "Heightened activities are taking place at a number of courts in Dhaka as numerous cases of arson and violence against BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami leaders/activists are currently being tried. According to a report by this daily, hearings in these trials are running beyond normal court hours, extending till about 8-8:30pm almost every day. This is a rare occurrence in the court system of Bangladesh, as defence lawyers representing the accused have pointed out.\nCases as old as even a decade, which remained dormant for long, suddenly came to life a few months ago. The law minister told this daily that the government had instructed the prosecution to take steps for quick disposal of old cases, but claimed that the instruction was not specific to cases involving opposition leaders. But the reality tells a different story. A mid-level police officer revealed to this daily that the police have clear instructions from the government to finish off trial proceedings against members of BNP and other opposition parties before the upcoming general election.\nWhy this sudden rush? Up until July, the courts could not proceed with these cases because prosecution witnesses \u2013 all of whom are police members \u2013 did not show up to record their statements, even risking non-bailable arrest warrants. This raises the question: is the sudden desire to dispose of old cases merely for the sake of justice? Or is there an ulterior motive behind it? BNP leaders say that these court proceedings are being rushed to keep them off the streets during their anti-government movement, as well as to thwart any prospect of them contesting the election.\nTheir claims are not entirely unsubstantiated: in July, leaked minutes from an emergency meeting of the police top brass revealed that they had decided to pick \"selective\" cases to bring a maximum number of potential election candidates from the main opposition under conviction, as per a report published in July by the New Age. Over the years, we have also seen how BNP men have been drowned under cases often deemed to be politically motivated. Against this backdrop, the High Court's observation \u2013 that no one sentenced to more than two years in jail can contest any election \u2013 bears special significance for opposition leaders now on trial.\nThe timing and political implications of these developments suggest that the ruling regime could be abusing the legal system to potentially gain an advantage in the upcoming election, should it occur as planned. This, we must say, goes against the spirit of democracy, and likely hampers any chance of the nation having a fair and participatory election. We urge the authorities to ensure that due process is maintained in all legal matters, especially in political cases, at all times.\n",

        "full_article": "The Road Transport Act (RTA) was passed five years ago, in a somewhat hurried manner following a widespread protest led by school students. The law, as the government had promised back then, was aimed at safeguarding the lives of passengers, drivers and pedestrians on the road. Five years later, our roads are not any safer. In fact, according to road safety advocates, roads in Bangladesh \u2013 particularly in Dhaka \u2013 have become increasingly dangerous, especially for pedestrians.\nThis hardly comes as a surprise, seeing as the road safety law is yet to be fully implemented. Unlike the Digital Security Act (DSA), which was passed around the same time as RTA and was implemented right away, the government has faced numerous hurdles to put the latter into effect. As passenger welfare advocates have pointed out time and again, transport leaders, most of whom either have strong ruling party connections or are part of the ruling regime themselves, have heavily influenced the government's decisions in their favour. Sadly, those decisions have often proven to be detrimental for the people.\nTake, for example, the matter of unfit vehicles. The state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), on May 17, issued an order to cap the economic life of buses and trucks, aiming to reduce road crashes as well as pollution. That decision was put on hold by the Road Transport and Highways Division (RTHD) less than four months later, when they caved in under the pressure of transport associations. This has been the case for almost all road safety-related decisions. This is why, despite passing the law in September 2018, the government was only able to finalise its rules in December 2022.\nBy failing to withstand the influence of transport owners and leaders, our government has failed to ensure safety for us on the road. According to the\u00a0data\u00a0collected by Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, between 2015 and 2022, more than 21 people have been killed and 39 more injured in road crashes every day on average. Dhaka has been found to be the most unsafe place in the country, which is ironic, seeing as it is also the slowest city in the world, traffic-wise.\nIt's high time our government stopped caving in to the vested interest groups in our transport sector, who throw tantrums whenever an official decision to improve road safety goes against their favour. The government must remember that it is mandated to serve the people, not the transport owners and associations.\n",

        "full_article": "A revision of the minimum wages for readymade garment (RMG) workers is overdue, particularly in the context of the soaring inflation. All parties involved with the industry ---apart from workers and garment owners, the two main stakeholders, labour leaders, rights groups and even platforms of foreign retailers and brands---are unanimous that wages of RMG workers need to be raised. However, it is on the limit of revision of the minimum monthly wage and other associated benefits that they cannot reach a consensus. The gap between the demand made by workers' representatives and the offer from the owners' representatives is wide---almost as wide as the total amount of minimum wage on offer. Against the workers' demand for Tk 20,393, the owners' offer is Tk 10,400. But then the labour rights groups have rejected both these proposals and stuck to their demand for an amount in between Tk23,000 and Tk25,000. Indeed, the wage board has a tough time ahead to convince the two sides of the main stakeholders to arrive at a meeting point. If the genuine grievance of the RMG workers has been duly recognised, now is the time to find a solution acceptable to both. Although RMG export from Bangladesh still enjoys its fair share in global apparel business, it is also facing extra challenges and suffering from economic slowdown in the importing countries of Europe and America. Although new markets have been found to make some amends for decelerated demand in the proven destinations, those cannot quite make up for the lost revenue earning. So a balance between the garment owners' capability and the demand from workers has to be struck. It has to be the most rational profit sharing basis for the factories---not all of which are equally strong and capable of withstanding adverse weather ---to stay in business. The survival of the industry guarantees protection of the interests of both owners and employees. When so much is at stake, the role of the foreign buyers and brands also proves crucial in the whole affair of fixing the wage structure. Of the 5,000 RMG factories in Bangladesh, about 200 have now turned LEED (leadership in energy and environmental design)-certified green ones---the highest in the world. But the irony is that the retail platforms and brands abroad are unwilling to raise prices of apparel commensurate with the extra cost on environmental upgrading. Their concern for higher wages for RMG in Bangladesh should be complemented by appropriate price enhancement of the apparel they receive from Bangladesh. Evidently, all three parties in the apparel production-the management, marketing and retail sale--have to look at the issue dispassionately and must be ready to go the extra mile to help each other in their own interests. The owners need to come out of the confine of free-market economy's theory of as much profit as possible and at the same time workers should also allow some manoeuvrability in order to help resolve the disagreement over the minimum monthly wage. So far as medical, conveyance and food allowances are concerned, the owners have offered higher amounts than those demanded by workers. The contentious issues are basic pay and house rent. If the higher amounts under those heads are rationally adjusted, a middle ground can be found out for an amicable settlement.",

        "full_article": "Of late there have been a few expert dialogues, seminars, view-exchanges etc on the state of rivers in Bangladesh. Those were organised apparently with a view to reaching consensus on the remedies to the adversities facing these rivers --- both large and small. Normally, the pollution of rivers by mindless human activities near the large cities and ports attracts the different colloquiums' focus. The river experts, researchers and the river-saving activists are found busy achieving their single goal: protection of the rivers from their death throes. Similar spotlights are thrown on some other scourges related mainly to river encroachment and sand lifting, and laying ownership to certain narrow rivers. It sounds atrocious. But it continues to happen in many remote areas of the country.Helpless, poor villagers remain just witness to this grave crime of occupying rivers. Except cursing the influential quarters involved in the grave offence, they have little to do. As the former get away with many criminal activities, the peace-loving people just look on. They remain deprived of almost all kinds of benefits coming from these 'private rivers'. It is especially the fishing community who remains most affected by the prohibitions slapped by the local influential quarters on a river. These injustices have been in place for long.These are isolated events related to the rivers of Bangladesh. But there are widespread scourges which plague the veritably vanishing rivers. A few of them hasten the premature thinning of once mighty flows. Experts, however, hold the view that despite their slowing down of flows, no rivers face complete death. Due to siltation and human interferences, some gorgeously flowing rivers lose their strength in current. Their decline in flows expedites their process of drying up. In the process, a few thinly flowing rivers do get buried under the expanse of dry lands and pastures. All-out efforts in the form of massive digging and dredging can help reclaim a few of these rivers, despite their disappearance a few decades, or even a century, ago. If put into practice, these physical and mechanical devices could have reclaimed a number of rivers long presumed dead in this country. As a corollary, the controversy over the exact number of rivers in the river-filled land would have long resolved. Of all the river-related adversities, the most terrible in the context of the present Bangladesh appears to be the non-stop spate of erosion. This menace besetting the mostly mid-level farmers and poor villagers owning derelict homesteads has long been recognised as a bane of this river-dominant country. However, concrete structures also do not remain spared. River erosions have long been a natural process in this country which is filled with rivers --- many flowing down from upstream areas. In the past, the season of monsoon used to be earmarked for the rivers' spate of dreadful erosions. Be they large and small, few rivers in the country are spared the dread of massive erosion during monsoon. Thanks to this natural phenomenon, hundreds of acres of crop fields on the river banks are devoured by river erosion almost every year. This apart, scores of human settlements, markets, river port structures and age-old buildings remain vulnerable to river erosions round the year.Although the season of erosion in the past used to be seen being confined to the season of monsoon, changes continue to take place. Thanks to the vagaries of nature prompted by climate change, the assaults of river erosion nowadays continue to devastate the river banks round the year. There are several highly erosion-prone rivers in Bangladesh. They constitute three major streams of the country, i.e. the Jamuna, the Ganges and the Meghna. In the context of the three streams, river experts have identified a number of erosion-prone zones in the country. They comprise Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogura, Sirajganj, Tangail, Pabna and Manikganj. The areas are under the influence of the Jamuna River. Many river enthusiasts are found confused about the causes of erosion. A general concept has it that due to silt the soil structure continues to become weak. Formation of this type of soil ends up in its easy breakdown due to the strong current of the river water. River erosion, thus, starts occurring at suitable points. Moreover, erosions mainly occur due to the braided nature of rivers in Bangladesh. The process is aggravated by heavy rainfall, particularly upstream --- leading to increased water flow. To the commoners, an easy remedy to river erosion is to construct levees along the river banks. As part of traditional anti-erosion measures, these embankments comprise placing sand bags, geo bags and many other handy protective barriers along the river banks. In the developed rural areas, a number of other advanced devices are used. Experts, however, suggest stronger measures to contain the onrush of water. Instead of ad hoc measures, they prefer putting in place permanent measures to better adapt to the river banks' breakdown. According to experts, the major agents of soil-erosion are water and wind. The others include weather and climate, topography and tectonic activity, misuse of river-bank soil, loss of vegetation and trees; and poor erosion management of banks. It doesn't require in-depth studies to conclude that deforestation plays a major role in aggravating the river erosion process. To the great misfortune of the land, vast swathes of the country's river banks remain barren except the covers of grass and weeds. To put it briefly, river bank erosion, grabbing and encroachment, as well as unbridled pollution, are equally responsible for the dismal state of our rivers.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Rice being the staple diet of the Bengali people, farmers here use 75 per cent of their cultivable land for growing this crop. Since rice cultivation is water-intensive, even in the past when modern irrigation technology was not introduced, farmers used indigenous methods to irrigate their rice fields with water from rivers, canals and various other water bodies. With modern irrigation pumps now available everywhere, they use it extensively. And this practice often results in overuse of irrigation water which is wasteful, increases the farmers' production cost and pollutes environment as the fossil fuel, diesel, is mostly burnt to run their pumps. The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) says, 23 per cent of the diesel imported by it (BPC) worth Tk.300 billion is used to run the irrigation pumps which number around a million. And with most surface water sources drying up during the cultivation season (January to June) of the major rice crop, boro, the deep tube wells draw groundwater to irrigate the rice fields. The water table, as a result, is receding fast, which is a matter of grave concern for agriculture as well as well as the ecology. Depletion of groundwater, which is a vital source of potable water, is also a cause for concern. To get around the challenges of using irrigation water sustainably, a model called Integrated Rice Advisory System (IRAS) has been developed for the country's farmers. It has been developed by the Agro-Meteorological Information System Development Project (AMISDP) of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in collaboration with the Washington University (WU) in USA. In this model, researchers use data provided by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other satellite data to inform rice farmers all about how much water they actually need for their crop, how much water they have and how much they are using. In the study conducted by the IRAS team completed in June 2023, advisories on the requirement of irrigation water were provided to more than 10 million farmers. Advisories can be sent to farmers through the media, both print and electronic, social media and text messages directly to the farmers' mobile phones. And the credit goes, especially to IRAS, for the idea of sending advisory in the form of text message, often customised, to the farmers. The customised text sent to a farmer to meet his particular need might be like this: you don't need to irrigate your crop, or apply half a finger of water to your field and so on. And the calculation for the overuse of irrigation water is done by comparing the actual amount of water consumed by crops (which is estimated from the satellite data) with the crops' water demand estimated from the weather data (basically precipitation forecasts for the upcoming week) supplied by the Global Forecast System (GFS) of the US National Weather Service. Faisal Hossain, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the WU and leader of IRAS and his team estimated that by implementing the programme, wastage of water in Bangladesh agriculture could be reduced by about 30 per cent, cut fuel consumption (to operate irrigation pumps) by 45 per cent and save money as government subsidy worth USD115 million annually. And the drastic cut in fuel use in agriculture means a reduction in annual carbon emission by 300,000 tons. At the trial phase of the IRAS programme, some farmers who followed the text message advisories used 32 per cent less irrigation water than usual, hired fewer irrigation pumps that consumed less fuel, but the yield was same as before. However, the challenge is to train the country's farmers to use the advisories properly before popularising the practice among them.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
