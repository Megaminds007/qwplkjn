The BJP\u2019s sharp focus has been on the rhetoric of \u201cBangladeshi infiltration\u201d, which it is linking not only to the State\u2019s demographic changes but also to crimes against tribal women, land alienation, and what some Adivasi communities perceive as a gradual dilution of their indigenous cultural practices. The party accuses the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance of encouraging \u201cinfiltrators\u201d to bolster the alliance\u2019s voter base. This campaign has been running alongside the BJP\u2019s efforts to stress the importance of unity among SC, ST and OBC groups using the messaging of \u201cek hai to safe hai (safe when united\u201d), suggesting that the BJP\u2019s campaign is targeted at having a coalition with more place for Adivasis alongside the party\u2019s existing base of non-Adivasi Hindu voters. Amidst the blitz of campaign speeches by the BJP\u2019s star campaigners, the ruling alliance\u2019s campaign led by Chief Minister Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana Soren, has squarely put the onus of checking alleged \u201cinfiltrators\u201d on the Centre, without explicitly negating the claim of the BJP. The INDIA campaign also tries to drive home the point that as Jharkhand has no international borders, the onus of checking alleged infiltrators should be on the Union, where the BJP is in power.Another central theme in the INDIA bloc\u2019s campaign strategy has been the promise of implementing land registries as they had been surveyed in 1932 for the purpose of determining domicile. But the JMM and its allies are careful here too, as Jharkhand has had a history of settlement with migration from neighbouring States in waves ever since. Some senior BJP leaders have suggested a National Register of Citizens in the State, though the party does not mention this in its manifesto. The BJP is talking up charges of corruption that sent leaders such as Mr. Soren and the Congress\u2019s Alamgir Alam to jail. The JMM has been questioning the announcement of the election in the State a month before the term of the current Assembly ends, calling it as a BJP ploy to disrupt the welfare schemes of the Soren government. While the BJP is going all out to attack the popularity of these schemes by questioning their implementation at the fag end of the alliance government\u2019s term, its manifesto has tried to outdo the JMM\u2019s in terms of sops being promised for the youth, women and farmers in the State.

        "full_article": "It is an unambiguous and resounding mandate for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP), a coalition that includes civil society groups and trade unions, in Sri Lanka\u2019s just-concluded parliamentary election. The election has demonstrated the NPP\u2019s growing appeal among all sections, who had in 2022, frustrated with economic hardships and the old political establishment, thrown out what they despised as a corrupt regime. Having elected JVP chief Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the country\u2019s President in September, the people have now provided the ruling alliance with a hard-to-get over two-thirds majority. The NPP, which has secured 141 seats, with around 6.87 million votes in 196 seats, bagged 18 more seats under the system of proportional representation, giving it 159 seats in total in the 225-member legislature. The NPP has accomplished what former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could not get in the 2010 poll after the LTTE\u2019s defeat.The significance of the poll also lies in the extent and geographic span of the NPP\u2019s victory. It has been a remarkable show in Jaffna and Vanni in the Northern Province, that is home to Tamils and the stronghold of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi. Except for Batticaloa, the NPP emerged the top party in the east, with its sizeable population of Muslims, and in the Central Province\u2019s Nuwara Eliya district, with its majority hill-country Tamils. In its vote share, island-wide, the coalition outperformed Mr. Dissanayake, who touched the 50% mark only in four electoral districts in the September poll. The rise of the coalition, from three seats with 3.84% vote share in 2020, to a super majority now, is remarkable. The political calculations of Mr. Dissanayake, who called for a poll within days of assuming office, have paid off, as the Opposition did not put up a fight. Though Sajith Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya remains the principal Opposition party in Parliament, its vote share has dropped considerably. The parties backed by two former Presidents, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mr. Rajapaksa, have performed miserably. While voters have spared Mr. Dissanayake the compulsion of seeking allies to pursue his reform agenda, he should still consult all sections. His promises at the time of the presidential poll, such as the abolition of executive presidency, a new Constitution, and the repeal of oppressive laws, cannot be fulfilled merely with support in the legislature. The big takeaway from the November 14 poll is that the country has voted for decisive change that it sought from the time of the citizen\u2019s uprising in 2022. Mr. Dissanayake, at the commencement of his innings, described the unity of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, and all Sri Lankans as the bedrock of the new beginning. He can now build on this unity.

        "full_article": "By- Shri Shri Anandamurti\nWhat is the meaning of the term \u2018purush\u2019? The first meaning is: the entity that lies quiescent in the psycho-physical structure of another entity is called Purush. You may have noticed that different people perform various tasks in a house preparing for a marriage ceremony. However, the head of the family does not do any specific task but supervises the proper completion of all tasks. Similarly, Purush, cognitive faculty, lies hidden in the physical body. Without His wish, no organ of the body can function.\n\nThe second meaning is that the entity that resides before all other entities is Purush. The import of the above definitions is the same: Param Purush is the supreme reflecting principle. You may have thought about the primordial cause of this creation. Early humans had an undeveloped intellect. To them, rainfall, the dawn and rice were symbols of gods and goddesses. The matter was of paramount importance. Long afterwards, humans realised that Param Purush is the supreme cause of creation. \u2018Time, nature, fate, accident and the five fundamental factors \u2013 combination of all these \u2013 was thought to be the supreme cause of creation.\u2019\nWhile trying to discover the original cause of creation, we thought it must be eternal tempos. However, when the intellect developed, we discovered this hypothesis was incorrect because time is the mental measurement of the motivity of action. If there is no action, there is no question of any measurement of time. If the moon does not move around the Earth, no question of days, months or years can arise. Hence, time is not the original cause.\n\n\nYet, out of inquisitiveness, human beings continued to search for the ultimate cause of creation. A question arose in their minds: Is nature the ultimate cause? The answer is no. Prakriti, the supreme operative principle, functions according to the limited freedom that Purush, the supreme cognitive faculty, has granted it. Purush is the transcendental entity; Prakritiis merely the immanent power of Purush. The style in which Purush functions is called nature. Nature cannot act independently and thus cannot be regarded as the absolute cause of creation, the supreme reflecting plate. The instrumental cause of the universe\u2019s metamorphosis lies in Prakriti\u2019s three principles. Prakriti is an entity that acts; however, it cannot be the material cause or the efficient cause because there is no scope for any moral principle behind its actional faculty.\n\nShakti or energy is a blind force if not supported by prajna,intellect; it is always crude and static. The cognitive principle is both the material cause and the efficient cause of creation. In the flow of creation, the cognitive principle is also inseparably associated with the creative force. Hence, only the unmanifested supreme cognition, which is above both the cognitive principle and the operative force, can be the Supreme Reflecting Principle. When we reach both kshara and akshara, mutable and immutable, in the path of synthesis towards the One, we notice that in a previous stage, both of them have emanated from unmanifested, nirakshara, Supreme Cognition. This unmanifested Supreme cognition is the Supreme Reflecting Principle.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is worrying to learn, from an investigative report by this paper, that cybercriminal gangs have been breaking into the National Board of Revenue (NBR) server, using the ID and password credentials of officers to log in and complete customs procedures for the illegal release of shipments. Investigators have uncovered evidence of foreign cigarettes and liquor smuggled in through this process. What's most alarming is that the criminals managed to bypass two additional authentication layers, including the mandatory One-Time Password (OTP) sent to the credential holder's mobile phone, raising questions about the entire security protocols in place.\nCustoms and NBR officials have warned that such breaches pose a threat to national security. According to our report, this system vulnerability has allowed criminals to compromise the NBR server to release at least 48 imported consignments and launder money through fictitious imports totalling at least 3,000 consignments from January 2019 to September 2024. Often, the exact contents of these consignments remain unknown, which means dangerous items can enter the country undetected.\nOne particular breach occurred in May when cybercriminals accessed the NBR server using the credentials of a deputy commissioner from the Chattogram Custom House while he was in India for medical treatment. Investigators have identified a prime suspect in this case, who has reportedly been arrested several times for alleged public data theft from other government servers, including the NID server and land ministry web portal. Yet, he was released on bail every time, allowing him to continue targeting vulnerable government databases.\nClearly, there are significant flaws in the system. Earlier investigations found that cybercriminals secured access to the IDs and passwords of at least 27 customs officials, including retired, transferred, or even deceased personnel. This raises questions about why such credentials were not updated or deactivated. Moreover, security protocols on the NBR server reportedly get relaxed at certain hours, creating a window for cybercriminals to strike. To address these issues, it is essential to determine how unauthorised devices can access the server and why it would stop sending OTP alerts at certain hours.\nThese breaches suggest the possibility of insiders aiding these criminal gangs. In the current reality in which the government is trying to reform state institutions, it must prioritise cyber security, particularly in major entities like the NBR, NID, land ministry, etc. An in-depth investigation to identify and address all system vulnerabilities and hold accountable those involved in these cyber frauds and identity thefts is critical. Public institutions must be fortified against these increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\n",

        "full_article": "In its first 100 days, Bangladesh's interim government (IG) has taken critical steps towards stabilising the country and signalling a new direction. The IG's commitment to transparency and accountability stands out, with robust criticism now emerging freely in news outlets and on social media\u2014a promising sign of democratic practices returning to public discourse. With substantial national and international support, the IG has initiated several changes, including public briefings and a clear anti-corruption stance, which are refreshing shifts from the secrecy of past regimes. Notable achievements include stabilising central bank reserves, appointing reform commissions, empowering the army to help restore law and order, supporting a peaceful celebration of the largest Hindu festival, and reopening of university campuses.\nIn a recent show of responsiveness, the IG addressed the protests by injured individuals from the mass uprising. When demonstrators demanded better treatment and financial support, four advisers intervened very late at night, assuring swift action and pledging funds for their medical needs and rehabilitation. This engagement exemplifies the IG's commitment to addressing urgent public grievances directly and transparently\u2014a positive step towards rebuilding trust and showing accountability.\nAs I wrote in an earlier piece, there is a deep divide between the elite and the working people\u2014a disconnect that's not just economic or cultural, but deeply moral. Integrity has too often taken a backseat to personal gain, fracturing the country's social and moral fabric. For decades, millions of Bangladeshis have felt that leaders of every stripe put self-interest above public good, leaving working people behind.\nIn addressing this disconnect, the IG faces deep-seated challenges on multiple fronts\u2014from economic pressures to political factionalism\u2014that demand a careful balance between \"immediate actions\" and a resilient \"long-term vision.\"\n\nThe government faces an uphill economic battle. High inflation, unemployment, and rising living costs weigh heavily on working people, while local corruption, soaring prices of food and fuel, and powerful syndicates controlling key sectors expose the deep-rooted challenges of dismantling entrenched power structures. The IG's appeals to working people must be authentic and rooted in real change\u2014not just high-minded reform ideas or blaming the past 15 years of institutional breakdown.\nPolitical observers note a lack of political savvy within the IG, and its struggle to strike a balance between competing demands from various groups within and outside the government seems to be limiting its ability to deliver effective, actionable outcomes.\nThe IG must prioritise people's most pressing needs, fears, and aspirations. For a rickshaw puller or garment worker, the focus isn't on central bank reserves or constitutional reforms\u2014they need assurance that they can afford food, protect their homes from syndicate control, and secure educational opportunities for their children's future. The Open Market Sales programmes, offering essential food items at subsidised prices to low income families, is a proactive step towards maintaining affordability amid rising food inflation. However, such programmes need to expand to reach the millions still struggling.\nWhile addressing these immediate needs, the IG must also build a resilient governance model that can withstand political shifts and uphold democratic principles. Avoiding past mistakes, such as the abrupt abolition of the caretaker government in 2011, will be key to restoring public trust. Strengthening institutions, establishing accountability pathways, and fostering diplomatic stability are essential for Bangladesh's long-term growth.\n\nPeople aren't looking for quick fixes. They want a principled, realistic approach that respects the complexity of the task at hand. Building Bangladesh from Tetulia to Teknaf isn't about instant solutions but about setting a foundation rooted in solid principles and pragmatic action.\nAfter years of hollow promises, regime changes, and fragile constitutional amendments, many are questioning whether traditional governance models\u2014democracy, socialism, or communism\u2014still serve today's needs. These frameworks were created for past eras marked by monarchies, colonialism, and industrial revolutions. Bangladesh in 2024 faces a new set of material and moral realities that demand a governance model built not only for the present but resilient enough to stand the test of time and political vagaries.\nBangladesh needs a new governance model rooted in both ideal justice (nyaya) and practical justice (niti). It must balance autonomy, inclusivity, and accountability, yet honour the country's unique blend of culture, religion, and identity. Such a model is essential to unite people not as Bangalees or Bangladeshis but as a community of\u00a0Boishamma Birodhee Jonogan\u00a0committed to justice and opportunities for all.\nThe IG's immediate priorities should include: i) bringing high-profile detainees to justice through a transparent judicial process; ii) reducing the influence of syndicates in essential sectors like food and housing; iii) increasing representation from a diverse set of stakeholders in the decision-making process; and iv) establishing a systematic, regular reporting process by the IG on progress and challenges to build public trust and transparency. Rather than waiting for another crisis to unfold, the IG should leverage its intelligence units to gather insights and proactively address growing discontent, some of which may be fuelled by competing factions.\n\nAlongside these short-term actions, the IG must work on building a resilient governance model. A \"Bangladesh 2.0\" model should balance pragmatic action with justice and inclusivity, creating institutions that uphold democratic values and avoid past mistakes. Long-term goals should focus on strengthening institutions, establishing clear accountability pathways, and securing diplomatic stability to foster sustainable growth.\nIn international diplomacy, the IG faces the challenge of balancing ties with key allies while asserting Bangladesh's sovereignty. With Trump's re-election and close ties to Indian Prime Minister Modi, Bangladesh must navigate this complex landscape by emphasising its commitment to democratic values, stability, and regional cooperation. Strengthening partnerships with the US on counterterrorism and climate issues, while fostering respectful cooperation with India on economic and security concerns, will allow the IG to secure Bangladesh's interests amid shifting alliances.\nMoreover, the IG can leverage the unique asset of Professor Yunus and his extensive international network to reinforce Bangladesh's diplomatic credibility. Balancing these international relationships with domestic priorities will require both skilful negotiation and a clear commitment to the interests of working people.\nBangladesh has defied odds before, but today's greatest challenge is to bridge the widening divide between the elites and the working people. The IG must embrace principled pragmatism\u2014a balance of foundational values and adaptable, practical approaches\u2014to withstand political change and foster resilience. By addressing immediate needs and laying the groundwork for sustainable institutions, the IG can forge a future that honours its people and stands strong in the face of future challenges.\nShafiqul Islam\u00a0is director of Water Diplomacy, professor of civil and environmental engineering and water diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, US.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Bangladesh boasts the title of being the second largest global RMG exporter. The garments sector has contributed to transforming the local economy to lower-middle income from one that was worryingly below the poverty line. Although worth a staggering amount of $55 billion a year, the industry's infrastructure is far from perfect. Be it political unrests in the country, sustainability concerns from pressure groups or worker dissatisfaction, it is riddled with issues that need to be urgently addressed. Not to mention that workers are paid less than a living wage, which is not inflation adjusted to the soaring costs.\nBangladesh has a class problem which deters from effective conversations about the many barriers to operational unionisation in the garment industry. Without trade unions, it is difficult to address safety issues and elevate workers to fair wages and improved working conditions. The Labour Act 2006 governs labour relations and workers' rights in myriads of sectors of Bangladesh with an entire chapter dedicated to trade unions and industrial relations. Following the dreadful Rana Plaza collapse, the legislation had various amendments made to it to ensure workplace safety, maintain health standards and improve workers' rights and representation. Additionally, to ascertain that the formation and registration of trade unions is facilitated, provisions were strengthened.\nWhile this Act explicitly grants permission for trade unions to be formed, a minimum of 20 percent of workers within the same establishment are required to register one. The registration process is dauntingly bureaucratic and involves extensive paperwork. By the virtue of this legislation, the registered trade unions have the right to represent their members and can engage in collective bargaining on behalf of their members and negotiate better wages, working conditions, and other benefits. Employer interference through imposing any contractual obligations on workers to not join any union, dismissal or discrimination of workers who are members of any union, and refusal of employment on such grounds is deemed unlawful through the Labour Act 2006.\nIt has been established that on paper there is a comprehensive guide for operation of this in an ideal world, but the reality is far from it. The implementation is dangerously deficient. Lack of awareness of the workers themselves prevent them from recognising the benefits of collective bargaining. It does not help that the legislation is riddled with legal jargons that a lay person cannot comprehend. Workers in the garment sector also fear ramifications from employers as they consider themselves low skilled and highly replaceable. There is sufficient precedence of fear mongering by employers in this regard with reports of intimidation, harassment, and retaliations against union organisers and participating workers alike. Historically, the government has been complicit in the maltreatment of workers as they often prioritise increasing the GDP of the country rather than emphasising better standards of living.\nEarlier this year, following massive protests by garment industry workers, the minimum wage was increased from Tk 8,300 to Tk 12,500, whereas workers and trade unions say that Tk 23,500 is the living wage. Even this unsatisfactory increase came at the cost of the lives of four workers, while many others were left injured. Many workers were arrested without any possibility of bail. During this time, letters have been issued by big-brand buyers such as ASOS, Hugo Boss, and H&M asking for suppliers to conclude negotiations peacefully and offer the workers an adequate living wage. Buyers conveniently neglected to quote the amount asked for by the workers in those letters. So, they are indirectly colluding with the employers in the maltreatment of these workers by not up taking the cost of increasing the minimum wage.\nDespite legal frameworks being present, it could prove to be useful to simplify the union registration process. Many NGOs and grassroot organisations are running awareness campaigns to ascertain that workers are aware of their rights to unionise. However, it is pertinent for the government to also be involved in the process and detract from the unfair power dynamics between the workers and employers. Employers should face penalisation for engaging in intimidation or any other unfair practices to prevent workers from forming unions. International pressure by purchasers on employers in the garment industry should be more than just condemnations on paper, it should be more than hollow commitments to support a minimum wage, and they should reaffirm the exact amount demanded by the unions and workers.\nThe barriers to effective unionisation by workers in Bangladesh remain a critical issue and tackling it is the first step to creating a long overdue fair and equitable working environment for the blue-collar workers on whose backs this country runs.\nRaina Sabanta is a barrister.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
