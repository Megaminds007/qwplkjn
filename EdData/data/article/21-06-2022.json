Five years later, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s coalition has emerged as the second largest bloc in the French Parliament with 131 seats, clearly showing a resurgence of the left. Mr. Macron\u2019s party, Renaissance, and its allies won 245 seats, short of the 289 needed for absolute majority in the 577-member National Assembly. The far-right National Rally led by Marine Le Pen came third with 89 seats, a historic high. The results largely endorsed the trend that was visible during the presidential elections earlier this year. In the first round, the two far-right candidates \u2014 Ms. Le Pen and \u00c9ric Zemmour \u2014 and the Left\u2019s Mr. M\u00e9lenchon together polled more than 50% of votes. Mr. Macron secured a comfortable victory in the run-off, but his margin over Ms. Le Pen shrank substantially unlike in 2017 \u2014 an indicator of slow-burning voter resentment. Mr. M\u00e9lenchon read the tea leaves correctly and built a wider leftist platform to fight the parliamentary polls. He forged an alliance with socialists, communists and greens, trying to avoid a split among voters in the left of centre spectrum. Ms. Le Pen doubled down on her anti-immigrant populism. Mr. Macron, faced with a two-flank attack, could not hold his centrist fort.France\u2019s polity, traditionally dominated by the centre-right Conservatives and centre-left Socialists, has undergone structural changes. As the old consensus collapsed, Mr. Macron, a liberal populist, emerged as the guardian of the status quo. With pro-market economic policies and social liberalism, he projected himself as an alternative to the emerging new left and far-right parties. Though it helped him win back-to-back presidential elections, he could not calm rising resentment, which has finally hit his own party. The next five years will be harder for him than his previous term. He will have to stitch an alliance with the conservatives or win support from the left to drive his legislative agenda. What makes matters worse is a relentless cost-of-living crisis that has shaken western economies. France has managed to control fuel and electricity prices, for now, with a cap, but consumer price inflation has hit record levels. With a mushrooming energy crisis in the wake of Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion, France, dependent on energy imports, is facing added pressure. This explains Mr. Macron\u2019s guarded approach towards the conflict. Unlike the U.K., the U.S. or eastern European countries, he has repeatedly called for ending the war through talks. Unless the war ends, he cannot tackle the inflationary pressure effectively. And unless he tackles the cost-of-living crisis, he cannot stop the new left and the far-right from eating into his support base.",

        "full_article": "There is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about China\u2019s decision on June 16 to block the UN Security Council designation of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) deputy chief Abdul Rahman Makki as a terrorist, given that Beijing had repeatedly blocked the designation of the Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar until 2019, and other terror designations prior to that. Here too, the pile of evidence against Abdul Makki is considerable: that he is part of the command and control of the UNSC-designated terror group LeT, later renamed the Jamaat ud Dawa (JuD), which is also a UN-designated terror group, is in no doubt. He was not just a member of the governing body or \u201cShura\u201d; he served as the head of its \u201cforeign relations\u201d department, and raised funding. He is also a member of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed\u2019s family (brother in law). The LeT/JuD has been prosecuted in India, the United States and even Pakistan for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and Makki was himself tried and sentenced by a Pakistani special court to nine years imprisonment on terror financing charges \u2014 a ruling overturned a year later. India wants him for his involvement in attacks over the past two decades, including the Red Fort attack in Delhi in 2000, and, more recently, in attacks on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. He is on India\u2019s UAPA list of designated terrorists and also the U.S.\u2019s Specially Designated Global Terrorists with a $2 million reward for information that would convict him. Given what India and the U.S., which forwarded the proposal to put him on the UNSC\u2019s 1267 list of terrorists linked to the al Qaeda and ISIL, have called \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence, New Delhi has termed China\u2019s move to place a hold on the process (this could delay it for as much as six months) as \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d.While China\u2019s actions may be motivated by growing acrimony with the U.S. and India, it is necessary to analyse the situation beyond bilateral tensions. That Beijing\u2019s last-minute hold on Makki\u2019s listing came even as the Financial Action Task Force was meeting in Berlin to credit Pakistan\u2019s actions on terror financing, and begin the process to relieve it from the grey list, pending an on-site visit in the next few months, may not be a coincidence. While China defends its actions on Makki and previous designations that it blocked as \u201ctechnical objections\u201d based on \u201cprocedural\u201d loopholes, it is clearly part of a pattern of protecting Pakistan internationally. It is also notable that as a result of China\u2019s objections or otherwise, none of the terror designations under UNSC 1267 thus far against LeT commander Zaki ur Rahman Lakhvi in 2008, Hafiz Saeed in 2009 and Masood Azhar in 2019 actually contains charges against them for any attacks carried out in India. Beyond criticism and continued pursuance of the listing, it is necessary for the Government to continue to gather evidence and systematically build its case on cross-border terrorism on the international stage that cannot be derailed by political or geopolitical considerations.",

        "full_article": "Well-known civic rights activist Mizanur Rahman's narration of his harrowing experience of being picked up by police and tortured under custody, published in this newspaper's online version on June 15, gives us some disturbing snapshots of the unlawful actions of our law enforcement agencies. As a keen follower of developments related to human rights, I am reminded of the term used by the Committee Against Torture (CAT) of the United Nations for these kinds of arbitrary and unlawful abductions by members of law enforcing agencies. It's called \"unacknowledged detentions.\" Though Mizanur's four-and-a-half-hours-long unacknowledged detention came to an end to the relief of his family, the pains and psychological distress he suffered would no doubt stay with him forever.\nIs this unacknowledged detention of Mizanur an exception or deviation in policing practices? Unfortunately, recent trends suggest it has become a preferred tactic to bypass the mandatory legal requirement of producing the suspect before a magistrate within 24 hours. People disappear like characters of a fictional thriller and, if luck favours, they reappear, shown arrested just hours before from some strange place and produced before a court with a petition for remand. The UNCAT, in its concluding observation published on August 26, 2019 said, \"The Committee is seriously concerned at numerous, consistent reports that the State party's officials have arbitrarily deprived persons of their liberty, subsequently killed many of them and failed to disclose their whereabouts or fate. Such conduct is defined in international human rights law as enforced disappearance, whether or not the victim is killed or reappears later.\"\nIn Mizanur's case, when police picked him up from Bikrampur Plaza, he was misled into believing that it would be just a normal chat with the Deputy Commissioner. But soon he realised that something was not right and managed to inform his daughter. Soon afterwards, he was surrounded by several other police personnel and huddled into a car. In the car, they started misbehaving with him and snatched away his mobile phone. While his family members contacted the local police station, Shyampur Thana, law enforcement members expressed their ignorance about his detention. Though, at that time, he was either in their custody or was just being handed over to the Detective Branch (DB).\nUnlike other victims of unacknowledged detention, Mizanur gave a vivid description of the demeaning behaviour he was subjected to by a senior officer at the Shyampur police station and the physical torture he had to endure there. In his words, \"At one point, the female officer ordered that I be beaten up. A policeman was standing there with a stick. Once ordered, he beat me hard several times.\" He added, \"I have so far fought a lot to live with self-respect. Being beaten like this was unacceptable to me. Yes, I have been beaten up before on the road while protesting some cause. But being beaten up like this just for saying something really hurt my self-respect. I could hardly speak. I had never felt so helpless. It also enraged me,\" he said. He was not allowed to drink any water and was kept standing the whole time (about an hour) at the police station. He was threatened with the possible arrest of his wife and daughters as they too sometimes stood by him during civic protests.\nAfterwards, Mizanur along with another arrestee were handcuffed, blindfolded and taken in a car to the DB headquarters. His blindfold was only removed after he was taken to a high official's office there. But, there too, he was threatened that he could be falsely implicated in cases such as illegal possession of yaba. Later, after another three hours of mental agony, his family was called in and he was finally let go, most likely as a result of the alarm raised by other social activists and the constant enquiries from the media.\nMany of us, including his family, had felt relieved that he was lucky enough to have been found alive and freed, unlike many other victims of enforced or involuntary disappearances. Thereby, not many voices have sought accountability of the officials responsible for his unlawful abduction or unacknowledged detention and torture under custody. Mizanur's detention was the precise kind that was unacknowledged, as there won't be any official records of police ever picking him up without a warrant, interrogating him without the presence of his lawyer, subjecting him to dehumanising or cruel behaviour and beating him under custody, keeping him blindfolded and hand-cuffed. All these acts are defined as torture under our law.\nIt all happened despite the fact that Mizanur was not a suspect for any criminal acts or named in any cases anywhere in the country. He is, however, famous for his unique protests demanding safe drinking water from the supplying authority, Dhaka Wasa. He is also known to have taken part in other civic protests and for expressing opinions critical of the government and state entities, including the police, for corruption and irregularities.\nWhat Mizanur encountered since he was picked up from Bikrampur Plaza till his release are punishable offences under our own law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, 2013. There are further stipulations by the Supreme Court in implementing the Act due to reported allegations of such violence, particularly in the context of custodial situations where law enforcement agencies seek to obtain confessional statements from the arrestees following arrest or detention. The UNCAT, too, in its final observation, recommended that the government should \"[u]nambiguously affirm at the highest level\u2026 that law enforcement authorities must immediately cease engaging in the practice of unacknowledged detention.\" The Supreme Court's guidelines were issued in 2016, three years before the UNCAT's recommendations.\nWe need an end to unacknowledged detention and custodial torture. And it should begin with an independent investigation into Mizanur's unacknowledged detention. Without accountability of the perpetrators of such unlawful brutality and torture, they won't end.\n\u00a0\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist and writes from London, UK.

        "full_article": "From a small village-level local government election to the larger parliamentary polls, every election is a learning opportunity \u2013 that's the beauty of a working democracy. The recently concluded Cumilla City Corporation election was no different. Now, it's completely up to the stakeholders \u2013 the Election Commission (EC), the contending political parties, the voters, the observers, etc. \u2013 to decide what they are going to do with these \"lessons\", whether they're going to do anything differently the next time, or make the same mistakes again.\nInterestingly, the only stakeholder that seems to be making decisions based on these lessons are the voters. In the last city corporation polls in Cumilla 10 years ago, over seven out of every 10 voters turned up to vote. This time, the turnout was less than 60 percent.\nAlthough six out of 10 is still quite high in the national context, it is quite low for Cumilla. This decrease could be a reflection of the general voters' fast-depleting trust in the election process. It could be that they don't have confidence in the EC to ensure a level-playing field for all the contestants or that their votes would make any difference in determining the final result.\nIn all fairness, the \"rookie\" commissioners assumed office at a time when the EC's credibility is in ruins. None of the ECs in the past decade has managed to hold free and fair elections, barring a few stray ones. With this massive baggage, the Cumilla city poll was truly the first real test of character for the EC.\nThe EC was turned into a laughing stock when the local ruling party lawmaker blatantly ignored its order to stay out of the city before and during the election, and the EC did absolutely nothing to enforce it. So, we will have to wait and see what the EC does to recover from this embarrassment.\nThe Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said that the EC cannot do anything against a lawmaker if he \"dishonours\" the commission's directives. But that is not true. If the commission thinks that someone's interference can hamper the holding of a free and fair election, the commission can postpone it.\nFormer election commissioner Brigadier General (retd) M Sakhawat Hossain said that during the first election in Cumilla in 2012, when a minister went to the election area, the commission, through the returning officer, sent a message that if the minister did not leave the area within an hour, the election would be postponed. The minister then left the area.\nThe failure by this commission to take such a bold step raises the question: If the EC cannot control one lawmaker, how will it control 300 lawmakers in the next parliamentary polls? The last-minute drama over the announcement of the election result also raised questions over its competency to hold fair polls.\nThe Awami League and BNP also have major takeaways from the election. For the BNP, the lesson is crystal clear: The party cannot afford to lose elections by allowing its local level leaders to \"cannibalise\" each other. For the ruling AL, it's a major wakeup call ahead of next year's national elections. Although the AL barely escaped with a close victory in Cumilla this year because the opposition tent was not united, it's a clear indication that the anti-incumbency factor is very much in effect now.\nAlthough the election was partisan in nature, the ruling AL candidate contested the election with the party symbol, while his main contender, expelled BNP leader Monirul Haque Sakku, contested it with the clock symbol. This gave Rifat an upper hand.\nThe AL candidate got around 38 percent of the total votes cast. Usually, it is estimated that AL has around 40 percent of votes in the country. In that sense, AL's vote bank remained almost intact even after staying in office for the last 13 years at a stretch. But the party could not bag the floating votes, and it is probably because of the anti-incumbency factor. So, AL needs to think about the floating votes if it really wants to compete in the upcoming national elections. Otherwise, it will face a serious setback in the next polls.\nOn the other hand, although BNP boycotted the election, two of its leaders contested the polls and together got around 80,000 votes. The BNP candidates lost as their votes were split. But they bagged around 60 percent of the votes. The BNP's vote bank is estimated to be less than 40 percent. So, the result showed that it got the votes of the floating voters.\nThe lesson for BNP is that if it can choose the proper candidates and remain on the field till the last minute of the polls, it has a good chance in the next elections. But again, a good election is not entirely dependent on the BNP. The election result also showed that AL's votes did not increase \u2013 rather its candidate won the polls by taking advantage of the vote split of the two expelled BNP candidates.\nThe most important factor that drew my attention was the lack of festivity and enthusiasm over voting. In recent times, almost all the local government elections were one-sided. And many of the times, those who were elected won the elections uncontested. Even in Cumilla polls, two ward councillors were elected uncontested. That is perhaps why people have lost trust in the electoral system.\n\u00a0\nMohammad\u00a0Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Years ago, when I was about eight-years-old, I heard a teacher say that a woman's lungs are stronger than a man's. It sounded strange even to my young and untrained ears. When I asked my mother, she first snapped at the absent teacher, but then explained how in our world, a boy child is valued far more than a girl. And it starts at the cradle \u2013 people rush in when a baby boy cries, but not a baby girl. Hence her lungs are stronger because they get more exercise.\nThe explanation still did not make sense. I was yet to understand what being a woman meant. In our country, most girls are raised with the expectation of fairy-tale marriages. A dream is spun for her with hopes of beautiful dresses, jewellery, a loving husband, and children. She is also taught that however educated, she cannot be happy or fulfilled until she is married. It's as though that fairy-tale is meant to compensate for being taught that girls are softer and lesser than boys in every sphere of life.\nAfter marriage, with her dreams of a happy household, the girl suddenly is faced with the politics of her in-laws. In most cases, she needs permission from her husband and in-laws to even visit her parents. She is tested in various ways by her new family members. These tests are mostly demeaning and often abusive. Her life is dictated by the expectations of others in her new family \u2013 including when to have children, whether she can continue her studies, or have a career. However, if she complains about these ordeals, she is told that the happiness of a woman lies in making other people happy, not herself. The definition of \"happily ever after\" suddenly changes \u2013 it was never her happiness that was intended, but that of others \u2013 her husband, her children, and her in-laws. People nod in approval when they find such a selfless woman. In other words, a woman's selfhood must be sacrificed for the welfare of the society. The ideal existence society intends for her is one of self-abnegation.\nWhen I was growing up, I heard people describe my maternal grandmother as a woman of great prowess. She had given birth to fourteen children, including two that died in infancy, and managed her huge household with capable hands. She rose early in the morning before anybody else, and was the last one to go to bed. As a child, I only saw her as a loving nanu who readily fulfilled my wishes. But now when I look back, I also see that she was a woman who was denied her own dreams. Married off at age 12 and unable to fulfil her own desire for higher education, she devoted herself to raising her children to be successful in life. That was the best that she could have.\nMany would say that times have changed now and women have become independent. As I look around, I see that things have become even more difficult when women are working and taking care of the household at the same time. She is continuously urged to be perfect, even more of a goddess than her mother and grandmother. If something goes wrong with her children, it is invariably her fault because she did not give them enough time. Few notice her financial contribution to the family and even condemn her for buying sarees or personal items with her earnings. I have heard educated men make snide remarks like, \"Women work because they are not happy with their husbands' earnings,\" or \"Working women make bad mothers.\"\nTo be successful as a woman means withstanding societal pressure from all quarters, and having to brace themselves for each day as if nothing is wrong. Women are supposedly the weaker sex, but the reality is that to be independent and successful in a patriarchal setting, a woman has to be far stronger than her male counterparts. To establish herself, she has to encounter far more obstacles than a man.\nA strong woman, then, is one who has endured extreme difficulty, even harassment or abuse, and learnt to live with it as best she can. Have you wondered why these women are sometimes referred to as crazy or eccentric? A sane man apparently cannot imagine leading the life of a woman because that life is too restrained and limited. And yet a woman is made to live such a life because she is not a man.\nBy hailing these women as \"strong\" and worthy of admiration, society recognises their suffering with grudging respect, while also endorsing and perpetuating their ordeals: \"She is a strong woman and she can bear anything.\" Just because women have bravely borne ill treatment doesn't mean that it is justified. It is high time to look upon a woman as a full human being, not just as somebody's mother, wife, sister, or daughter who will sacrifice her life and ambitions for the \"greater good\" of society.\n\u00a0\nSohana Manzoor\u00a0is Associate Professor, Department of English & Humanities, ULAB.

        "full_article": "It was pitch-dark when I entered Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital on Saturday afternoon. The ground floor was submerged in knee-high floodwater. I climbed up the stairs to the first floor to find an elderly patient named Ana Miah lying on the floor.\nAs the ground floor of the hospital got flooded that morning, all the patients were moved to the first floor. Ana Miah was struggling to breathe, no oxygen available for him as the central oxygen line had been disconnected, thanks to the power outage that engulfed not just the hospital, but the entire Sylhet district.\nWhile this is the scenario in the city, one can only imagine the suffering the people in the remote areas of Sylhet and Sunamganj have been enduring since Wednesday. Just imagine: Your house is under floodwater, there's no electricity, your phone is out of charge and mobile network, there's no food or any hope of being rescued.\nPeople from outside the flooded region, who have family members and/or friends stranded in the area, are similarly distressed as they can't contact their loved ones. Social media is swamped with posts from worried users seeking any update about their stranded loved ones or any information of rescue attempts.\nAfter several attempts, I managed to establish contact with some remote areas. All I heard was people in distress, pleading to be rescued. Even the shelters in the remote areas are waiting for relief.\nAll means of connectivity are gone. One can hardly find a boat to wade through the flood; the boatmen who are willing to give a ride are asking for an exorbitant amount of fare. Sylhet Deputy Commissioner Md Mozibor Rahman said even the administration is struggling to find boats to extend rescue and relief work to the remote areas. Police, army, navy and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel, as well as the general public, are trying to provide help in any way possible.\nBut what shocks me is the nonchalant attitude of our public representatives. Most of the MPs, upazila and union chairmen, and city and municipality councillors are absent in this moment of crisis. Only a few people, like Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment Minister Imran Ahmed, were seen coming to his constituency to extend humanitarian support to the distressed people.\nAnd I have been seeing a general lacklustre attitude towards flood management for a while. Since the flash floods in 2017 destroyed Boro harvest in the country's northeast region, I have been constantly searching for a concrete explanation as to why floods have been so devastating in the region in recent times.\nThe answer is complex. Experts have tried to explain it in many ways, but it boils down to a combination of climate change, destruction of hills, deforestation, unplanned development work in the wetlands, and the massive loss of navigability in all the rivers in the upper and lower Meghna basin.\nAll of these reasons are the results of human actions.\nHas the government come up with any solutions to manage floods? I see none. After repeated calls from concerned citizens, it is rather disappointing to see the government only focused on infrastructural development, with little to no concern about conserving nature and the environment.\nSeveral concerned organisations and citizens have already urged the authorities to declare the flood-affected areas as a \"disaster zone,\" per the Disaster Management Act, 2012. Doing so will empower the local administrations to work more extensively and ease getting adequate support from all government offices.\nThe flood is just the beginning of the disaster. It will take months to rehabilitate the affected population and rebuild what has been damaged by the calamity. I hope the authorities concerned are preparing for that.\n\u00a0\nDwoha Chowdhury\u00a0is a journalist at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "We're alarmed to learn that the Press Council Act, 1974 is being amended with a provision for fining a journalist up to Tk 10 lakh if found involved in any \"illegal or criminal activities\". The likelihood of this happening has been confirmed by the chairman of Bangladesh Press Council, who said the draft of the amendment may be placed in parliament after it is approved by the Cabinet Division. As per a report by this daily, he also claimed that all journalist-representatives in the council had \"agreed\" to it and that the issue had been \"regularly discussed with the current committee\", although some committee members denied having any such discussion. It appears that a discussion to increase penalties did take place five years ago, but none on the proposed amendment.\nThe mystery surrounding this issue aside, the fact that the press council felt the need to impose such penalties for activities which should already be covered by the existing criminal law is disconcerting. It may involve changing an existing norm too as, according to one member, Press Council cases can only be filed against organisations, not against any journalist.We understand the importance of enhancing the power of the press council, especially when it comes to upholding ethics and fairness in journalism. But often, the threat to ethical journalism is from the system, not from individual journalists. Currently, the council can rebuke a journalist if their wrongdoing is proven but nothing beyond that.\nBut such hefty fines potentially add to a growing list of legal tools being used to create a culture of fear for journalists, who are already walking a tightrope with various draconian laws and regulations. It may contribute to further shrinking the space for them. They need to work independently to cover stories important to citizens, with no fear of retribution from any quarter whatsoever.\nThat said, we wholeheartedly support any move to ensure responsible journalism. But hefty fines and repressive laws for individual journalists or media organisations are not the way to go about it. There is no denying that journalists practising objective journalism can strengthen democracy in the country. No country or regime can thrive by throttling the voice of the people. Thus, we find the proposed amendment to the Press Council Act to be problematic, and therefore oppose it. We hope it will be rejected by the Cabinet Division.\n",

        "full_article": "It is most unfortunate that even after four and a half years have passed since the repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar was signed in November 2017, the process to take back stranded Rohingyas still could not be initiated. Although bilateral talks between the two countries resumed in January this year \u2013 after a two-year suspension due to Covid and the military takeover in Myanmar \u2013 no substantive outcome came out of it. Bangladesh has been asking Myanmar, for quite some time, to expedite the verification of Rohingyas to fast-track their repatriation. But the Myanmar authorities seem to be reluctant to do so. It appears they are just wasting time in the name of verifying Myanmar nationals, who fled around five years ago after enduring a brutal military crackdown in the Rakhine State.\nMeanwhile, international funding for the Rohingyas is declining rapidly. While the humanitarian agencies need more than USD 881 million this year to support the Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar and Bhasan Char as well as the host communities there, according to the UNHCR, they have only received 13 percent of the required fund as of last month. With the funding for the refugees waning, the government is facing a huge pressure in taking care of such a large number of refugees. The recent rise in violence, drug peddling, human trafficking and other criminal activities in and around the camp areas has also become a security threat for Bangladesh.\nUnder the circumstances, both Bangladesh and the international community must put greater strategic pressure on Myanmar to take back its citizens, and it must do so by ensuring that the conditions in the Rakhine State are safe and conducive for their return. Reportedly, Bangladesh had handed over the names of 8.4 lakh Rohingyas to Myanmar officials, but so far, they have only verified around 42,000 of them. And despite some attempts to take them back, many Rohingyas refused to return because of the uncertainties surrounding their citizenship and safety. This is only fair. Why would they go back to their country if they are not given citizenship? But having to take their responsibility indefinitely is also unfair from Bangladesh's perspective. The onus rests with Myanmar to solve this unique problem which it created.\nIn order to resolve the current stalemate, both Bangladesh and Myanmar should hold regular meetings through their Joint Working Group and Technical Working group. And the role of the international community cannot be underestimated either. They should put significant pressure on Myanmar to expedite the verification process and grant citizenship to the Rohingyas. The world must act unitedly to reduce the plight of the forcibly displaced Rohingyas and to repatriate them to their own country.\n",

Although the media has discussed the unsustainability of the military pension status quo, the official press release said that the only motivation for the scheme is \u201cattracting young talent from the society who are more in tune with contemporary technological trends and plough back skilled, disciplined and motivated manpower into the society\u201d.\nBut skirting fiscal reasons may have created an impression, at the popular level, that GoI needlessly foisted another disruptive scheme on unsuspecting masses. The reality is quite different.

        "full_article": "Over 500 trains were cancelled yesterday following protests against Agnipath. The cancellation follows instances of arson and wilful destruction of railway property last week. Yet again, Indian Railways (IR) has been made collateral damage. In the pre-pandemic period, IR carried about 22 million passengers a day, a measure of the scale of its importance. Cancellations not only directly inconvenience millions but undermine the economy as railway rakes transport 3.3 million tons of freight daily, mainly coal. This senseless destruction and related disruption should not be shrugged off.\nIR is the lightning rod of protests primarily because of its importance. Disrupting railway service attracts wide attention. While IR is unconnected to the cause of violence, can it do better in protecting its assets? IR\u2019s security is overseen by its own force, Railway Protection Force (RPF), and backed by central legislation. As trains crisscross states, state governments also come into the picture. Government Railway Police (GRP), funded equally by IR and states but under the administrative control of the local government, and local police assist in safeguarding railway assets and passengers.\nRPF doesn\u2019t lack attention. It\u2019s not only empowered to arrest without a magistrate\u2019s order, in 2019 handpicked personnel were given commando training. If IR\u2019s security performance is still unsatisfactory, it\u2019s because of gaps in coordination with the state police. This was examined in detail in a 2011 CAG performance audit of IR\u2019s security. GRP and state police forces handle security of trains, tracks and railway premises, while RPF protects properties and consignments. The performance of local policing is influenced by a state government\u2019s political signalling. Consequently, the leeway agitations get has a direct impact on IR\u2019s assets.\nIn this unfavourable environment, CAG\u2019s report observed that a unified overseeing arrangement between RPF and state police is missing. In short, there are coordination problems that IR has not addressed. Given last week\u2019s destruction, it\u2019s clear coordination gaps remain unplugged. Their cost will be borne by people who rely on IR. Between FY-2016 and FY-2020, losses on passenger service rose from Rs 36,286 crore to Rs 63,364 crore. Given GoI\u2019s fiscal challenges and limited rail budgets, willy-nilly people dependent on train travel will suffer. RPF, headed by a police officer on deputation, needs to strengthen its coordination protocols with local police. Trains can\u2019t be such easy targets for arsonists.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.  \n\n\n\n\nEND OF ARTICLE\n\n\n\nOpinions \nHindu-Muslim: Facts vs fear: Logic, data belie scaremongering on minorities.

        "full_article": "Bihar\u2019s Agnipath protests have put the focus on the state\u2019s massive youth unemployment. They\u2019re also showcasing a political drama \u2013 centred around CM Nitish Kumar\u2019s dilemmas. State BJP leaders have sharpened their attacks on Nitish, blaming him for poor policing. Nitish\u2019s position on caste census, rewriting history books and population control had earlier discomfited BJP. But, still, the alliance chugs on from one controversy to the next.\nBJP and RJD with 77 and 75 legislators respectively have reduced JD(U)\u2019s 45 MLAs to a small but crucial party in Bihar\u2019s 243-member assembly. Recall JD(U) had 115 legislators in 2010. In office almost continuously since 2005, anti-incumbency is predictably harshest on Nitish. Young male voters who thronged Tejashwi Yadav\u2019s rallies in 2020 were a signal to Nitish to hand over the baton to ally BJP, which effectively targeted women voters with central schemes. It was BJP\u2019s impressive showing that helped NDA cross the finish line, but Nitish walked away with the crown.\nNitish now faces the choice of being an increasingly unhappy ally of BJP and remaining CM or crossing over to RJD, in which case he will almost certainly not be the CM face in next polls. The problem here is that JD(U)\u2019s political future is entirely determined by Nitish\u2019s calculations about his status. Even if it makes sense for JD(U) to switch to RJD again \u2013 the two combined had swept away BJP in 2015 \u2013 Nitish may not take that call. Protecting his place in Bihar politics being the bigger objective. Person over party can be a costly folly, as Gandhis-led Congress has shown. Even AAP is in a bind \u2013 Arvind Kejriwal wants to be both high-profile Delhi CM and help grow the party \u2013 a tough ask.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.  \n\n\n\n\nEND OF ARTICLE\n\n\n\nOpinions \nHindu-Muslim: Facts vs fear: Logic, data belie scaremongering on minorities.
