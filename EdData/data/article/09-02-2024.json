However, mere uniformity without making reasonable allowances for diverse cultural and social practices among different social groups may not be ideal. The UCC adopted by the Uttarakhand Assembly aims to consolidate the laws relating to marriage, divorce and succession among all communities. The State has become the first since pre-Independence Goa to adopt a uniform code for civil matters. What is particularly violative of the Constitution is the bizarre portion in this UCC aiming to formalise live-in relationships through registration. This unwanted incursion into citizens\u2019 personal life is worsened by the prescription of a three-month prison term for non-registration. It will expose citizens to intrusive inquiries, social hostility and pointless deprivation of liberty. While it contains positive features such as conferring legitimacy on children born of live-in relations and mandating maintenance in the event of desertion, the very idea that people living together should submit themselves to registration and verification is repugnant to individual rights.When the Constitution makers made the adoption of a UCC one of the directive principles, opinion was divided on whether a UCC will undermine minority rights or promote equal status for women in all religions. B.R. Ambedkar felt the UCC, if enacted, should be voluntary in the initial stages. The previous Law Commission had said a UCC is neither desirable nor necessary, and, instead, suggested that each body of personal law be reformed to eliminate discrimination or regressive practices. However, the present Law Commission has revived the idea and has started gathering views from the public. Much of the Uttarakhand Code seems to have been borrowed from existing laws on marriage and succession, but with significant omissions. For instance, the Code is the only avenue for dissolving a marriage and there is no waiting period to remarry after a divorce; nor is there any need for a woman to marry another person before she can re-marry her former husband. These provisions, which eliminate the concepts of iddat, talaq and nikah halala, are all progressive and further individual rights. Interestingly, it preserves the existing provision allowing custom and usage as an exception to the bar on marriage within prohibited degrees of relationship, but adds a rider that such custom cannot be against public policy or morality. An unfortunate fallout of all this is a polarising discourse taking shape in the run-up to the general election. The concept of justice should not be lost in the search for uniformity, which should be no more than an incidental consequence of equality. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ncivil\n\n/\n\ncivil rights\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nUttarakhand\n\n/\n\nGoa\n\n/\n\nconstitution\n\n/\n\nRight to Privacy\n\n/\n\nprison\n\n/\n\nhuman rights\n\n/\n\nmarriage\n\n/\n\ndivorce\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\njustice and rights",

        "full_article": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that former U.S. President Donald Trump does not enjoy immunity from prosecution for crimes that he might have committed during his term in office, in the context of charges against him relating to undermining the constitutional democracy of the country. The ruling by the court\u2019s federal appeals panel implies that Mr. Trump can be tried in the case against him relating to a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which he faces four counts including conspiring to defraud the U.S. and to obstruct an official proceeding. However, because a month has passed since the time that the court heard arguments on immunity and issued the latest ruling, a high-pressure situation has emerged in terms of scheduling and carrying out the conspiracy trial before the date of this year\u2019s election, November 5. The prosecuting team, led by Special Counsel Jack Smith, is concerned that if Mr. Trump appeals the immunity decision and uses other stalling tactics in the conspiracy case, the trial might extend past the election date. In such a scenario, there might be a real risk that should Mr. Trump win the presidency again, he could use his position as a sitting president to either get the case against himself dismissed or potentially issue a self-pardon.While the Circuit Court has given Mr. Trump until February 12 to appeal its decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court justices will take on such a highly charged political case as the present one. Even if they do, it might well be weeks or months before a decision is made. Already, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether, under the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, Mr. Trump\u2019s name can be deleted from State ballots \u2014 as States such as Colorado have sought to do \u2014 under its \u201cinsurrection clause\u201d. The bottom line is this: Mr. Trump will continue battling legal cases throughout this lopsided election season and will potentially continue doing so after the election too. What remains to be seen is whether his legal battles affect his reputation among voters, positively or negatively. In the former case, the scenario of a convicted President, even one who governs from prison, cannot be ruled out under the U.S. Constitution. If the cases diminish his overall popularity and he falls short of securing the presidency, his political career may be at an end, but Trumpism as a movement reflecting broad voter frustration with the policies and values of traditional Republican and Democratic politics will continue to shape the destiny of the United States. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nUS PRESIDENTIAL POLLS\n\n/\n\ncrime, law and justice\n\n/\n\nconstitution",

The meaning of right or wrong, just or unjust, even traditional or modern, keeps shifting in new directions. Consider that most enduring stratification, patriarchy. Its look has been changing decade by decade, let alone century by century. Male domination could hardly remain impervious to young Indian women\u2019s literacy rising from 40% to 96% since 1981. A society undergoing such momentous changes wears out older laws at express pace. Like India\u2019s new criminal law codes, this is the most welcome quality of the Uttarakhand UCC bill. To meet needs of society as they are, rather than as they were. But such legislations need revision wherever they suffer tone deafness. Particularly to young people\u2019s thinking, living, doing.\n\nA lot of this dissonance is centred around assertions of individuality. Marriage is seen as being in service of family, live-in relationships are not. Why doesn\u2019t Uttarakhand govt feel the need to properly justify its plan to aggressively track live-in relationships, even though this is unprecedented? Because it is assumed that all parents will tacitly consent and clap. Lawmakers and judges are often only loyal to parents\u2019 generations. Their jobs require them to be much more open. Young people are pulling away from past scripts to write uncharted stories. Old headed institutions are made anxious by this confident adventurism. But while greybeards\u2019 entrenched power can inflict setback after setback on young \u2019uns, there is no stopping this tide. They will keep pursuing legalisation of gay marriage, criminalisation of marital rape, surrogacy rights for singletons, mandatory paternal leave, unsurveilled live-in relationships. Yes, the young lack the political heft of usual identity-based mobilisations. Yes, they don\u2019t threaten other people\u2019s life or property. They only challenge worldviews. Like income taxpayers, 3% of whom contribute to 48% of total collection, they have no vote-value. And yet, disregarding young people\u2019s voices is a giant socioeconomic self-goal.\nHow will young people chained up by past social mores, individual desires bent to bygone codes, live up to their potential? That\u2019s why it\u2019s in urgent national interest that lawmakers be guided by what Supreme Court said in its landmark Right to Privacy judgment. State should not intrude upon a citizen\u2019s personal liberty. In fact, protection of liberty is one of state\u2019s key remits. State isn\u2019t Papa. In any case, Papa doesn\u2019t know best.

Key question: why\u2019s there a huge demand for cheating\nStudents who spend years preparing for govt exams truly feel cheated when some fellow candidates cheat. GOI has tried to address this growing problem with a new bill, cleared by Lok Sabha on Feb 5.\nSevere punishment |\u00a0Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act 2024 sets store on deterrence through harsh punishments. Offences under this legislation are cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable.

That\u2019s necessary but not sufficient.\nDemand measures |\u00a0Students are absent from bill\u2019s provisions. They are buyers of dodgy services that lead to exam malpractice. It\u2019s likely that anti-cheating law sidesteps addressing demand issues because core problems are beyond its scope.\nCraze for govt jobs |ASER 2023 survey of rural students threw up insightful results about their aspirations.

ASER survey showed that underlying virtually all responses were students\u2019 assumption that good jobs are only to be found in govt institutions.\nQuality matters |\u00a0But govt jobs are a small fraction of total jobs.

        "full_article": "The recent central bank directive to slash cash incentives for exports has evoked strong reactions from businesses who consider the move detrimental. They are urging the government to restore the previous facilities. The country's apex chamber, FBCCI, conveyed its concerns to the finance minister in a letter, emphasising that reducing incentive rates for most export products is impractical given the current challenging economic climate. The letter reportedly highlighted several existing challenges that are now constraining exports. Of the challenges, increased interest rates on loans leading to higher manufacturing costs, reduced allocations from the Export Development Fund (EDF), halving of exporter's retention quota, and gas price hike are particularly pestering. According to the FBCCI, one of the sectors likely to be hit hard by the reduced incentive rates is the export-oriented spinning mills, numbering around two hundred, which serve as the primary source of fabric for garment factories. Industry insiders fear this could result in heightened dependence on imported fabrics, as lowered incentives would erode their competitiveness and force garment exporters to import yarn and fabrics. Additionally, the FBCCI letter warned that withdrawing cash incentives without implementing alternative measures would negatively affect both the RMG industry and overall economy.To recap, the central bank circular last week has announced reduced incentive rates for 43 export products for the remaining six months of the fiscal year. Among these products are readymade garments (RMG), crust leather, jute and jute goods, furniture, farm products, potatoes, and processed foods. Specifically, RMG will now receive a 0.50 per cent cash incentive compared to the previous 1.0 per cent, while the incentive for RMG exporters diversifying their products and markets has decreased from 4.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent. Additionally, other significant items such as agricultural products, jute products, light engineering, and plastic will experience reductions in rates ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 per cent. The decision was made on revision of the earlier August 2023 decision, which set incentive rates for products throughout the fiscal year 2023-2024. While the effectiveness of cash incentives in boosting exports has been debated, conclusive evidence is lacking due to the absence of comprehensive studies. Nevertheless, it is believed that cash incentives did help certain products, especially new and non-traditional ones, in accessing export markets. According to WTO rules, this practice is generally prohibited except for the least developed countries (LDCs). Although Bangladesh, as an LDC, is still exempt from this restriction, cash incentives for exports would have no place upon its expected graduation from LDC status after three years. According to reports from newspapers citing the central bank, this move is part of a gradual phasing out of incentives, which by 2026-when the country is set to graduate-would become prohibitive. In other words, rather than abruptly withdrawing the facility, the central bank has chosen a phased reduction approach, giving exporters some time to adaptHowever, given the feedback from businesses, it is crucial for the government to carefully consider their concerns in order to ensure that reduction of incentive rates doesn't adversely affect the country's export sector.",

        "full_article": "An apathy towards and even hostility to children's outdoor activities seems to be ingrained in the social attitude of urban people. Even few people complain against a dire shortage of open space in the capital Dhaka with a population density of 23,234 per square kilometre, second highest in the world after Manila with 43,611 per square kilometre. Although the data of population density presented by different international bodies vary, one thing is clear that Dhaka remains at the top echelon of the most densely populated cities in the world. It is axiomatic that an intractably crowded city has multifarious problems beginning with a lack of decent housing to required utility services, green cover, open spaces, playgrounds for children and parks for people to be in regular touch with Nature. The critical problem of mindless indifference to open space and playground has been highlighted at a view-exchange meeting jointly arranged by the Institute for Planning and Development (IPD) and the Work for a Better Bangladesh (WBB) Trust. With Dhaka's living condition degrading fast and earning the city the infamous laurel of 'worst liveability' among cities, the issue of living environment in this mega city has, of late, come under similar critical reviews from time to time. It emerges from deliberations at the view-exchange meeting that only 16 per cent of Dhaka's residents live within the range of sports facilities or infrastructure and the rest 84 per cent have no access to such amenities. Similar crises bedevil public health in divisional cities and district towns. Happily, more and more people are now concerned about their and their future generations' symbiotic relations with this urban mess. The campaign headed by a woman activist for protecting the Tentultala playground in Kalabagan area from the police acquisition is a case in point. The police started construction of boundary walls of their proposed Kalabagan police station. But in the face of public protest and outrage, they had to abandon their anti-people plan.This and a few other such positive incidents do not, however, assure environmentally conscious people of a rosy future for the city. The disturbing question, if the mega city can sustain or it will have to be abandoned never ceases to haunt them. If the extensive pollution caused by release of factory effluent, refuse such as chemical dyes, residues of burnt-up fuels from vessels and industrial chemicals from large containers into the Buriganga and other rivers around the capital continues unabated, the lifeline of the city will get snapped. Even globally, according to new research by scientists in Germany and the Netherlands, water scarcity caused by pollution of river sources could affect three billion more people than expected midway this century. It is not only the waters of the surrounding rivers that are beyond recognition because of heavy pollution but also the city's air quality that is falling foul to make screaming headlines for the worst level of pollution in the world. Discarded plastic and polythene have been rendering both lands and water bodies increasingly contaminated. So the living condition in this chaotic city is growing insidious from all corners of the city.The World Health Organisation stipulates that each person should have a minimum of 9.0 square metre open space such as playground, parks, gardens etcetera. This means that each 1,000 people must enjoy 2.25 acres of open space and 1.0 acre of playground. Green and open spaces should be at a walking distance. How much such spaces and facilities the city people have to breathe in is anyone's guess. If this is not enough, the manipulation of playgrounds an autocrat recovered from illegal possession to turn into child-friendly facilities in many wards of the city has rendered those unfit for games and sports. Over the past few years, those playgrounds have witnessed construction of concrete segments and walkways in some cases. Elderly people may go for morning or evening walks there but the playgrounds for children are gone. If the all-round pollution of water and air is considered together with such shrinkage of sports facilities in the city, the extent of gross artificiality of habitation in this city becomes blatantly evident and painful. Inactive outdoor children have hardly any option other than living a sedentary life or worse becoming addicted to smart gadgets' virtual world or online video games. In the worst case scenario, the rise of a culture of teen gangsterism and the related crimes including drug abuse is a natural consequence. City people are insanely intoxicated with immediate gains and opportunism to lose sight of the future. But sacrificing a better tomorrow for today's insane opportunism spells doom for people and places. Amid this gloom, it is heartening to know that the environment, forest and climate change ministry has taken up a 100-day programme for protection of environment from pollution. In 40 upazilas of 12 districts in coastal areas, a three-year programme has been taken for eradication of single-use plastic. More important it is to root out the source of harmful polythene and plastic once and for all. However, this is not enough. Poisonous fume-emitting brick kilns and vehicles have to be removed, factories and industries releasing untreated effluent and refuse compelled for installation of effluent treatment plants within a reasonable time frame. Rivers, other water bodies, flood plains, green covers and urban open spaces must be recovered to health or created anew for ecological balance. Such programmes can be successful if these are complemented by decentralisation of administration as well as economic and commercial opportunities.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Most residents of Dhaka city are unaware of the enormous duties and responsibilities that the City Corporation Act of 2009 has vested in two city corporations. There should be no genuine reason to blame them for not knowing those. Possibly, most officials and even the elected heads of the city corporations are not conversant with the same. The Third Schedule of the City Corporation Act of 2009 delineates works to be done by the city corporations across the country. The Schedule has hardly skipped any area/activity related to the comfortable living of residents of different city corporations. It is not just cleaning roads or drains or removing garbage. The City Corporations, according to the Schedule in question, are required to ensure most civic facilities to the urbanites and make their life comfortable and hassle-free.The city corporations of Dhaka or, for that matter, identical entities in other cities have been failing to meet not even a fraction of such facilities, either for want of resources or for lack of genuine efforts. Some jobs the Dhaka city corporations, however, have been doing regularly. These include cleaning of the city roads, removing garbage and lighting the streets after dusk. They also clean surface drains intermittently. Yet they skip many tasks, deliberately or otherwise.The state of affairs with the city pavements is a case in point. Pavements or footpaths are supposed to be used by pedestrians sans any hindrances, but the reality is otherwise. Be it in the south or north of the city corporations, the pavements remain occupied by makeshift shops or hawkers from morning till midnight. Not just pavements, in many busy areas, hawkers keep portions of roads occupied, causing unnecessary suffering to pedestrians and vehicles.There are stories galore about how city pavements have transformed into money spinners for some unscrupulous people. In exchange for the pavements to be used illegally by hawkers, they allegedly earn millions every month across the city. It is the job of the city corporation people to keep pavements safe for uninterrupted movement of pedestrians, but they have failed miserably in their task. The plying of rickshaws is another area that highlights how indifferent the city corporations are to blatant breaches of law on city streets. Dhaka city had nearly 90,000 rickshaws with valid licences in the late seventies. Since then, unlicensed rickshaws started proliferating and their number has risen to around half a million or more. These three-wheelers have become severe headaches for people responsible for the city's traffic management. As if to make things worse, a faster mode of rickshaws, the battery-run ones, is now swamping the roads, lanes and by-lanes. These rickshaws are unsafe for travelling. Allegedly, with the backing from some elements both in and without uniform, the battery-run rickshaws are plying the city streets with impunity. Both city corporations and police are finding it convenient to keep their eyes shut. Among hundreds of problems commuters face in Dhaka, the traffic congestion in front of Mohakhali inter-district bus terminal is one. From dawn till late at night, it is truly difficult to get through that place. Buses are kept parked in two to three rows on both sides of the road in front of the terminal. Even one vehicle finds it almost impossible to wriggle through a maze of buses. One wonders whether the city father concerned has ever used this route. The traffic situation in front of the terminal shows the total apathy of the Dhaka North City Corporation to the commuters' plight. One can cite many more problems that have remained unaddressed by the two city corporations belonging to one of the most densely populated megacities in the world. Hopefully, the men in charge would spare a little time to devise measures for resolving the problems. Some problems have become difficult to resolve because of prolonged indifference. At least there should be efforts to lessen their impact on public life. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Security analysts observe repeated violations of Bangladesh's airspace by Myanmar helicopters, border patrols, mine deployments, and drone activity as provocative actions aimed at drawing Bangladesh into conflict. Conversely, Bangladesh has consistently displayed restraint, managing the situation with patience and adhering to a policy of dialogue-based conflict resolution, in line with our foreign policy principle of 'friendship to all, malice towards none.'Bangladesh must carefully consider its response to this situation, which is both distressing and challenging.
