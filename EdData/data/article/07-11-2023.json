Elections in India have become expensive and most parties, except those from the Left, tend to field candidates not just based on their dint of work or popularity but, increasingly, on their abilities to mobilise resources for campaigns. So, electoral politics has thrown up a set of politicians who are in it to build a career more out of patronage and less out of ideological conviction. This allows for a large degree of malleability in party affiliation for this set, many of whom engage in party-hopping as they have a good sense of the way electoral winds are blowing. Joining them too are incumbents who do so if not given another chance by their parties, and also rebels. The politics of patronage can be frowned upon as being less representative of interests and demands in a constituency and more of a transaction between the candidate and the voter \u2014 the voter gets goods and services from the winning candidate for voting in favour while the legislator uses the post to create an elaborate spoils system, usually to benefit from it as well. This system of patronage can also be seen as an outcome of the larger democratisation of the polity itself, as it throws up representatives catering to specific demands of voters, making the process meaningful for them, bypassing the party structure.The by-product of this system is the presence of careerist politicians who are in it more for transactional purposes than principled or ideological reasons. A reason why the Congress has lost out to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in pre-eminence nationally is because of large-scale defections to the BJP, which has managed to articulate a clear ideological stance of right-wing conservatism through its leadership while providing a platform for those seeking to use the electoral system for patronage. As the Congress tries to rejuvenate itself, the party has sought to distinguish itself from the BJP not just in terms of what it represents in secular terms but also as a vehicle of welfare through electoral guarantees. This has allowed itself to play host to last-minute defectors from the BJP and regional parties in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana, but this also throws up a challenge in retaining these malleable legislators. Alas, defections will remain a feature of Indian politics unless voters punish the defectors for repeated party-hopping and see no longer term interest in choosing a representative with tenuous ideological affiliation.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nMizoram Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nMadhya Pradesh Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nRajasthan Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\nTelangana Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party",

        "full_article": "The \u2018festival of lights\u2019 should not be allowed to degenerate into a festival of noise. Firecrackers are associated with joyous celebrations across the world; but, many are toxic, often too loud, and release noxious fumes when combusted. In 2018, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research launched less noxious and less noisy \u2018green\u2019 crackers, whose use various statutory bodies have mandated. The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 stipulate that firecrackers cannot be burst in \u2018silence zones\u2019, designated by State governments, and anywhere after 10 p.m. From 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. (i.e., \u2018daytime\u2019) and in industrial areas, firecracker noise cannot exceed 75 dB(A) Leq. The thresholds in commercial and residential areas are 65 dB(A) Leq and 55 dB(A) Leq, respectively. dB stands for decibel; A is a weight scale for human perception of loudness; and Leq means the figure is a time-average. The rules allow people to register a complaint if the noise overshoots by 10 dB(A) Leq during daytime.Because dB is a logarithmic unit, an increase of 10 dB implies a tenfold increase in acoustic pressure, which is often beyond the point at which the sound becomes harmful. Research has found links between loud environs and sleep disorders, tinnitus, stress, anxiety, hearing loss, and cardiac health. More than 80 dB(A) in offices has been associated with hypertension whereas above 50 dB(A) at night, when the body is unaccustomed to loud noises, could increase cortisol levels. Traffic noise has burgeoned in cities where haphazard development has forced motorists to overuse horns. Many religious occasions have become synonymous with noisy celebrations irrespective of the hour. During Deepavali, firecrackers (even \u2018green\u2019 ones) routinely produce more than 90 dB of sound. If, say, people burst firecrackers at 90 dB for 10 seconds and the ambient noise is 50 dB for 50 seconds, and this pattern continues for four hours followed by 12 hours of 50 dB noise, the 16-hour Leq is 74.5 dB \u2014 which merits a complaint in residential areas but not in commercial ones, yet the noise is already harmful. Different loudness zones are also seldom publicly demarcated while some places are both residential and commercial. The rules are unclear about the sanctions to be meted out to offenders. Enforcement remains obscure. So, focusing on marginal improvements to firecrackers before every festival is becoming a red herring. India\u2019s noise is a public health crisis. If firecrackers are not to worsen matters, governments must prevent the production of violative firecrackers altogether and cities must improve public access to noise data and adopt noise mitigation targets.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDeepavali\n\n/\n\nnoise pollution\n\n/\n\nscientific institutions\n\n/\n\nhealth\n\n/\n\ntraffic\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "Many stressful decisions characterise middle-aged life, but none more than buying furniture and painting walls. In simpler times, in the days of my parents, this was not much of a deal. You kept porcelain crockery, the precious-looking kind that you never used, in glass cases in the living room. Storage receptacles like the almirah, usually from Godrej or Raj & Raj, which housed everything from clothes to family jewellery, were chosen purely based on the thickness of the steel. This, of course, made sense since its purpose was to prove protection against, according to urban legend, the \u201cacid\u201d that all dacoits carried.\nNot that displaying the family crockery in the living room was similarly logical. Still, my generation knew better than to ask elders questions. However, the conventions of interior design were well established: a money plant next to the couch, a vase on the coffee table, a framed picture of the Mona Lisa on the wall next to Rabindranath Tagore, and of all the things people were judged on, their choice of furniture and design was not one of them.\nFast-forward to today. The pernicious YouTube and television have implanted in our collective minds an aesthetic, driven by influencers in the pay of furniture and paint companies, of what well-designed living spaces should be. So, no, you cannot paint all walls with the same paint shade; that would be too economical. You need accent walls, one wall painted in a totally different way, so yes, buy a totally useless can of paint or five.\n\nNeither can you get all the furniture colour-coordinated and purchased from the same store for a bulk discount; that would be \u201cmatchy-matchy\u201d, which apparently is a major faux pas, deserving of ridicule. Things need to be mismatched to give an organic lived-in-feel, but no, not like that; too many colours all around is so \u201cha-ha, what were they thinking!\u201d There should be multiple textures, and some colours are deemed relaxing and some not, and if you are wondering what the science behind it is, there is none; it is what the brown suits in boardrooms want to have incepted in the hive mind till what they want you to think is what you think you think.\nSomewhere through the depths of time, the mass-printed Mona Lisa on a generically blue-painted wall smiles benignly at the folly of this age.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The regional think-tank summit held in the capital on Saturday has raised the old question of closer cooperation among South Asian nations for collectively realising their untapped potential. It would be worthwhile to remember that the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) have long become non-functional. If the first formed after the European Union (EU) model to serve as a regional socio-economic and cultural forum and the second after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to mainly serve commercial and economic interests, they soon became spent forces sooner than later. Now the on-going economic slowdown all across the globe brings the issue of forging meaningful and mutually beneficial cooperation among them to the fore. Not only can the nations of SA thus withstand the stormy weather but also initiate what can be termed the 'Age of South Asia'.However, the political history of South Asia with India and Pakistan remaining at loggerheads with each other is not specially propitious for developing highly effective multilateral trade and economic cooperation and collaboration. Obviously, bilateral agreements on trade and investment have predominated mutual relations. With India and Bangladesh speeding up their economic and development agenda in the past couple of decades in particular, global powers also started paying more attention to the South Asian region. Had it been without hidden agenda linked to geopolitical rivalry between those powers, things would be easier for both South Asian nations to advance their causes. Geopolitics has of late turned aggressive and at times nasty to the point where small and neutral countries cannot often pursue their independent economic and trade policies. In this age of information, the divisive global politics also stands in the way of forging closer regional cooperation -- only more so when the developing and least developed countries are dependent on the big players for financial aid, military hardware and other supports. Pursuing an independent foreign policy may be difficult but yet if a nation reforms its agricultural, industrial and to a large extent monetary policies, economy takes off on a higher trajectory. In South Asia, not all countries could grab the opportunities of groundbreaking technologies by reforming their systems and therefore their development has remained at uneven stages. Even within the country, economic disparities have remained yawning. Therefore, the challenges before the South Asian countries are both external and internal. If the countries could deal with corruption leading to erosion of resources through money laundering with an iron hand, they would be better placed to explore avenues for mutual cooperation. However, the soured relations arising out of mistrust and a lack of understanding of the value of standing together in the face of crises like the pandemic, the economic recession following the Ukraine war and fallouts of strifes such as in Gaza have not helped the cause of a united approach to regional development and prosperity. With a 4.4 million sq kilometre area, one-tenth of the Asian continent and a population of 1.9 billion, one-fourth of the global population, South Asia is a formidable stock of natural and human resources. Even in conventional areas the potential for cooperation is immense. Non-conventional areas like blue economy opens up a vista vast enough for the members of the region to exploit in the days to come. The question is, if they are ready to do so unitedly.",

        "full_article": "Uncertainty is a fact of life today everywhere. It's not a local matter limited to one or two sectors but a global scenario that engulfs the world in its glum grip. The largest footprint of that can be seen in the investment reticence in general. They are cautious and few would be expected to enter in the non-profit sectors now. Which is why, it's a bit odd that media houses are continuing to emerge even though the economic skies are not full of robust profit bearing clouds. MEDIA INVESTMENT PATTERNS In the post 1971 period, media went through from a beleaguered situation in the 70s but in the 80s as private capital began to grow so did media outlets.As Bangladesh crossed its first decade, the growth accelerated and media became a good vehicle for gaining social capital, often needed to bolster financial ones. This fact is critical to understand the media structure because investors are not in it for economic profit. In some cases, media outlets do make money but that's an extra bonus as ownership of media serves as a tool for gains that can't be made in the economic market but helps strengthen their clout elsewhere. That doesn't mean that the media is a charitable venture. Far from it. It assists the investors in accumulation of social capital which provides a great deal of prestige as owners, publishers and Editors. This provides them with a significance that in turn helps economic growth indirectly. It's against this background that the continuance of newly emerging media outlets amidst economic stressed times needs to be examined. OF MEDIA AND POWER STRUCTURE After the 90s, various ruling class segments began to consolidate themselves as institutions matured. Generally speaking, the ruling class in Bangladesh is made up for segments. Two are state power holders- civilian politicians and members of the armed forces when they take over politically. Plus there are two critical associate segments that play facilitating roles. These two are the bureaucracy and the business community. These four segments together make up the socio-economic glue that keeps politics together. Co-operation and co-ordination among these four forces is essential if the state structure is to be maintained. Within this power structure the media plays a role of negative and positive trigger providing. Professional media now increasingly shares the information space with social media but has over time become a critical player and ingredient in the power games that all politics has.It's in this context or at least in part, that the answer to the puzzle of growing media in the era of uncertainty has to be sought. GROWTH AMIDST STRESS?Fact is, while new outlets are arriving, many of the older ones are under considerable economic stress. This is only to be expected as the world is experiencing political shocks including war that has had negative economic impact. Hence, the general economic landscape in Bangladesh like everywhere else is somber. This has affected the media's revenue generating mechanisms including consumer products advertisement. Several media houses have had to scale down their operations and lay- offs have been noted. This is happening in other sectors as well, which is why the rise of new media outlets may seem like a puzzle.IS THE OWNING CLASS CONFIDENT? Three possible speculative answers can be made why media houses are rising despite the globally weakened economy. Insiders are of the opinion that the owning class in Bangladesh is far stronger than thought of. While the middle has been badly hit by the price rise and other difficulties, the owning class remains less vulnerable. The media outfits and their role remain the same in the current model of gathering social capital for economic gain. Thus the demand for the media's role remains. Hence they see media investment as a longer term matter which is inevitably going to provide yields sooner or later. Another aspect is that a media outlet's product identity is also useful for branding even in difficult times. This gains greater value as the need for marketing social-political products grows.. Since most economic decision-making does involve a chain process, to be outside the chain or loop is to take economic risks that are not worth it. And the media offers membership in the loop. So immediately or in the next year or so, branding of governance products can be very useful. By providing worthy media products, it can significantly contribute to the security of the owning class in a pre and post transition world. Finally, although the business community is fairly close knit and have common causes, they also have internal conflicts which have grown over the years as the sector has become very profitable. Several media-based conflicts between major business houses were noted and media management of news concerning this class is needed now. So having a tool to act as a manager of hostile content is an important demand of major business players. CONTINUITY OF MEDIA POWER? It's obvious that if investment is coming in, the need for an indirectly profitable sector like the media exists. It also means that the capital investors have a measure of confidence in the economy in the longer run. However, the media is not just about the owners but the professionals and workers who also need some protection in such times. So guarantees of both performance and protection of services should be added to the regulatory framework governing the Bangladesh media world where optimism at the top exists despite all odds.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Dengue is still here and taking a heavy toll on public health every day. Though this vector-borne disease should be around in the monsoon months, it seems, Bangladesh has proved to be a happy breeding ground for its carrier, the mosquito called Aedesaegypti. For it is still infecting and killing people and as of November 5, the number of people who died of the disease was over 1400. According to the data available from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), so far over 279,900 people have been infected by the disease and that number, too, is increasing by the day. If compared with previous records of dengue infection in the country since 2000, this year's infection figure is the highest ever. Similarly, the hospitalisation rate is also very high with over 277,800 patients hospitalised to date. And the number is increasing daily. These figures simply point to the enormity of the public health threat facing the nation due to dengue and the mosquito that spread the disease.Considering the virulence of the dengue in Bangladesh, some entomologists of the country have begun to believe that it is no longer a seasonal disease as it was once thought to be. Also, climate change is being considered as a reason for Aedes mosquito's becoming adaptable to all the seasons of the year. In that case, will the dengue-carrying mosquito require new techniques to kill it? For it has recently been observed that the city corporation authorities were experimenting with many novel ideas to eliminate the mosquito but with little success. And now, it appears, they have resigned themselves to living with dengue and its cause.But whatever the reason behind the dengue-vector's becoming invincible, climatic or otherwise, the breeding of the mosquito still takes place in stagnant, clean water even if it is in very small amounts accumulated in flower tubs, discarded plastic cans, potholes etc. That means this part of the dengue vector's habit or behaviour has remained unchanged. So, it is still beatable with ordinary means. And the best way to destroy the larvae of this mosquito, as everyone knows, is to spray larvicide on the breeding places of the mosquito. So, the question is if the authorities in charge of eradicating the mosquito causing dengue could develop an effective strategy to fight the menace in a systematic manner. The question arises because one would often come across city corporation workers spraying insecticides using fogging machines to kill the mosquito or its larvae, but, mysteriously, it does not seem to work. Otherwise, how could the mosquito become so stubborn and powerful to survive all the attempts made by the local government bodies to exterminate it? True, the residents of the city or other areas of the country where dengue is endemic have a role in keeping their surroundings, especially the potential breeding places free of the disease's vector. But that cannot be any excuse for laying the blame for any failure of combating dengue at the citizens' door. For the citizens pay the government tax and, in return, expect that the latter through its various organs would look after their wellbeing. However, pointing the finger at any government organ or the public is not the solution to the matter in hand. What is needed is getting out of the habit of adopting stopgap measures to deal with the public health threat posed by dengue and its vector. The matter (of combating dengue) should be a top priority for the government, like it was during the Covid time in 2020 and 2021 and action should be taken accordingly.[email\u00a0protected]",

Bangladesh is a developing country. We all should remember that any conflict between political parties and violence cannot bring any good to anyone. It can only cause more public suffering. We should not waste our country's resources through creating any anarchic situation. It is high time for the political parties to think about public sufferings caused by their political programmes. The purpose of politics should be the welfare of the people. Political parties should do politics for the people.
