In what was later described as a case of mistaken identity, six workers returning home in a vehicle from a coal mine bordering Assam were gunned down by the security forces at Oting village in Mon district. Seven more villagers were shot dead later, following a scuffle with villagers who had found the bodies in an Army vehicle. Prior sanction to prosecute Army personnel is necessary under Section 6 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). A Special Investigation Team of the Nagaland Police completed its probe in March 2022, and filed a charge sheet in the case. It had sought sanction for prosecution from the Defence Ministry\u2019s Department of Military Affairs. The police had claimed they had established the involvement of 30 personnel, who allegedly violated standard operating procedures and rules of engagement, and resorted to indiscriminate and disproportionate firing on the vehicle. Meanwhile, the Army also ordered a court of inquiry, but its outcome is not known. On petitions by the wives of the Army personnel involved, the Supreme Court of India stayed the criminal proceedings in July 2022.The Centre has been quite keen on reducing the areas covered by the law giving special powers in disturbed areas to the armed forces. In recognition of the significant improvement in the security situation in the northeastern region, it has reduced the notified areas in Nagaland, Assam and Manipur in recent years. On the political side, it has been working towards peace accords and getting insurgents and extremists to lay down arms. However, it is quite incongruent with its overall policy of creating an atmosphere conducive for peace and development, and making partners out of those laying down weapons, for the government to disallow the prosecution of those suspected to be involved in an admittedly mistaken counter-insurgency operation. It would have redounded to the government\u2019s credit had it allowed the criminal courts to decide on the extent of culpability of the Army men. Prosecution of armed forces personnel involved in excesses is quite rare, leading to the widespread impression that AFSPA is used to promote impunity. The government must demonstrate its commitment to peace in the region and justice for the victims by either granting sanction for their prosecution, or taking exemplary action based on the findings of the military court of inquiry.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nNagaland\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\ninvestigation\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nnational security\n\n/\n\nAssam\n\n/\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\narmed Forces",

When he was toppled in April 2019 in a mass uprising, many hoped that the resource-rich country in the Horn of Africa would finally get a chance to move towards a freer society with a representative and responsive administration. But the tragedy of Sudan is that the monstrous regime that Mr. Bashir built outlasted his reign. Within two years of his fall, the military was back, and now, a power struggle between the top two generals has pushed Sudan to the brink of a civil war. Dozens of civilians have already been killed in fighting that broke out on Saturday in Khartoum and other parts of the country between the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a notorious paramilitary group. Despite international calls for truce, Lt.Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the military chief as well as the head of the Sovereignty Council, the transitional administration, and his deputy, Lt.Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who commands the RSF, have refused to negotiate, blaming each other for the attacks. Mr. Dagalo, who has close ties with Russia\u2019s Wagner private military company and Saudi Arabia, claims that the RSF has taken control of the presidential palace and has vowed to bring Gen. Burhan to justice, while the military has dismissed such claims and launched air strikes against RSF sites.Just two years ago, the two generals stood hand in hand when they ousted a civilian transition government and took over the reins of the country. Faced with international isolation and domestic pressure, they agreed to transfer power back to the civilians. But differences emerged on who should control the post-transition military. Gen. Burhan supports the integration of the RSF into the regular military and transition to civilian government to take place in two years, while Gen. Dagalo, who fears that he would lose his clout, wants to delay it by 10 years. Discord grew into mistrust and mistrust led to fighting. And the fighting could drag the country, which has a history of internal strife, into an all-out civil war. Sudan\u2019s generals are known for their scant regard for the welfare of their people. The country is struggling with an economic crisis, with rocketing inflation and a burning hunger problem. The last thing Sudan wants now is a civil war. If the priority of the generals is to address Sudan\u2019s basic problems, they should pay attention to the call for a truce and dialogue, and commit themselves to a timeline-sensitive democratic transition. Decades of military rule in Sudan have resulted in a lot of atrocities. Generals Burhan and Dagalo should not tread the same course.\nCOMMents\n SHARE \n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nSudan\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war",

        "full_article": "The killings of Atiq and Ashraf Ahmed, accused in over 100 cases, has left UP police\u2019s reputation, never great to begin with, in shreds. Forget celebratory social media frenzy. The killings are a massive failure and there should be accountability fixed in the upper echelons of UP police. Atiq\u2019s long career as a politician who flitted through different political parties speaks to the nexus between criminals and politicians in the state. This, therefore, leads to the suspicion that his killing may be a bit convenient. Since the killing in February of Umesh Pal, along with two policemen, there have been other killings linked to it. This makes the casualness of the police on Saturday night in Prayagraj inexcusable. A three-member judicial commission is reportedly being set up to probe this killing. It\u2019s in the interest of the state that there\u2019s a credible investigation into this laxity. And investigations can\u2019t only be confined to the Saturday night killing.\nOn April 13, Ahmed\u2019s son Asad and another person were killed by UP police in an encounter. This incident too was linked to the Umesh Pal murder. The Supreme Court has taken a dim view of extrajudicial encounters. In line with the relevant judgment (PUCL vs State of Maharashtra), there needs to be a separate investigation into this encounter according to SC\u2019s guidelines. The UP government should ensure it\u2019s carried out.\nIndia has a dark history when it comes to police and extrajudicial encounters. It\u2019s a symptom of a dysfunctional criminal justice system and also diverts attention from an underlying nexus between instruments of the state and the underworld. All these ingredients are present in the spate of killings that preceded Saturday night\u2019s incident.\nAs the accompanying commentary points out, enforcing law and order in UP has been the trump card of the Yogi government. It played a big role in BJP\u2019s second successive assembly win in the state. Indeed, law and order is a prerequisite to attract investment into the state. However, the manner in which it\u2019s brought about matters. If there\u2019s a perception that arbitrariness and abuse of power by the state are the mechanisms favoured, it\u2019s unlikely that UP will realise its potential investment. Therefore, a credible investigation into the killings is essential. It\u2019s in the best interest of the state.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The strike by delivery executives of quick commerce platform Blinkit in the national capital region is another grim reminder of the wider economy\u2019s job problem. The protest is over Blinkit\u2019s revised rates and benefits that drastically reduce minimum earnings on orders. This isn\u2019t the first such incident in recent times. Last year, food delivery platform Swiggy faced similar protests by its delivery executives across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai after it introduced a revised pay structure.\nPartly, this is related to the way tech-driven commerce platforms operate. Most of them aren\u2019t profitable and depend on investor capital. When investors demand profits or cash runs thin, these companies cut pay and benefits for their delivery executives. But any business should have the freedom to revise its business operations. The real problem here is the lack of steady non-farm jobs. That\u2019s what makes even insecure gig economy jobs so attractive. This is borne out by Periodic Labour Force Survey 2021-22 which finds that for the country\u2019s workforce most additional jobs being created are in the selfemployed category. The message is clear: not enough salaried jobs.\nThus, delivery executives are caught between a rock and a hard place. For many young people in the workforce, the choice is between accepting low-paying gig work with poor working conditions or returning to their villages for unproductive farm work. While quick commerce platforms should provide better working conditions, the onus of solving this problem can\u2019t be on them. They will naturally follow market forces and profitability. The economy needs to create many more regular jobs for the burgeoning workforce, especially in the manufacturing and services sectors. Government claims enough jobs are being created won\u2019t prevent future labour protests.\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "by Arnab Ray\nDon\u2019t ask me how I know this, but recently, on the Bangladeshi food vlogging scene, there was a great controversy wherein one food vlogger accused another, in all seriousness, of ungentle personal behaviour. As per the accusation, the one accused stood in front of the victim in a buffet line and then did the unthinkable: took the meat off the last leg-roast piece, leaving the hapless vlogger with the bone. The accused vlogger, also in all seriousness, countered the original accusation with video evidence of what she had done. While I will not pass judgment on which side of this schism the scales of justice should lean or on whose plate the juicy meat should drop, I could not help but remember my experiences of witnessing terrible buffet behaviour.\nEveryone, even the professed socialist, is a predatory capitalist when they get to the buffet line: everyman for the largest piece of meat or most shrimp, and the devil takes the hindmost, or in this case, the hindmost is resigned to scraping the ladle on the bottom of the bowl. Now, if you are behind, you can try different strategies, including the classic of slipping through the gap between the torso and arm of the person in front of you or coughing or smiling passive-aggressively: \u201chow long are you going to take?\u201d Still, the ground they shall not cede; instead, they look at you and give an apologetic shrug, acknowledging but not apologising for their privilege.\nThen others are more insidious. They pretend to be considerate by not pouring the remaining contents of the bowl onto their plate. Instead, like the best CEOs, they merely take the best \u2013 the meat off bones, the \u2018amsotto\u2019 (mango fruit leather) cubes floating in the chatni, and leave the buffet line signalling their appetite as well as their virtue.\nBut even this, I can tolerate. What I cannot are those who stand in front of a buffet item and dawdle and loiter as if contemplating whether to press the nuclear button. You will take it all. At least do it quickly, man. Then there are the worst of the worst, those who go against the direction of the buffet line or casually pop into the middle, hoping no one notices. Kaun hai yeh log? Kahaan se aate hai? And as I ask this, I see myself in the mirror and get the answer.\n\n",

        "full_article": "by Pranav Khullar\nAs one stands entranced by the image of the boy-Krishn lifting the Govardhan hill in Nathdwara, a beautiful Picchwai cloth painting adorning the wall behind, the abstract Upanishadic Self seems to manifest itself through a doctrine of divine grace.\nThe Shuddh-Advaita, Pure NonDualism, of Vallabhacharya posits the path of Pushti-marga, Divine Grace, on the premise that Brahmn is also personal in nature, being Purna, perfect, and Purshottama, best of Beings.\nVallabha saw this Brahmn as assuming the form of the world itself, possessing almost all the qualities of Para-Brahmn itself. The manifest world is not unreal, as Shankara\u2019s Mayavada contends. The external world is real, because it is the adhibhautika, material form of Brahmn, for the world has emanatedfrom the Self itself, for the sake of divine lila, divine sport. Vallabha interprets the Upanishadic Self from a radically different standpoint than Shankara\u2019s Advaita.\nVallabha bases his concept of Shuddh-Advaita on the notion of a personal God in the Brihadaryank Upanishad. The Upanishad explicitly states that Brahmn desired to be many, and the Self manifested itself as a multitude of souls. Brahmn may be beyond the a bstraction of thought itself but can be \u2018known\u2019 when the Self manifests itself through the world. And Maya, for Vallabhacharya, is the instrument by which Brahmn reveals the world from itself, and not the illusion which Shankara defined it, as an erroneous apprehension of seeing the world as real. Maya becomes apositive principle for Vallabha. His doctrine of Pushti-marga, too, echoes the theistic strain found in the Mundaka Upanishad \u2013 that the knowledge of the Self is possible only through Divine Grace.\nVallabha then roots this immanence and transcendence of Brahmn in the figure of Krishn, developing his concept of Bhakti accordingly, by giving it the character of a rasa, a sentiment of love. God has assumed human form for the lila, to bestow His grace on the devotees. He cannot bestow that grace as the Abstract Self.\nLiberation is to be sought in the interplay of emotions between the devotee and Krishn, in all the hues and colours of the Nav-Rasa, nine primary emotions. The Mukhar-Vinda Bhakti is the highest form of devotion, which is meditating on the physical form of Krishn, as the gopis of Vrindavan are alluded to have practised unconsciously, in the Bhagavat Purana. Vallabhacharya further postulates that this liberation is to be had in the figure of Krishn as Shrinathji, the boy Krishn lifting Mount Govardhan with his little finger, just as Chaitanya found this liberation in the figure of Krishn through the eyes of Radha.\nTradition has it that Vallabha had the inner darshan of Krishn in the form of Shrinathji, and was given the BrahmaSambhandha mantra, followed to this day for initiation into the Pushti-marga. This consecration of the self to Krishn, Vallabha states, will awaken the soul to its real nature as part of God\u2019s consciousness. And while the Vallabha tradition lays down regular seva, divine service to God, as part of the process, complete surrender to Krishn seeking his grace, lies at the heart of Vallabha\u2019s Shuddh-Advaita, in the realisation that the manifest world is only a lila of Brahmn.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A report published by this daily on Sunday shows, once again, just how widespread plastic pollution has become. At the Kulaura municipality in Moulvibazar, even a bit of rain is enough to flood the roads and cause waterlogging. This is because of the indiscriminate disposal of waste \u2013 including polythene, plastic packets, bottles, and cork sheets \u2013 into the town's drains. We have seen this scenario play out countless times across the country, with the disposed waste causing drainage systems to clog up, leaving little room for the excess water brought in by rain. Sometimes, the drains are cleaned up, but excavated wastes often end up back in because of the lack of proper waste management.\nGiven the state that it has reached, plastic pollution in the country demands urgent attention. In the absence of a proper disposal system, people often leave their waste anywhere they find vacant. Most, however, fail to realise how it contributes to clogging the drains, and how waste, in turn, lands in connecting rivers and other water bodies. This is not just harmful for the environment; when plastic enters the human body (in the form of microplastics), it can have all sorts of health consequences.\nUnfortunately, the problem seems to getting worse day by day. According to a World Bank estimate, between 2005 and 2020, Bangladesh's annual per capita plastic consumption in urban areas tripled. Moreover, experts have found that of all the plastic wastes produced in the country in 2019, only 36 percent was recycled. The rest has been left to cause a havoc on the environment and every living thing in it. One cannot help but wonder whether Bangladesh has at all achieved anything from its \"historic\" ban on polythene and plastic bags in 2002. To this day, it remains an example of worthless legislation minus enforcement.\nHow pervasive plastic pollution has become can be understood from a joint study that revealed that at least 17 species of fish and three species of shellfish from rivers flowing through the Sundarbans were contaminated with microplastics. Plastic is definitely causing severe harm to the environment and the marine life. As such, the environment, forest and climate change ministry's March 27 announcement of banning single-use plastic across 6,500 square kilometres of the Sundarbans is a welcome one. But enforcement can again be an issue, so the authorities must ensure that such restrictions are placed everywhere and enforced without fail.\nWhile the role of industries in accelerating the pollution of our environment is undeniable, it is also crucial that individual citizens are made aware of the danger of irresponsible waste disposal. We urge the authorities to conduct mass awareness programmes in this regard and ensure that there are adequate waste disposal points available in all city neighbourhoods. Without drastic changes in how we, individually and institutionally, treat plastic waste now, things will get worse in the coming days.\n",

        "full_article": "The ability to harness the power of data exchange among healthcare providers can change the face of public health in Bangladesh. But it is easier said than done. Professionals in our healthcare systems often say that we have achieved an ideal level of health data connectivity. That is an erroneous assumption. The ability to share data laboriously among a few platforms falls short of true data interoperability.\nIn an ideal state of health information exchange, Bangladesh should have three levels of data connectivity: district or local, division or regional, and state or national. Beyond that, we should have a single network, like the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (Tefca) in the US, for a uniform platform to support business, technical, and regulatory aspects of transporting data across the country in a more meaningful and cohesive manner.\nThe local health data connectivity networks will link care providers so that when patients transition between care facilities, the care teams can extract their clinical records from connected facilities across the district. These facilities typically cannot afford the heavy infrastructure and hefty costs to join national platforms. Technology vendors can facilitate basic data-sharing services at low costs for such entities, providing them with a lifeline for local data-sharing. Regional health information exchange organisations will integrate local platforms in the division under one umbrella, and provide a gateway to national networks.\n\nOnce the three-tiered goals are accomplished, healthcare communities must work to build one umbrella that will link all data-sharing mechanisms at local, regional, and national levels. The system will provide governance and policies to create further coherence and coordination in sharing data nationally. Consider US' Tefca, designed to offer a \"universal floor\" to share data via the most robust national networks. These platforms must pass rigorous data safety, security, and interoperability measures. The initiative breaks down silos.\nIntegration with regional health data-sharing organisations is greatly useful when patients seek care at a facility outside their usual settings \u2013 the district. Regional networks will have richer data than local platforms, owing to all the patient data from connected hospitals across districts under their aegis.\nThe national health information networks will be on top of the tier delivering the most comprehensive data repository on patients, as they will provide linkages to all local and regional health information platforms, and other national networks. These networks offer a seamless and connected experience of care and the best practice for data dissemination. More importantly, national platforms offer flexibility in meeting diverse business, technical, and regulatory needs around health data transmission.\n\nHealth systems should be at the front and centre of data connectivity because they must provide the best patient outcomes, and without data, they can offer only substandard care. \nOnce the three-tiered goals are accomplished, healthcare communities must work to build one umbrella that will link all data-sharing mechanisms at local, regional, and national levels. The system will provide governance and policies to create further coherence and coordination in sharing data nationally. Consider US' Tefca, designed to offer a \"universal floor\" to share data via the most robust national networks. These platforms must pass rigorous data safety, security, and interoperability measures. The initiative breaks down silos.\nTo build the federated data infrastructure mapped out above, interprofessional and intersectoral consensus building and shared decision-making are critical. Three actors must be involved in this process: the government, the technology companies, and the health systems.\nThe government has the ultimate authority and duty to do the heavy lifting to uplift health care. They must also regulate and support small providers to integrate with health information exchange initiatives. Health data transaction relies on internet connectivity. Unfortunately, many areas, especially rural communities, are unable to afford the costs. Moreover, not all physicians' offices have office space or trained employees to use technology. The government must incentivise these geographically and economically disadvantaged providers by funding high-speed internet and providing necessary resources.\nCommunication technology companies must step in to improve health care for the greater good, alongside promoting their business. Once healthcare systems see the benefits of technology, they will heavily invest in it, creating more opportunities for the companies. Increased utilisation of health information exchange can set the stage for a massive diffusion of technology. Ideally, the companies will create enough revenue to be able to even offer free connectivity services for small practices, whether or not the government can fund them.\nHealth systems should be at the front and centre of data connectivity because they must provide the best patient outcomes, and without data, they can offer only substandard care. Data sharing among care providers not only helps support the best patient experience but also saves lives. With high patient satisfaction, health systems create more revenue opportunities for themselves as well.\nIn an ideal state, national data exchange can do miracles to find missing persons and support uninterrupted healthcare during disasters, when patients are displaced. During emergencies, patients often have to leave behind their medication and prescriptions, and their routine care providers are simply unable to operate. In those times, patients seek care outside their normal settings. At a connected facility or emergency shelter, the technology will enable clinicians to investigate patients' medical records, without starting over with examination and treatment. It will also create alerts letting care providers know where their patients have been treated, and help connect them to their loved ones.\nWe are clearly far from the ideal future state. Claiming that the country has achieved true data interoperability is misleading at best.\nABM Uddin\u00a0is a healthcare consultant for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.

        "full_article": "With the Copenhagen Climate Ministerial and the release of the IPCC Synthesis Report (AR6), the stage is set for negotiations at COP28. The first major climate summit of the year, hosted by Denmark and the Egyptian COP27 and UAE COP28 presidencies in March, has set the ball rolling for discussions on key issues linked to finance, loss and damage and mitigation and the interplay with the Global Stocktake (GST) that will culminate at COP28 in Dubai.\nThe period between now and then and how this time is used to steer the process will determine the outcome in December. The key messages from the AR6 and how they are leveraged at ministerials and reflected in the GST outcome will play a vital role in identifying the lack of adequate progress made towards delivering the Paris Agreement.\nThe AR6 provides clear indication for the need to respond with accelerated action. This is the time for defining diplomatic pathways ahead to ensure that COP28 is ready to course correct. The next three years are most likely the last chance for giving meaningful shape to policy for defining emissions and resilience pathways this decade. The COP28 presidency can set out an actionable plan that puts the world on an emergency footing to meet the Paris Agreement goals. It is important that progress is made on negotiating tracks for multilateral action on climate change. These include making the Loss & Damage fund a reality, agreeing on a new Global Goal on Adaptation as a framework for strengthening resilience, driving mitigation ambition and implementation, and scaling up climate finance pre-2025 as well as furthering the process of agreeing to a new post 2025 climate finance goal among others.\nAs indicated in the report, the fossil fuel phase-out must be the centre piece of any science-based strategy to avoid overshooting 1.5 degrees Celsius. This will require that Nationally Determined Contributions this year align with 1.5\u00b0C pathways, and set 2035 targets by COP30 in response to the GST.\nThe COP28 presidency can set out an actionable plan.\nMoving from Sharm El Sheikh to the UAE and beyond will require a quantum leap in political will to address multiple issues. High benchmarks must be set for the oil and gas sector to play a credible role in flipping investment ratios in favour of renewables over fossils, ending investments in new production, and setting net zero transition plans including Scope 3 emissions.\nAccountability has remained a clog in the wheel, and left unaddressed will continue to derail the Paris targets. Governments, in response to the GST, can set new measures for government, non-state actors and cooperative initiatives to report progress to the UNFCCC, providing updates by June to fulfil transparency obligations. This is also a good time for G7 countries to share a roadmap on how they plan to fulfil their commitment to double adaptation finance by 2025 and increase it ten-fold by 2030 as part of the GST course-correct response. The modalities for the launch of a fully facilitated Santiago Network on Loss and Damage with the selection of a host secretariat, advisory board and committed funding must be adopted to ensure finance flows from the fund and the 'wider mosaic of solutions' at COP28.\nGoing into the COP, the presidency must caution against engineered carbon dioxide removal such as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage as substitutes for deep emission cuts and risk of delaying phase-out of fossil fuels as reliance on these technologies carries major risks of overshoot in emissions.\nAs host and president of the upcoming COP, UAE needs to provide more clarity on how they are viewing the final GST outcome, including their vision on a GST declaration, a GST decision, a COP28 cover decision and technical annexes to help set unambiguous expectations.\nThe Petersburg Dialogue in July can be used to test core elements of GST outcomes and build champion groups ready to share aligned high ambition expectations at the subsidiary bodies. The UN summit can raise the bar on ambition by widening a leader-level champion group to inject momentum into ministerial dialogue from pre-COP to COP28.\nAnd finally, the new World Bank leadership can put evolution on fast track by driving the Common Assessment Framework implementation and a leaders' agenda to advance elements of the Bridgetown initiative and beyond, while setting up a major Bretton Woods plus 80 moment in 2024 as a landing point for finance system reforms.\nThe soft limits to some human adaptation and hard limits to ecosystems have been reached.

        "full_article": "A report published by this daily on Sunday shows, once again, just how widespread plastic pollution has become. At the Kulaura municipality in Moulvibazar, even a bit of rain is enough to flood the roads and cause waterlogging. This is because of the indiscriminate disposal of waste \u2013 including polythene, plastic packets, bottles, and cork sheets \u2013 into the town's drains. We have seen this scenario play out countless times across the country, with the disposed waste causing drainage systems to clog up, leaving little room for the excess water brought in by rain. Sometimes, the drains are cleaned up, but excavated wastes often end up back in because of the lack of proper waste management.\nGiven the state that it has reached, plastic pollution in the country demands urgent attention. In the absence of a proper disposal system, people often leave their waste anywhere they find vacant. Most, however, fail to realise how it contributes to clogging the drains, and how waste, in turn, lands in connecting rivers and other water bodies. This is not just harmful for the environment; when plastic enters the human body (in the form of microplastics), it can have all sorts of health consequences.\nUnfortunately, the problem seems to getting worse day by day. According to a World Bank estimate, between 2005 and 2020, Bangladesh's annual per capita plastic consumption in urban areas tripled. Moreover, experts have found that of all the plastic wastes produced in the country in 2019, only 36 percent was recycled. The rest has been left to cause a havoc on the environment and every living thing in it. One cannot help but wonder whether Bangladesh has at all achieved anything from its \"historic\" ban on polythene and plastic bags in 2002. To this day, it remains an example of worthless legislation minus enforcement.\nHow pervasive plastic pollution has become can be understood from a joint study that revealed that at least 17 species of fish and three species of shellfish from rivers flowing through the Sundarbans were contaminated with microplastics. Plastic is definitely causing severe harm to the environment and the marine life. As such, the environment, forest and climate change ministry's March 27 announcement of banning single-use plastic across 6,500 square kilometres of the Sundarbans is a welcome one. But enforcement can again be an issue, so the authorities must ensure that such restrictions are placed everywhere and enforced without fail.\nWhile the role of industries in accelerating the pollution of our environment is undeniable, it is also crucial that individual citizens are made aware of the danger of irresponsible waste disposal. We urge the authorities to conduct mass awareness programmes in this regard and ensure that there are adequate waste disposal points available in all city neighbourhoods. Without drastic changes in how we, individually and institutionally, treat plastic waste now, things will get worse in the coming days.\n",

        "full_article": "Bad news: the severe heatwave that has been sweeping through the country for about a week may continue for a few more days. On Sunday, Dhaka experienced its hottest day in the last 58 years, with a temperature of 40.5 degrees Celsius. Things are even worse off in some places outside the capital, with Chuadanga recording 42.2 degrees Celsius on Saturday \u2013 the highest in this season. In such a situation, the risks of heat strokes are quite high, with people experiencing cold-related illnesses.\nDoctors say that a heat stroke, if untreated, can have immediate and long-term health consequences. One may recall that last July, during a lengthy heat spell in the northern region, at least 70 people died of heat-related illnesses in just three days. No doubt, the ongoing record-breaking heatwave and the relentless air pollution in urban centres make a terrifying combination for the ordinary people, with the poor and disadvantaged suffering disproportionately.\nThe problem is, the causes behind the ongoing heatwave are so multifaceted that there is no single entity that we can point our finger to or seek redressal from. There are no easy solutions either. While experts recommend that children and elderly people should remain indoors during the day, this is not an option for many, particularly day labourers and informal-sector workers who cannot afford to not work. Given the insanely high prices of most essentials, people are forced to bear the impossible heat during work, commute, and even rest.\nThere is no denying that human-induced climate change is largely to blame for the heatwave. It is a fact that our cities, particularly Dhaka, are ill-planned. Structures are being erected on any piece of land that is empty, without a care about how it will affect the surrounding environment. Tall buildings clustered around each other not only block wind flow and trap heat; the heavy use of air conditioners also contributes to higher temperatures.\nIn the countryside, rivers are drying up, leaving behind sandy patches which emanate unbearable heat, making living and livelihood difficult for local communities. Given the increasing lack of wetlands across the country thanks to pollution and encroachment, people feel hotter than they otherwise would. And with more greenery being destroyed than is planted, it is no wonder that we are facing this intense heatwave. Lack of humidity is only making it worse.\nGiven the reality, only long-term planning and thoughtful policies can rein in the extreme weather events we are witnessing today. We urge the city corporations, local administrations and all development authorities to stop the current trend of mindless urbanisation and deforestation. Water bodies must be protected from encroachers. Those responsible for choking rivers and canals must be brought to book. Decentralisation of Dhaka, too, must be prioritised. While the public must be aware of how to not fall ill during an extreme heatwave, global and local leaders must stamp down on the larger causes behind it.\n",

        "full_article": "The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2022 published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) hardly presents an encouraging picture for society. It confirms once again the widening economic disparity instead of social integration through rational distribution of wealth and income. Even the excuse of the two years' pandemic-induced economic shock and the global economic recessionary trend coming on its heel triggered by the war in Ukraine will not fully explain the number of debtor households in both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. In a free market economy pursued by the country, any distributive justice in wealth creation is least expected. The fact that the rich accumulated more wealth during the pandemic is a proof of an archaic system never helpful in reducing economic disparities in society. What is particularly disconcerting is that the rising number of borrowers are mainly taking loans from creditors who are either their neighbours or otherwise familiar to them. The number of debtors accepting loans from banks and financial institutes is most likely to be very small. The survey's contention is that 37.03 per cent borrowed money in the year 2022. If compared with the 35.49 per cent borrowers in 2021, this cannot be said to be unusual given the reversal economies, not only in Bangladesh but also globally, are suffering. Then the amount of loan for an average family has gone up to Tk70,506 in 2022 from Tk37,743 in 2016. If the inflation is counted, perhaps this jump in six years is not very big. But the issue here is not an increase in loan, it should have been a thing of the past by this time. Bangladesh has become richer many times over, but the fate of the underprivileged and lower segments of society has not improved proportionate to the country's wealth acquisition. Admittedly, village economy has also expanded but the number of landless and marginal farmers has also increased.In the six years under review, the borrowing families have increased by more than 7.0 per cent but the increase is more in urban areas in 2022 by 10.01 per cent than in rural areas where the rise was 6.65 per cent. Yet the overall debtors were more in rural area at 39.35 compared with 32.11 per cent in urban areas. This is because the number of borrowers were higher in villages from earlier times. Now what is particularly worrying is that usurers in villages are taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of the landless and marginal people who are in dire needs of cash. In a way the NGOs are also acting as usurers because the interests on their weekly loans are atrociously high. Had there been institutional credit on easy terms and conditions, the poor and vulnerable borrowers would not find themselves in such dire straits. The moneyed and privileged have got the benefit of stimulus packages in order to overcome their investment requirements. People with no collateral at the bottom rung of society have no access to government's funds or institutional support. Following the NGO method of credit disbursement, such as through formation of groups, they can be provided with institutional credit. This will not render them paupers on repayment of loans.",

        "full_article": "Side by side with a large number of people's Eid travel to their ancestral village homes, many take out time to spend a few days travelling and seeing places. A few of them venture outside the country, mostly the tourist spots in the neighbouring countries. The trend of passing the Eid holidays outside the confines of residences has been picking up for more than a decade. Thanks to the lockdowns prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the steadily rising tourism culture had to pass through a crisis in 2020-21. An uncertain future stared the rising sector in the eyes. The country didn't have to wait much longer. The Bangladesh domestic tourism soon found itself on a firm footing.Given the rise in the number of local tourists in the country, which started nearly a decade ago, the sector should have taken an institutional shape. Now that the hindrances to its growth, especially the unforeseen scourges like the pandemic and its fallout, have been dealt with firmly, the sector insides look to a better future for Bangladesh tourism. It's true the South Asian country is a new entrant in the regional tourism. Notwithstanding its fast growth, the local tourism is hamstrung by scores of limitations such as weak infrastructural facilities in the areas of communication, short-time lodging, tour guidance and the overall service sector. Many consider the lack of sufficient security a disadvantage. However, the recent entry of imaginative tourism-related entrepreneurs shows the signs of better times for the future Bangladesh tourism. It begins with the tourist sites. Not long ago, the very term 'tourism' in this country would bring to the mind the long sandy beach of Cox's Bazar. Besides the then quiet beach and the leisurely crowds of tourists, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) slowly emerged as another site. At present along with the country's second-largest beach at Kuakata, dozens of lately discovered spots in the CHT and the greater Sylhet are popular tourist hubs. Both youths and elderly people throng these places. Many previously obscure and lesser known venues in the country are now recognised as tourist sites. A number of these spots are located at the hilly riverside areas in the Moulvibazar district under the Sylhet division. Not long ago, the Sylhet-centred tourism hub was synonymous with Jaflong, a hill station nestled amid fascinating scenic beauty. Now there are over a dozen spots around it.Private tour operators are behind the new discoveries. Locals living around the remote and far-flung tourist spots are also seen making attempts to popularise the locations. It's because if tourism flourishes in the areas concerned, the local people will be benefited by income-generating activities. Bangladesh is a small country. But the country's tourism prospects are enormous thanks to its being a deltaic land, and crisscrossed by large and small rivers. Moreover, it has the world's largest mangrove forest. These distinctive features make the country a unique tourist destination. Bangladesh is no Mauritius, nor is it a Polynesian island-nation, the Balinese island in Indonesia or Langkawi archipelago in Malaysia. These countries and places try their best to highlight their tourist appeal. Bangladesh has its unique socio-cultural background and a distinctive style of hospitality, which has evolved through the ages.The tourism sector in Bangladesh has for long been operating in an amateurish, rudderless manner. Whatever progress it made had been possible through individual initiatives. The Eid and winter travels to different spots throughout Bangladesh, holidaying in the Sundarbans or on the St Martin's Island, visiting the far-away areas deep in the Bandarbans and the other two CHT forest districts --- all of these tours would be undertaken by spontaneous initiatives. It had been the norm even a decade back. Now that the Bangladesh Tourism Board and the Parjatan Corporation have started taking proactive roles in promoting domestic tourism, a semblance of discipline appears to be in place. Tourism is now a formally recognised revenue earning area. The total contribution of travel and tourism to the national GDP of Bangladesh was Taka 809.6 billion (4.7 per cent of the total GDP) and is forecast to rise by 6.4 per cent per annum to Taka 1,596.0 billion (5 per cent of the total GDP) in 2026. Revenue in the travel & tourism market is projected to reach US$ 1,853.00m in 2023: World Travel and Tourism Council. Following the 2-year Covid-19 lockdown, the country has started showing signs of regaining its footing in the tourism sector. The steady growth of the domestic tourism of Bangladesh in the last one-and-half years stands proof of its future course --- confident and apparently unhindered. In the recent times, tourists move around the country throughout all seasons --- especially in winter. People pick this season due to its dry nature. It's cool in temperature and is normally free of rain. A section of people love to set out for tour ventures during the season of monsoon. Most of them love to see the sea amid rain, and the beaches and trees drenched in rainwater. The average people are found avoiding the sizzling summer time. Unlike in many other countries, the growth of tourism in Bangladesh remains constrained by scores of hindrances. The most acute of them is related to easy and affordable communication. The newly built Padma Bridge has alleviated the ordeals tourists once had to pass through while making trips to greater Khulna. The Sundarbans mangrove forest is located in this region. The country needs more express trains, special long-haul tourist buses and launches to help people connect with distant tourist spots. The completion of the Cox's Bazar-Gundum (Bandarban) railway is expected to bring about radical changes in tourist movement in \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "New advances are being madein cancer treatment. Side by side with the existing therapies including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy (that targets proteins that control growth, division, and spread of cancer cells), andsurgery, new approaches to cancer treatment have been developed. Immunotherapy is one of them. In this method of treatment, the immune system of the body is stimulated or suppressed using substances so the body can fight cancer or other kinds of diseases. In some immunotherapies, certain cells of the immune system are targeted, while in others, the immune system, in general, is affected. Oncolytic virus therapy is one form of immune therapy that involvesnew types of drugs that depend on viruses to choose and attack cancer cells and at the same time stimulate body's immune response against the tumour. The difference between, for example, chemotherapy and immunotherapy is that in chemotherapy, both the cancerous and healthy cells are attacked. But in immunotherapy, the body's immune system is stimulated to destroy the cancer cells without harming the healthy cells. In a recent development, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given approval to such treatment in whichthe virus in question, herpes,which causesthe common cold sore or fever blisters, has been genetically engineered to fight deadly skin cancer that develops in the melanocytes, cells that produce melanin (melanin is the pigment that gives skin its colour).Scientists first genetically changed the herpes virus so that it lost its capacity to make people sick. Its genewas further modified so it could replicate within cancer cells thereby enhancing its capacity to fight cancer. With the genetically modified herpes virus getting FDA-approval as an oncolytic virus therapy, scientists are now looking into the cancer-fighting potential of other such known viruses such as polio, rabies, and adenovirus. But these are about our known viruses' potential to fight cancer after necessary tweaking of their genes. But scientists have now found the relics of millions of years old virus hiding in human DNA. These pieces of ancient viruses can wake up to help our immune system to attack malignant tumours in the body. The discovery has been made by scientists at the Francis Crick Institute in London, UK.This immune-enhancing property of the ancient virus parts has been aninspiration for scientists to develop vaccines that can help treat or even prevent cancer.The researchers have discovered a link between the B-cells(a type of white blood cells which constitute a part of the immune system) that cluster around tumours and ensure a better rate of survival from lung cancer. B-cells produce antibodies that can fight infections. But what were they doing in the lung cancer? Scientists continued research to discover that they were trying to fight a type of virus, the so-called, endogenous retrovirus (a family of viruses lying within our genome). In a cancer cell, the ancientendogenous retrovirusestryto resurrectsegments, if not the ancient viruses in their entirety. The B-cells identify those in tumour cells and consider those as a viral threatand try to destroythose with the help of theentire immune system of the body. That is, these fragments of ancient viruses are in a way protecting humans from cancer. According to a BBC report, the study on how that happens naturally in human body was published in the scientific journal Nature. However, researchers now want to use the helpful role of the millions of years old viral fragments in thehuman body to develop not only therapeutic, but also preventive vaccines against cancer.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
