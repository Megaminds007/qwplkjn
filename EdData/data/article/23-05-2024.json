The ECI has, in recent years, disappointed the Indian electorate by its inability to be effective, impartial and prompt in its role as the watchdog of elections. This is partly a function of the mechanism of the appointment of the ECI\u2019s members, which is entirely a partisan decision of the executive. The ECI has now written to BJP president J.P. Nadda to ask \u201cstar campaigners\u201d of the party to refrain from making statements which \u201cmay divide the society\u201d. Its letter follows his response on May 13 to a notice issued to him over a complaint against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s speech in Banswara, Rajasthan \u2014 Mr. Modi had referred to Muslims as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cpeople with more children.\u201d The letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asks him to ensure that the party\u2019s star campaigners desist from making any statements which may cause tensions between different castes and communities. These rebukes from the ECI to the parties come a day after it censured the former Calcutta High Court judge turned BJP candidate from Tamluk, West Bengal, Abhijit Gangopadhyay, for his remarks against Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee. He was barred from campaigning for 24 hours.Earlier, the ECI had acted against YSRCP chief, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, BRS chief K. Chandrashekar Rao, Telangana Minister Konda Surekha, BJP leaders Shobha Karandlaje and Dilip Ghosh, and Congress leaders Supriya Shrinate and Randeep Surjewala. Complaints against U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, last week, for their alleged violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) are pending. Overall, these measures might give an appearance of impartiality but that is not enough. The ECI is assuming a false parity between legitimate debates on policies that impact various social groups differently and an incitement of xenophobia for social polarisation. The MCC cannot be a ruse to muffle political debates and disagreements which are, and should be, at the heart of campaigning. Misuse of power and creation of disharmony fall in a different basket. The integrity and the credibility of the ECI is central to the legitimacy of elections. Reinforcing its independence should be a priority for all stakeholders in Indian democracy, particularly political parties and the judiciary. The ECI is too important to be left to itself. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nElection Commission of India\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nRajasthan\n\n/\n\nminority group\n\n/\n\nCaste\n\n/\n\njudge\n\n/\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n/\n\nYuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party\n\n/\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nAssam",

        "full_article": "In seeking arrest warrants against the leadership of Hamas as well as of Israel, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has taken a welcome first step towards accountability for the war crimes committed since October 7, 2023. It was the day Hamas launched its deadly attacks, killing over 1,200 Israelis and taking at least 245 hostages. The Israeli military retaliation on Gaza has been brutal and relentless, and the death count has crossed 35,000 people, most of them women and children. The application for warrants, which will be decided by a Pre-Trial Chamber of ICC judges, will naturally have a greater impact on Israel than on the non-state group. Israel\u2019s immediate concern is the moral equivalence the prosecutor has made in levelling charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against both the national leadership of a democracy and an armed group that wants to destroy it. Save for Israel\u2019s diehard supporters, including the U.S. and some other governments, few would disagree with the balance sought to be struck by ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan. It may not be flattering for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to be named for war crimes and crimes against humanity alongside Yahya Sinwar, head of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri alias Deif, commander-in-chief of the Al-Qassam Brigades, and Ismail Haniyeh, who heads the Hamas Political Bureau.It would have been impossible, however, for the ICC prosecutor to ignore what the Israeli leadership has been accused of \u2014 starvation as a method of war and intentionally killing and directing attacks against civilians, among others. Hamas has been accused of extermination, murder, rape, torture and taking hostages. Israel has predictably questioned the application, repeating its position that it is engaged in legitimate self-defence. To many, the arrest warrants may appear futile. Those against whom warrants have been issued, but remain unexecuted, include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Sudan\u2019s President Omar al-Bashir. However, regardless of the efficacy of such measures in preventing or punishing war crimes, the step does entail diplomatic costs, as member-countries of the ICC are obliged to arrest and hand over those against whom warrants are pending under the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC mechanism. It may increase Israel\u2019s isolation on the one hand, and harden the U.S.-Israeli position on the Palestinian question on the other. Israel, like the U.S., is not an ICC member-state; but as the Putin precedent shows, this may not be an impediment to the issuance of warrants against its leaders. On the flip side, Mr. Netanyahu will likely use this to shore up his position at home.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\ninternational court or tribunal\n\n/\n\nIsrael\n\n/\n\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\ncrime, law and justice\n\n/\n\nsexual assault & rape\n\n/\n\nmurder\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nSudan\n\n/\n\nlaws",

        "full_article": "Calcutta HC is hearing today an appeal against its order on Monday restraining BJP from publishing ads it found had violated Model Code of Conduct (MCC) \u2013 Election Commission\u2019s manual for political parties that\u2019s in force from announcement of polls till results day. HC was sharp \u2013 it held EC had \u201cgrossly failed\u201d to address violation of MCC. It was a rare observation, even troubling, that a constitutional court found reason to pull up a constitutional authority. Three takeaways.\nContent & timing of ads |\u00a0HC found the ads to be \u201cslanderous\u201d and \u201cderogatory\u201d. One ad in Bengali appeared to use religion to target Trinamool. Another ad was published on May 12, a day before the fourth phase of polling in Bengal \u2013 MCC mandates a 48-hour silence period before poll days. These are routine violations that EC could have swiftly handled. Trinamool moved court alleging EC had not acted on its complaints. For EC\u2019s own good, the political party should not have felt the need to approach court. That it did demands institutional introspection within EC.\n\nCourts on poll duty |\u00a0Supreme Court has been on constant poll duty. Following the electoral bonds case, it has in its docket cases vital to EC\u2019s constitutional authority \u2013 appointments of ECs, EVM-VVPATs, on vacancies in legislatures, and of course, the Maharashtra cases including assigning of party symbols. Both public and political parties are turning to the courts frequently on matters jurisdictionally in EC\u2019s ambit. Courts have desisted; thrown out frivolous pleas, discarded irrelevant claims, patiently heard activists and campaigners \u2013 returning petitioners repeatedly to EC, whose remit is the conduct of free and fair elections, and ensuring a level-playing field.\nConstitution matters |\u00a0There cannot be a perception that EC is anything but a neutral arbiter. Calcutta HC referred to Article 226 of the Constitution to state the petition before it wasn\u2019t preventing \u201csmooth process of the election\u201d. Article 226 provides the right to approach HCs (and SC under Article 32) to anyone whose fundamental right has been violated. HC also invoked Articles 14, 19 and 21 (equality, freedom of speech and liberty) to uphold the petitioners\u2019 plea. Central to the authority the Constitution vests in EC, is people\u2019s trust. To be universally perceived as a fair custodian of this trust is inarguably one of the most important institutional remits in India. In fiercely contested elections, EC must go the extra mile. It\u2019s the only safeguard against campaigning\u2019s tendency to descend to the lowest common denominator. Calcutta HC upheld both letter and spirit of MCC.\n\n",

Set up to prosecute war crimes, it can issue arrest warrants against individuals if national courts can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it. ICC\u2019s testing its power. Last year, it issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin and now its prosecutor has applied for warrants against five consequential figures in the Israel-Hamas conflict, including Benjamin Netanyahu. The catch here is that ICC can bypass national courts but not enforcement agencies if arrests have to be made.\n\u2018World order\u2019 |\u00a0The pivotal moment for global legal institutions was the San Francisco conference in 1945 when the UN charter and the statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) were adopted. The euphoria of the founding moment contained a kernel of truth. The world order would be hierarchical. UN\u2019s \u2018Big Five\u2019 would get exclusive veto powers because they bore the primary responsibility to hold up the order. And also disturb it, as subsequent events showed.\n\nShifting equilibrium |\u00a0A rules-based order has two parts. There are well-intentioned ideas to prevent conflict and promote economic cooperation. There\u2019s also the reality of power exercised by sovereign states. Their interaction produces an equilibrium. That equilibrium is increasingly under pressure, leading to the architecture falling apart. Be it UN or WTO, multilateral bodies are now mostly ineffective.\nFragmented order |\u00a0Move aside World Bank and IMF. China is today the world\u2019s largest official creditor. A 2021 study looked at contracts between Chinese state enterprises and 24 sovereign borrowers. They\u2019re designed to weaken collective action on debt restructuring by groups like the Paris Club. The world order is fragmenting and there\u2019s not much sympathy because of past institutional hypocrisy. As for ICC, after years of prosecuting African warlords, it\u2019s facing a new reality.\n\n",

Elsewhere, communal refers to something inclusive, pertaining to the community as a whole. However, in India the word has become a replacement for divisive terms like \u2018sectarian\u2019 or \u2018partisan\u2019.\nIn the current rhetoric of electioneering, the word has acquired the Humpty Dumptyesque ability to mean whatever its user wants it to mean. Which is fine, in that such linguistic laissez-faire is a democratisation of language, showing that one is free to choose whatever meaning one elects to give a word, free of the dictatorship of conventional usage. So, when one speaker uses the word \u2018communal\u2019, the adjective is descriptive of a mindset or policy based on an appeasement of minorities. However, when another uses the same term, it means something very different, which is fomenting a climate of majority rule at the expense of multi-culturalism.\nEven the terms \u2018minority\u2019 and \u2018majority\u2019 have adopted a Humpty Dumpty free-for-all changeability. The word \u2018minority\u2019 does not merely refer to a value-neutral numeric pertaining to a segment of the overall population, but is a stand-in for a sinister stratagem called vote bank politics. The word \u2018majority\u2019 too has become an ambidextrous verbal construct, which could either also mean vote bank politics, or nationalism, depending on one\u2019s view or ideological hue.\nIndeed, the Humpty Dumptyism of language includes the act of speaking itself, with the verb \u2018to say\u2019 having become a matter of contention, as in did a person say or not say, something or the other, about some people, at some time or another.\nHumpty Dumptyism turns language into a selective sieve which filters out all meaning from words, turning fact into fiction and fiction into fact.\nThe interchange of fact and fiction turns everything into faction: the faction of Humpty, or that of Dumpty. Take your pick.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are shocked to learn of the murder of Awami League MP Anwarul Azim Anar from Jhenaidah-4 constituency, who was reported missing for over a week in India. According to a general diary filed in Kolkata on May 18, the MP went to India for medical treatment on May 12, and was staying with a family friend named Gopal Biswas. At around 1:41 pm on May 13, he left Biswas's home, apparently to visit a doctor, saying he would return in the evening. However, a WhatsApp message was sent from his phone later that evening saying that he was going to Delhi and that there was no need to call him. Another message was sent on May 15 to Biswas reiterating that he was in Delhi with \"VIPs,\" urging not to call him. Since then, neither Biswas nor Anar's family heard from him. Although the Kolkata police have confirmed his death, his body is yet to be recovered, as of writing this editorial.\nThis is a highly unprecedented incident; never before has a sitting Bangladeshi MP been found embroiled in such a deadly affair in a neighbouring country. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his disappearance and death have raised a number of questions in the public mind. Why was he murdered? What could be the motive behind it and who could be involved? Why would he suddenly take off for Delhi if he really was visiting for medical treatment, and why would he refuse to speak on the phone? Where was he during the missing period? Was the MP somehow involved in any unlawful activity leading to his murder?\nAzim, who has been elected three times, stood accused in 21 cases between 2000 and 2008, according to his affidavit submitted to the Election Commission before the January 7 national election. Three of those were murder cases, while the rest involved smuggling arms, explosives, drugs and gold, extortion, tender manipulation, and sheltering extremists. He was even on a \"wanted\" list of the Interpol. Though he was subsequently cleared in all 21 cases during the AL regime, allegations of his involvement in various illegal trades have surfaced from time to time. Given his checkered past and the suspicious activities in India before his murder, we cannot help but be wary of the possibility of his involvement in some serious crimes across the border.\nWhile we condemn the killing of MP Anar, we must say it would be unfortunate\u2014and a matter of shame for our nation\u2014if he was found involved in unbecoming activities, that too in a neighbouring country. We demand a proper investigation into the murder and full disclosure of the circumstances that led to his death. Three people have already been arrested over what Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan has called a \"planned murder.\" The authorities must be forthcoming about any detail they might unearth in the days to come. Only full transparency can allay the rumours and speculations that are currently proliferating on and off social media about the MP.\n",

        "full_article": "Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian President, and the country's foreign minister were tragically found deceased on May 20, 2024, shortly after their helicopter crashed in foggy conditions. In response, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed a relatively unknown vice president as the interim leader.\nAccording to Iran's Constitution, the first vice president assumes the presidency in the event of the president's death or incapacity. Mohammad Mokhber, appointed to this role by the late President Raisi in August 2021, will now take over the presidency. Despite Iran having several vice presidents serving in its cabinet, the first vice president holds the most senior position. Mohammad Mokhber will serve as president until a new election is held, as mandated, within the next 50 days.\nEbrahim Raisi, a significant figure in Iran's political arena, was elected as the next president of Iran following the 2021 elections. These elections took place amid concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic impact of US sanctions, and uncertainties regarding the nuclear deal. Notably, there were significant concerns about voter disengagement. The outcome signalled a strengthening of conservative power in Iran's political sphere.\nBorn into a devoutly religious family in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in 1960, Ebrahim Raisi commenced his extensive theological studies at the Qom religious seminary at the tender age of 15. By the time of the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution, Raisi, then 18, rapidly ascended the ranks of power. He initially served as the prosecutor general of Karaj, a suburb of Tehran, and later assumed the position of deputy prosecutor for the entire capital.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, Iran's first Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini covertly issued decrees condemning thousands of political prisoners to death. These prisoners, primarily from dissident groups like the People's Mujahedin of Iran and supporters of leftist factions, were targeted following Iran's acceptance of a ceasefire, which triggered a series of attacks.\nA \"death commission,\" comprising four individuals, reportedly including Ebrahim Raisi, was subsequently established to oversee the executions. Amnesty International released a report in 1990 documenting these killings, highlighting the absence of fair trials for the victims. Despite international condemnation, Iran has never officially acknowledged its role in these events.\nIn 2019, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Raisi and other high-ranking Iranian officials for their involvement in human rights abuses. Raisi, who served as Tehran's deputy prosecutor general, was accused of participating in the \"death commission\" responsible for the extrajudicial killings of political prisoners.\nRaisi, always a staunch supporter of the establishment, held several key positions within Iran's judicial system. After the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989, Raisi was appointed as the prosecutor of Tehran. He served as the first deputy chief justice from 2004 to 2014, followed by his appointment as the attorney-general of Iran from 2014 until 2016.\nIn 2016, Mr Khamenei appointed him to lead the Astan Quds Razavi (Imam Reza charity foundation), which manages a vast network of businesses and endowments. These foundations, mainly sustained by donations or assets seized during the 1979 revolution, operate directly under the Supreme Leader's authority. When Raisi assumed leadership of the foundation, Mr Khamenei publicly praised him as a trustworthy person with high-profile experience, a rare commendation from the Supreme Leader. This endorsement fuelled speculation that Raisi might be groomed as a potential successor.\nRaisi assumed office during a critical period for Iran. The nation grappled with a faltering economy, exacerbated by sanctions, and the collapse of the nuclear deal, which had promised economic relief. The death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman detained for violating Iran's strict hijab regulations, triggered widespread protests. Raisi endorsed a severe crackdown on these demonstrations.\nIn response to both internal unrest and external pressures, Iran escalated its nuclear activities, initiated arms shipments to Russia, and reaffirmed its support for various organisations, including Hezbollah, the Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Shia Mobilisation Units.\nRaisi, a notable figure in Iran's political landscape, earned recognition for his efforts in establishing robust partnerships with China and Russia, significantly shaping Iran's foreign policy. He played a crucial role in brokering the Chabahar Port deal with India, contributing to the cessation of Iran's global isolation.\nAnalysts attribute these diplomatic accomplishments to Raisi's strategic prowess. The reconciliation with Saudi Arabia facilitated dialogue with other regional powers and led to a temporary reduction in tensions. In November last year, amidst Israel's Gaza conflict, both Syrian President Bashar Assad and Raisi attended an urgent Arab League summit in Riyadh, advocating for stronger measures against Israel. Alongside political gains, the reconciliation between two major regional economies stimulated discussions on enhancing trade relations.\nUnder Raisi's leadership, Iran revitalised the Chabahar port agreement with India, defying potential US sanctions. The recent decade-long pact between the two nations will witness India undertaking the development and management of Iran's strategic port, facilitating access to Afghanistan and Central Asian countries while bypassing Pakistan. India's infusion of $120 million into Shahid Beheshti terminal infrastructure, coupled with an additional $250 million credit line for associated projects, brings the contract's total worth to $370 million.\nIran's continued endorsement of groups like Hamas under Raisi has magnified its sway in West Asia and the Arab world, prompting other Arab nations such as Egypt to publicly extend support and assistance to Palestinians.\nThe passing of Raisi creates a significant vacuum in Iranian politics. Vice President Mohammad Mokhber's appointment as the temporary leader adds to the uncertainty during this transitional phase. Raisi's contributions to Iran's politics and foreign relations leave a lasting impression on the nation and its surroundings. As Iran moves through this critical period, the future direction of its leadership remains uncertain.\nThis article was first produced in Globetrotter.\n\nPranjal Pandey is a journalist and editor located in Delhi.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

But it does feel like a wasted opportunity, especially given the widespread use of mobile phone and internet among women in Bangladesh.\nThe \"Joy\" app\u2014through which women facing violence can send rescue pleas to law enforcers, family and friends\u2014was seen as a laudable step when it was launched in 2018. However, over the last six years, only six requests were sent through the app, according to a recent report by this daily. For context, over the last four years, more than 6,000 women were raped and more than 300 were murdered after rape. Had the app worked properly or had girls and women known about it, could some of those victims be reached in time?\nYou can no longer find the app on Google Play, and no link to the app is even visible on the landing page of the website of the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) or other relevant ministries. The app is apparently under reconstruction currently, and Google might have restricted some of its features in Android 12. But this is no excuse for its serial underperformance in all the years that it has existed.\nWe have seen a similar usage pattern with the MoWCA's 109 helpline, which is not being used for the purpose it was intended to serve. Moreover, since 2013, an estimated 600-plus apps have been developed by the government, but like Joy, most of these disappeared from Google Play. Joy was built with a budget of Tk 45 lakh. If similar amounts were spent to develop the other apps, imagine how much of taxpayers' money went to waste.\nIt is clear that government officials and organisations behind these initiatives put little effort into properly utilising them, making a mockery of the whole investment. But rescue tools like an app or helpline can save many potential victims of violence, if properly used and promoted. We urge the authorities to take immediate steps to revive these important tools.\n",

The retraction by the authorities concerned has widespread and long-term ramifications for the regulation of traffic in the city and elsewhere in the country. This is not for the first time that a move with merit for managing traffic a little better has been thwarted in the face of violent protests. Transport workers, particularly those involved with operation of buses, have, on more than one occasion, forced the authorities to backtrack on well-advised measures taken to free the city's traffic from rampant anarchy and accidents. It happened in case of long-route and highway operation of buses also. Then there is the question of implementation of laws. The Road Transport Act 2018 even has provisions for stiffer fines and even capital punishment but even the violation of the common regulations are routinely overlooked and decisions taken revoked soon.When the authorities concerned turn a blind eye to illegal and unregistered vehicles, it is just a matter of time before such transports proliferate. A development of this order puts the political administration in a dilemma. When a large number of otherwise unskilled people get involved in a livelihood without official approval, the political and humanitarian aspects come to the fore. This is exactly what might have prompted the prime minister to reconsider the operation of battery-run three-wheelers in the capital. It means the vehicles have earned the right to ply on roads in other cities and towns as well. Although the highways have been kept off-limit to such vehicles, there is hardly any guarantee the measure will hold. A number of makeshift and tinkered contraptions called 'nosimon', 'korimon' on top of easy bikes have never complied with the official order. But here was a chance of taking the battery-run vehicles off the road. In a mega city where, according to the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), the number of pedal rickshaws now stands at 1.5 million, the most unsafe and legally unapproved battery-run ones pose various threats. Their speed is not matched by their body shape and aerodynamics. The most significant issue here is rickshaws' movement in alleys and narrow roads mostly in residential areas and at a short distance. Unmanageable speed and precarious brake system make battery-run rickshaws completely unfit for plying in alleys and narrow roads, let alone the busy main roads of the city. This is why such vehicles failed to receive approval from the authorities concerned and the High Court made their operation illegal. There is still time to withdraw such vehicles from road because the number of such vehicles, reports BILS, is 0.2 million. Under a rehabilitation programme, their drivers could be shifted to alternative livelihood options. The official retraction decision will encourage owners and pullers of pedal rickshaws to turn more and more of those into battery-run ones. At some point, their proliferation, like pedal rickshaws, will be unmanageable. Their organised power will be many times stronger and the authorities will be powerless to make them comply with rules and orders. It's a grim prospect for a capital city where vehicle speed in busy time has already come down below walking speed.",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh stands out from many developing economies, thanks to its favourable demographic dividend. A large young population presents a unique opportunity for growth. Tapping into this bright potential, however, hinges on transforming the youth into a skilled and productive workforce on a par with global standard. Given the importance of human capital development for Bangladesh to reap its unique demographic dividend, policymakers and planners often make grand promises to reform policies and take initiatives to transform the population into valuable human resources. Unfortunately, what the authorities say and what they do are not necessarily the same. For example, despite all the lofty promises of reforming policies and taking initiatives to turn the population into valued human resources, two of the most vital sectors - education and health - continue to be ignored in the national budget.The best international practices suggest that a country should spend six per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or 20 per cent of its annual budget on education. The Dakar Declaration, in which Bangladesh is also a signatory, supports this guideline. Even the government's own 8th five-year plan, from fiscal 2020-21 to fiscal 2024-25, put much emphasis on human resource development and recommends 16.5 per cent of Annual Development Programme (ADP) allocation for education and 11.1 per cent for health sector in fiscal year 2024-25. But, according to a recent news report, the education and technology sector will jointly get an ADP allocation of Tk 315.28 billion (12 per cent) and the health sector will get nearly Tk 206.82 billion (7.80 per cent of the ADP) in the upcoming budget. Way short of what it ought to be.Overall, as the report informs - quoting a finance ministry source - the education sector would receive Tk 1 trillion and the health sector Tk 420 billion in the next budget. The funds encompass both operational and developmental expenses. Budgetary allocations for the education and health sectors may appear to be increasing year-on-year, but in proportion to GDP, the allocation for education is only two per cent and just one per cent for health. Putting it into a global perspective, the World Bank says Bangladesh is one of the 10 countries that spend the least on education in proportion to GDP. Only a handful of countries like Bermuda, Haiti, Mauritania, Cambodia, Laos, Monaco, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, and South Sudan allocate a smaller share of their GDP to education.Bangladesh's average two per cent of GDP allocation for education is far lower than many regional neighbours such as Bhutan (6.6 per cent), Nepal (5.2 per ent) and India (2.7 per cent).Moreover, Local Government Departments, the Department of Road Transport and Highways, and the Department of Power receive a bigger slice of ADP allocation than the health and education sectors. While the necessity of developing roads and highways and increasing power generation is undeniable, merely establishing infrastructure will not suffice. There is no alternative to increasing the allocation in the education and health sectors to ensure the availability of human resources necessary for their smooth operation. Worse still, a large chunk of the education budget is not directly linked to education but goes to non-developmental sectors like salaries and maintenance costs for teachers, officials, and staff. While ADP allocations should ideally focus on both infrastructure and human resource development, it appears that the construction of buildings is receiving far more priority than the qualitative improvement of education and services.As a result of chronic insufficient investment in quality education, primary healthcare, and skills development, the country is facing an acute human capital crisis. For example, Bangladesh needs to hire foreign engineers and technical experts for the construction of mega projects like the Padma Bridge and Metro Rail. However, no decisive action is yet visible to develop the technical expertise within the country who could lead such projects in the future.The lack of skilled manpower is also evident in the fact that, while a large number of educated youths are not finding jobs, many local businesses are hiring foreign nationals who take home about six billion dollars annually, equivalent to a quarter of the country's expatriate income. Furthermore, according to a recent report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Bangladeshi expatriate workers earn significantly less than their Indian counterparts due to a skill gap. The lack of investment in these two sectors also means that out-of-pocket education and healthcare expenditures in Bangladesh are significantly higher compared to neighboring countries like India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Pakistan. This high expenditure is closely linked to an increase in poverty and widening social and economic disparities.It is imperative, therefore, for the government to review its priorities and set allocation accordingly to enrich the country's pool of skilled manpower. Analysts suggest that aiming for 20 per cent of the annual budget for education may be too ambitious for now. However, the government could start with 14 per cent next fiscal year and increase the allocation by, say, one per cent each year. At the same time, it's equally important to improve the government's capacity to implement development projects effectively.Advanced economies worldwide are known and respected for their optimal investment in human resource development. They understand that a skilled and educated population is the cornerstone of sustained economic growth. If Bangladesh truly wants to graduate to a proper middle-income economy, there is no alternative to developing human capital. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The tragic death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash triggered a shockwave throughout the world.Accompanied by Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and some other senior officials, he was on his way home after a short trip to Azerbaijan.Unfortunately, the 40-year old Bell helicopter that carried the Iranian president crashed due to heavy fog and inclement weather.This is so far the official version. But hours after his death, conspiracy theories started emerging from various corners, including the media, with some pointing fingers at the Mossad, the intelligence service of Iran's arch rival, Israel.Though Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in his statement made it clear that the crash was an unfortunate incident, some in Iran and other parts of the world are apparently not ready to accept that the crash was accidental.No doubt the reason for the doubt is the timing of the crash. It took place at a time when the rivalry between Iran and Israel is at its peak.Just a couple of months ago the entire world witnessed the spectacular show of airborne attacks and counter attacks unleashed by both countries against each other.The direct conflict situation between the two countries surfaced for the first time in history through this aerial campaign.So, there are obvious reasons for the emergence of the conspiracy theories over the death of Mr Raisi, a hardliner, who was well-known for his tough stance against Israel.The conspiracy theorists want to say that the helicopter was tampered while it was grounded on the land of Azerbaijan, a country where pro-Israeli elements are reported to have a strong presence.Even some analysts while talking to an Iranian television made an oblique reference to conspiracy. A commentator named Foad Izadi said, 'When a helicopter faces an accident, it might be caused by a technical issue or maybe weather conditions. - but there are also other scenarios'.Referring to Israel and its powerful intelligence service, he added: \"We have an issue in the republic of Azerbaijan and that is the presence of the Zionists and Mossad in that region. It will be investigated. We have respect for our neighbours but we should not get targeted from their territories.\"However, such conspiracy theories are unwarranted and such a campaign may heighten tension further in the Middle East, which is already plunged into geopolitical volatility.In the narratives of the conspiracy theorists, a simple truth is overshadowed by more compelling and dramatic possibility of intentional sabotage, and such thriller like scripts plant the seed of doubt so that it continues to flourish in the fertile soil of public imagination.Peace and stability in this region, the energy hub of the world, are imperative as further conflict would pose serious threat to the energy supply causing economic turmoil in the whole world.And countries like Bangladesh that are hugely dependent on petroleum imports from the Middle East will be one of the worst victims.In fact, Iran itself needs to be unperturbed by such conspiracy theories for its own stability as Raisi was considered an heir apparent to the supreme leader.Many believe that Raisi's sudden death may cause a succession crisis in Iran.Though soon after the death of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Mr Khamenei himself made it clear that there will be no disruption in the governance mechanism due to the departure of Raisi from the scene, apprehensions are there that the new President and foreign minister would have to face a herculean task to fill in the gaps of their immediate past predecessors.So let us hope that real truth behind the deadly crash would come out soon and stop the rumour from generating provocative campaigns.Provocation, tension and speculation are the least wanted elements in the Middle East right at the moment.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Electric auto rickshaws, a modern twist on a Bangladeshi staple, have become an undeniable force in the nation's transportation landscape. However, recent discussions of a ban on auto rickshaws threaten the very progress these eco-friendly vehicles represent.A ban, despite its intended benefits, would be a severe blow to countless Bangladeshis. These electric rickshaws provide crucial income for millions, particularly those in the informal sector. For many families, they represent a pathway out of poverty and a means to build a secure future.Beyond economics, electric rickshaws offer a sustainable and convenient transportation option. Unlike buses, they can navigate narrow streets and cater to short trips, making them irreplaceable for daily commutes. They also contribute to a cleaner Bangladesh by reducing noise and air pollution compared to traditional fuel-powered taxis.So, how can Bangladesh ensure the safety and seamless integration of electric rickshaws? The answer lies in a collaborative effort. Implementing stricter regulations and mandatory driver training programmes can significantly enhance safety on the roads.Additionally, investments in infrastructure, such as designated lanes for electric rickshaws, would benefit everyone. This would not only improve traffic flow but also create a safer environment for both drivers and passengers.By embracing innovation and prioritising safety, Bangladesh can find a solution that preserves the livelihoods of auto rickshaw drivers, safeguards the environment, and keeps these iconic vehicles as a vital part of the nation's vibrant mobility network.\nSayma AkterStudentNorth South University[email\u00a0protected]",
