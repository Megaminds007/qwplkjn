        "full_article": "The diplomatic row between India and Canada has, as expected, begun to impact people who have ties with both countries. The unusual manner in which Canada made public its understanding that Indian officials were somehow involved in the 2023 murder of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar has derailed bilateral relations. Washington\u2019s allegations regarding the plot against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun further complicated matters. On November 3, a camp on the premises of the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton, which was organised by the Indian mission to provide consular services, was violently disrupted by Khalistan activists. Later, a protest by a Hindu group also led to violence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the violence at the mandir as \u201cdeliberate\u201d and attempts to intimidate Indian diplomats as \u201ccowardly\u201d. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau termed the incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d. At least two people linked to Nijjar have been reportedly arrested by the police in Canada. One of them is wanted in India. An estimated 19 lakh people, or about 4% of Canada\u2019s population, are of Indian origin. Many of them maintain close ties with India and require varied consular services.That a small violent group can even disrupt routine diplomatic functions is a sad commentary on Canada\u2019s standing as a stable democracy where the rule of law is supreme. The Canadian government must ensure that Indian diplomats are secure. India and Canada should not encourage or tolerate any kind of mobilisation that causes communal rift in either country. India\u2019s diaspora engagement must unfailingly reflect the multi-religious character of the nation. India-Canada bilateral trade in goods and services combined is around $19 billion. It was expected to be boosted further through a bilateral trade treaty, but negotiations on this are now stalled. Both countries have been careful so far to insulate their economic relations, but disruptions in visa issuance on both sides can have an impact. India and Canada have significant convergence on many issues, climate change, for instance. Sustained people-to-people contacts have been beneficial, notwithstanding the fact that the current turmoil also originates from fractious diaspora politics. Independent of India ties, Canada is trying to tighten its border policy as nearly two-thirds of the population reportedly feel that there are too many immigrants entering the country. New restrictions on student visas will affect Indian aspirants too. While a complete normalisation of ties cannot be quick, both countries can and must avoid disruptions to their consular services.

        "full_article": "Within a week of winning the U.S.\u2019s electoral mandate, including its popular vote, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump seems ready to pick up from where he left off in 2020. He has begun announcing his nominees for key posts including his National Security Adviser, Border and Immigration agency head, Environmental Protection Agency chief, UN Ambassador, and is completing the process for more senior posts. He is also relying more on his family than on Republican Party bosses. His son Don Jr., is leading the vetting process, saying that loyalty is the most important qualification, and he would pick candidates who \u201cdon\u2019t think they know better\u201d than his father. Mr. Trump has received calls from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the leaders of Australia, China, France, Japan, South Korea and the U.K., among others. Calls with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu were aimed at ensuring that the two major world conflicts are wound down. Here too were shades of Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox behaviour from his previous tenure: billionaire associate Elon Musk was a part of the call with Mr. Zelenskyy. Details of another call, allegedly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, were leaked to a leading U.S. daily, but the Kremlin called it \u201cpure fiction\u201d. In what can only be seen as an imitation of Trumpian style, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto released his conversation with Mr. Trump on social media. The call with Mr. Modi appeared to have rekindled the friendship from Trump 1.0, with Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of Mr. Modi and the Indian readout recalling the Houston and Ahmedabad rallies.While it is clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable flourishes and hyperbole remain, New Delhi must be prepared that the substance of his bilateral agenda is unchanged despite the strides in ties since 2020. Mr. Trump\u2019s declarations on trade should be taken seriously \u2014 he withdrew India\u2019s GSP status for exports over high tariffs in 2019, and his desire to build American manufacturing will clash with the \u2018Make in India\u2019 programme and the 2021 PLI benefits scheme. His new partnership with Elon Musk may mean that India will be expected to consider demands from Tesla and Starlink for special duty waivers and tax holidays, as much as it has for other sectors Mr. Trump favoured in the past, such as the Tellurian MoU for LNG purchases (2019) or real estate projects. While the Trump administration and the Modi government will have more aligned policies on China, the West, South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, they will probably differ over Iran, the UN, immigration and subsidies. New Delhi will need to study Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees, deciding clearly where it is willing to concede to the incoming U.S. administration and where it intends to stand firm.

        "full_article": "Students need saving from the coaching industry. A govt version isn\u2019t the innovation India needs\nCoaching classes are such a large part of Indian culture that it\u2019s hard to believe lots of countries get on perfectly well without them. Of course they do sports coaching, life coaching, entrepreneurial coaching and tonnes of other versions. What they don\u2019t do is go to cram schools to get into other schools. But even in India, coaching has so far been a private enterprise. Now, govt wants a piece of the action. Union education ministry has plans to assist 12.5L competitive exam candidates by 2029. This shows staggering unambitiousness. First, because the medical entrance test alone had 24L applicants this year. Second, govt-aided coaching won\u2019t at all level the education playing field.\nNSS data indicates that urban households on average spend about 12% a year on private coaching out of their total education budget, rural households 15%. As in China and South Korea, this dependence follows from extreme bottlenecks, a well-understood diagnosis. Even the education ministry, which seems to have developed some amnesia, has often held that coaching centres reflect a shortage of quality opportunities. The supply-demand mismatch is particularly striking as students approach institutions of higher education and as they apply for govt jobs. No doubt this is a monumental social challenge. But it isn\u2019t going to go anywhere with govt-aided coaching. Don\u2019t make a fetish of out-of-the-box. Appreciate staid educationist solutions like improving govt schools\u2019 quality.\u00a0\nFor all of China\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s crackdowns on the coaching industry, its tentacles have kept bouncing back. But this doesn\u2019t at all mean that India should go the other way. For too many students coaching has already supplanted regular education instead of supplementing it. Isolated away from friends and family, a generation is being lost. If expanding access to coaching sounds cool in some quarter, it\u2019s bad education.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "The statue of Justice in the Supreme Court muses about her recent makeover\u00a0\u00a0\nThe redesigned statue of Lady Justice has caused much comment. But what does Lady\u00a0 Justice \u2013 our Fair Lady who is meant to represent fairness and impartiality \u2013 herself think about the changes? SO eavesdrops on Justice\u2019s monologue.\u00a0\nJustice: With the country\u2019s legal system shedding its colonial legacy and Indian Penal Code, a relic of the British Raj, being replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita it was time for me to get a change of appearance.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to some, I was based on Themis, the Greek goddess, who later became the Roman goddess, Justitia. But the weighing\u00a0 scales, which I still hold, could be traced to the Egyptian goddess, Maat.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat was a heck of a lot of legacy to be carting around and I\u2019m glad to be shot of most of it. And the sari makes for a nice change from that toga-like thing that made me look like I was going about in public in my bathrobe.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut why put that great big crown on my head?\u00a0 I\u2019d have thought that as a Republic, which derecognised princes in 1971, we\u2019d done away with royal regalia.\nAnyway, ditching that sword I was carrying, which seemed very warlike and not in keeping with our philosophy of ahimsa, was a good\u00a0 thing. Though a copy of the Constitution, which replaces the sword, itself makes for an\u00a0 effective cudgel, with all the extra heft added to it thanks to its 106 Amendments, and more in the pipeline if rumours are to be believed.\u00a0\nBut what\u2019s really puzzling is the removal of\u00a0 my blindfold which was to symbolise impartiality of judgment, regardless of status, caste, or creed. Does my unblindfolding mean that I\u2019m no longer to be impartial? Or does it mean that in my unblindfolded eyes all are equal?\u00a0\u00a0\nBut yikes! What\u2019s this that I see? There are over 5cr cases pending in courts across the country, with 62,000 over 30 years old.\u00a0\nI can\u2019t bear it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll give me\u00a0 back my blindfold. But will anyone notice if I\u00a0 keep my eyes wide shut\u2026?\n\n",

        "full_article": "The indigenous, often courted for votes in India, want both inclusion & autonomy\u00a0\nJharkhand, where the first-phase polling happens today, has seen fierce competition for tribal votes. Parties have variously invoked tribal rights to jal, jangal and zameen, a distinct religious and cultural identity under the Sarna code, or their fear of being engulfed by \u2018outsiders\u2019. Variations of these issues play out globally, wherever there\u2019s a substantial indigenous population, who are all different. Central Indian adivasis are a world away from isolated Sentinelese in Nicobars, or Native Americans, the Maori or the Inuit. But there are broad themes in their predicament: tensions over land, resources, and identity, clashing visions of the good life and future. They are 6% of the world\u2019s population but account for 19% of extremely poor.\nMany indigenous tribes have been uprooted by European colonialism. Their autonomy over their own life choices was denied. Today, while their autonomy is accepted, it is easier said than done. Native Americans are citizens of their own \u2018domestic dependent nations\u2019 as well as US, with rights under both systems. In New Zealand, Maori are seen as sovereign people, with guaranteed political voice and representation. In Australia, indigenous Australians were seen as a lesser race, with terrible consequences. In India, indigenous people have endured colonial expropriation, constitutional paternalism and religious interference, they are displaced in the name of conservation as well as industrial and commercial projects, they have suffered the sharpest edge of the security state in central India.\u00a0\nIndigenous people\u2019s rights are individual and collective. Cultural protection cannot be disentangled from land and ecology. Here, we often frame adivasis either as stewards of a pristine wilderness and lost wisdom, or as deprived but aspiring Indians who want a bigger piece of the extraction and consumption economy. Neither is correct. As individuals embedded into this political economy, they, like any of us, seek a dignified life.\u00a0 But as groups, they occupy a different angle to capitalism and the mainstream order. Indigenous groups have led environmental justice movements, from Standing Rock protests over the Dakota oil pipeline, or against mining projects in central India. Their customs often spring from a different relationship with the earth and other living beings, different from calculations of conventional economics. Their store of knowledge enriches human inheritance. Indigenous or otherwise, we should have access to the same range of choices \u2013 and the world should be big enough for our differences too.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A UP body telling women their safety only lies in segregated spaces is absurd & counterproductive\nWomen\u2019s commissions across India should have their hands full. From crimes against women to other injustices, there is so much work to be done on their mandate to enhance women\u2019s status. And yet, what do these commissions mostly make headlines for? Partisan actions. This dysfunction speaks to how appointees are serving causes other than gender justice. But even by this underwhelming yardstick, the UP state women\u2019s commission\u2019s proposed guidelines for improving women\u2019s safety in public and commercial spaces are disgraceful.\nThe core idea is to segregate women from men \u2013 to get her hair cut a woman should only depend on a woman, to go to a gym only on a woman trainer, to get clothes stitched only on a woman tailor. This is a complete mockery of equality. Down this path, male doctors will not treat female patients, male teachers will only educate male students, all male and female workers will only work with colleagues of their own sex. This is straight out of Taliban\u2019s playbook. And look how that\u2019s going for Afghanistan.\nCommonsense should suffice to say this is not safety but the opposite. Instead of policing the exception who is guilty of \u201cbad touch\u201d, it\u2019s telling women to feel fearful of all male tailors, trainers, hairdressers. That it will improve women\u2019s employment is further farrago. Harassing businesses with such wild guidelines is actually an economic self-goal by any state, hurting opportunities as much as freedoms. Across societies, when diversity is straightjacketed by segregation, it lowers growth alongside social trust. Even sex-ed classes deliver better if they can educate girls and boys side by side. We owe our children a world where they thrive in \u2018mixed company\u2019 instead of dreading it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Dr Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus of BRAC University and a water resource and climate change specialist, talks to Naznin Tithi of The Daily Star about the reasons behind the persistent waterlogging problem in the Bhabadaha area and the measures that should be taken to solve it.\n\nIt's hard to believe that over a million people in Bhabadaha in the country's south-west region have been suffering from waterlogging for so long. When did the problem start and how did it get so bad?\nThe waterlogging problem has been there in Bhabadaha for the last 30 years, which is the result of development activities in the sixties and the seventies. This is the result of an absence of monitoring, greed of a group of people, and the inability of the local community to push for their own agendas and ideas. In any development project, when you intervene or interfere with the natural process, you need to monitor and see what is happening. But the Water Development Board has failed to do so in the case of Bhabadaha. There are also many other factors involved.\nIn the coastal areas of Bangladesh, polders were constructed to protect crops from the high tide (during hide tide, croplands would go under water) and for land building. A hundred years back, these polders were called \"Oshtomashi Baadh\"\u2014or, embankments that would remain functional for eight months of the year. During this period, crops would be protected and harvested, and at the beginning of monsoon, it would be cut down for the tide to come in. Together with the tide would come sediment, which would get deposited and land would be raised. Although it takes time for the land to be raised through this process, it was going on.\n\"Polder\" is a Dutch word that basically means any embankment that prevents the movement of water from the river to inland. When it is linear, we call it an embankment. But when it encircles an area, we call it a polder. Currently, the entire coastal area of Bangladesh is empoldered\u2014we have around 129 of them.\nAround the time of 1965/1966, when the master plan for the overall water management of Bangladesh was prepared for the first time, the demand for building permanent polders came up. A US consultant with USAID funding, in consultation with the local people, decided to build polders around the entire coastal belt of Bangladesh. Before these polders were constructed between 1965 and 1969, tides used to come in and reach the beels or wetlands. The tidal volume was very high during monsoon\u2014about 6 million metre cube. It would come naturally with the tidal water. The 10 to 12 large beels in the Bhabadaha area used to be filled up with the tidal sediment during monsoon.\nBut as the permanent polders were built around the beels, the land building process inside the polders stopped because water could not enter into the polders with sediments. The tidal volume then got deposited in the surrounding rivers, reducing their depth and width. The result is, the poldered areas became lower than the riverbed, creating waterlogging during monsoon. This problem became severe especially in Keshabpur, Abhaynagar, Dumuria and Tala upazilas of Jashore, Khulna and Satkhira in the early nineties.\nTo sum up, the waterlogging problem in Bhabadaha is a result of polderisation. I am not against polders. Without polders, the agricultural revolution in the south-western Bangladesh would have never been possible. After the polders were constructed in the sixties, for the first twenty years it produced excellent results. And then, in some areas, such as the Bhabadaha, the problem started to surface. And that was the time when shrimp cultivation was introduced. So, one group of the community\u2014the powerful elite\u2014didn't bother about the poor farmers and made money by farming shrimp.\nHowever, the polder system is still functioning in Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Noakhali, Laksmipur, Patuakhali and Barisal because the tidal cubature in these areas is still good with fresh water coming from the upstream. But in the south-western part, the behaviour of the polders became different due to the extensive network of rivers. In the Bhabadaha area, especially in Keshabpur, Abhoynagar, Dumuriya and Tala upazilas of Jashore, Khulna and Satkhira, fresh water supply from the upstream has decreased because of Farakka barrage and the tidal cubature has also declined.\nHas anything substantial been done by the authorities so far to solve the issue? Reportedly, the Bhabadaha Pani Nishkashan Sangram Committee has been protesting the projects undertaken by the Water Development Board. Why?\nAround 1977/78, when the government took up the delta development project, these facts were revealed and we requested a new management approach for the polders. Then in the nineties, the government undertook a project to stop the tide by constructing regulators across the river system. But the local people and the civil society organisations opposed it, demanding fresh studies to deal with the issue. The local communities, based on their traditional knowledge and wisdom, demanded implementation of the Tidal River Management (TRM) method.\nThrough this approach, an embankment is built around a beel leaving two cut-points for water to enter and recede from. When the water recedes during low tide, it takes the sediment deposited on the riverbed in a process of natural excavation. Under this method, water can be allowed to enter the tidal basin (the beel) for land building. In the course of a few years, the empoldered area becomes higher than the surrounding riverbed.\nAlthough the government and the engineers of the Water Development Board were against it, the local people started implementing TRM near Chuknagar in Dumuriya upazila of Khulna. After this first TRM initiative was successfully applied by the local community, fresh studies were carried out and the TRM was approved as the technical solution of the problem. But the powerful elites of the area and the local members of parliament did not want the method to be implemented. Government officials sided with the elites. They wanted waterlogging to be there so they could cultivate fish and shrimp. But the decision was suicidal for the local communities, because they could not cultivate paddy, their main food.\nDuring the last 15 years, the government undertook various projects for dredging the rivers and to pump out the stagnant water from the area. But, no amount of dredging will be able to lower the riverbed level. It will get filled up in two/three years. Also, people can get only temporary benefits by pumping out water from the beels.\nSo, what should be done now to push the authorities to implement the TRM approach, since this is the most efficient way to solve waterlogging in the area, according to experts and locals?\nWe need \"social engineering\" to solve the waterlogging problem of Bhabadaha\u2014you need to allow the tide to come in and deposit the sediment in an organised manner. Doing so needs community involvement. But the WDB engineers traditionally like to work through the contractors, not through the community. Recently, the local community completed one TRM project in the Pakhimara Beel of Tala upazila in Satkhira, which has been quite successful. But the powerful local elites and the local MPs would always make attempts to foil the efforts taken by the locals.\nVery recently, the government took up a project to implement TRM and go for land building, but the ministry itself opposed it.\nAs I have mentioned, the situation gradually deteriorated over the last 30 years. In the first 20/25 years, villagers reaped a lot of benefits from the polders. But now the hydro-morphological, tidal hydrodynamics and sediment transport mechanism has been totally altered. This requires a fresh assessment of the ground realities.\nThe waterlogging problem in Bhabadaha must be seen as a national problem. And the solution today would be to form a national commission with professionals from BUET and other experts who understand this particular problem and can solve it with the participation of the local people.\nNeedless to say, TRM is the ultimate solution. The Water Development Board should be instructed to push for implementing TRM in the Bhabadaha area. But they will have to fight with the local elites and their powerful backers who prefer using the land for shrimp cultivation. So, I think only the government can undertake this challenge, and they should not side with the powerful people at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n",

Long demanded by migrants to ensure seamless journey, this step by the interim government aligns with other reassuring measures it has taken since August 8, including securing pardons for 57 jailed Bangladeshi migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and initiating talks with Malaysian authorities for re-recruiting Bangladeshi workers.\nReportedly, migrant workers, whose remittances form the backbone of Bangladesh's economy, are often subjected to neglect and harassment at the airport. Although fancy displays were installed inside the airport during the last regime, hardly any arrangements were made to ease migrant workers' travel experience. Many workers travel from remote parts of the country, enduring long journeys and the anxiety of venturing abroad, only to face unkind treatment from airport staff upon arrival. The same poor reception greets them when they return home.\nThe newly opened lounge provides much-needed rest and relief for the workers\u2014before they embark on another long and sometimes hectic journey\u2014as well as subsidised snacks priced lower than the typically overpriced airport food. Moreover, 100 volunteers sponsored by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will assist them at the airport. These efforts, however, should not diminish the need for training regular airport staff to ensure better treatment for our remittance earners.\nGiven that remittances are one of our primary sources of foreign currency, it is extremely important for the government to prioritise this sector, especially in light of the country's foreign currency debt. Authorities should also address other key issues faced by migrant workers including high cost of migration, recruitment irregularities, wage theft, abuse by foreign employers, and inadequate support from Bangladeshi missions abroad. Expanding into new labour markets through diplomacy, or expediting recruitment in established ones like Malaysia and UAE, should remain our priorities, but not at the cost of workers' rights.\nWe hope the government will continue to take meaningful steps to support them in their journey to earn remittances, and ensure that they are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve, both at home and abroad.\n",

        "full_article": "The South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Women's Championship recently took place from October 17 to 30 at Dasharath Rangasala Stadium in Kathmandu, Nepal, featuring teams from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The teams showcased the growing talent and commitment of women footballers across the region. Constrained by limited opportunities and societal roles imposed by patriarchal structures, the Bangladesh team's success in clinching the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship is an immense motivation for all women and girls in the country, and it embodies the spirit of courage and zest. More than just a sporting victory, this is a liberation from the societal expectations and decades-long obstacles that have restricted women's participation in sports.\nFootball has been a male-dominated sport in South Asia for decades, leaving few opportunities for women to play this wonderful sport professionally. However, the outlook is somewhat improving. Football in the women's circuit has received a welcome boost from some inspiring examples from the international football stage, as many players, having come from difficult backgrounds, have shown special skills in overcoming the hurdles. Against this background, the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship has piqued audience interest, with seasoned players aligned with emerging talents: India's Ashalata Devi, Bangladesh's Sabina Khatun, and Nepal's Renuka Nagarkoti. As women's football seems to be finally hitting the mark in the region, these sportswomen are role models for the upcoming generations of girls who want to take up football.\nThe SAFF tournament with its 12 matches was an exceptional fixture. In the finals, held on October 30, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by a score of 2-1, thereby conferring its 2nd SAFF title. The teams commenced the tournament in a round-robin format before going on to the knockout rounds, leading to the grand finals. While four of the semifinals sprinted for one-time title-bound glory, Bangladesh's women's football team's achievement was entwined with the hope and resilience of Bangladeshis during the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship.\nHowever, even as the celebrations erupted, a gloomy shadow was on the horizon. The coach of the Bangladesh team, Peter Butler, announced his resignation immediately after their victory. Butler emphasised the issues of delayed payment and some other problems during his term, saying that he had not been paid his salary for three months. The news caused ripples in the women's sports fraternity, with debates on the need for transformation. While winning the SAFF championship symbolises a monumental win, it marks a wake-up call. Studies mention that women's sports receive only four percent of the total media coverage, which thankfully has been increasing in recent times. Similarly, sponsorship for women's sports is less than one percent in most countries.\nLack of financial support directly affects team performance. If the coach or players feel unappreciated, this will show in their performance and results. To realise the full potential for women within sports, there is a need to deal with opportunities and gaps; support includes timely salaries for coaches and funds for training and development for young female athletes. The transitions from amateur to professional opportunities can be enhanced by paying scholarships, creating mentoring programmes, and providing support for women in coaching. Community participation and consciousness-raising campaigns are taking centre stage in the quest to change stereotypical representations of women within sports.\nThere is a call upon sports associations, governments, and corporate sponsors to put women's football at the top of their priority lists and invest in it most preferentially. The gap in funding compared to men's sports is glaring. Investing in women's sports could yield considerable economic returns and social benefits such as increased community engagement and improved health outcomes for women.\nSupporting women's football doesn't simply break down into just fair salaries for coaches and pay for players, it's about building an arena wherein women can flourish, free of financial insecurity. If barriers to the success of women in football can be removed, women can do everything they want. In the course of dismantling the stereotype, and opening up opportunities by allowing women into football, society will empower these women to fulfil their passions and realise their fullest potential.\nThe learnings from this championship transcend the boundaries of the football field and point toward the various supporting systems needed to empower women across all disciplines. It starts with early education. The message is clear: give women opportunities, and they will deliver greatness.\nWith each roar of encouragement from the gallery, with each goal, with each moment of camaraderie, the barriers that once confined women begin to crumble and the domain becomes open to young girls who have started to come out onto the fields, inspired by the victory of the Bangladesh team.\nZareen Tasneem is student at North South University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
