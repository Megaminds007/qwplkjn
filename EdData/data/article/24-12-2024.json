        "full_article": "Well into the eighth year of India\u2019s revamped indirect tax regime, the apex body governing the system met last Saturday and unveiled a flurry of decisions \u2014 including some rate changes and clarifications \u2014 that were punctuated by some broader issues it chose to kick down the road. That the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, with the Centre and States on board, had to wait for its 55th gathering to figure out that it needed to clarify that pepper and raisins supplied by farmers, gift vouchers and penalties levied on borrowers by banks and non-banking finance companies, are not taxable, is instructive. Similarly, the switch to a three-tiered levy for something as banal as popcorn \u2014 despite the rationale of taxing sweetened varieties more in the name of health \u2014 after all these years, is worrying. Such moves neither reflect well on the Centre\u2019s claims around its hurried July 2017 rollout that the GST is a \u2018Good and Simple Tax\u2019, nor does it bode well for a meaningful overhaul of its multiple and complex rates\u2019 structure through a long-delayed rationalisation exercise.That the Council also did not bother to consider initial recommendations of a ministerial panel tasked with rejigging the GST rates, nor take up a panel\u2019s suggestions to review life and health insurance policies\u2019 taxation despite a commitment to expedite this rethink, only diminishes expectations from the panel going forward. That the panel\u2019s head left the meeting early, stating it will hold further deliberations on insurance policies\u2019 levies soon, is not comforting, if not entirely casual \u2014 especially as the government has been promising action on this front since the Budget session. The dithering, for whatever reason, is beginning to hurt the industry too. In November, new life insurance business tanked for the first time this year as consumers held off on buying a cover in anticipation of a GST cut. The longer this indecision, and the feet-dragging on the broader rate rationalisation plan, launched over three years ago, persists, the worse will be the implications on consumption that has already turned tentative, and private investment plans that hinge on consumption as well as tax certainty. The Council\u2019s decision to reverse an October verdict of the Supreme Court letting realty players claim input tax credits on costs of construction for commercial structures intended for renting or leasing purposes, will also have ramifications on India\u2019s investment climate. With legal changes to take retrospective effect from July 2017, this is a blast from the past for investors spooked by similar taxation misadventures over the past decade.

        "full_article": "Through history, forests for humans have been sites of shelter, food, livelihoods, protection, and strength of spirit. According to the new India State of Forest Report 2023, 25% of India\u2019s land is covered by forests or trees, on its face a healthy figure and a step closer to the National Forest Policy\u2019s prescriptions. But big numbers always hide problems. Post-Independence, India\u2019s forest governance has been typified by attempts to break free from European colonialists\u2019 insular view of forests as sources of timber, codified in laws the country inherited. Two significant achievements in this regard were the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 and the Forest (Rights) Act 2006. The counteracting forces of industrial development and the pressures of climate change on the state have however troubled the implementation of both Acts and the government has, sadly, chosen the easy way out.Courts and conservationists have demanded that the state follow the dictionary definition of forests whereas the administration has been muddying it to exclude \u201ccommunity\u201d forests, among others, while including plantations and orchards. Even if the administration\u2019s impetus is murky, it is allowing India to claim it is growing its carbon sink towards its climate commitments while allowing developmental activities to continue unimpeded. Thus, the 25% figure hides forest cover loss in the biodiverse Western Ghats, the Nilgiris and the northeast, the shrinking of mangroves in the Kutch and the Andamans, and of \u2018moderately dense\u2019 forests and the ongoing endangerment of open natural ecosystems. The report also lacks details about whether its estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of degraded land account for the specific uses to which they are currently being subjected. Forest loss in biodiverse areas cannot be adjusted with new plantations elsewhere, the consequences of which are exacerbated by the decision to include even commercial plantations, which have lower sequestration and ecological value, and the continued use of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act. Indeed, the growing gap between theoretical and actual forests also extends to finances. In several northern districts, the extent of forest cover that suffered fire losses has increased by an order of magnitude in two years. Ground reports by The Hindu have documented a paucity of human resources, skill, and equipment to control fires. Economic growth is essential and trees will be lost, but this is precisely why the friction that laws impose on the growth impulse is essential too. Yet, the government has been weakening environmental safeguards \u2014 more recently, the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act 2023 further contracted the 1980 Act\u2019s purview \u2014 and distorting its official inventory of forests. It is hard to imagine anyone winning in the end.

        "full_article": "Forests are like the lungs of our planet\u2014they keep everything alive and healthy. They give us fresh air, store water, and protect us from big problems like climate change. That\u2019s why every country should take good care of its forests. In India, something called the State of Forest Report comes out every two years, showing how much forest we have and how healthy they are. The latest report says about 22% of India is covered with forests. That\u2019s a good number, right? But there\u2019s more to the story.\nWhy Should We Worry?\nThe report says India has already made big progress in storing carbon in forests, which helps fight climate change. But here\u2019s the problem: not all forests are doing well. In fact, forests in eight mountain states are shrinking. For example, in Uttarakhand, almost half of the forests are at high risk of catching fire because of hotter, drier weather and human activities like overbuilding. Fires damage trees, plants, and animals\u2014and it takes years to recover. The government can stop this by supporting local forest groups, called van panchayats, and controlling too much construction. But they\u2019re not doing enough.\nWhat\u2019s Happening in Tripura?\nTripura is facing a different kind of problem. Rubber plantations, which are planted to make things like tires and shoes, are spreading fast. Now, they cover 12% of the state\u2019s land. Rubber trees grow quickly and are good for business, but they replace natural forests. This means animals lose their homes, and the land becomes less rich and balanced. Natural forests are full of life and secrets, like plants that might someday help us make new medicines. Once these forests are gone, we can\u2019t bring them back.\nWhy Old Forests Are Special\nForests that have grown naturally for a long time are way better than newly planted ones. They store more carbon, which helps slow down global warming. They\u2019re also full of plants, trees, and animals that work together in amazing ways. Scientists like Suzanne Simard have found that trees in old forests \u201ctalk\u201d to each other through their roots to share food and help each other survive.\nWhat Should We Do?\nInstead of quickly planting new trees to make up for what we\u2019ve lost, we should focus on saving the forests we still have. Governments should plan smarter and listen to experts who know how forests work. It\u2019s not too late to fix things, but we have to act fast.\nForests aren\u2019t just beautiful\u2014they\u2019re our protectors. If we lose them, we lose a big part of what keeps our planet alive. So let\u2019s make sure we take care of them before it\u2019s too late.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Imagine you buy a ticket to a fancy theme park. You pay a lot for it and expect to enjoy the rides. But when you get there, the ticket is suddenly declared invalid. How would you feel? That\u2019s kind of what happens to many people in India with health insurance. They pay for years, thinking they\u2019ll get help when they fall sick. But when they finally need it, their claims are rejected.\nHealth Insurance: Who\u2019s Got Your Back?\nInsurance is supposed to be a safety net. If you get sick or need surgery, it\u2019s meant to cover the costs. But not all insurance companies are the same. A recent report showed that a government-run insurance company rejects only 1 out of 500 claims. Compare this to private insurance companies, where some reject as many as 1 out of 35 claims. That\u2019s a big difference!\nEven worse, some private insurers reject nearly 1 in 5 health claims. That\u2019s a huge problem because these claims aren\u2019t for small things like fixing a cracked windshield\u2014they\u2019re for surgeries, hospital stays, and medical emergencies. Families depend on insurance to afford healthcare, which is already very expensive. When claims are denied for unfair reasons, it feels like a betrayal.\nWhy Is Healthcare So Expensive?\nIn India, good healthcare\u2014clean hospitals with modern equipment\u2014is really pricey. Most middle-class families can\u2019t pay for it without insurance. But if insurance companies reject claims, families are left struggling to pay hospital bills. While some people do try to cheat the system with fake claims, it\u2019s clear that some insurance companies reject claims way too often. This raises a big red flag.\nGST: What\u2019s the Government Doing?\nOn top of all this, the government charges 18% GST (Goods and Services Tax) on health insurance premiums. That means for every \u20b9100 you pay to an insurer, you give \u20b918 more to the government. The government recently had a chance to lower this tax but didn\u2019t. Instead, it decided to focus on things like taxing popcorn. Yes, popcorn!\nIf you buy salted popcorn, you pay 5% tax. If it\u2019s in a package, you pay 12%. And if it\u2019s caramelized (with sugar), you pay 18%. While the government is busy deciding popcorn taxes, it hasn\u2019t done enough to make health insurance more affordable or reliable.\nWhat Needs to Change?\nHealth insurance is like a promise. If you\u2019re paying for it, you should get help when you need it. The government should:\n1. Make sure insurance companies don\u2019t reject claims unfairly.\n2. Lower GST on health insurance so it\u2019s not so expensive.\n3. Focus on helping people afford healthcare instead of worrying so much about popcorn taxes.\nIn the end, health is way more important than snacks. Don\u2019t you agree?\n\n",

        "full_article": "Claims rejection rate too high in health insurance, as is GST on it. Govt busy taxing snacks \nSarkar used to make scooters and bread once, film rolls and hotels too, but private alternatives were better. It\u2019s gospel now that private firms create competition, which is good for customers. So, news that a public sector insurer rejects claims much less often \u2013 1 in 500 cases \u2013 than its private peers gives pause. Ratio of rejections to overall claims is called \u2018claims repudiation ratio\u2019, and as TOI explained on Monday, a lower ratio is better for customers. The gap between this firm and its closest private peer \u2013 rejecting 1 in 35 cases \u2013 is impossible to ignore. Either the public sector firm has a knack for finding bona fide customers, almost all of whom make genuine claims, or private insurers are possibly wilful deniers.\nNumbers for rejected health insurance claims strengthen this hypothesis. Some insurers dismiss almost one in every five health claims. It would look bad if the claims were about cracked windshields, but here we are looking at surgeries and hospital stays that can cripple family finances. Demand-supply mismatch means healthcare in India \u2013 the sterile, air-conditioned type that everyone deserves but the middle class actively seeks \u2013 is prohibitively expensive. Insurance is a post-dated ticket to access it. Denial of that ticket on flimsy grounds after pocketing high premiums for years is a stab in the back. There are false insurance claims, of course, but some firms\u2019 tendency to reject more often than others is a red flag.\nDisaffection with insurers is not a uniquely Indian problem. US health insurance was broken long before Luigi Mangione shot the CEO of the country\u2019s biggest health insurer on Dec 4. In India, the feeling of betrayal is worsened by 18% GST on health premiums. For every rupee you pay to an insurer, govt takes another 18 paise. It had a chance to reduce this burden on Saturday but chose to leave the matter hanging because, seemingly, this is not an obvious imperative and needs further discussion. However, despite GST\u2019s credo of \u2018good and simple tax\u2019, it found time to fix 5% tax on ordinary salted popcorn, 12% if it\u2019s packaged, and 18% on the caramelised variety because it contains added sugar. Talk about priorities.\n\n",

The Arakan Army recently claimed to have captured the last Myanmar army outpost in the strategic western town of Maungdaw, thereby gaining full control of the 271-kilometre-long border with Bangladesh. In light of this development, Bangladesh has urged Myanmar to address the ongoing crisis in Rakhine State and along its borders, emphasising that it cannot negotiate with non-state actors like the Arakan Army.\nForeign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain conveyed this message to Myanmar during an informal consultation held in Thailand on December 19. He also stressed that peace and stability in the region would remain unattainable without resolving the Rohingya crisis, which necessitates their safe and secure repatriation to Myanmar. According to the foreign adviser, at least 1.2 million Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh over the past seven years due to Myanmar's civil war and the persecution of Rohingyas. Moreover, Bangladesh recently had to accept over 60,000 additional Rohingyas through various unofficial channels, despite its decision to prohibit new arrivals. This has been attributed to corruption at the border, which has left the Bangladesh government with limited options.\n\nBangladesh recently had to accept over 60,000 additional Rohingyas through various unofficial channels, despite its decision to prohibit new arrivals. This has been attributed to corruption at the border, which has left the Bangladesh government with limited options.\nClearly, the situation is becoming increasingly complex and concerning for Bangladesh. Corruption along the border, facilitating the influx of Rohingyas and potentially fuelling drug, weapon, and human trafficking, poses a growing security threat. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to address these issues urgently before they escalate further. Moreover, given the current border situation, progress in the Rohingya repatriation process has completely stalled. But how long can Bangladesh continue to provide shelter to them, especially with foreign aid to support Rohingyas steadily dwindling in recent years? The economic, environmental, and social burdens Bangladesh is shouldering to accommodate the Rohingyas are becoming more unsustainable by the day. The potential for further destabilisation, both for Bangladesh and the broader region, continues to grow because of the conflict.\nThe recent escalation of violence in Rakhine has again raised fears of a revival of organised violence against members of the Muslim Rohingya minority community, similar to that which drove huge numbers of them to flee to Bangladesh in 2017. Under these circumstances, Bangladesh must be extra vigilant about securing its border with Myanmar. At the same time, with the aid of the international community, the government should persuade the Myanmar junta and the various rebel factions to reach a peaceful resolution through dialogue for the sake of restoring regional stability.\n",

        "full_article": "The recent layoffs of approximately 40,000 workers across 15 apparel units of Beximco Group, one of Bangladesh's largest garment manufacturers, have sent shockwaves through the industry because of their timing and sheer scale. Such a significant workforce reduction, attributed to a lack of work orders and difficulties in opening letters of credit for raw material imports, is evidence of the ongoing challenges in the country's ready-made garment (RMG) industry. There are also, however, some issues that are unique to Beximco, so it would be a mistake to be too alarmed by this news, as concerning as it might be to many.\nAs I see it, Beximco's problems are evidence of a number of ongoing problems in the garment industry. The layoffs have resulted in significant labour unrest, with workers protesting for unpaid wages and job security. Such disruptions not only affect the immediate workforce but could also potentially deter international buyers concerned about ethical labour practices.\nOn this front, my hope is that we are through the worst of the worker unrest, and now we can, as an industry, put these issues behind us in 2025.\nThe political upheaval following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina's regime has led to disruptions in factory operations and supply chains. Such instability risks eroding buyer confidence, resulting in order cancellations. It is difficult to say how much impact this situation has had on the economy as there are many variables at play in the global economy.\nHowever, it was recently reported that Bangladesh's RMG sector recorded export earnings of $35.88 billion in the calendar year of 2023, according to the revised data from the Export Promotion Bureau. Initially reported at $47.38 billion, this correction points to an $11.50 billion decrease in export earnings compared to what was previously published.\nFor context, the garment exports hit $46.99 billion in FY2022-23, an increase from $42.613 billion in FY2021-22 and $31.456 billion in FY2020-21.\nThe FY2020-21 figure is an outlier as it reflects the tail-end of the pandemic when orders were down across the board. What we are looking at is a fall of around $11 billion over a 12-month period, which is clearly a cause for concern. In this context, the job losses at Beximco come as no surprise.\nIt should be noted that in the past year we have seen a change of president in the US, a key market, as well as major political and economic instability in many European countries such as Germany, France and the UK. While not in recession, the European Union has witnessed sluggish growth in the past 12 months. Many countries are implementing net zero plans which are causing short-term pain as countries attempt to balance growth with environmental commitments.\nDespite these issues, I still believe there are ample opportunities for Bangladesh to grow substantially in 2025. But to capitalise on these, the government and the industry must take proactive steps.\nThe government's decision to provide liquidity support to Beximco for wage payments demonstrates a welcome commitment to stabilise the industry. Such interventions can prevent immediate crises and provide a buffer for companies to restructure and adapt. More support like this may be required if other flagship companies find themselves in a short-term liquidity crisis.\nMoving beyond basic garment manufacturing to high-value products, such as technical textiles and sports apparel, will ultimately be key to opening new markets and reducing dependency on traditional buyers. This shift requires investment in technology and skills development but promises higher profit margins and market stability.\nStrengthening industrial relations will also be critical moving forward. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has proposed key reforms to resolve labour unrest, emphasising the importance of constructive social dialogue. Implementing these reforms can lead to a more harmonious industrial environment in Bangladesh, enhancing productivity and worker satisfaction.\nIn summary, while it is always difficult to see job loss at a major manufacturer, there are steps we can take to mitigate its impact while ensuring that it does not become endemic across the industry. The year 2024 as a whole has been something of an\u00a0annus horribilis\u00a0for Bangladesh\u2014a year in which political instability combined with an uncertain global economy have combined to create the perfect storm for garment manufacturers. We must hold our nerves as we approach the end of this intense period. The fundamentals of our industry\u2014our safe factories, our capable workforce, and world-class production methods\u2014remain robust.\nLet's all work together\u2014industry, government and global stakeholders\u2014to bounce back stronger than ever in 2025.\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is managing director at Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "We commend the initiatives the government is taking to improve local treatment for cancer, infertility, and heart and kidney diseases. According to a report by\u00a0The Business Standard, the government aims to encourage patients seeking treatment abroad for these ailments to opt for domestic facilities instead.\nWhile exact figures are unavailable, around 800,000 Bangladeshis are believed to travel abroad annually for medical treatment, spending over $5 billion. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo,\u00a057 percent of these patients go to India, 20 percent to Thailand, 20 percent to Singapore, and the rest to countries like the UK, Japan, Malaysia, China, and the UAE. But recent Indian visa restrictions have created uncertainties for many, especially those requiring treatment for cancer, cardiopathy, nephropathy, or infertility. Against this backdrop, the government's plan to establish eight cancer hospitals and dialysis centres, each with 100 beds, across the country within the next 6-12 months is a welcome move indeed.\nHowever, outbound medical tourism is primarily driven by gaps in local healthcare, including shortages of facilities, equipment, and skilled staff. For example, the 750-bed \"super-specialised\" hospital of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University's (BSMMU) is still operating at only 10 percent capacity two years after its inauguration mainly due to a manpower crisis. While health ministry officials assure us that it will soon be fully operational, similar mistakes must be avoided for new projects. Plans to introduce double shifts at government hospitals to ease patient pressure, and asking private hospitals to operate on a non-profit basis for at least six months, are also positive steps.\n\nBeyond these ad hoc measures, broader reforms to the healthcare sector are also essential. Patients are often driven abroad due to the nexus between doctors and diagnostic centres or pharmaceutical companies, high costs of medicine and tests, lack of trust in local care, etc. Moreover, improving the behaviour of medical professionals, including by dedicating more time to patients, is crucial.\nIncreasing the capacity of the Mohammadpur Fertility Services and Training Centre (MFSTC) is another commendable initiative. Meanwhile, amendments to the organ transplant law to expand the donor pool must be done responsibly, ensuring safeguards against exploitation by organ traders.

Patients are often driven abroad due to the nexus between doctors and diagnostic centres or pharmaceutical companies, high costs of medicine and tests, lack of trust in local care, etc. Moreover, improving the behaviour of medical professionals, including by dedicating more time to patients, is crucial.\nOur healthcare industry must prioritise service over profit. Alongside government efforts, medical professionals and industry leaders must work collaboratively to build a system that inspires trust and addresses patient needs effectively.\n",
