In the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, the Mahayuti, the tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Ajit Pawar, are visible to all. The setback the coalition faced in the 2024 general election might have been the immediate trigger for the open display of discord in the alliance. But for the BJP, the leading partner in the alliance, this could not have come at a more inopportune time. Assembly elections are to be announced in the State soon. While the Mahayuti is caught in internal strife, the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) \u2014 of the Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray, the NCP led by Sharad Pawar and the Congress \u2014 has managed to put its house in order. A flagship scheme that the ruling alliance unveiled recently in the hope of recovering some lost political ground is itself cause for strife among partners as each one of them calls it by a different name. Mr. Shinde uses the full name \u2018Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana\u2019, while the BJP calls it the \u2018Ladki Bahin Yojana\u2019. Ajit Pawar, who introduced the scheme during the Budget session in June, refers to it as the \u2018Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana\u2019. The recent incident where a statue of Shivaji Maharaj collapsed in the Rajkot Fort in Sindhudurg district has further embarrassed the coalition. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had unveiled the statue last year. Mr. Modi has apologised to the public for the collapse of the statue but that has not laid the matter to rest. The MVA is determined to milk the issue, and on Sunday, organised a protest. Shivaji Maharaj, a Maratha king, holds immense significance for the Maratha community, to which Ajit Pawar and his uncle and patriarch of the State\u2019s politics, Sharad Pawar, belong.Ajit Pawar was the first to offer an unconditional apology for the statue\u2019s collapse. Both the BJP and the Sena have had a long tussle with the NCP, and Ajit Pawar personally, before becoming political partners. A Sena Minister recently said that sitting in close proximity to NCP members in cabinet meetings made him feel nauseous. Many in the BJP blame the Ajit Pawar group for the debacle in the Lok Sabha election. Ajit Pawar also appears unsure of his association with the BJP and the Sena. He surprised his alliance partners by admitting that fielding his wife Sunetra against his cousin Supriya Sule in the general election was a mistake. He also said that he had asked the BJP not to target Sharad Pawar and felt that Mr. Modi\u2019s remark calling Mr. Pawar a \u2018Bhatakti Atma\u2019, or an aimless soul, while on the campaign trail in the run-up to the general election did not appeal to the people. Clearly, he has not burnt his bridges with the larger Pawar family. The underlying rivalries are beginning to hurt the Mahayuti.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nMaharashtra\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nShiv Sena\n\n/\n\nNationalist Congress Party\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nAssembly Elections\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nbudgets and budgeting\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi",

But over the last two decades, wherein Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have been the hegemonic forces, such bursts of surprise have been few and rare. Seen in this context, the exits of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic \u2014 against Botic van de Zandschulp and Alexei Popyrin, respectively \u2014 in a 24-hour span from the ongoing US Open appear seismic. Alcaraz is the World No.3, a four-time Major champion and a bona fide title-contender wherever he plays. Djokovic is the World No.2, the defending champion and winner of a men\u2019s record 24 Slams. The reverses could well be attributed to the draining summers, physically and emotionally, Alcaraz and Djokovic experienced. The 21-year-old Spaniard won the French Open-Wimbledon double \u2014 among the hardest feats in all sport \u2014 and fought Djokovic tooth and nail in the Paris Olympics final before settling for the silver medal. Djokovic underwent a knee surgery in early June but made the Wimbledon final in less than six weeks after that before clinching the elusive singles gold medal in Paris, the one prize that was missing from his glittering cabinet.In a larger sense, however, it is Djokovic\u2019s third-round loss that can upend world tennis. Not since the 2017 Australian Open, when he lost in the second round to Denis Istomin, has the Serb gone out of a Major this early. It also means 2024 will join 2017 as the only two seasons since 2010 that have not seen him lift a Major. The failure is a telltale sign that Djokovic, at 37, will no longer be at the top of the totem pole. In fact, 2024 will be the first since 2002 without a Slam winner from among Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. World No.1 Jannik Sinner now has a golden opportunity to firmly establish the new order by adding the US Open to his 2024 Australian Open crown. The Italian entered New York under a cloud, with the revelation that despite testing positive for a prohibited substance twice in March, he was cleared of any wrongdoing. The 23-year-old wobbled in the first round but has since looked serene. Sinner is drawn to meet the 2021 titlist Daniil Medvedev in the last eight, a tough nut to crack despite having beaten the Russian the last five times on hard courts. But as the legendary Billie Jean King once said, \u201cpressure is a privilege, and champions adjust\u201d.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nUS Open\n\n/\n\ntennis\n\n/\n\nAustralia\n\n/\n\nFrance\n\n/\n\nWimbledon",

First, there were reports of attacks on minorities and their properties. This led to head of interim govt Muhammad Yunus visiting the iconic Dhakeshwari temple and assuring that Hindus would be given equal protection. But some actions of the interim govt since have again raised questions over the safety of minorities, secular individuals and journalists.\nRevenge attacks on Press?: There have been growing concerns that Dhaka\u2019s new dispensation and its supporters are targeting journalists seen to be close to the erstwhile Hasina govt. A journalist with a pro-Hasina media organisation was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Two others were arrested while trying to leave the country. These actions mirror the policies of the Hasina govt towards so-called unfriendly Press. In fact, Reporters Without Borders has raised concerns over 25 journalists being recently charged with crimes against humanity, hinting at a witch hunt.\nRelease of Islamist radicals: Plus, the interim govt has released extremists with links to terror groups. This includes Jashimuddin Rahmani, chief of Ansarullah Bangla Team, an organisation that has links with Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. In fact, the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh too has been reversed. These are all elements that were against Bangladesh\u2019s liberation struggle and subsequently eroded away Bangladesh\u2019s secular moorings. Their release now raises fears for Bangladeshi minorities and intellectuals.\nSecurity dilemma: The last thing one needs is for Bangladesh to emerge as a hub of Islamist extremism. This is not only a problem for that country but also a serious concern for India. Hasina had indeed become an autocrat. But she kept extremism under check and did not allow anti-India forces free rein. A reversal now also undermines the fight for rights and justice that the new Dhaka dispensation is supposedly championing. Yunus failing to halt the radicals will only prove him a puppet.\n\n",

Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on:\n\nAttacks on Minorities: There have been reports of people attacking religious minorities and their property. The leader of the temporary government, Muhammad Yunus, visited an important Hindu temple and promised to protect Hindus equally. But since then, there have been more worries about whether minorities, people who support a secular government, and journalists are safe.\nProblems for Journalists: Some people are worried that the new government and its supporters are going after journalists who were friendly with the previous government. One journalist was found dead under strange circumstances, and two others were arrested while trying to leave the country. There are concerns that this might be a way to silence people who criticize the government. An organization called Reporters Without Borders is worried about over 25 journalists being charged with serious crimes, suggesting that this might be a witch hunt.\nRelease of Extremists: The temporary government has let out people who have links to terrorist groups. This includes Jashimuddin Rahmani, who leads a group connected to Al-Qaeda. They\u2019ve also reversed a ban on a group called Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. These groups were against Bangladesh\u2019s fight for independence and went against the country\u2019s secular values. Their release has made people worried about the safety of minorities and intellectuals in Bangladesh.\nWorries for the Future: There\u2019s a big concern that Bangladesh might become a hotspot for extremist activities. This would be a serious problem not just for Bangladesh but also for neighboring India. Even though the previous leader, Hasina, was seen as a dictator, she managed to keep extremism in check and didn\u2019t let anti-India groups have too much power. If the new government doesn\u2019t handle extremists properly, it could make it look like Yunus is just a puppet and not really working for justice and rights.\n\n\n",

BJP high command has yet to rein him in. But the allies have started speaking out. JDU and LJP have criticised the decision to discontinue the state-assembly\u2019s 2-hour break for Muslim MLAs to offer namaz on Fridays. Both parties\u2019 spokespersons have correctly pointed out that if a fair standard was used, then the stated goal of increasing legislative productivity would see certain Hindu practices also being axed.\nPRS analysis shows that in 2023 the Assam assembly sat for 19 days, most of these taken by the budget session. Not only was this below the national average of 22, it compares terribly to top-scoring Maharashtra\u2019s 41 days, Bengal\u2019s 40 and Karnataka\u2019s 39. The obvious solution for increasing assembly productivity is to increase its sittings.\nFurther, AIUDF adds that the reason the Friday practice dating back to pre-Independence Assam still makes sense is that the state has a substantial number of Muslim MLAs. The Assam decision recalls efforts to prevent jumma namaz in public spaces in Gurgaon, which totally ignored how India spills over into the streets for all its religious occasions, including Chhath, Muharram, Palm Sunday and Durga Puja. Such double standards are extremely dangerous politics, even more so in a state whose ethnic and linguistic fault-lines are daily threatening an eruption.\nHimanta Biswa Sarma also recently went to the extent of asking a journalist\u2019s religious identity, in response to a question about hill-cutting in the state. In response to the rape of a minor, he told the assembly he would \u201ctake sides\u201d and stop \u201cMiya Muslims\u201d from taking over Assam. Even if central BJP leadership is wary of hauling him up publicly, it must bring him to order. Whether it is shifting responsibility of a crime from an individual to an entire group or collapsing the work of the press into a person\u2019s religion, Sarma has regularly been at odds with his oath of office to \u201cdo right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law without fear or favour, affection or ill-will\u201d. Instead of strengthening public order, he is likely undermining it. Even when inflammatory statements and partisan policies have an electoral justification, they are\u00a0 morally unjustifiable. But in light of the Lok Sabha results, there\u2019s nothing even \u2018smart\u2019 about Sarma\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n",

The big leaders in his party haven\u2019t stepped in to stop him yet, but some of his partners in government are starting to speak up.\nThe JDU and LJP parties are upset because the Assam government has canceled the 2-hour break that Muslim lawmakers used to get on Fridays to pray. They think that if the goal is to make the assembly work better, they should also look at other religious practices and not just target one group.\nA study showed that in 2023, the Assam assembly met for only 19 days, which is less than the national average of 22 days. Other states like Maharashtra, Bengal, and Karnataka had many more meeting days. If they want the assembly to work better, they should have more meetings.\nThe AIUDF party says that keeping the Friday prayer break makes sense because Assam has many Muslim lawmakers. They compare it to other places in India where religious events spill out into public spaces, like Chhath, Muharram, Palm Sunday, and Durga Puja. They believe that treating different religions unfairly is dangerous, especially in a state with so many ethnic and language differences.\nRecently, the Chief Minister even asked a journalist about their religion and said he would take sides to stop a certain group from taking over Assam. This is against his promise to treat everyone fairly according to the law. His actions and statements are not only unhelpful but also harmful to the peace and order of the state.

        "full_article": "On November 29, 1957, the Bengali-language newspaper Jugantor carried an advertisement placed by the management of Metro Goldwyn Mayer's (MGM) Metro Film Hall of Kolkata. The advertisement featured a picture of serpentine queues of spectators surrounding the portico of the hall. The building is shown tilting at an angle as if unable to withstand the weight of the spectators. The rest of the advertisement displays a signed telegram from the Metro Company, expressing delight at the huge success of Chandranath, starring Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar. This was possibly the first Bengali-language film to be released at Metro, a theatre that had previously only exhibited English-language films. The telegram read: \"Heartiest congratulations. Never have we seen such a huge rush at the box office.\"\n\nPerhaps the reason they took the Bengali film industry by storm in the 1950s is due to their onscreen chemistry, their excellent choice of literary stories with strong plots and characterisations, and the cohesive use of cinematography to create dreamscapes of love, intimacy, and desire\u2014sometimes even tragic, doomed love.\nOn March 22, 2024, another film, Oti Uttam, was released in Kolkata. This film uses AI-generated images of footage from the Bengali matinee idol Uttam Kumar's films, and his dialogues from his romantic hits are interpolated into a contemporary love story. Kumar is depicted in his films and appears as a 'love guru,' dispensing advice to the young protagonist pursuing his love interest in the new film.\nBoth these events point to the unprecedented iconic popularity of Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar, two stars who became superstars in the 1950s and beyond. The period from 1957 to 2024 marks a long journey showcasing the enduring appeal of these stars of the Bengali film industry in Kolkata.\nThey stormed the industry in the mid-1950s (though both had started their careers in the late 1940s with major flops) and dominated their field until 1978 and 1980, respectively (Suchitra Sen retired in 1978, and Uttam Kumar passed away in 1980). Yet, the end of their careers has not led to their disappearance from the cinematic firmament of the Bengali public's imagination. Their romantic and individual star personas continue to appear across multiple media platforms: films, fiction, television serials, cover albums, commemorative events, posthumous awards, and nostalgic retrospectives.\nWhat is the allure of these two stars that refuses to fade? Is it that they acted in extremely popular romantic melodramas? Or is it their screen presence and charisma that captivated Bengali audiences, leading to their romantic couple films becoming hits and superhits? They acted in 30 films opposite each other from 1954 to 1978, with 22 of those being love stories in the 1950s alone. Described in superlative terms as the ultimate screen lovers, the 'golden pair' of Bengali cinema, their stardom parallels that of the Raj Kapoor and Nargis pairing in Hindi cinema of the same period. However, what sets them apart is their enduring popularity in the public imagination decades after their heyday.\nPerhaps the reason they took the Bengali film industry by storm in the 1950s is due to their onscreen chemistry, their excellent choice of literary stories with strong plots and characterisations, and the cohesive use of cinematography to create dreamscapes of love, intimacy, and desire\u2014sometimes even tragic, doomed love. The black-and-white magic of these good-looking, fresh young stars on screen carried the spectators along, weaving the enchantment of their love stories.\nThese love films often focused on depicting urban modern experiences where the lovers met during their professional or educational pursuits in the city and fell in love. The portrayal of this love frequently involved scenes of close intimacy without the presence of family elders or authority figures. Alternatively, their love would transgress some societal or familial tradition, requiring them to overcome such proscription or prohibition. They were cast as doctors, engineers, architects, singers, teachers, etc., where their bhadralok/bhadramahila avatars were showcased with unfailing regularity, which helped popularise these films. Most of these films were based on stories penned by notable writers such as Banaphool, Ashapurna Devi, Tarashankar Bandopadhyaya, Ashutosh Mukherjee, Prabhavati Devi Saraswati, and Nirupama Devi, among others. There were also a few films starring Sen and Kumar with other stars from the canonical triumvirate\u2014Saratchandra, Rabindranath Thakur, and Bankim Chandra.\nThe romance plots in these films were not without social context and often raised significant questions about the pressing issues of their times: love marriages, love across caste and religious barriers, marital conflicts, social issues like job hunting and unemployment, crumbling civic infrastructures, or wartime scarcities (World War II as well as the India-China war of 1962 were very much a part of the historical and social consciousness of the period). It is not far-fetched to suggest that, in the post-independence period of the 1950s, these romantic and modern love stories symbolised the exhilaration and exuberance of freedom and the possibility of charting an individual's journey to achieving personal and emotional fulfilment, challenging conservative traditional values while retaining cultural roots.\nOne can easily cite films such as Shaap Mochon, Sagarika, Chaowa Paowa, Harano Sur, Saptapadi, Suryotoran, Agni Pariksha, Chandranath, Kamallata, Grihodaho, and Rajlaxmi O Srikanto, to name just a few of their hit films that created an iconic aura of romance, which helped Sen and Kumar take on the mantle of superstars of their time. It is worth mentioning that these films were released in single-screen cinemas, usually as part of a chain release across three screens in Kolkata. Most of the films starring the duo had long exhibition runs, aiding their box-office success, with runs spanning from 13 to 24 weeks from the release date! Predictably, their love films ensured the duo's huge commercial success.\nYet, it is interesting to note that despite the resounding box-office success of their romantic films, both Sen and Kumar were routinely criticised for their repeated appearances in 'hackneyed romantic films' and for the display of charged erotic intimacy on screen in their portrayal of modern love stories. The tremendous popular appeal at the box office came with a heavy note of censure and critical disdain, creating a kind of negative space that Sen and Kumar had to navigate in the early phase of their careers in the 1950s. This moral tone of disdain is evident in the film journalism, reviews, and magazines of the time.\nOne must remember that the staple of popular film culture was invested in melodramas, which were considered a maligned object of derision because they showcased excessive emotionalism, used stereotypical characters, and were seen as non-realistic in their expression. Most of the critical templates and film evaluation criteria favoured 'realism' as the preferred mode of representation, as it was supposedly able to offer viewers a 'real slice of life,' while melodramas were panned for being 'unrealistic,' repetitive, and overly sentimental.\nMoreover, the onscreen depiction of love scenes, romantic and sensuous songs picturised on the duo, and the unbridled display of Sen's glamorous and photogenic beauty, coupled with Kumar's handsome and charismatic screen presence, were criticised for corrupting young minds and audience tastes and were considered to be against genteel good taste\u2014not appropriate for the bhadralok. However, fans and spectators were clearly not bothered by what the critics were saying and continued to flock to the film halls in droves, bringing both money and popular fame in equal measure.\nThis star story and its huge popular appeal were not limited to just their films together; both Sen and Kumar were equally successful opposite other stars and actors. Their films not only performed well at the box office but also received numerous film awards. Suchitra Sen was known for her strong, author-backed roles in films such as Dweep Jele Jai, Uttar Phalguni, Saat Paake Bandha, Hospital, Smriti Tuku Thak, Sandhya Deeper Pradip, Boloygrash, Devi Chaudhurani, and even in Hindi films such as Devdas, Bumbai Ka Babu, Mamta, and Aandhi, among others.\nUttam Kumar's acting in Satyajit Ray's Nayak and Chiriakhana, as well as Tapan Sinha's Zhinder Bondi, Khudito Pashan, Jotugriho, Chowringee, Antony Firingee, Nishi Padma, Anando Ashram, and Nabaraag, along with his stellar performances in character roles (where he was not the protagonist) such as in Prithibi Amare Chaye, Jadu Bangsha, and Nagar Darpane, are some examples that demonstrate his eminently successful career trajectory. Unlike Sen, however, Kumar had a mixed reception in Bombay cinema. He remade his Bengali superhit Agnipariksha as Choti Si Mulaqat in Hindi with Vyajanthimala, but it was a big flop. Nevertheless, his roles in Anand Ashram, Desh Premi, and Amanush garnered him much appreciation and acclaim.\nUttam Kumar is known to have acted in 202 released films, while Suchitra Sen had 60 films to her credit. Both were recipients of national as well as international film awards. Sen was chosen as the Best Actress at the 1963 Moscow International Film Festival for her role as an estranged wife in Saat Paake Bandha opposite Soumitra Chatterjee. Uttam Kumar received awards and accolades for Satyajit Ray's Nayak, both at home and at the Berlin Film Festival. Their films also received many Filmfare Awards and BFJA Awards. (Filmfare Awards were instituted by the Times of India newspaper group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards were established. BFJA, the Bengal Film Journalists' Association, was founded in 1937 and has since been renamed the West Bengal Film Journalists' Association.)\nSen had gone into a self-imposed reclusive life after she retired from the industry in 1978, rarely appearing in public. The erstwhile mahanayika (a moniker she had earned after her Moscow award) eventually came to be known as Tollywood's Greta Garbo. Even in her seclusion, she continued to fuel public interest and curiosity about her life and circumstances, yet managed to retain her aura of isolation and her refusal to be seen. Her control over her public image was so strong that even after her death in 2014, her body was not shown to the public but was carried in a closed casket for cremation. She had received the Padma Shri in 1972 but refused the Dadasaheb Phalke Award as she did not want to appear in person to receive it, although the Banga Bibhushan Award (instituted by the West Bengal government) was handed over to her daughter, actor Moon Moon Sen, in 2012.\nKumar's sudden death in 1980 plunged the industry into a state of gloom and despair. By the 1970s, he had transformed from being the mahanayak into the 'guru,' the figurehead or 'dada,' the elder brother figure who could carry the burden of ensuring good box-office collections despite his ill health and the declining industry standards due to the social and political turmoil in the state. The terrible lock-outs, grain shortages, Naxalite movement, and its brutal suppression by the state had impacted the film industry just as much as they did other sectors of the economy. It almost became Uttam Kumar's sole responsibility to deliver hits as the bankable matinee idol. His untimely death dealt a huge blow to the film industry, from which it took time to recover.\n\nIn the post-independence period of the 1950s, these romantic and modern love stories symbolised the exhilaration and exuberance of freedom and the possibility of charting an individual's journey to achieving personal and emotional fulfilment, challenging conservative traditional values while retaining cultural roots.\nHowever, both Sen and Kumar continue to appear and reappear in contemporary times and still manage to draw substantial attention despite their absence. The internet remains abuzz with the circulation of their film and publicity stills, new fan sites, documentaries, and reportage about them. Television serials, such as Mahanayak, capitalise on the gossip and rumours about their troubled personal lives; contemporary film stars such as Mithun Chakraborty, Prosenjit, and Jishu pay tribute to Kumar by modelling their acting style on his or portraying him on screen (Shukno Lanka, Autograph, and Mahalaya). Novellas, such as Suchitra Sen: Uttoron O Antaraal, fictionalise the rumoured love story between these two romantic icons, and there exists a veritable industry of unauthorised biographies about them. Kumar wrote a serialised autobiography in Nabakallol, which was later posthumously published as Amar Ami (1980), while Sen assiduously refused to write or commission one, claiming that her life story would have to reveal many unpalatable facts about several well-known figures. Despite this, there are some ten or more biographies about her published by film journalists, while Kumar also has numerous books, as well as dedicated special issues brought out by reputed film societies of Kolkata. The enchantment of this duo continues to haunt the public imagination long after its constitutive moment and continues to weave its magic on the Bengali cinematic firmament even today.\nSmita Banerjee is a Professor at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce, University of Delhi.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are worried about the outbreak of waterborne diseases, particularly diarrhoea, in the flood-hit communities. The situation is said to be especially alarming in the worst-hit areas like Feni, Noakhali, and surrounding districts, where floodwaters are receding much slower than expected, thus increasing the risks of diseases. Although the authorities have correctly identified the crisis of safe drinking water as a key problem, measures taken so far are proving to be inadequate. This underscores the need for further expanding ongoing efforts to both address the crisis of safe water and treat diseases emanating from the lack thereof.\nA major challenge at the moment is the struggle of hospitals and health complexes that remain ill-equipped to handle the influx of patients. For example, Feni's Sonagazi Upazila Health Complex has 50 beds but is having to treat nearly double its capacity, with patients reported to be lying on the floors, staircases, and balconies. The Chhagalnaiya Upazila Health Complex, which has the same number of beds, had 126 patients on Saturday. The Feni General Hospital's diarrhoea ward, which has 18 beds, was accommodating eight times its capacity. Similarly, at the Noakhali General Hospital, a diarrhoea ward meant for 16 patients was treating 280. The two districts together contributed at least 32 in the overall flood death toll of 59.\nThe overflowing of patients has been ascribed to the submersion of tubewells during the flood\u2014which contaminated the water source and caused waterborne diseases to spread\u2014but also to the flooding of many community clinics, upazila health complexes, and even district hospitals, which multiplied the pressure on the remaining facilities. The result is that thousands have been left without access to basic medical care at a time when it was most needed. The government has tried to respond to the crisis by deploying 619 medical teams across the 11 flood-hit districts. But considering the scale of the disaster, there is clearly a need to increase the number of such teams, and ensure that they reach remote and worst-hit areas, as patients cannot be expected to travel long distances because of the communication disruptions caused by the flood.\nGoing forward, the government also must restore and strengthen the health infrastructure in affected regions. Reopening all community clinics, which are often the only source of healthcare for rural populations, is particularly important, as is ensuring the availability of safe water. The current crisis has once again laid bare the pitfalls of our disaster management systems. Bangladesh is no stranger to such calamities, yet the recurring issues of overwhelmed health facilities and lack of clean water after any major flood suggest that much needs to be improved. It is crucial to invest in building a more resilient health system that can respond effectively to such emergencies.\n",

        "full_article": "The interim government's Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus's address to the nation on August 25 resonated deeply with the public, striking a chord of authenticity, humility, and aspiration. Social media has been abuzz with comments such as\u00a0\"Dr Yunus's vision for a new Bangladesh gives me hope\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"We needed this kind of leadership years ago.\" His speech was remarkable not only for what it said, but for how it was delivered\u2014free of arrogance, malice or personal gratification. Instead, it was a call to action, focusing on the urgent need for national unity and the commitment to building a new, democratic, and inclusive Bangladesh.\nDr Yunus emphasised the interim government's dedication to restoring democracy, combating corruption, and overhauling key sectors such as the judiciary, banking, and education. He called on all political parties to support these efforts, urging a consensus-driven approach to rebuild the nation on a foundation that truly serves the public interest. His vision for a new Bangladesh is one where the sacrifices made during the recent uprising translate into a just and democratic society.\nA significant part of his speech was his focus on transparency, particularly the declaration of assets by government advisers and the prioritisation of eradicating bribery and rampant corruption. His metaphor of the nation as a family, though powerful, also drew mixed reactions, with some concerned that it might oversimplify the complexities of governance.\nWhile the speech hit the right notes on many fronts, it also left some wanting more. Critics have pointed out that, while Dr Yunus's vision is inspiring, the real challenge lies in its implementation. Comments like,\u00a0\"Talk is cheap\u2014let's see some action,\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Can he really clean up the mess left by 15 years of misrule?\"\u00a0reflect the scepticism that still lingers.\nThe \"country as a family\" metaphor, while evocative, may not fully capture the diverse realities and challenges facing the nation. Unity is essential, but it must also respect and embrace diversity. Citizens are not just looking for unity; they want a sense of autonomy and inclusivity within the broader national framework.\nMoreover, there was an expectation for Dr Yunus to delve into the specifics of how the interim government would introduce substantive reforms. While procedural changes are necessary, the public is eager to see fundamental structural shifts that address the deep-rooted issues in Bangladesh's governance. Whether this requires constitutional amendments or a complete overhaul was a question left unanswered.\nDr Yunus's humility in admitting the challenges ahead was appreciated. He acknowledged that enacting these changes will not be easy and that mistakes will likely be made along the way. However, he also asked for time and patience, promising transparency and a commitment to course correction as needed. This approach aligns with a broader understanding that nation-building is a complex, adaptive journey.\nThe interim government's swift leadership change at the home ministry and the formation of an economic panel to draft a white paper are pragmatic steps towards addressing immediate challenges. However, citizens demand more than procedural justice\u2014they seek genuine institutional reforms that will lay the foundation for a new Bangladesh. To build and sustain public trust, the government must prioritise meaningful reforms over superficial actions, avoiding the appearance of arbitrary decisions in recent high-profile arrest cases.\nA promising start has been made with the appointment of a student leader as a special assistant to the chief adviser, signalling openness to fresh ideas and perspectives. However, the specifics of the structural changes needed for Bangladesh 2.0 remain unclear. The interim government must continue this dialogue, engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders to ensure that the reforms are not merely cosmetic, but truly transformative.\nThis is a crucial moment for Bangladesh. The vision of a new, inclusive, and just society is within reach, but it demands collective effort and a clear path forward. As Dr Yunus aptly said, the journey has just begun. The interim government must now focus on earning the trust and engagement needed to navigate this path.\nCitizens aren't looking for quick fixes; they want a sustainable, principled approach that respects the complexity of the task. Using the journey metaphor, building the nation from Tetulia to Teknaf isn't about instant results, but about starting with a strong foundation of principles and pragmatism. It's encouraging to see conversations already underway on how to align people's will with the ideological vision and a strategic thinking for a new Bangladesh\u2014one rooted in autonomy, equity, dignity, and fairness.\nDr Yunus's speech was a strong start, but the real test lies in how the interim government turns this vision into reality. The people of Bangladesh are hopeful and ready to contribute to building Bangladesh 2.0. The road ahead is tough, but with the right actions, it's a journey worth taking. Now, the interim government needs to prove it can deliver on its promises.\nShafiqul Islam\u00a0is director of Water Diplomacy, professor of civil and environmental engineering and water diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, US.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Threat to security of factories and industries continues to dominate the minds of the business community dampening its enthusiasm to carry forward trade, investment and overall business activities. Although the law and order situation has improved somewhat compared to the peak of recent political upheaval, it remains fragile, unpredictable and foreboding. This instability together with flash floods, high inflation and extortion, has created a hostile business environment. Businesses across various sectors are grappling with declining sales and reduced demand. The construction industry, a major driver of the economy, has been particularly hard hit. Manufacturers are operating at reduced capacity, in order to avoid stockpiles of unsold goods.The inflationary pressure that reached a 13-year high in July has particularly exacerbated the situation. Consumers are also tightening their belts. Amid all this, the prolonged security concerns are like adding salt to the wound. Not only does this jeopardise domestic industries and trade, but also deters foreign investors, sending a negative message to the global market. Of late, the leaders of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Bangladesh met finance and commerce adviser Salehuddin Ahmed and urged the government to take swift and decisive measures to enhance industrial security and curb extortion. They said foreign buyers and investors are greatly concerned about the current law and order situation and it needs to be urgently improved.Following the meeting, the adviser assured the business leaders of the government's commitment to ensure law and order and financial security. He said that the government would take necessary steps to protect factories and create a conducive environment for businesses to operate smoothly without fear. However, there have been at least two incidents of industrial fires, one at Gazi Tires factory in Narayanganj and the other at Pran Industrial Park in Narshingdi. The incident at Gazi Tires, a factory owned by former minister Golam Dastgir Gazi, was particularly demoralising. Following news of Gazi's arrest, hundreds of people stormed the factory, looted factory goods, and then set it on fire. The overall physical damage is estimated to be Tk1.5 billion, but the loss does not stop there. Its 4,000 workers dependent on their pay packages to feed and support their families are now unemployed and face an uncertain future.The incident at Rupganj is far from being an isolated case. Similar attacks, looting, extortion, and intimidation have affected numerous other businesses. These incidents pose a significant threat to the country's industries, trade, and the livelihoods of countless millions. The impact of these incidents is proving highly unfriendly to businesses already struggling to maintain their tenuous footing in an increasingly precarious environment. Despite the bleakness of the current situation, however, there is a glimmer of hope for economic recovery as the government undertakes a series of reform measures to get the economy back on track. Businesses, too, are cautiously optimistic that once law and order is restored, the economy will rebound and improve. But if factories are damaged or are completely demolished, how will reform measures alone suffice? The government must play a crucial role in obviating the threat posed to businesses and industries.",

        "full_article": "Though the Dr Yunus-led interim government is still in a nascent stage, yet expectations from it from the various disgruntled sections of administration and society seem to be unlimited. However, the methods being used to realise the demands are also the age-old tactics like blocking the traffic at sensitive city intersections or staging gheraos at the different administrative headquarters of the government. The supposedly aggrieved quarters holding such demonstrations are in most cases too aggressive to be calmed down by simple assurances. Some members of the paramilitary auxiliary force, the Bangladesh Ansar, for instance, held such a day-long gherao programme at the Bangladesh Secretariat on August 26. As some seven advisers of the interim government and other senior officials were prevented from leaving office till late in the evening, students from the university had to intervene and clear the way for the government officials to leave the secretariat. But the ansar put up a bloody fight with students before they were forced to leave the place. The armed forces were also called to flush out the troublemaking ansars. One wonders, why have the programmes to press home demands to be so bellicose and violent when the government in question is new and yet to put its house in order? Since the present government has come into existence to fill in the vacuum left by the previous government due to its sudden exit, is it not too early for those various aggrieved quarters to place their demands? This raises question about the sincerity of their cause and an apprehension if they have any secret agenda up their sleeve. Seeing that the executive branch of the previous government, except some minor reshufflings, is still intact, it won't be surprising if some in the administration who have not given up hope of a return to the old order might still try to destabilise the interim government. There is no reason to believe that such attempts at destabilising the interim government will stop shortly. However, handling of disturbances in most cases will require prompt mobilisation of the law-enforcement agencies. But the incident involving ansars has proved that the law-enforcement agency, the police to be specific, is not yet ready to respond to the law and order issues as and when they arise. Students cannot intervene in every such case. One cannot also expect that the armed forces, in every case of disturbance, big or small, will appear to restore order. Take the case of some ninth graders of the Barishal Government Technical School and College who reportedly ransacked the reception room of the Barishal Kotwali Model Police Station, broke glass and vehicle on the thana premises in the late afternoon of last Friday (August 30). The teenagers went violent as the police allegedly failed to resolve a dispute between them (enraged teens) and the members of their rival group. Another reason for those teenagers' anger, as reported, was that, the Kotwali Model Police Station police advised students to take the army's help to resolve their dispute. However innocuous, such incidents raise concern about the police's preparedness and ability in its present shape to maintain law and order at a time when the country is passing through one of its most critical phases in history. Why can't the police handle such minor problems themselves, but have to seek the military's support to resolve? Are they so scared that they cannot face even a small group of unruly teens? True, they have recently gone through a traumatic experience of mob violence against police across the country. But the disruptive time of extreme volatility is over. The hostile crowds have returned home. Gradually, things are settling down. In the changed circumstances, the interim government has given them (the police) the assurances they need to join work and, encouragingly enough, they have responded well to the interim government's call and have already joined their duties. So, what is holding them back from doing their duties wholeheartedly? The adviser of the interim government for home affairs needs to address the issue seriously towards boosting the morale of the police force. This is urgent if the armed forces are to return to their barracks and the students to their studies. The police must be adequately equipped to deal with normal law and order issues as well as any act of sabotage by forces of destabilisation. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the military's intervention should be sought. Commendably, the interim government has meanwhile taken up a number of challenges including restoring discipline in the financial sector. Also, it has, in a welcome move, signed the international convention on enforced disappearances. Some big guns of the previous government have meanwhile been held on charges of corruption and various misdeeds. It is expected that charges brought against them are based on adequate evidence to substantiate those. However, success of all these good gestures of the interim government will depend largely on its main strength, its stability. So, before everything else, the internal challenges to the nterim government's stability have to be dealt with in earnest. The key posts of the civil and military establishments should be replaced with people having unquestionable loyalty to Dr Yunus's interim government. Such replacements have to be made promptly, because the enemies within are still at work to create instability. Also, the government should be alert to any constitutional crisis. The chief adviser should consult experts on this issue and act swiftly to avert any contradictory clauses challenging the legitimacy of the interim government.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bliss it was in that dawn to be aliveBut to be young was very heaven\nNothing could be more appropriate for Bangladesh right at the moment than the famous couplet penned by William Wordsworth in his The Prelude. Living in this time is bliss because it opens the prospect of correcting the systemic wrongs for the nation's journey to its cherished goal. But why is it heaven to be young? It is because they have dared to be the torch-bearers of not only an adventure on the road to a dream destiny but also challenged the rest of society to become their co-travellers. First, they did it successfully by bringing down the government that represented the obsolete authoritarian system. Then, again they led from the front to take society at large along with themselves in mitigating the sufferings of the flood victims in the south-eastern areas of the country. The contrast between responses from either the deposed government or the people in general in the wake of cyclones Amphan or Remal and floods in Sylhet and those now witnessed is unmistakeable. Sure enough, the country's students or youths are the beacon of hope for the nation.However, is the nation or even a section of students ready to go all the way with the mainstream students who have been striving to cement the student-people bond in favour of a social transformation for the better? Certainly, there are forces within the ranks of both students and people who joined the mass movement ---and those apart from anti-social elements ---inimical to the causes the leaderships of students are fighting for. The 200 or so higher secondary examinees who stormed the secretariat to wrest the cancellation order from the newly installed government expose a glaring deviation. Then the numerous incidents of resignation by teachers under duress in several cases accompanied with humiliation and physical assaults are contrary to the spirit of the anti-discrimination movement.The other negative development is the non-compliance at the grassroots level of instructions issued by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) hierarchy. There are reports that immediately after the entrenched extortionist gangs of the deposed government left the scene, their places have been taken over by the counterparts from the BNP. Initially, students monitored some lucrative spots for extortion such as Karwan Bazar and the new batch of extortionists could be kept at bay. With the student vigilance gone on account of concentration to both study and collection of relief materials for the flood victims, the social parasites have staged a comeback. However, one particular incident involving such a takeover of Shimulia ferry ghat (jetty), fish jetty and trawler jetty inspires hope. More than a hundred BNP lower ranked leaders and followers, reports a contemporary, brought out a protest rally demanding expulsion of the president and general secretary of the BNP unit of Kumarbhog, Louhajang for their capture of the jetties and starting extortion from there and shops all around. Remarkably, the general secretary of the Krishak League of Louhajang Upazila took lease of the jetties from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) on payment of Tk 16,000,000 for the current fiscal year. In this case, the protest has come from within the party rank and file. This bodes well for all including the interim government because such social resistances make its job easier. There is no alternative to banishing extortionists from society. Not only do they hold hostage business and transports but also contribute to stoking inflation. Now is the time to bring an end to this anti-social culture once for all. The social parasites ---no matter which party they belong to ---must not be given any space if the purpose is to create a society free of discrimination. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
