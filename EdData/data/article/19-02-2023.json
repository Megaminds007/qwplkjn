In the 17 years since the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been implemented, studies have asserted its net positive impact in the rural areas. From reducing penury through providing off-season employment, and thereby improving household consumption among the invariably poor citizens who avail the scheme, to acting as insurance during monsoon deficient seasons, besides allowing for greater food security through increased productivity helped by the works generated, the scheme continues to be a robust welfare tool. This was even clearer during the pandemic, when thousands of migrant workers who left urban areas due to the lockdowns took up work under the MGNREGS in rural areas where demand for the menial but arduous work peaked. There is of course the case that the scheme has still not transcended into creating more useful assets beyond roads and irrigation canals and requires broadbasing and better implementation. But it must be said that the Union government\u2019s treatment of the scheme has graduated from a case of lukewarm acceptance of its need because of its popular impact to treating it as a fiscal burden.Such a reading can be justifiably made if the reduced allocation for the scheme in the Union Budget, from 2.14% of overall outlay in FY23 to 1.33% in FY24, is considered. This was despite implementation in recent years experiencing wage delays and underfunding. This has also depressed demand, with formal requests for work only being a portion of the actual demand. Also, there is much evidence that Aadhaar-based payments have neither reduced corruption nor reduced wage payment delays while creating hurdles for officials and workers during implementation. Union Rural Development Minister Giriraj Singh has now said that the Act should be amended to change the contribution of funds from 100% by the government to a 60-40 split between the Centre and the States in order to make States \u201cmore vigilant regarding corruption\u201d. But this will only lead to further complications in funding. There has been a shrinking in the States\u2019 share of taxes following GST and the financial stresses during the pandemic. States taking up 40% of the funding burden would affect the payment of wages even further. Besides, MGNREGS is a demand-driven programme and salient especially in poorer States and it is incumbent upon the Centre to ensure its robust funding instead of putting the onus on individual States to do so. The government must change its approach towards the MGNREGS by recognising its potential in catering to the poor\u2019s right to work.",

It is strange that a Member of Parliament, whose duty it is to hold the executive accountable to Parliament, is being accused of breach of privilege of the House for seeking answers on crucial issues. Portions of Mr. Gandhi\u2019s speech, made during a discussion on the \u2018Motion of Thanks on the President\u2019s Address\u2019, that referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ties with industrialist Gautam Adani were expunged from the record of the House. When a member\u2019s own rights are being curtailed in the name of parliamentary privilege, the very concept is being reduced to an instrument of executive fiat. Mr. Gandhi raised pertinent questions regarding the political patronage received by the Adani Group, which is in the eye of a storm after a short seller based in the United States brought to light dubious patterns in the group\u2019s transactions and ownership. The government has not provided any answers. And, on top of it, the sword of privilege is being wielded against the Opposition leader. The expectations from the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha are to protect the majesty of Parliament, particularly in its interactions with other branches of the state, rather than disciplining the members.The parliamentary discussions on the Adani controversy, which were vitiated by the unreasonable restrictions on Opposition leaders, follow a devious trend of executive imperium over the legislative branch in some States too. Chief Ministers of many States command supreme powers \u2014 they control their parties, dominate over the Opposition, and take Assemblies for granted. Assembly sittings have become fewer and debates shallow. The argument that popular leaders now make is that they are answerable to the people directly \u2014 Mr. Modi also invoked the \u2018blessing of 140 crore people,\u2019 while speaking in Parliament on February 8, but the range of questions arising out of the Hindenburg report on the Adani Group remained unanswered. People seek accountability from the elected government through their elected representatives, and the legislature is mandated to mediate that interaction. Mr. Gandhi asked questions as he should. Asking him to adhere to parliamentary norms in doing so is par for the course. But more critically, the government should be required to respond to the allegations. It is a sign of erosion of parliamentary authority that it is not happening.",

Look at the emotional response of the audience, usually dominated by Indian expatriates and persons of Indian origin, to any Indian cultural performance overseas. This group, which now numbers around 3.2 crore, is highly skilled and successful. In the US, for example, average income of Indian households is higher than that of any other group. In several countries, Indians are among the top earners. A 2012 estimate of the diaspora\u2019s wealth was $1 trillion. Ten years later, that figure would have increased substantially. If we add the collective economic heft of Indians abroad to India\u2019s GDP, which will be $ 3.5 trillion at the end of March, there\u2019s little doubt Indians in the most fundamental sense already generate an economic value well over $5 trillion. India as defined by its national boundaries will likely have a GDP of $5 trillion by 2025 but the India that includes those abroad and invested in the India story is already a $5 trillion-plus powerhouse.\nThis idea, introduced by Samir Jain, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, Times Group, in his special address at the ET Global Business Summit, has broad and significant implications. Just as any country\u2019s top income earners are pivotal to its economic progress \u2013 they invest, they innovate, they take risks, they back new technology, they create jobs \u2013 so can 3 crore plus Indians abroad be a huge asset for India. They already send $100 billion in remittances to their home country annually \u2013 the highest remittance figure in the world.\nIn business, network effects kick in when the value of a product is intrinsically tied to the increase in the number of users. Imagine the network effect of human beings \u2013 the network effect of high-earning, high-performing Indians abroad entirely invested in the idea of India\u2019s progress. PM Modi knows the immense value of the diaspora, Jain noted in his GBS address. But business leaders and policymakers, including those attending the summit, must think of many more ways of integrating the diaspora\u2019s economic dynamism to the India story.\n\u00a0\n\n",

It prohibits electioneering 48 hours ahead of polling.

This hard-won credibility rests on its track record of conducting complex multi-phase elections in the world\u2019s largest democracy.

More than a third of Rohingya refugee children are stunted and underweight. Starting next month, WFP is being compelled to reduce the value of its food assistance to USD 10 per person from USD 12.\u00a0\nWe agree with the two UN special rapporteurs who have said that this would have devastating consequences and that it is \"unconscionable\" to cut rations just before Ramadan.\nWe have been hearing about cuts in UN funding for Rohingya refugees for the last few years. In August 2022, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) appealed to the international community for help and cited the plight of the Rohingya refugees who are living in very difficult conditions and who have slim prospects of being rehabilitated to their home country. Only 49 percent of the USD 881 million in the 2022 response plan was given at the time.\nBangladesh has made huge sacrifices to host the refugees and is struggling with the economic, environmental, and social impacts of having such a mammoth refugee population in its land. The most sustainable solution would be the safe, dignified repatriation of Rohingya refugees, which would give them full citizenship rights. But the international community has failed to broker such a peaceful repatriation.\nGiven the reality of the Myanmar government's refusal to take back its people and the growing vulnerability of the Rohingya refugees in the camps, it is shocking that the UN is reconciled with cutting these essential humanitarian funds. Aid shortages will mean more malnutrition, more diseases, fewer health services, and increased insecurity as violence in the camps will escalate further. It will also increase the number of desperate, risky journeys made by Rohingyas towards foreign lands \u2013 which have often led to tragic deaths. Thus, an already desolate situation is about to get worse for these victims of genocide and forced displacement.\nWe join the voices of various agencies working on the ground in their alarm over this decision by the UN to cut aid. We understand the global pressures of food and general inflation due to the prolonged war in Ukraine. But this is a continuing humanitarian disaster created by Myanmar, one that has imposed a huge burden on Bangladesh \u2013 which itself has been impacted by the global economic crisis.

It is a direct threat to freedom of the press. The Indian government has argued that the sudden raids on the BBC's offices by the Indian tax authorities have no relationship with the news agency's airing of the documentary \u2013 but we in the media have become quite used to this phenomenon. Whenever the media publishes something that governments do not approve of, we see governments resorting to tactics of harassment \u2013 whether through legal, financial, or other threats. And these events are never coincidences.\nAny government may feel aggrieved by certain media coverage. And it may also be because the coverage was inaccurate, in which case the fault could lie with the media. But the right way to go about addressing this is through providing accurate counter information. If there were any flaws within the BBC's documentary, the correct way to expose those mistakes would have been for the Indian authorities to provide counter facts. Any government, when it is unsatisfied with a media content, has the right to challenge it by pointing out flaws and factual errors. However, to use the might of the state machinery to harass the media should never be acceptable in any democratic society. Moreover, such pressure \u2013 whether it be legal, financial, or otherwise \u2013 never works to achieve the end goal.\nUltimately, the media's job is to inform the public. And the public never sees suppression of the media in a positive light. Whenever a state machinery harasses the media right after it has revealed information that the government feels apprehensive of, the people never see it as being a coincidence. Rather, it only further corrodes the state's credibility in the eyes of the public.\nRights groups around the world have already expressed their concerns about the deterioration of press freedom in India. And this latest incident only brings it under more global spotlight for the wrong reasons. Therefore, we agree with the statement of the Indian Press Club that, \"Such an action against an international broadcasting network will damage the reputation and image of India as the largest democracy.\" As such, we hope the Indian government will restrain its agencies from misusing their powers to intimidate the media.\nUnfortunately, the misuse of state power to harass the media has been increasing all around the world, including in our country. It is something that should concern all those who believe in the values of a democratic society. We hope the Indian government, as well as all other governments around the world, realise how counterproductive such actions are, and refrain from any such intimidation tactics. Instead, governments should engage more with the media in the realm of information, and look to provide counter evidence when it believes certain coverage by the media has not been accurate.\n",

        "full_article": "Of late, I have been to both the Jammu region and the Kashmir valley, asking questions. On the surface, the Union government's claim of normalcy having been restored is borne out by booming tourism, the numerous full airlines flying in and out of Srinagar, the overfull hotels, the streets straining under the load of traffic, and the educational institutions humming with activity. The population moves around fairly freely. The spectacle of heavily armed cops at every corner is sensibly reduced.\nBut just below the epidermis, Jammu and Kashmir simmers. All it takes for the resentment and anger to surface is a mild question or two.\nThe fundamental rift between Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha's perception of \"normalcy\" and the people's view is that, while Kashmir may have been captured, the Kashmiris have been alienated. There is profound resentment at the robbing of the people's dignity, the pervasive sense of having been humiliated, the denial of democracy and human rights, and solutions being thrust on them without consultation \u2013 whether it is larger questions concerning Articles 370 and 35A, or quotidian matters like the expropriation of land for large highway-building projects, or apple movements being severely restricted while Adani-branded Himachal apples capture the market.\nAbove all, the psychological distancing is a reaction to the Union government's unsubtle attempts at diluting the specific, separate identity of Kashmiris that was critical to the compact of J&K accepting Indian citizenship on the strict condition that, to preserve their identity, they would be encouraged to exercise as much autonomy as possible.\nThat is the basis of Article 370, elaborated in the Delhi Agreement of 1952 under which the opening article in the J&K constitution proclaims the region as an integral part of the Indian Union, while subsequent articles left J&K far freer than other states with respect to exercising political and administrative authority. Indeed, Article 370 spawned the subsequent Article 371 which ensured special provisions for the governance of at least 11 other states, including \u2013 interestingly \u2013 Gujarat.\nIt is precisely because their distinct identity is so crucial to the Kashmiris that Atal Behari's invocation of \"Kashmiriyat\" has had so much resonance in Kashmiri hearts. The principal objective of the reading down of Article 370 has been the shifting of identity from \"Kashmiri\" to \"Indian.\"\nTo a Kashmiri, accepting the \"Indian\" label depends entirely on the Kashmiri identity being valorised. I understand this as a Tamilian \u2013 for my home state has abandoned its secessionism only on the clear understanding that the Tamil can privilege their Tamil identity in exchange for accepting Indian citizenship. The same holds for India's northeast hill states \u2013 which is why Article 371 is so important to them. There is thus nothing unique to J&K's insistence on identity as the fulcrum of their willingness to be Indian. This is insufficiently understood in the Hindi-Hindutva heartland from which Modi derives his authoritarian power and insensitivity to the sentiments of the periphery.\nIn J&K, this insensitivity has had the serious and deleterious consequence of pro-Pakistan sentiment spreading even among schoolchildren, as affirmed to me by one young teacher from a prominent political family.\nThe saffron view of \"normalcy\" being measured by the absence of overt street agitations is ahistorical. Intifada in Kashmir is always as unpredictable as it is certain. We saw this in December 1989. We saw it again in June 2010. That explains how the sudden eruption in 2016 was not anticipated till the volcano erupted. Unless current trends at forcibly \"Indianising\" J&K are reversed, the region will continue to drift from us. It is admitted on all hands that Article 370 had been leached of much of its substance long before August 5, 2019; but the Article remains crucial to J&K's future, because it is their constitutional guarantee of Kashmiriyat determining their identity.\nThe other key consequence of Sinha's rule has been that large-scale disillusionment with BJP rule is not confined to the valley, but stretches to Jammu and even to Ladakh.\nIn Jammu, the rising dissatisfaction is centred on the Kashmiri Pandit, who had long been fed the illusion that all it would take to return to their homes in the valley would be for the BJP to take charge. Initially, they were delighted at being recruited in large numbers to government jobs. When they found the administration was inept at ensuring their security in posts in Kashmir, they fled with their families to Jammu. But while they believe they are entitled to their salaries while taking refuge in Jammu, Sinha's administration is adamant that they first return to their posts in Kashmir. Thus, they are faced with a stark choice between life and livelihood.\nMoreover, a locality in Jammu city, with the largest concentration of Muslims, is being targeted with the bulldozer of encroachment. At least 20,000 protesters are on the streets. But some of the most prominent politicians of J&K also have large homes in the area. They are not being targeted. It is such religion-based discrimination that causes deep discomfort in the union territory (UT) as a whole, for it denies the heterogeneity of religious belief that lies at the heart of Kashmiriyat.\nBut, above all, it is the adverse impact of the withdrawal of Article 35A that is far more serious in Jammu than in Kashmir.\nWhile outsiders are buying up land, securing jobs, and being voter-registered in the lakhs in Jammu, the impact is less in Kashmir where there is little outside investor interest visible on the ground. It was the Dogra fear of Punjabi businessmen and professionals muscling in which led to the 1927 Act that Article 35A protected.\nArticle 35A grew out of Article 370. So, when Jammu's non-Muslims welcomed the suspension of 370, they did not immediately realise that, as 35A was the child of the 370, it would lead to the safeguards of Dogra identity withering away under the impact of non-Dogra encroachment on their fiefdoms. Now, there is even fear that a Bihari might emerge as the leader of Jammu as a result of the registration of some 2,500,000 outside labour as voters, made possible by the precipitate withdrawal of Article 35A safeguards.\nIn Ladakh, the famous engineer, innovator, and educationist and Magsaysay-winner Sonam Wangchuk has been prevented from going on fast at a pass high up in the mountains to press his demand for the inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution (the status of autonomy enjoyed by many northeast hill states like Nagaland and Mizoram). He has instead undertaken his fast on campus, leading to the detention of scores of his student supporters and attempts to force him to sign a bond saying he will call off his agitation to avoid incarceration. Wangchuk has, of course, refused this Faustian offer. Such is the disillusionment with separate UT status that Wangchuk is on record as saying they were much better off when Ladakh was an integral part of J&K than it is today as a UT. He demands statehood.\nWhen elections are held \u2013 whenever \u2013 if the Gupkar alliance holds, the BJP does not stand a chance anywhere in the erstwhile Riyasat of J&K. But will the alliance hold? That, as Hamlet mournfully reflected, is the question.\nThis article was originally published in\u00a0The Wire\u00a0on February 9, 2023.\n\nMani Shankar Aiyar\u00a0is a former career civil servant diplomat and a member of the Indian National Congress Party.\n",

And these events are never coincidences.\nAny government may feel aggrieved by certain media coverage. And it may also be because the coverage was inaccurate, in which case the fault could lie with the media. But the right way to go about addressing this is through providing accurate counter information. If there were any flaws within the BBC's documentary, the correct way to expose those mistakes would have been for the Indian authorities to provide counter facts. Any government, when it is unsatisfied with a media content, has the right to challenge it by pointing out flaws and factual errors. However, to use the might of the state machinery to harass the media should never be acceptable in any democratic society. Moreover, such pressure \u2013 whether it be legal, financial, or otherwise \u2013 never works to achieve the end goal.\nUltimately, the media's job is to inform the public. And the public never sees suppression of the media in a positive light. Whenever a state machinery harasses the media right after it has revealed information that the government feels apprehensive of, the people never see it as being a coincidence. Rather, it only further corrodes the state's credibility in the eyes of the public.\nRights groups around the world have already expressed their concerns about the deterioration of press freedom in India. And this latest incident only brings it under more global spotlight for the wrong reasons. Therefore, we agree with the statement of the Indian Press Club that, \"Such an action against an international broadcasting network will damage the reputation and image of India as the largest democracy.\" As such, we hope the Indian government will restrain its agencies from misusing their powers to intimidate the media.\nUnfortunately, the misuse of state power to harass the media has been increasing all around the world, including in our country. It is something that should concern all those who believe in the values of a democratic society. We hope the Indian government, as well as all other governments around the world, realise how counterproductive such actions are, and refrain from any such intimidation tactics. Instead, governments should engage more with the media in the realm of information, and look to provide counter evidence when it believes certain coverage by the media has not been accurate.\n",

        "full_article": "As the country has pivoted towards an import-based energy generation, the current economic downturn in terms of sourcing energy supplies threaten to cut power generation significantly before the onset of summer. This is evident from the case of the newly inaugurated Rampal power plant complex (with two power plants with a total capacity of 1,320 megawatts) that is facing trouble operating at full capacity. From what has been reported in media, the 660-megawatt first unit of the jointly owned (Bangladesh-India) Maitree super-thermal power plant has been operating on and off since its inauguration. It depends on imported coal the supply of which has been severely constrained primarily by the ongoing dollar-crunch. Needless to say, a project of this magnitude can hardly be considered fully functional if it operates at a small fraction of its capacity.Although production has been ramped up to 400 MW, sustaining this momentum depends entirely on the ability to open necessary LC(s) to maintain an uninterrupted supply of coal. Also, one cannot overlook the requirements of the economy at large where everything from basic essentials like cereal, edible oil to raw materials for industry need to be imported. Thus, there is a fierce competition for the dollar, but at the end of the day, industrial production is bound to suffer if energy supplies cannot be ensured. The problems with sourcing foreign currency might deepen as Bangladesh enters into an uncertain 2023, marked by soaring energy prices. Bangladesh needs to learn from the European experience of depending largely on foreign energy sourcing. The fact that countries in the European common market (EU) have been forced to expend hundreds of billions of dollars in expensive fuel import (primarily LNG import) is not something that not only Bangladesh, but most Asian economies cannot afford. Again the country decided to not explore its own proven and prospective coal fields nearly a decade ago, while opting at later stage to set up several coal-based power plants. This has baffled most energy planners at home. The country has always been a gas-dependent one and most of its energy infrastructure is natural gas-based. Captive gas-based power generation was allowed in industry at subsidised prices and it is extremely difficult to wean off industry from cheap gas. Today, the country is at a crossroads and there are no easy answers to the problem emanating from the current energy crisis. But one should learn from history and take lessons from the current global scenario regarding sourcing energy supplies from foreign nations. Serious and concerted efforts need to be taken to explore both gas and coal reserves and these efforts must be the new modus operandi. While pockets of gas discovered can be added to the national grid as and when found, coal exploration will be a mid-term affair. There needs to be a new coal policy that will, hopefully, attract FDI, not only to Phulbari but other prospective coal-rich areas in the country. Austerity measures need to be rethought to prioritise energy exploration, for without energy, the wheels of the economy will slow down and Bangladesh risks falling out of the development success model for which it is known globally.",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh economy has recovered significantly in the post-Covid period and stayed on the higher trajectory of growth. It is reflected in the country's official statistics on macroeconomic situation. The final estimation of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), released by the national statistical agency early this month, showed GDP growth at 7.10 per cent in the last fiscal year (FY22). The rate was 6.94 per cent in the previous year or FY21. During the period of Covid-19 pandemic, economic activities of the country slowed down and contracted. The outcome was a pared-down 3.45-percent growth in GDP in FY20, marking a sharp fall from 7.88 per cent in FY19.Thus, coming back onto the 7-plus growth trajectory is still challenging for Bangladesh. As global economy is going through a near-recessionary phase mainly due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Bangladesh is also in trouble. The negative external factors cast shadow on the economic prospect of the country. Taking the reality into consideration, the government has already revised down the growth target to 6.50 per cent for the current fiscal year (FY23). Initially, the target was 7.50 per cent. With lower rate of GDP growth, the economy is also set to be hit hard by higher rate of inflation now. The government's primary target was to keep the inflation within 5.60 per cent in the current fiscal year. The consistent upward inflationary pressure has compelled the authorities to raise it to 7.50 per cent. Annual average rate of inflation has already reached 7.92 per cent while the monthly rate stood at 8.57 per cent in January last.So, Bangladesh is now bound for a 'low-growth, high-inflation' regime although no quarterly or half-yearly data of GDP are available now. Decline in growth is clearly in sight. Different international agencies also have downgraded the growth projection for Bangladesh. The United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2023 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that Bangladesh economy would grow by 6.0 per cent in the current year. The World Bank estimated that the rate would be yet lower, 5.20 per cent to be precise, in the ongoing fiscal year.The decline in growth is largely in line with the global growth prospect. The IMF projected that global growth would decelerate to 2.90 per cent in the current year from estimated 3.40 per cent in the last year.A quick look at the final estimate of GDP in FY22 may be helpful to contextualising the growth prospect of the country in the current year. It showed that growth in both agriculture and industry declined although growth in services increased in the last fiscal year. The estimate, prepared by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), also showed that though overall economy in the last fiscal year was largely driven by consumption, investment posted higher growth. Total consumption (at market price) increased by 7.36 per cent to around Tk 29.69 trillion in the last fiscal year from Tk 26.34 trillion in FY21. Investment jumped by 16.25 per cent to Tk 12.73 trillion in FY22 from Tk 10.95 trillion in the previous fiscal year. Though consumption-led growth is a long-term trend in the country, higher growth in investment in the past year reflects some increase in productive activities in the economy. Investment-GDP ratio increased to 32.05 per cent in the last fiscal year from 31.02 per cent in the previous year. Nevertheless, the ratio was still below the pre-Covid period. In FY19 the ratio was recorded at 32.21 per cent.Now, the question remains whether the higher growth in investment will prevail in the current year. Different indicators show that investment has started to slow down in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. For instance, private- sector credits recorded 12.90- percent growth at the end of December last against 13.65 per cent at the end of June last. The opening of fresh letters of credit for import in the first seven months of FY23 dropped around 25 per cent from the same period of FY22. Costlier foreign exchange compels many traders to cut down their business activities.Again, NBR's tax-revenue collection in the first half of the current fiscal year grew by 10.74 per cent against 16.80 per cent in the same period of FY22. The implementation rate of Annual Development Programme (ADP) was 23.53 per cent in the July-December period of the current fiscal year which was 24.06 per cent in the same period of FY21. Once the updated data on the third quarter is available, a better picture of the investment situation as well as the pace of the economy will come clear in sight.Nevertheless, there is no doubt that growth prospect is subdued and higher inflation will take a heavy toll in the near future. Slowdown in investment has squeezed the overall economic activities and more people are opting for various informal work for their bread and butter. So, they will get little slice from the growth pie. Moreover, growth in Bangladesh is discriminatory and resources are concentrated in few hands. That's why even higher growth has not succeeded in reducing the plight of the low-income people significantly. For lack of updated data on income and expenditure distribution, it is difficult to depict the real scenario statistically. Some implicit indices may, however, help to show the uneven growth distribution. For instance, though GDP-growth rate was higher in the last fiscal year, the growth in per-capita GDP dropped. Per-capita GDP increased by 9.20 per cent to $2687 in the last fiscal year from $2462 in FY21. But, it increased by 10.20 per cent in FY21 from $2234. Now, decline in growth in the current year will further marginalise these people.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Stressful life of the middle and lower-middle classes in the country's cities at times becomes unbearable. They look for outlets to release their stifling boredom. There are few to emerge as a way out to relieve them of their suffocation. Dhaka, as capital of Bangladesh, can boast of several outlets for spending pastime. But those are area-based. And many of them are based in north Dhaka. People from the south cannot visit those places at will thanks to traffic gridlock. In the similar way, the residents of the north cannot normally visit the Shahbagh-Dhaka University area to enjoy their timeout. But on occasions they turn desperate to come to the southern Dhaka to spend some good time.It's a well accepted fact that after continuing a grinding schedule day in and day out, the city residents look for short reliefs from monotony. Over the last couple of years, Dhaka has been offering the outlets of several such breaks from the city's hectic life. In most cases, these outings comprise different special days marked by national holidays. Some are not holidays. But, nonetheless, these are filled with festive moods. They are festivity-dominant days marked by attending gaiety-filled events, meeting friends and acquaintances after a long time and just gossiping. Many of these special festivities also centre round the different occasions marking the special days of Bangla seasons. Of them, the Bangla months of Baishakh and Falgoon emerge as the two most important ones. The ongoing month of Falgoon marks the Bangla month of spring. Although the first day of Falgoon isn't a holiday, young males and females attired in their festive dresses, yellow and red being the dominant colours, move about the must-go venues, especially the Shahbagh areas. The day coincides with the Ekushey Book Fair at the Bangla Academy and the Suhrawardy Udyan. Many small families with children are thus seen entering the book fair for a long time.The 1st of Falgoon in Bangladesh is also called the Day of Love. The celebration of this occasion sees young romantic pairs loitering in a leisurely mood throughout the Shahbagh, Dhaka University and Nilkhet areas. Earlier in the morning, the students of the Fine Art Institute welcome spring with songs and dance and poetry recitations. However, the greatest of the Bangla season-based festivals has long been the Pahela Baishakh, the Bangla New Year's Day. It is celebrated on the first day of the Bangla month of Baishakh, which is the beginning of summer. The Bangla New Year's festival is unparalleled in terms of jubilation and fanfare. Other seasonal celebrations of Bangladesh pale beside it. What the other parts of Dhaka often miss are the various types of cultural events that take place on the Arts Building campus, and also in the surrounding areas. These areas include the Fine Art Institute and the Dhaka Museum. The International Film Festival being held at the Central Public Library for two decades has already become a vital event in the cultural hub. Unlike in every large city elsewhere in the world, Dhaka has yet to have its own dedicated area for activities of the arts and culture. The Shilpakala Academy is there to hold the 2-yearly biennale of Asian Art Exhibition. But it also organises solo and group art shows, drama festivals, musical evenings etc. Kolkata's Nandon is a large arts complex holding all kinds of shows including film festivals. Grand plans were once taken to build the Dhaka Arts Complex around the Suhrawardy Udyan, i.e. connecting all the institutions on its two sides through a foot overpass on the ground's eastern part. The majestic plan may have been lost under many other more important files. Many youths may have forgotten the chapter altogether. Ironically, the foot overpass still stands --- nearly abandoned and over a gridlocked road.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bahadur Shah Park in Old Dhaka is a historical place. This is the place where the captured rebels of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny were hanged to death. Previously called Victoria Park, the place was renamed in 1957 after Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor of India. A memorial in this park reminds us of the sacrifices of the martyrs of the mutiny. Besides historical aspects, this park is important because Old Dhaka does not have enough open places. A large number of people regularly visit the park for breathing in open air, strolling, jogging and taking physical exercises. However, the park is now at a great risk of losing its greenery and rich history as the Dhaka South City Corporation has allowed a private entity to construct a food court at the historic site. Two fast food shops have already been set up in the middle of the park. These shops have significantly shrunk the space. There is no need for a caf\u00e9 inside the park as there are plenty of eateries in the area. Open green spaces are considered the lifeline of cities. But we in busy cities like Dhaka are alarmingly losing our parks, playgrounds and other public spaces. If the Bahadur Shah Park turns into a business centre in the name of a food court, it will ruin its main spirit. So, we urge the city corporation authorities to immediately take action and stop constructing the food court at the historic Bahadur Shah Park. \nBadsha Faysal, Jurain, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected] ",
