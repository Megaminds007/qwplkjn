The conflict between the government and the Opposition degenerated into a scuffle on the penultimate day, followed by absurd allegations and police reports. The Opposition sent a notice for a motion of no confidence in Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President of India Jagdeep Dhankhar, which was rejected by the Deputy Chairman. The acrimony peaked with the Opposition turning a reference by Home Minister Amit Shah to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar into a stick to beat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with. Mr. Shah\u2019s misspoken remarks were taken out of context by the Opposition which feels that it is par for the course. After all, the BJP had made ridiculous allegations about the Congress party\u2019s supposed link with anti-India forces abroad to stall Parliament proceedings for several days earlier. Productivity in the Rajya Sabha was 40%, as it met for 43 hours and 27 minutes of the schedule. The Lok Sabha functioned for 54.5% of its scheduled time. Both the Houses witnessed protests from the treasury and Opposition sides over issues such as the alleged interference of U.S. billionaire George Soros in Indian politics, and the U.S. government\u2019s actions against the Adani Group.The session was scheduled to take up 16 Bills in the legislative business and the first batch of supplementary grants under the financial business. Of the 16 Bills, only one Bill, the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024, significant for the civil aviation sector, was passed in both Houses. The Rajya Sabha passed the Boilers Bill and the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, bringing major changes in the industrial laws governing large furnaces and boilers and the petroleum sector. Other than the Appropriation Bills as part of the supplementary demands for grants, the Lok Sabha discussed and passed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, the Railways (Amendment) Bill and the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill. The debates saw Opposition members asking the government to protect the public sector banking system, ensure the safety of rail passengers and employees and bring in transparency in the allocation of funds to States hit by natural calamities. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, that aim to achieve simultaneous elections in the country, were introduced and referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar made statements in both Houses on India-China relations. The winter session demonstrated the need for an urgent restoration of parliamentary norms and basic decency in exchanges between political opponents.

        "full_article": "The horrors will never go away, and a survivor  has got only a semblance of closure after a French court sentenced her former husband to 20 years in prison for committing and orchestrating mass rapes of her for almost a decade. The 72-year-old man  admitted in court that he had drugged the survivor ,72, for years, before raping her, and recruiting strangers online to violate her as she was deeply asleep. In all, 51 people, aged between the late 20s and 70s, assaulted her as she lay in a drug-induced stupor, and have got away with punishment ranging from three to 15 years, less than the terms sought by prosecutors. The evidence, photographs and films, was stored in the man\u2019s  computer and shown in court to shocking disbelief; the crime itself unravelled in 2020 after he was being probed for another misdemeanour, filming women inappropriately. But in all this, the survivor\u2019s  brave stand \u2014 to waive anonymity and requesting a public trial \u2014 and boldly stating that \u201cit is not us who should feel shame, but them\u201d, struck a chord. People all across France, and the world, have followed the over three-month trial, marched on the streets and held demonstrations to seek changes in law for sexual crimes against women, and also the overturning of societal perceptions and toxic patriarchal behaviour. She said she had led the fight for her daughters and grandchildren and also \u201cunrecognised victims whose stories often remain in the shadows\u201d. She hoped that by opening the doors of the trial, and despite her ordeal, \u201csociety could take hold of the debates that took place there\u201d. Her case has sparked fierce debates on abuse and the aftermath. Under French law, the maximum penalty for rape is 20 years, and rights activists have pointed out that the punishment is simply not enough for ruining a life. In a majority of cases, complaints of sexual abuse and rapes are not reported and prosecuted. France is not the only violator. The United Nations says violence against women remains one of the most prevalent human rights violations, and that globally, an estimated 736 million women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence.  The survivor held out hope and confidence that society will \u201ccollectively seize a future in which each woman and man can live in harmony with respect and mutual understanding\u201d. But first, her words should be heeded, and rape charges must never be trivialised. She has helped break the silence and the shame around rape; the onus is on society and law-makers to shatter the stigma and impunity attached to sexual abuse.

        "full_article": "The concept of insurance is based on an attractive idea: you pay a small amount of money regularly, and if and when disaster strikes, you will receive protection from catastrophic expenses. But ask anyone who has experienced insurance as it operates today, especially health insurance managed by private companies, it is likely they will describe back-breaking ordeals to get that \u2018protection\u2019 despite what the company earnestly promises in ads. In the US, where commercial insurance dominates healthcare funding, these individual ordeals coalesced into an ocean of discontent earlier this month following UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s murder.\nIt also catalysed a new wave of discussions and testimonies among ordinary Americans about the inhumane nature of a healthcare system based on private commercial insurance. I studied public health in a US graduate school with a sizable number of international students, and the one thing that most of us strongly agreed on was that America is a stupendous failure when it comes to health systems management and healthcare policymaking. While much ink has been spilled over how and why American healthcare is terrible, one simplified example will suffice here: current infant mortality (IMR) and maternal mortality (MMR) indicators for the US and Kerala, respectively, are 5.4 and 6 (IMR), and 23.8 and 19 (MMR). That is, despite ostensibly spending $4.5 trillion or 17.3% of its humongous GDP on healthcare, the US barely manages to outperform our very own state of Kerala, which is doing excellently on far less money.\nIn America, experts and activists are indeed concerned about the poor state of healthcare, and one sees there an abundance of books, articles, university courses, and political rallying around the issue of healthcare reform. Nevertheless, US healthcare has been an attractive model for policymakers and their consultants globally. This might be because commercial insurance gives the outward appearance of financial \u2018efficiency\u2019, while helping company executives accumulate wealth and pass some of that on to friendly politicians. In 2023, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare posted $22 billion in profits, even as a survey reported that it had the highest claim denial rate (32%)\u2014this often happens when an insurance company rules that a drug or procedure prescribed by your doctor is not \u201cmedically necessary\u201d for you. An investigation in July exposed how \u201cUnitedHealth harnesses its physician empire to squeeze profits out of patients\u201d. In fact, the private insurance model is so lucrative for American business and political elites, that they have successfully propagated misleading ideas about its supposed benefits like avoiding \u2018govt takeover\u2019 of healthcare and offering \u2018freedom of choice\u2019 to patients.\nThe propaganda about the supposed public benefits of private insurance is what Amartya Sen and Jean Dr\u00e8ze allude to as the \u201cprivate insurance trap\u201d in their 2013 book \u2018An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions\u2019. Dr\u00e8ze and Sen explain how a healthcare system dominated by private insurance carries serious flaws and suffers from an irreversibility issue: \u201cthe health insurance industry can easily become a powerful lobby and establish a strong hold on health policy, making it very difficult to move away from that model\u2026\u201d Citing the example of the US, they write how healthcare reform there has been next to impossible despite the country\u2019s tremendous resources, \u201cpartly due to the power of the health insurance business, and partly due to deep-rooted political resistance to the idea of \u2018socialised\u2019 health care, which resistance has been much cultivated by private health insurance companies.\u201d\nOn the other hand, successive govts in India, inspired by the idea of \u2018social insurance\u2019 among other things, have painstakingly built a largely socialised healthcare system and created such entities as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), AIIMS, public medical colleges, military hospitals, rural primary health centers, and the ASHA workers network. There is still a lot we need to do better (for example, provide decent housing and clean water to communities, or ensure that people are not treated disrespectfully in govt health centers), but unfortunately, instead of working to further fine-tune and improve our existing socialised infrastructure, there are many in govt today who believe that we must just \u2018nudge\u2019 Indians into the profit-seeking spirals of corporate hospitals and insurance companies. Considering the increasing reliance of politicians across parties on insurance-based schemes like PMJAY, the nudge might well turn into a push in the near future.\nThis \u00a0renewed global focus on America\u2019s grand healthcare failures should alert us to the dangers of replicating the US model wherein commercial entities mould policy to prioritise private profits over public welfare, and create an exasperating, multi-layered bureaucracy of permissions and approvals between a patient and their care provider. For our policymakers, this is an opportunity for introspection and course correction.\n\n",

Historic landmarks to anonymous dwellings, the greens lining the water or sky rising beyond it, everything can seem nicer than it is. On-board romances are frequent. Gliding through water, sweet nothings flow better. Even when one is headed to a mundane destination, like work, the journey offers sublime delights the road cannot. In Kolkata, a Hooghly ferry provides fine sights of traffic on the Howrah bridge above. In Goa, a govt-run Mandovi ferry to Divar island is still free. For taking a four-wheeler across on the ferry, you shell out the kingly sum of 10. Nothing extra is charged for exotic flora and fauna sightings.\nGiven this serenity, the shock of those aboard a ferry heading to Elephanta Island must have been horrific. It was rammed by a navy speedboat on Wednesday. When will accountability and punishment be fixed? Meanwhile, life jackets are suddenly in abundance on Mumbai\u2019s ferry travellers. Question is, will they stay on?\nChicago river architecture cruises bring alive how back during the great fire of 1871, flames were able to jump shores by burning all the trash in the water.

        "full_article": "Corruption, embezzlement, and money laundering have been endemic in Bangladesh but reached new heights during the last 15 years of the now-toppled regime led by the Awami League. The recently published \"White Paper on the State of the Bangladesh Economy\" reported that $234 billion was syphoned off from Bangladesh between 2009 and 2023. The interim government has promised to work tirelessly to identify the perpetrators of this massive mayhem\u2014to loot and plunder the country and its poor people\u2014and bring back some of the ill-gotten resources.\nTax havens around the globe, particularly in the Middle East, Malaysia, the UK, Canada, the US, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, provided a golden opportunity for businesses, bureaucrats, and politicians to use a well-crafted system of patronage and crony capitalism to take advantage of the country's incompetent leaders and financial regulators to launder an average of $16 billion a year.\nThe White Paper documented the mechanism used for money laundering (ML)\u2014these tricks have been well-known for a long time. The then foreign minister of Bangladesh stated during an interview with The Daily Star in 2020 that the AL government had information that politicians, businessmen, and government officials, including some \"serving officials,\" had pilfered and whitewashed money by buying properties in Canada. It is no secret that Bangladesh Bank and the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) were fully aware of the scale of ML and the role played by the key protagonists!\nThe previous government was, on many occasions, alerted by the World Bank, multilateral financial institutions, UN agencies, and national watchdogs about the scope of illicit financial flows (IIF). In 2011, during negotiations with the World Bank to secure financing for the Padma Bridge, the bank provided \"credible evidence of corruption\" to the government. These were brushed aside and dismissed as \"trumped-up\" allegations by the former prime minister.\nIn my brief discussion on this matter with members of the current administration, it is clear that money laundering and its prevention are among its highest priorities. Last week, the BB governor publicly reiterated his intention to bring back stolen assets from other countries. He chairs a nine-member taskforce with representatives from important state agencies, which has been assigned to track down stolen assets abroad and support investigations aimed at their recovery. The taskforce seeks to expedite legal proceedings for asset recovery, identify and address barriers to recovery, manage frozen or recovered assets abroad, and strengthen communication with relevant domestic and international bodies to gather essential information while enhancing internal coordination and capabilities.\nWhile asset recovery is a tough and time-consuming process, it needs to be done, and for many reasons. The money looted from the coffers is now being used to undermine the present government. If we reverse the resource outflow and turn back the tide, that would rejuvenate our economic development. For example, the ML activities of the owners of the S Alam Group have resulted in the bankruptcy of the various businesses they own. If their overseas resources are liquidated and the proceeds repatriated and invested in their domestic enterprises, the local economy will receive a shot in the arm.\nAlso, we need to send a message to the culprits. In the language of criminal justice system, the purpose would be \"deterrence, retribution, and restoration.\"\nThe asset recovery stage encompasses several steps that need to be pursued diligently. To begin, a special sub-unit comprising legal and financial experts could freeze, without delay and much fanfare, the funds or other assets of designated persons or entities. Fortunately, Bangladesh can leverage the goodwill earned by the interim administration and seek assistance from three powerful international bodies: i) The World Bank's Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (STAR); ii) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), based in Paris; and iii) The US Department of Justice's Money Laundering and Asset recovery Section (MLARS).\nGoing forward, the taskforce must initiate and hire staff to undertake and strengthen legal action in the following areas: identifying stolen assets, including non-performing bank loans; collecting intelligence and evidence and tracing overseas assets; determining the beneficiaries of ML and ownership transparency; initiating international cooperation between involved jurisdictions; coordination between agencies participating in the taskforce; and legal actions, domestic and international.\nWhy is international collaboration so important? Most of the stolen money is invested overseas or stashed away in foreign banks. The process of identifying these investments and recovering them will be slow and involve tackling the lawyers, trust experts, real estate agents, accountants, and financial institutions representing the individuals\u2014the Saifuzzamans and the Benazirs\u2014who might have already been identified and tipped in advance. The money, once taken out of the country, is most likely to have been invested in real estate or businesses through a process known as \"layering,\" where the ownership is completely fuzzy. We need to hire the best global investigators to trace the money since the beneficial owner may be hidden behind multiple layers of shell companies or a nominee company director.\nSince the US, Canada, Singapore, and the UK have some of the strictest anti-money-laundering (AML) legislation and enforcement mechanisms, our embassies or high commissions in these countries must be notified of the business entities or persons of interest. Several newspaper accounts of Bangladeshi residents in Singapore, New York, Toronto, and London have surfaced over the last few years. The taskforce can forward the list of suspects to MLARS and target the three most corrupt sectors identified by the White Paper: financial, ICT, and power.\nThe ultimate goal of the current administration is to lay the foundation of an anti-ML programme that will prevent future occurrences. A comprehensive ML programme will include investment in employee education, stricter internal controls, accountability, and early detection.\nWe need to build stronger defences against corruption, money laundering, and fraudulent trading practices. Key sectors like banking should have guardrails against the \"bad influence of party politics,\" to quote Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud. Various policy measures and actions recommended by the Farashuddin Commission, set up after the Bangladesh Bank heist, need to be implemented. A whistleblower programme to reward individuals who provide helpful information on illegal financial activities must be established.\nFinally, this most recent money laundering and kleptocracy saga underscores the pressing need for unwavering diligence and proactive implementation of a comprehensive AML compliance framework in Bangladesh to safeguard the financial system.\nDr Abdullah Shibli\u00a0is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company.

        "full_article": "Bangladesh, with its diverse ecosystems, harbours an array of wildlife species critical to global biodiversity. Yet, this rich natural heritage faces immense threats due to the illegal wildlife trade, both as a source and transit route. The role of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), established in 1973, is vital in curbing this alarming trend. However, recent developments have highlighted serious gaps in the country's compliance.\nIllegal wildlife trade in Bangladesh encompasses a wide range of species, including Bengal tigers, turtles, exotic birds, and marine life. The country's geopolitical location, bordering India and Myanmar, makes it a strategic transit point for traffickers.\nAccording to field studies, Bangladesh has 16 key trafficking hotspots along its borders, including Teknaf, Benapole, and the Chattogram seaport. Smugglers exploit porous borders and weak enforcement to move wildlife into neighbouring countries such as India, Myanmar, and Vietnam\u2014countries with booming wildlife markets.\nSince joining CITES in 1982, Bangladesh has committed to regulating international wildlife trade through strict permits and documentation to protect species from overexploitation. However, in August 2024, Bangladesh faced suspension from CITES due to persistent failures in enforcement, hindering efforts to protect endangered species such as tigers, elephants, and various marine life forms. Despite this setback, Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan expressed optimism, citing the government's commitment to stronger compliance and enhanced wildlife monitoring.\nChallenges persist due to fake permits and insufficient training among port personnel, allowing smugglers to exploit these loopholes and traffic protected species via air and land routes, notably through Dhaka and Chattogram airports. And while the government has made progress in some areas, wildlife trafficking, especially through less-regulated borders, continues to thrive.\nThe Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU), established by the Forest Department, has been at the forefront of efforts to combat wildlife trafficking. Recent seizures of animals, such as Hoolock gibbons, fishing cats, and Kalij pheasants, underscore the ongoing struggle to stop wildlife smuggling. According to law enforcement, wildlife trafficking routes often pass through major international ports like Chattogram before moving to destinations such as India and Myanmar.\nIn March 2021, a significant operation led to the rescue of seven Patagonian Mara, an exotic species from Argentina, in Satkhira. This demonstrates how international traffickers exploit Bangladesh as a transit point. Similar seizures of zebras, lion cubs, and other species further highlight the scale of the illegal trade operating within the country.\nBangladesh is home to several species listed under the CITES appendices:\nAppendix I: Includes species threatened with extinction, such as the Bengal Tiger, Indian Elephant, and Red Panda, as well as marine species like the Olive Ridley Turtle.\nAppendix II: Includes species like the Saltwater Crocodile, Gharial, and Indian Star Tortoise, which are at risk without trade controls.\nAppendix III: Includes certain mangrove species from the Sundarbans and orchids from the Dendrobium genus, protected due to over-harvesting.\nDespite these protective measures, enforcing CITES regulations remains challenging. Combating wildlife trafficking in Bangladesh is hampered by weak enforcement, inadequate resources, and insufficient training for the Wildlife Crime Control Unit. Online marketplaces like Facebook and YouTube complicate regulation, while domestic demand for wildlife products exacerbates the issue. Corruption and lack of expertise among port officials and border guards allow traffickers to exploit false declarations and evade detection, further endangering biodiversity.\nWildlife trafficking poses a significant threat to Bangladesh's biodiversity. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over 390 species in Bangladesh are at risk of extinction. Poaching, habitat destruction, and trade disrupt ecosystems and push species towards extinction. Marine life, such as turtles and sharks from the Bay of Bengal, is particularly vulnerable. Bangladesh has already lost 31 species in the last century, and many more are at risk if illegal trade continues unchecked.\nThe Bangladesh Forest Department, in collaboration with international organisations like Interpol, has intensified anti-trafficking measures. These include:\nRescue operations: Seizures of exotic and native wildlife, including endangered species.\nPublic hotlines: Encouraging citizens to report wildlife crimes.\nLegal frameworks: Enforcing the Wild Animals (Preservation and Security) Act, 2012.\nCapacity building: Plans for a DNA-based tiger gene bank to strengthen anti-poaching measures.\nHowever, recurring offenders and inadequate market monitoring undermine progress. Given this reality, here are some steps that should be taken to address wildlife trafficking effectively: i) Enhance enforcement through training programmes for law enforcement and customs officials; ii) Use modern technology, such as drones and checkpoints, to deter smuggling; iii) Launch public awareness campaigns to reduce domestic demand for wildlife products; iv) Strengthen international cooperation for intelligence sharing and joint operations; and v) Revise policies to enforce stricter penalties and wildlife trade regulations.\nBangladesh's biodiversity faces significant pressure from illegal wildlife trade. Effective CITES enforcement and collaborative efforts among government agencies, international organisations, and the public are crucial for safeguarding ecosystems and global biodiversity.\nFardeen Bin Abdullah\u00a0studies LLM at the Department of Law, University of Rajshahi.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Bangladesh being named\u00a0The Economist's Country of the Year\u00a0in 2024 is a tremendous achievement for the country\u2014one that all Bangladeshis can be proud of. Each December,\u00a0The Economist\u00a0awards this title to a country that has made significant progress over the past year. This year, Bangladesh earned the prestigious accolade for \"toppling a despot and taking strides towards a more liberal government.\" This recognition is particularly meaningful for a nation that has recently undergone a major political transition, overthrowing an extremely corrupt and autocratic regime of 15 years through a student-led mass uprising.\nThe report highlights the remarkable journey of the Bangladeshi people in overcoming political repression and paving the way for a brighter, more democratic future. As the Hasina regime grew increasingly repressive\u2014marked by election rigging, jailing of opponents, and violent crackdowns on dissent\u2014the people united and took to the streets to assert their rights. During the July uprising that ultimately led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina, hundreds were shot dead by the regime, and around 20,000 were wounded. The heavy toll paid to oust an autocratic regime is a rare and profound example of resilience in modern history\u2014even though Bangladeshis are no strangers to demonstrating such resilience in the face of oppression.\nWhile the political transition has inspired optimism both nationally and globally\u2014showcasing the resilience and determination of the Bangladeshi people\u2014the nation now faces significant economic challenges. Rebuilding the country will require addressing the economic consequences of the previous regime. During Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule, narratives of substantial economic growth were propagated, but these claims have since been exposed as largely illusory. A government-commissioned white paper revealed that an estimated $234 billion was syphoned out of the country between 2009 and 2023. Additionally, Bangladesh has long struggled with inflation and unemployment, issues that must now be tackled urgently. However, with unity, these challenges can be overcome.\nThe interim government, led by Prof Muhammad Yunus, has prioritised rebuilding trust and stability. Its initiatives include economic and other reforms, restoring public order, and addressing social grievances. Despite the challenges, the progress made so far has been promising. Moving forward, Bangladesh must establish positive relations with other countries for mutual benefits, ensure judicial neutrality, and organise free and fair national elections. These steps are critical to solidifying the country's progress towards a more liberal democracy.\nThis is also a time for Bangladesh to correct past wrongs and begin anew\u2014building a nation founded on equity, justice, the rule of law, and human rights. We hope the global community will continue to recognise our achievements and stand by Bangladesh as it strives to fulfil the democratic aspirations of its people.\n",
