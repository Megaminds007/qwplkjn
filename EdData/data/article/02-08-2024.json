Each copy of the newest draft has been provided with a unique watermark that can identify \u201cleaks\u201d, if any. Public consultations are an integral part of making laws that affect many Indians, a fact that was recognised by the government\u2019s 2014 Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, which recommends extensive public outreach before lawmaking. While the government circulated the earlier version of the Bill to the public, it seems to have insisted on withholding responses, and has chosen to take just a few stakeholders into confidence. This approach ignores online creators, large parts of the media industry, and civil society \u2014 the very stakeholders who have the most to be concerned about with media regulation. The Bill would expand an already comprehensive regulatory framework that has been criticised as having a chilling effect, discouraging free expression in a range of media spanning news and entertainment. This has been evident, for instance, in the toning down of OTT streaming platforms\u2019 content since the passage of the IT Rules, 2021.Cast in that light, the omission of meaningful public consultation \u2014 a growing problem in much of policymaking across Ministries \u2014 may be less a sin of omission and more a deliberate strategy of gatekeeping major policy changes, and deciding who gets to have a say in them. While the individual laws that are being deliberated in this way may be concerning, the process in and of itself is cause for significant alarm. When it comes to media regulation, for instance, the interests of established corporate stakeholders might not always coincide with those of the emerging crop of creators, independent commentators, social media users and independent journalists who are also likely to be impacted by the Broadcasting Bill. Without a right to know other stakeholders\u2019 points of view \u2014 let alone respond to them \u2014 the quality and sincerity of this proposal can only be deeply suspect. The government must cease methods of policymaking that may be quick and unfussy, but diminish public trust in their intent. Meaningful public consultation does not constrain the ability of lawmakers to proceed with their intended course of action in any case; all it does is to put diverse points of view across. Hurried and gate-kept consultations may well end up begetting flawed and exclusionary legislation.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\nmedia",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s torturous saga on the fate of genetically modified food crop made another pit stop last week with a two-judge Bench, of Justices B.V. Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol of the Supreme Court of India, delivering a split verdict on the question of allowing genetically modified (GM) mustard in farmer fields. As of today, the only GM seed permissible in India is cotton. The gain in cotton yield had prompted agricultural institutions, private and public, to develop GM seeds in food crops such as rice, wheat, tomato, brinjal and mustard though none has been released. These issues underpin the story of DMH-11, or Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11, that was developed under a publicly funded project at the Delhi University\u2019s biotechnology department. The genes used in the plant make the crop suitable and lucrative to private seed companies for making newer hybrid varieties. For crops to be approved under India\u2019s agricultural system, they must be sown over three seasons in different agro-climatic zones and prove themselves to be consistently better than their existing comparators. Trials conducted over three years by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research suggest that DMH-11 passed these metrics. This led the GEAC, the scientific advisory body led by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, to approve DMH-11 in October 2022, subject to certain tests. On the other hand, environmentalist groups have said that the DMH-11 is a \u2018herbicide tolerant\u2019 crop. It is genetically coded in a way that effectively forces farmers to use certain kinds of pesticide, with destructive environmental consequences; the allegations are that the developers were not transparent with this information. These findings, and the GEAC approval, have been contested in the Court by Aruna Rodrigues and the organisation, Gene Campaign.The judges disagreed among themselves whether the GEAC was correct. Justice Nagarathna said that the GEAC had violated the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019, under which any new organism or modifying technology should, by default, be caged in unless its consequences are deliberated upon. Justice Karol, however, appeared to be satisfied by the process. Therefore, the case passes on to a larger Bench led by the Chief Justice of India. However, the most significant decision was a Court order to the Centre to evolve a policy on GM crops. The dispute over GM crops is fundamentally ideological and less on the traditional agricultural yardsticks of yield and farm economics. This is amplified by India\u2019s agricultural history where a panacea from yesteryears, hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilizer, while improving yields and productivity, have unleashed environmental harm. In their decisions, the Court and the government must remember that the good ought not to be seen as the enemy of the perfect. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nagriculture\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ngenetics\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nbiotechnology\n\n/\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\nhistory\n\n/\n\nfertiliser\n\n/\n\nuniversity\n\n/\n\nDelhi",

This is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Western Ghats. With Tuesday\u2019s landslides taking over 150 lives, govts\u2019 failure to mitigate its well-known ecological vulnerabilities is sharply, and justly, in focus today. But an unregulated tourist boom has also played a key role in the ghatastrophe. This factor deserves all the more attention, because it is seen wreaking havoc across several environmental hotspots in the country.\nThat many homestays and resorts which got destroyed were located right on river banks, \u2018without providing any room for the river\u2019, is reminiscent of how buildings constructed in floodplains got swept away during the 2013 Kedarnath floods. Uttarakhand has hardly corrected course since then. Tourism bucks and real estate greed are still seen running rampant. Whether travellers come looking for physical or spiritual adventures, they become part of the same traffic jams and garbage mountains. Tiger reserves to oncepristine beaches, too often the scene is sadly the same. They crowd onto railway tracks to see Dudhsagar Falls, make Darjeeling run short of drinking water, make Ooty feel indistinguishable from Bengaluru.\n\nThis is a painful irony. The search for an escape from cities, turns tourist destinations into an unpleasant reflection of these cities. It\u2019s a Janus-faced challenge. It has to be addressed at both ends. Our cities have to be made much more \u2018livable\u2019 and our vacation stations have to be much better conserved. The first needs reversing the decline of our blue-green infra. Imagine Delhi with a Yamuna that raises our spirits rather than stench, Mumbai with its green lungs safe and stronger, Bengaluru with its lakes breathing not frothing. Imagine well-maintained parks, gardens, playgrounds.\nBut don\u2019t imagine any of this will happen without a heavy increase in public pressure. Govts will have to be pushed to change their priorities. The decade-long inaction on the Gadgil and Kasturirangan reports on the Western Ghats is a classic example of how other interests prevail over the environment, in the normal course of things. This norm needs shaking up. While humans profit from it in some way or another, even if short-term, the destination only experiences loss after loss. What took millennia to build, we are destroying recklessly, and can never bring back.\n\n",

He was there to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran\u2019s new president Masoud Pezeshkian, and had met Iran\u2019s top boss, Ayatollah Khamenei. Both Tehran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the assassination. But many questions remain unanswered.\nHaniyeh was staying in a high-security building. Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah was also in the building. But it was Haniyeh who was targeted. Last week 14 Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, met in Beijing and reportedly worked out an in-principle unity arrangement. It has been known for a while that there are divergences between Hamas\u2019s political wing led by Haniyeh and its military wing in Gaza. In that context, unity talks don\u2019t serve Tehran\u2019s strategic interests \u2013 it sees Hamas in Gaza as a tool to keep Tel Aviv off-balance. Could Haniyeh be a casualty of such machinations?\n\nThe assassination comes at a time tensions have been rising between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2013 after a rocket attack killed 12 children in northern Israel. Tel Aviv, in response, has hit southern Beirut, targeting an alleged Hezbollah commander. If Israel and Hezbollah skirmishes break out into open war, it could make the ongoing conflict and casualties in Gaza seem like a smaller tragedy, as difficult as it is to imagine that. A heavily-armed Hezbollah and a stretched IDF make for an unpredictable conflict dynamic.\nIran has vowed revenge, Hamas has vowed retribution, and Hezbollah is keeping Israel\u2019s northern border hot. But, here\u2019s the thing. Unlike Gaza, as tragic as the human cost is, the global economy will get a big shock if there\u2019s a full-on war between Iran and Israel. Netanyahu could end this by winding down military operations in Gaza. But is he listening?\n\n",

It can end up criminalising any & every conversion\nPassage of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2024 (\u2018Amending Act\u2019) on Tuesday should be seen as a very significant development. The law amends the contentious UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 (\u2018Act\u2019). While the state legislature may view the amended Act as a stricter and more efficient law to tackle unlawful religious conversions, it appears even more arbitrary and constitutionally suspect.\nThis underscores the fundamental flaws in India\u2019s criminal lawmaking practices. Such laws are often employed in day-to-day governance, and remain subservient to extraneous considerations, rather than being guided by constitutional values.\n\nWhat is allurement? |\u00a0The Act is ostensibly designed to prohibit unlawful religious conversions. However, its sweeping definitions effectively criminalise any form of conversion, including those protected by the constitutionally guaranteed right under Article 25 to freedom of conscience, and the free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.\nUnder the Act, any conversion can be declared unlawful if it involves an element of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, or allurement.

Gadgil headed the environment ministry\u2019s Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), which, in Aug 2011, recommended earmarking the Ghats as an eco-sensitive area spanning six states \u2013 Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\nThe panel had sought a complete stop to environmentally hazardous human activity.

Five drafts later, all recommendations remain on paper, one or the other state sidestepping the matter each time.\n\u00a0\n\n\u25cf Were the Wayanad landslides waiting to happen?\nYes. Any nation can be seen to be having four capital stocks \u2013 natural, social (cooperative behaviour, security), human (education, health, employability) and man-made. India extensively practises building highly subsidised man-made capital, at serious costs to natural, human and social capital. This invariably worsens economic, social, educational and health disparities, thereby depressing overall welfare. This also limits our industrial enterprises from competing successfully internationally.\nIt is this narrow view of development that\u2019s behind most environmental degradation, including the Wayanad landslides. It is this view that promotes the increasing frequency and intensity of human interventions, such as mines and quarries, roads, buildings on hill slopes everywhere, including in ecologically highly sensitive regions, without a care for the environment.\nRead full article\n\n",

        "full_article": "The prime minister and several ministers keep on asking: since the quota reform has already been implemented, why are the students still demonstrating? The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed\u2014the government itself admits to 150\u2014and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.\nToday's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.\nThe all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".)\nThe killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history\u2014and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?\nWhat brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.\nOf all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?\nUse of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.\nThe case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.\nHow can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?\nWe demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.\nIt must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.\nIt is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.\nThose who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).\nWe urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too. Wisdom should compel the government not to brush them aside, which it will do only at its own peril.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "On July 28, the 70th birthday of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (1954-2013), Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros won the Venezuelan presidential election, the fifth since the Bolivarian Constitution was ratified in 1999. In January 2025, Maduro will start his third six-year term as president. He took over the reins of the Bolivarian Revolution after the death of Ch\u00e1vez from pelvic cancer in 2013. Since the death of Ch\u00e1vez, Maduro has faced several challenges: to build his own legitimacy as president in the place of a charismatic man who came to define the Bolivarian Revolution; to tackle the collapse of oil prices in mid-2014, which negatively impacted Venezuela's state revenues (over 90 percent of which was from oil exports); and to manage a response to the unilateral, illegal sanctions deepened on Venezuela by the United States as oil prices declined. These negative factors weighed heavily on the Maduro government, which has now been in office for a decade after being re-elected through the ballot box in 2018 and now in 2024.\nFrom Maduro's first election victory in 2013, the increasingly far-right opposition began to reject the electoral process and complain about irregularities in the system. Interviews I have held over the past decade with conservative politicians have made it clear that they recognise both the ideological grip of \"Chavismo\" over the working class of Venezuela and the organisational power not only of Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela, but of the networks of Chavismo that run from the communes (1.4 million strong) to youth organisations. About half of Venezuela's voting population is reliably wedded to the Bolivarian project, and no other political project in Venezuela has the kind of election machine built by the forces of the Bolivarian Revolution. That makes winning an election for the anti-Ch\u00e1vez forces impossible. To that end, their only path is to malign Maduro's government as corrupt and complain that the elections are not fair. After Maduro's victory\u2014by a margin of 51.2 percent to 44.2 percent\u2014this is precisely what the far-right opposition has been trying to do, egged on by the United States and a network of far-right and pro-US governments in South America.\nEurope Needs Venezuelan Oil\n\nThe United States has been trying to find a solution to a problem of its own making. Having placed severe sanctions against both Iran and Russia, the US now cannot easily find a source of energy for its European partners. Liquified natural gas from the US is expensive and not sufficient. What the US would like is to have a reliable source of oil that is easy to process and in sufficient quantities. Venezuelan oil fits the requirements, but given the US sanctions on Venezuela, this oil cannot be found in the European market. The US has created a trap from which it finds few solutions.\u00a0\nIn June 2022, the US government allowed Eni SpA (Italy) and Repsol SA (Spain) to transport Venezuelan oil to the European market to compensate for the loss of Russian oil deliveries. This allowance revealed Washington's shift in strategy regarding Venezuela. No longer was it going to be possible to suffocate Venezuela by preventing exports of oil, since this oil was needed as a result of US sanctions on Russia. Since June 2022, the US has been trying to calibrate its need for this oil, its antipathy to the Bolivarian Revolution, and its relations with the far-right opposition in Venezuela.\nThe US and the Venezuelan Far-Right\n\nThe emergence of Chavismo\u2014the politics of mass action to build socialism in Venezuela\u2014transformed the political scenario in the country. The old parties of the right (Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica and COPEI) collapsed after 40 years of alternating power. In the 2000 and 2006 elections, the opposition to Ch\u00e1vez was provided not by the right, but by dissenting centre-left forces (La Causa R and Un Nuevo Tiempo). The Old Right faced a challenge from the New Right, which was decidedly pro-capitalist, anti-Chavista, and pro-US; this group formed a political platform called La Salida or The Exit, which referred to their desired exit from the Bolivarian Revolution. The key figures here were Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, Antonio Ledezma, and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who led violent protests against the government in 2014 (L\u00f3pez was arrested for incitement to violence and now lives in Spain; a US government official in 2009 said he is \"often described as arrogant, vindictive, and power-hungry\"). Ledezma moved to Spain in 2017 and was\u2014with Corina Machado\u2014a signatory of the far-right Madrid Charter, an anti-communist manifesto organised by the Spanish far-right party, Vox. Corina Machado's political project is underpinned by the proposal to privatise Venezuela's oil company.\nSince the death of Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela's right wing has struggled with the absence of a unified programme and with a mess of egotistical leaders. It fell to the US to try and shape the opposition into a political project. The most comical attempt was the elevation in January 2019 of an obscure politician named Juan Guaid\u00f3 to be the president. That manoeuvre failed and in December 2022, the far-right opposition removed Guaid\u00f3 as its leader. The removal of Guaid\u00f3 allowed for direct negotiations between the Venezuelan government and the far-right opposition, which had since 2019 hoped for US military intervention to secure them in power in Caracas.\nThe US pressured the increasingly intransigent far-right to hold talks with the Venezuelan government in order to allow the US to reduce sanctions and let Venezuelan oil go into European markets. This pressure resulted in the Barbados Agreement of October 2023, in which the two sides agreed to a fair election in 2024 as the basis for the slow withdrawal of the sanctions. The elections of July 28 are the outcome of the Barbados process. Even though Mar\u00eda Corina Machado was barred from running, she effectively ran against Maduro through her proxy candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and lost in a hard-fought election.\nTwenty-three minutes after the polls closed, US Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2014and now a presidential candidate in the November elections in the US\u2014put out a tweet conceding that the far-right had lost. It was an early sign that the US\u2014despite making noises about election fraud\u2014wanted to move past their allies in the far-right, find a way to normalise relations with the Venezuelan government and allow the oil to flow to Europe. This tendency of the US government has frustrated the far-right, which turned to other far-right forces across Latin America for support, and which knows that its remaining political argument is about election fraud. If the US government wants to get Venezuelan oil to Europe, it will need to abandon the far-right and accommodate the Maduro government. Meanwhile, the far-right has taken to the streets through armed gangs who want to repeat the guarimba (barricade) disruptions of 2017.\nVijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor, and journalist.

        "full_article": "The manner in which the government has dealt with the whole issue of the six coordinators of quota reform protests has legal malpractice written all over it. The six were finally released on Thursday afternoon, after nearly a week since being picked up between last Friday and Sunday. All through this period, top law and police officers defended it by using words that seemed carefully scripted. Even on Thursday, the law minister claimed that the six were kept in custody for their own safety, and that it was they who had sought protection. But no one is buying it anymore. Legal experts say the safety claim, putting the onus on the students, is but a cover for what was actually an abduction, which is illegal and unconstitutional. Citing the Appellate Division's guidelines, they said any detainee must be produced before court within 24 hours, which was not done in this case.\nWe have seen a similar legal manoeuvring in the case of the teenager detained in connection with the death of student protester Abu Sayed. The 16-year-old, Alfi Shahriar Mahim, was apparently not even present at the site of the killing. But police still arrested him for murder, leading to him being held in Rangpur jail for 13 days. The manner in which police handled the whole issue\u2014from bringing false charges against a minor to inflating his age in case documents to preparing a First Information Report (FIR) that totally contradicted with independently verified footages of police repeatedly shooting Abu Sayed, despite the victim posing no threat\u2014is unacceptable\u00a0on multiple fronts. It indicates that law enforcers may go to any lengths to cover their tracks and absolve themselves of any responsibility for the killings that occurred since July 16.\nShahriar Mahim has now been released on bail. But his trouble is not over, as he hasn't been cleared of the charges against him. Elsewhere, two of the freed six\u2014who reportedly went on a\u00a0two-day hunger strike leading to their release\u2014have busted the myth of police hospitality and protection, confirming that state officials were lying through their teeth all along. Soon their Facebook accounts have disappeared. Is anyone surprised at this stage?\nBut what does their plight tell us about the reliability of law enforcement officials in charge of investigations? What does it say about the nearly 11,000 people arrested or the 673 cases filed across the country over the last 14 days? These mass arrests and the tenuous legal justifications provided for them make a mockery of our justice system. They also show that, despite recent government claims about being open to a fair and thorough investigation into the killings of so many people in quota-related clashes, the authorities are still unwilling to pursue accountability where it is most needed: its own security forces.\nThis has to stop. Legal manoeuvring can no longer hide ugly truths or delude citizens. While we want accountability for the destruction and damage caused to public infrastructure, we believe the investigative focus should singularly be on establishing accountability for those tragic deaths at the moment. And the higher authorities must prove their sincerity by immediately stopping the pointless mass arrests, releasing all victims of legal harassment, especially students and political activists, and aid rather than obstruct in the process of investigating the role of security forces during the violent events of July 16-21.\n",

        "full_article": "The countrywide turmoil and the overall depressing scenario prevailing for well over a fortnight are highly likely to leave an adverse impact on exports, especially that of apparel. This is particularly because the country's number one export product is largely reliant on overseas buyers' preference which, for valid reasons, may shift if they consider the atmosphere here uncongenial. For some time now, a growing discontent has been observed among major brands and retailers over issues such as, long lead time, energy and power shortage in exporting factories and a lack of compliance with labour rights. Exporters have been saying that buyers are placing more orders with Vietnam and China recently, due mainly to shorter delivery times. According to them, lead time for importing and processing for export has become longer-to 70-80 days from 50-55 days in the recent past. Echoing the feeling a global study '2024 fashion industry benchmarking', jointly conducted by the United States Fashion Industry Association (USFIA) and the University of Delaware, says retailers in the United States are diversifying their sourcing base beyond China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh to mitigate the rising geopolitical risks, adding that while Asia remains the dominant apparel sourcing base, the leading buyers are planning to gradually shift to other potential sources. The study says seven of the top ten most-utilised apparel sourcing destinations among the respondents in 2024 are Asia-based, but the order of the top Asian suppliers has changed. The study report further states that shipping delays, supply-chain disruptions, and political instability related to sourcing have lately emerged as top concerns among US brands and retailers.According to the study nearly 60 per cent of respondents plan to expand apparel sourcing from India over the next two years, exceeding the planned expansion from any other Asian country. On the other hand, about 48 per cent of respondents expressed interest in expanding apparel sourcing from Bangladesh over the next two years-- down from 52 per cent in 2023 and 58 per cent in 2022. Additionally, a higher percentage of respondents sourced from Cambodia (75 per cent utilisation rate), Indonesia (75 per cent utilisation rate), and Pakistan (61 per cent utilisation rate) this year, the report said. The report also states that Bangladesh has still remained the topmost competitive country in terms of product prices with a score of 4.0 among all apparel manufacturing countries. The average rating for Vietnam, the second most price-competitive country, has been found to be 3.5.The study no doubt has rightly pointed out the key issues causing concern for the US brands and retailers in sourcing from Bangladesh. In fact, local exporters, too, were concerned about the problems vis-\u00e0-vis the relative advantage of sourcing from some competing countries. However, this must not dishearten them. The fact that Bangladesh, despite so many challenges since the dismantling of the MFA quota regime way back in 2005, has been struggling hard to successfully secure its position among the lead exporting nations explains the commitment and resilience of the exporting community. To ride out the prevailing odds, the government should be forthcoming in resolving some of the critical issues constraining production and exports.",

        "full_article": "Called the greatest show on earth, the Olympics showcases the soaring human spirit at its summit in multidisciplinary games and sports. The beauty of the competition unfolds in myriad forms of physical ability, skills, tactics, resourcefulness of mind, endurance or perseverance and the indomitable will to prevail in the toughest of competitions and conditions. So keen and close are the competitions that the victor and the vanquished feel deep in their heart the rival is but an alter ego. This is where lies the uniqueness of the Olympics. Unfortunately the world today is not at peace with itself where fractious politics gets the better of the cardinal virtues of fellow feeling and human bond. The so called moral guardians of nations have no qualms about fuelling conflicts and violence across wide swathes of the globe because that serves their interests by way of making parties dependent on their arms, military hardware and financial helps. Such a conflict-ridden world needs the message of amity, peace and friendship in rivalry as upheld in Olympic villages and competition venues. Political leadership of the host country often tries to exploit the mileage of hosting such a gala sports meet. Both political bonhomie and commercial interests can be served through astute diplomacy on the side of the great event. But the competitors bother little about who their opponents are. Well, a partisan crowd may at times behave unsportingly as did those in the gallery during the Olympic football match between Argentina and Morocco. Then the supporters of the host country simply gave a poor and deplorable account of themselves when they booed and even threw a water bottle at British cyclist Thomas Pidcock, the ultimate winner of the cross-country mountain bike race, which he parried with one of his hands only seconds before crossing the finishing line. The Olympics 2024 marking the return of this prestigious event to the land of the father of the modern Olympic games, Pierre de Coubertin has kicked off under the shadow of serious security concern. Sabotage carried out in the small hours of Friday disrupted France's much vaunted railway system on the big day. Bomb scares also triggered evacuation at airports across that country on the inaugural day. Then internet cables were severed causing disruption to internet services in France. Such attacks bring back the memory of the Munich massacre in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team at the 1972 Munich Olympic games along with one German policeman and five Palestinian militants of the Black September, a militant organisation, were killed.Certainly, the French President's calculation for reaping political mileage has misfired against the backdrop of the election that barely secured his presidential positions and the strategic withdrawal of candidates by the New Popular Front (NFP) comprising the Socialist, Green and Communist Parties undercut the expected majority of the far right National Rally (RN) of Marie Le Pen. Europeans have not only adversaries in migrant militants but also in hard-line political opponents who are capturing newer territories such as Italy. The Paris Olympics could be the right occasion to send a message of peace and universal brotherhood against the rising ultra-right voices in Europe. However, the acts of sabotage amid the tight security clamped on the city have cast a shadow of doubt on the maintenance of the liberal and democratic values in that part of the world. Not only politics but society is getting uglier, brutal and dehumanised almost all across the world. Israel has been carrying out a systematic genocide in Palestine in defiance of the ineffectual angel that the United Nations has lately become thanks to the United States' unwavering support for the Zionist regime. The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh by Israeli air strike in Iranian capital Tehran has all the potential of escalating the war far beyond the Gaza-Israel border. World economy, particularly that of the common people, still finds itself in a moribund state by the successive blows from the corona pandemic and the Ukraine war. Intriguingly, the rich have found it rather most propitious for amassing wealth. According to the Oxfam's latest estimate, the top one per cent of the wealthiest in the world has accumulated wealth by $42 trillion over the past decade. This is 34 times more than the bottom 50 per cent. The average wealth for the rich soared by $400,000 per person whereas it grew by only $335 for the bottom half of the world population.The rising outrageous inequality has pushed the underprivileged to the fringe and with their back to the wall, they are seething with rage. Events like the Olympics can be used as a good distraction from such gross economic injustice. Contrarily, it can also help foster better understanding between athletes and subsequently the peoples in ways inconceivable otherwise. When an island nation with a population less than a million can be the most successful nation in a game--- rugby that is---winning gold in 2016 and 2020 and silver at this Olympics, it sends a most positive message to the world. The journey of Adriana Oliva Ruano, originally a gymnast at the London Olympics in 2012, to this year's competition in women's trap shooting in Paris is more fascinating than any fairy tale. A gymnastic career-ending injury at the age of only 16 with six damaged vertebrae, she opted for trap shooting at the advice of her doctor and now she is the Olympic champion with a record score of 45 out of 50. This is how human spirit at its most excellent triumphs against overwhelming odds and undying hopes in the heart of so finite a structure cross the boundary to infinity to attain immortality. To address the yawning inequality, the world needs a spirit and collective hopes of such an order.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Flouting the building construction regulations and ignoring the city development authorities' approval have become so rampant in Bangladesh that it will be nearly impossible to find any fully compliant building. One of the main reasons for Dhaka being an unliveable city is such habitual flouting of building regulations.According to the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for 2022-35, 95,000 new buildings were constructed in the capital during the 2006-2016 period, but only 4.6 per cent of the structures were built with proper approval of the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK). It is obvious that the violation of such regulations outside Dhaka would be worse, as government and local government agencies concerned there are lax about construction of structures. In Dhaka, the situation has reached such a point that almost no building owner considers the construction of floors beyond the RAJUK-approved limit an offence.The RAJUK has lately acknowledged it and wants to legalise buildings by imposing fines depending on the extent of violations, at a meeting of the parliamentary panel on the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. Legalising the non-compliant structures is in discussion at a time when the capital development authorities are introducing a new floor area ratio or FAR, much to the disappointment of land developers and landowners who have plans to construct buildings. The introduction of the new FAR will drastically reduce the permissible total floor area of buildings, particularly those in non-posh areas. Despite strict opposition from different stakeholders, the RAJUK is moving forward with its plan, arguing that the areas where roads are narrower and population density is higher should have lower FAR.There is no denying the fact that unauthorised building construction and floor construction beyond permissible limit have contributed greatly to the population density and narrow roads. But the question arises, who is responsible for such violations --- developers or building owners alone or RAJUK people too? As the sole agency for planning and supervising the development of the capital and its adjoining areas, the RAJUK has full responsibility for unplanned urban development. The organisation has offices in different parts of the capital to supervise construction and ensure all buildings and structures are constructed in compliance with relevant rules and regulations. Most people in our society are prone to violations of regulations for their own benefit, but if a statutory organisation like RAJUK plays the role of an onlooker, what is the justification for its existence? If the buildings constructed in the non-posh areas did not flout the regulations, the situation would not be so grave there. It would not be illogical to ask why one who is planning to construct a building on one's own land will suffer for violation of law by a construction company and inaction or failure on the part of RAJUK to ensure compliance of the legal provisions. Sure enough, the merit of the new FAR is contentious but if it still wants to go ahead, it should attach due importance to other priorities. It should identify the violators of the building regulations and take strict measures against them. The mere imposition of fines will not help bring any ultimate benifit to the urban areas. If the violators can go scot-free or have their misdeeds justified by just paying some fines, it will simply encourage others to violate the regulations, turning the city more chaotic and unliveable.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

The continued use of single-use plastic is responsible for heavy pollution, threatening the sea, rivers, lakes, and fish species in Bangladesh. It has emerged as one of the major environmental threats to the country.To gradually eliminate polythene bags from the market, entrepreneurs can introduce jute bags as an alternative. Jute bags are eco-friendly products that can create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs.However, the jute sector has been experiencing a decline and requires support from the government to revive it. Providing subsidies, credit facilities, and technical assistance to jute farmers and manufacturers would be sufficient to help the industry. If jute bags gain popularity locally, other countries can learn from our sustainable entrepreneurs.\nMohammed Ayman Bin Kamran ChowdhuryStudentSchool Of Business and Economics,North South University[email\u00a0protected]",
