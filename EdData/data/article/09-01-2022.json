But by quickly blaming the Punjab government and the State police, the Central functionaries triggered a blame game that has forestalled the possibility of a fair and credible inquiry into the incident. Two parallel inquiries have been announced, one by the Centre and another by the State, both of which are on hold until Monday when the Supreme Court of India will hear a plea on the issue. Discussions on national security are always surcharged in India but at least this one involving the personal security of the Prime Minister should have been more tempered. Union Ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party functionaries turned this into yet another loyalty test, and resorted to hyperbole. India takes the security of its Prime Minister very seriously. After all, a sitting Prime Minister, a former Prime Minister, and the leader revered as the father of the nation are among the list of the country\u2019s assassinated leaders. The Special Protection Group (SPG), with an outlay of around \u20b9600 crore in 2020 and around 3,000 personnel has just one job \u2014 protect one person, the Prime Minister. The critical question that is to be probed is who made the decision that the Prime Minister could, and should, travel by road for more than 100 km, from Bathinda to Ferozepur and what inputs went into making that decision. Assuming that someone concluded that it was advisable for the Prime Minister to be on the road for nearly two hours, the process that preceded it must be probed. It was also decided that the Prime Minister should not be using a helicopter as was originally planned. The route was identified in advance as a contingency plan, but the decision to use it was made at the last moment \u2014 a version that both the State and Central governments agree on. Various scenarios involving miscommunication, misinformation and misjudgment are possible. Protesters who blocked the route were reportedly unaware of the Prime Minister\u2019s travel. As the Union Home Minister said, accountability must be fixed, and loopholes must be plugged. Considering the mutual distrust the State and the Centre have now public, a Supreme Court-monitored probe could be a good way to get to the bottom of the matter in a credible manner. This episode must also lead to a more efficient protocol for the Prime Minister\u2019s travel, and a repurposing of the SPG, if required. Meanwhile, loose talk, diatribe and electioneering on the issue must be shunned at all cost.",

Kazakhstan, which broke away from the Soviet Union to become an independent republic in 1991, has been tightly ruled by \u201cstrong men\u201d ever since. Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country\u2019s powerful leader, stepped down as President in 2019, but retained an outsize influence over the government of his cherry-picked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The capital city was named after Mr. Nazarbayev as Nur-Sultan and his statues erected across the country. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Nazarbayev, who embodies the old regime, was the centre of public anger. The protesters, chanting slogans, such as \u201cold man out\u201d, burned his statues. Shaken by the mass gatherings and violence, Mr. Tokayev took a series of swift measures to quell the unrest. He reversed the fuel price hike, sacked his Cabinet and replaced Mr. Nazarbayev as the Security Council\u2019s chair with himself. He has also requested the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization for help. A willing Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, quickly despatched troops.Not many had foreseen a crisis of this proportion coming. But Kazakhstan has witnessed growing labour and ethnic unrest in recent years. Despite its oil wealth, low salaries and poor working conditions have always been issues. Many hoped that Mr. Tokayev would bring in change. But they saw Mr. Nazarbayev continuing to pull the strings. The pandemic-induced economic slowdown and soaring inflation made matters worse. Public resentment was building up against the ruling elite over the years, and the fuel price hike did just light the fuse, triggering protests first in Zhanaozen, a city in the western Mangystau Region that had seen unrest in the recent past. It spread to other parts of the country quickly, especially to Almaty, the largest city where the mob stormed the Mayor\u2019s office. The protesters, emboldened by the concessions the regime has made, now demand political reforms. For Mr. Tokayev, this is the biggest crisis of his presidency, but also an opportunity. It is a crisis because in a country where the public was taught to adulate their rulers, the violent clashes raise both political and security challenges to the ruling elite. On the other side, it is an opportunity for the President to come out of the shadows of the old regime. The outcome of the current crisis would largely depend on the choices he would make. Dealing with the protests only through force, including with help from Russia \u2014 the Belarus model \u2014 would not resolve the underlying issues. The other option, the most sensible one, is to reach out to the angry public, hold consultations and build consensus to enter a new social contract with the people of Kazakhstan.",

        "full_article": "Did you know that Bangladeshi girls and boys won four gold medals at the International Robot Olympiad (IRO) last month? Since 1999, girls and boys from around the world have been competing here every year with their amazing ideas and the robots they build. In 2021, Team Bangladesh won four gold, two silver, five bronze, and four technical medals at the IRO. This is an achievement that should encourage many more youngsters to enter the amazing world of robotics. As a nation, we should be proud and assured that amid myriad problems, we are producing intelligent youngsters\u2014our first robot builders. I humbly acknowledge the tremendous work done by the organisers and promoters behind this success. But how do we make this success permanent? We have the human capital, our leadership has embraced the vision too, but are the institutions ready to lead?\nAI (artificial intelligence) is a buzzword that engenders both fear and hope. This is because AI can automate many tasks resulting in cheaper, faster, and better performance than humans. So, economies that are embracing AI-based automation have greater leverage than others. This means that a novel digital divide among the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\" is lurking in the corner. Many international institutions like PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and Mckinsey have forecasts on how many tasks of almost all economic sectors will be replaced by AI-backed automation. There will be new jobs and roles added to the economies, while many traditional jobs will become obsolete.\nHowever, AI is in its nascent state. Even the developed nations have only started harnessing AI. Also, unlike previous technologies, AI is less about infrastructure and more about knowledge and education. Hence, any nation with a planned educational scheme can reap its full benefits. However, the first step is to have a practical and context-aware strategy.\nThe Bangladesh government's ICT Division portal hosts a draft AI strategy. According to that draft, a task force was supposed to be established by 2019, prototype development and piloting was due to be done by 2021, and data-driven directive generation and a fully trained workforce are supposed to be in place by 2024. However, a prolonged web search failed to provide any information regarding the progress of this strategy. Meanwhile, Oxford Insights' Government AI Readiness Index 2020 tells us that Bangladesh ranks 123rd among 172 countries, and in the regional ranking, we are 14th among 16. One of the parameters of this index is \"vision,\" where Bangladesh scores zero.\nThere are a couple of other indices that are also relevant to understanding our technology readiness. One of them is a Portulans Institute's Network Readiness Index, based on parameters like technology competitiveness, governance, individuals' readiness, and social and economic conditions. According to the 2021 index, Bangladesh ranks 95th among 130 countries, despite having a score higher than expected given its income level. In the individuals' readiness sub-index, Bangladesh ranks 104 with points lower than the lower-middle-income average. The United Nations' e-government development index (EGDI) indicates the state of digital inclusion, in 2020 EGDI, Bangladesh ranked 119th out of 193. Among its South Asian peers, Bangladesh is lagging behind India (100), Bhutan (103), and Sri Lanka (85). To sum up, these indices point out that the culture of digital inclusion in the country is not satisfactory.\nTo bring about a cultural shift, vision is necessary, but not sufficient. First, we need to focus on making the government truly digital. Bangladesh has some piecemeal solutions, but with no electronic ID or holistic data management system, and without a user-friendly interface, these interventions are fractured. The country can move forward only if the transactions between the government and the residents become secured and easy.\nSecond, we should focus on finding a way to leapfrog. As a soon-to-be developing country, Bangladesh is slowly moving towards heavy manufacturing, but the economy is still dependent on agriculture, textile, and garments. With AI, most manual tasks in these sectors will be automated. This means that we will need fewer-in-number-but-better-in-skills labour. With proper planning, new technologies infiltrate faster in societies where people do not enjoy the luxury of traditional technologies. The developing world saw faster growth of mobile phones and mobile financial services than the developed world, where there are robust landlines and banking services. This is proof that leapfrogging is possible. The key is to start with one sector and not to worry about all others. Maybe we could emphasise agriculture or textile and put all our research and planning efforts on building AI-driven appropriate technologies and engaging people.\nThird, we need to plan on infrastructure. Emphasis should be given to wider use of mobile telephony and applications. This requires ensuring robust high-speed connectivity, and sufficient wireless bandwidth. Secured applications should be designed that are usable with little tech knowledge and no language barrier. These applications will need a vast amount of data while collecting much more. These data should be made available for greater use, and the regulatory regime should ensure that personal privacy will not be at stake in the name of public safety.\nFinally, we need to plan on ensuring education for all. The critical need of a successful AI-based society is its educated residents. The focus should be on ensuring multi-disciplinary training starting from the primary level. In the AI world, emphasis should be given to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics), not STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as we need more society-aware scientists, technologists, and science-aware social workers, and creative residents. We should also emphasise making our educational institutions ready for \"continuous education,\" focusing on training and awareness for all.\nBangladesh came a long way in 50 years. However, the next phase of our growth depends on a knowledge-based society. If we want to ensure development, we will have to embrace AI. Our youngsters are ready; we need to ensure that the adults have put a proper plan in place.\n\u00a0\nDr Moinul Zaber\u00a0is senior academic fellow at the Operating Unit on Policy-Driven Electronic Governance (UNU-EGOV) in United Nations University (UNU), Guimaraes, Portugal.

        "full_article": "A year ago, on January 6, armed, violent supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol. Lawmakers hid in fear of their lives. Trump's Vice-President Mike Pence faced a real threat of being hanged for performing his ceremonial duty and declaring Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 elections.\nIt was, to echo the words of President Franklin Roosevelt, \"a day that will live in infamy.\" The events of that day were an ominous warning. Democracy faces an existential threat in the US\u2014an unprecedented development in any Western democracy since World War II.\nThe crisis may have been triggered by Trump, but that is not where the real danger lies, a vital point to which I shall return.\nTo be sure, the origin of this existential threat to democracy is Trump's refusal to concede after losing the 2020 presidential election. Trump's political career is littered with many dubious firsts: He is the first US president to refuse to concede after losing an election; he is the first US president to be threatened that his mike would be switched off in a presidential debate if he didn't follow rules; and he is the first US president to lie so blatantly and often that the US media, normally deferential to the president, was forced to bring itself to call Trump a liar so often that the fact itself became passe.\nTrump's lies have ranged from the frivolous (he said it didn't rain during his inauguration, when it did) to the silly (Trump said the Boy Scouts chief told him he had given the greatest speech to them ever. The Boy Scouts chief confirmed he said no such thing). Sometimes his lies were no laughing matter. His litany of untruthful remarks about the coronavirus (it was like the flu, the situation was \"totally under control,\" the virus was \"disappearing\") had profound adverse consequences.\nTrump's most consequential lie is his claim to have won the 2020 presidential election. This is a breach of one of the loftiest traditions of American politics. No matter how bitter the campaign, at the end of a presidential election, the losing candidate\u2014whether Republican or Democratic\u2014makes a gracious concession speech, which reaffirms the strength of American democracy. The sustenance of democracy, after all, depends on the consent of the defeated.\nTrump and his supporters stubbornly claim to have won despite no evidence.\nThe real damage\u2014and it is far from clear that US democracy will recover from it\u2014is the vicious, mindless nature of the assault on the American electoral system.\nTrump and his supporters filed a slew of lawsuits, all of which have been thrown out of court\u2014frequently by judges appointed by Trump himself. Unsubstantiated claims of rigging, false voting, machine tampering have been made and debunked.\nHowever, the reason American democracy is staring at a yawning abyss is not Trump or his cohorts so much as the complete meltdown of the Republican Party.\nAwful as Trump's depredations have been, what has been stunning to behold is the complete moral bankruptcy of the Republican Party. Eight US senators and 139 House members\u2014all Republicans\u2014have refused to accept Biden's victory. There is a wry saying about American politics: \"If you think the politicians are bad, you should see the constituents.\" According to a University of Massachusetts at Amherst poll in December last year, 71 percent of Republican Party supporters don't believe Biden is the legitimately elected president.\nThe intraparty Republican political bloodletting is reminiscent of Soviet-era purges. Georgia presents a depressing case study. Its popular Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are robust Trump supporters. Both face a remarkably odd predicament. As they gear up for re-election, they face intraparty rivals\u2014an extraordinarily rare thing for an elected official. Why? Both Kemp and Raffensperger had refused to subvert the presidential elections in Georgia in 2020, and Trump, in a fit of spite, has backed Republican rivals to unseat both of them.\nIn a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, Trump supporters have made blanket support for his big lie a litmus test. Equivocation is not acceptable, and the cult-like support they demand is completely untethered from consideration of facts.\nThe disquieting upshot of all of this is that American politics has entered a new era. Today, only partisan victory is an acceptable outcome to most Republicans. In the Republican Party, voices of reason and ethical democratic norms are marginalised to the point of extinction as Trumpier elements merrily rule the roost.\nDemocracy made a narrow escape in the 2020 elections. One reason was that election officials\u2014including Republicans\u2014refused to compromise the integrity of the electoral system.\nBetween threats to impartial election officials, unsubstantiated claims of malpractice whenever the results go the other way, and a vicious partisan mindset immune to facts, it is not clear at all the US will be so lucky next time.\n\u00a0\nAshfaque Swapan\u00a0is a writer and editor based in Atlanta, US.\n",

        "full_article": "I cannot say for sure what 2022 will bring for every person on this planet, but for me it signifies a bend in the road. Last year is gone, and I can only hope that the new one will bring for us all exciting experiences, fewer worries, new opportunities, and more fulfilment.\nAt the end of each year, I usually write a column appropriate for the occasion. I not only feel the thrill that the last month of the year, particularly the last few days of December, brings to a writer, but also consider it my humble responsibility and honour to share with my readers my dreams, my frustrations, or my aspirations as the new year rolls around. After all, a new year is supposed to herald a new beginning, invoke a sense of joy, and give us hope for the future.\nI can remember how I welcomed the First Night since I reached adulthood. In 1977, the year I first came to the USA, we teamed up with some of my Bangladeshi fellow students at Boston University and walked on a cold night from our campus to downtown. I still have photographs from 1978 New Year's Eve, when we got together with some couples from the Indian sub-continent and had a blast in a graduate student's apartment. And, as far as I can remember, our New Year's celebrations at Dhaka were some of the best.\nI cannot say I feel all this sense of anticipation nowadays. The last two years have been a roller-coaster ride for humanity with Covid-19, economic uncertainty, lockdowns, and the after-effects of the pandemic. It was not like this ever, as far as I can remember.\nThrough this column, I would like to extend my best wishes for a happy new year to the readers of The Daily Star. I hope that 2022 is a peaceful, prosperous and stimulating year for you. I will also touch upon three areas here: the lessons learnt from the past, where we can go in the future, and the prospects for the global community in the coming days.\nThey say hindsight is 20/20, and while I do not agree with this aphorism, it seems we have seen some good years in the decade of the 2010s. But how could we have anticipated Covid-19 at the beginning of 2020? Who could have foreseen that the pandemic triggered by this deadly disease would still be with us after two years and still causing so much disruption and complications?\nFor me, some of the most lasting recollections from 2021 are the continuous rise in the cost of living, the loss of family and friends, shortened or cancelled travel plans, and the fear instilled by Delta and then Omicron variants. Fortunately, we started getting vaccinated, and now some countries have started on the \"fourth jab\".\u00a0\nBut what about the rest of the world? A group of World Health Organization experts is calling for 70 percent of the global population to be fully vaccinated by mid-2022. As I write this column, vaccines are still in short supply in Africa and healthcare facilities in most developing countries are stretched to the limit. Howsoever we define the term \"vaccinated\", the overwhelming majority of the population in many countries remain unvaccinated. A map informed by data, compiled from government sources by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, shows that countries in vast swaths of Africa and the Middle East have more than 90 percent of the citizens without any vaccination.\nSo, another year has gone by. Countless people around the globe felt a sense of loss, either because of Covid-related deaths or other setbacks. Rabindranath Tagore, I recall, wrote a song many years ago that captures the mood of our times\u2014the emptiness and the overwhelming sense of vacuum. He wrote: \"Kokhon jey boshonto gelo, ebar holo na gaan.\" (When did spring end? Didn't even hear any music.) In our case, 2020 and 2021 were two long years when spring came and we did not celebrate. We did not sing and all the festivities we had planned did not happen.\nNow in 2022, we all are wondering what the new year will bring. Last year was a tragic one for many. After the vaccines became available towards the end of 2020, many of us had hoped that the pandemic would be over and we'd be able to go about our daily business as before. We'd travel, meet our family and friends more often, take our children and grandchildren to birthday parties and other social gatherings, go out and eat in a restaurant, and do away with many other activities that the multitude of restrictions\u2014social distancing, masking, and fear and uncertainty\u2014had imposed on us.\nThat did not happen. But many other changes took place to deal with the ongoing ravages of Covid-19. More people are working from home, online shopping boomed, and social exchanges are mostly \"virtual\". Last year was memorable in other ways. Bangladesh celebrated its 50th birthday, and Dhaka University turned 100. World events were plentiful, starting with mass vaccinations in some countries, the collapse of the US presence in Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed in Myanmar and Ethiopia, the failure of COP26 to deliver, and so on and so forth.\nMy hope for this year is that the warring factions particularly in Myanmar, Ukraine, Yemen, and Ethiopia will come to an agreement. The hungry and innocent will not suffer and nobody will die of hunger or drown while seeking a better life. The gains from economic growth and vaccinations will be shared equitably.\nAt the end of each year, my favourite magazine, The New Yorker, publishes a section named \"Remembrances and Postscripts\". I will not burden my readers with my own version of recollections from the best and worst moments of the last year, but I can't resist the temptation to share with you a glimpse into my world, tinged with sadness, as I ring out 2021.\u00a0\nAt this juncture, all indications point to a burgeoning year for the world's economy. Inflation and supply chain hiccups will ease, and all other indicators point to a good but bumpy year. One of the curses of the pandemic economy is the volatility in major markets. Carbon emissions are down, and while it is a common practice to blame climate changes for all weather-related mishaps, we know that things were getting better.\u00a0\nFinally, a word to cheer you up. I will quote therapist Monique Bellefleur, who said in The Boston Globe (\"The 2022 Mind-Set\"): Be gentle with yourself. Beating yourself up for not functioning at your highest level or for not having your dream body will only make you feel bad. When we feel bad, we tend to turn to our most unhealthy coping mechanisms, which ultimately distance us even further from our personal goals. Try self-compassion and consideration of our current world context instead. Of course, you're tired, unmotivated, sad, etc.\u2014we are in the third year of a global pandemic and that cannot be discounted.\n\u00a0\nDr. Abdullah Shibli is an economist and serves as Senior Research Fellow at the US-based International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI).

        "full_article": "It was in the foothills of the Himalayas that he was born. In a bullock cart amid a snowstorm. It was in the cold chill of January, in the severest winter in Bangladesh's memory, that he died. Alone and uncared for, the frail old man shrunken with age, but with a heart as wide as the ocean, and a mind as young as the children that he loved, Golam Kasem, nicknamed Daddy, died at the tender age of 103. The single-storey yellow building at 73 Indira Road, with its unkempt garden, was home not only to Bangladesh's oldest photographer, but also the first Bengali Muslim short story writer.\nBorn on November 5, 1894, Daddy lost his mother shortly after birth. Raised by his aunt, the young man took up photography the way many young men take up many things\u2014to impress a young girl. She had promised to cook for him if he could develop a film that others had failed to. Kasem embarked with the same trait for disciplined research that he maintained till his death. He went around the studios of Medinipur to find out the method that would win him his meal. He never talked of what the meal was like, but did describe how he used a hardener to prevent the emulsion from peeling off. Saving his bus fare to school to buy a brownie camera, he began taking photographs of the things he loved most: animals, flowers and children. And most importantly, he preserved those negatives. In his archives, amid old paper sachets marked in his neat handwriting are glass plates dating back to 1915.\u00a0The harbour in Calcutta, early steam engines, the Gurkha regiment in shorts, and many many portraits. Period pieces lit in that soft natural light that early studios used.\nGrainless negatives of people, generally in studied poses. His spontaneous pictures were those of animals and children, and among them are some gems. \"Her first dance\" is a delicate photograph of a child amid a twirl, centre stage with her family as an audience. Strong portraits of his friend, a teacher, and the calm portrait of his grandmother belie the fact that he was an amateur who took photographs for fun. He sold his first photograph at the age of 98, for Drik's 1991 calendar.\nThe founder of the Camera Recreation Club, Daddy arranged regular meetings at his house in Indira Road where the club was housed. Regular visitors included poet Sufia Kamal, painter Quamrul Hassan, and photographer Manzoor Alam Beg. His letters were hand-written, each one numbered, and the envelopes were often made of recycled newspapers or book wrappings. Competitions at the Camera Recreation Club were unusual events. Photographers who would abstain from many local competitions would submit those small 4\u2033x5\u2033 prints. And they were proud of the simple prizes they sometimes won. The prize giving was always accompanied by a cultural programme. And Daddy would always sing.\nThe room next to his bedroom was his darkroom. A red plastic bowl stuck under a light bulb\u2014his safe light. He mixed his own chemicals from old tins of chemicals. Often, I would get an SOS\u2014in the same neat handwriting, asking for potassium ferricyanide or some other chemical that he needed for his latest experiment. Photography was his passion. Once during a meeting at the Bangladesh Photographic Society (BPS), where he had been presented a new camera, Daddy spoke of how the camera he had been given would be much more than a machine to him. He talked of how he kept his camera next to his pillow when he went to sleep. How, when he was sad, he would speak to it, and that it would talk back and comfort him. Unimpressed by the modern motor-driven models, his preference was a simple manual SLR, \"preferably not too heavy,\" he would add with a mischievous smile.\nThat is not to say he was shy of technology. I remember him holding up his thick glasses to read his first email from his grandson in Canada. He asked me to come back the next day, and as I parked my bicycle by his rose garden, he was ready with his answer, again written in his neat handwriting. He was fascinated by email and used it regularly, and curious about how the message would get through the ether.\nDaddy was fiercely independent. He cooked his own meals, fed his dog and cats, and did his own shopping. Until recently, he would even go on his own to a house down the road and guide himself up the stairs to meet a lady friend whom he occasionally visited. Rarely would he talk of himself, and it was only in passing conversation with the late Nasiruddin that I discovered that Daddy was the first Bengali Muslim short story writer. He used to write regularly for \"Saogat,\" and continued to write, both technical articles on photography for the BPS newsletter, and short stories for general publication. His last manuscript, a simple manual on photography, sadly lies in my hands, unpublished. He had dearly wanted it printed before he died. The proofing was complete, the photographs selected, but \"matters of consequence\" allowed other projects to take precedence. His last note, urging me on with the publication, will forever haunt me.\nAlways articulate, on his 100th birthday, at the opening of a joint photographic exhibition by him and the other photographic guru Manzoor Alam Beg at Drik Gallery, he talked eloquently of how photography was the way for people of the world to make friends, to break barriers, to discover one another. Later as the chief guest at the opening of the 1996 World Press Photo Awards, he talked of his own struggle to overcome the limitations of an ageing body. \"My body says no, but my mind says you must, and in the end, it is the mind that wins.\" On January 9, 1998, the body finally said no and the mind took wings.\n\u00a0\nShahidul Alam\u00a0is a photographer and an activist, and founder of Drik and Pathshala South Asian Media Institute.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is saddening that the building that once housed East Bengal's first art and craft school, Maheshwarpasha Art School, is set to be demolished and replaced by a new structure. While the identity and location of the school itself changed a few times since its establishment in 1904, the building where it was first located is recognised by art historians for its cultural significance. In a statement dated March 14, 1975, poet Jasimuddin and artists Quamrul Hasan and Nilima Ibrahim had also stressed the need to preserve the school for posterity. So, despite this, why is it that the Khulna City Corporation (KCC) is considering demolishing it?\nIt should be noted that the building currently houses a school named Shashibhushan Shishu Vidya Niketan. Even if a similar building is erected in its place for the students, it is not going to be the same, and over a century of history will have been lost simply because we didn't appreciate the importance of preserving buildings and sites of historical significance. The move to construct a new building after the demolition drive also reeks of poor planning at best and historical amnesia at worst, as the present school could easily be moved elsewhere. The bottom line is, nothing justifies the demolition or alteration of such a significant structure.\nWe would like to urge local authorities to investigate how this outcome can be avoided, and to find out the best possible way to preserve its rich cultural history. As experts have said, turning the building into an art gallery could be one way of engaging tourists with local heritage, as well as the school's own history. At the same time, we also need to see the bigger picture here: this is not an isolated incident. Such buildings and sites are, after all, being sacrificed at the altar of development on a regular basis. Therefore, we would urge the government to stop this onslaught and identify more such vulnerable buildings and take immediate steps to preserve them. With a proper plan, these can then be transformed into tourist destinations giving local tourism a much-needed boost. We need to understand that buildings such as these are more than brick and mortar. It's time we accepted this with the sobriety it deserves.\n",

        "full_article": "It is hard to believe that a river would be pushed to slow but certain death for the sake of a so-called development project undertaken by a government agency. A report by this daily on Saturday reveals how the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) has filled up around 26 acres of the Kuhelia river in Cox's Bazar's Moheshkhali upazila to build a two-lane road. The river has now turned into a narrow stream due to this massive encroachment. Reportedly, when the RHD gave the proposal to the land ministry to acquire land for the project, the latter had turned it down. Even then, the RHD moved ahead with the project ignoring the ministry's prohibition.\nWhen a government agency does something like that, and so blatantly, it shows where our priorities lie as a nation. Is it any wonder then that local land grabbers feel emboldened to do the same ignoring river protection laws and Supreme Court directives in that regard? According to law, no one can hinder the natural flow of a river or fill up the flood plains of any river for any purpose. The High Court also gave some very important directives in 2019 declaring rivers as \"living entities\", while condoning strict punishment for polluters and grabbers.\nHowever, very little has changed after those directives were given. News of our rivers being encroached or polluted by those in power or enjoying their patronage is getting quite frequent. Sadly, the perpetrators are hardly ever brought under the law. This daily has reported the sad condition of a few of our rivers in the last month alone\u2014the Sonai River and the Old Khowai River in Habiganj district, for example, which are just two cases that recently exposed our failure to protect the rivers.\nIn case of the Kuhelia River, the RHD and the district administration had given the project proposal to the ministry by hiding some basic facts: while the RHD did not mention in its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report that construction work would require earth filling, the Cox's Bazar district administration mentioned the river area as \"ponds\" and \"ditches\" in the proposal sent to the land ministry. What is more, the RHD is continuing with the construction work ignoring the PMO's recommendation to build the road away from the river.\nWe, therefore, urge the government to take immediate steps against the RHD officials and those in the Cox's Bazar administration involved in the Kuhelia River grabbing, which is a punishable offence according to our law. Unless we can implement the law against powerful offenders, including those holding public offices, more of our rivers will face the same fate. Also, this will send a strong message to anyone who thinks they can get away with putting rivers in harm's way for their own petty interests.\n",
