The Tamil Nadu government\u2019s launch of the free breakfast scheme for schoolchildren is an instance of a policy initiative with far-reaching consequences for school education and public health. As Chief Minister M.K. Stalin himself said at the launch of the scheme, provision of free breakfast is not a freebie, but the foremost duty of a government to ensure no child goes hungry. Mr. Stalin framed his words and deeds from the promontory of the progressive Dravidian model, which promises inclusive growth for all segments of the population. A key element is the welfare of children, which explains Tamil Nadu\u2019s early emphasis on feeding children in schools. The importance of a daily breakfast as the most important meal of the day is widely acknowledged. Multiple studies across the globe indicate that eating breakfast regularly confers positive outcomes on students, affecting their ability to focus, learn and retain information positively. School performance improves, as do behaviour and cognition, but a regular breakfast also takes care of diet quality, micronutrient sufficiency, anaemia and height and weight issues in children, and is even believed to sculpt BMI scores for the future. The government has targeted providing schoolchildren an average of 293 calories and an average protein input of 9.85 gm per day. The mid-day meal that is already being provided to students in schools comes up to an average of 553 calories and 18 gm of protein, giving every student who takes the food supplied in school about 846 cal and nearly 28 gm of protein a day. The Centre\u2019s midday meal guidelines prescribe between 450-700 cals per child per day, and a protein intake of 12-20 gm per day.While the proposed menu for the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s breakfast scheme will take care of hunger, the calorific, energy and micronutrient requirements of the children, with a diet rich in local preparations and vegetables, it also has to provide adequate attention to taste and quality parameters. The government, rich with its experience of dealing with the mid-day meal scheme over several decades, must avoid the errors of omission and commission \u2014 including pilferage, poor quality of food, delays in sanctioning funds, and caste-related disruptions \u2014 that have been hurdles in its path earlier. Other State governments would also do well to be inspired by Tamil Nadu, which has allowed its intent to triumph over the state of its finances, finding money to fund this very crucial aspect of nation building \u2014 ensuring the growth and development of children.To read this editorial in Tamil, click hereTo read this editorial in Hindi, click here",

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has taken a sledgehammer to deal with YouTuber and blogger \u2018Savukku\u2019 A. Shankar, and sentenced him to a six-month jail term for some Tweets targeting the judiciary. As political commentary goes, his style of presenting his views is indeed quite trenchant. With a know-it-all air, he goes about giving purported background material, insinuating deals and designs behind developments, often without substantiation. It is no surprise then that he got into trouble. In his defence in the suo motu contempt proceedings, Mr. Shankar said his comments were aimed at questioning the under-representation of Dalits in the judiciary, and the excess representation to Brahmins, and that taken as a whole, his comments were aimed at improving the system. The court would have none of it, and deemed his comments contumacious. It noted that he expressed no regret or repentance, but affirmed that he would continue to speak about the judiciary after his release even if sent to prison. Even though Mr. Shankar made a personal insinuation against Justice Swaminathan, what really counted was his sweeping charge against the entire judiciary. This could have been dealt with by the Principal Bench in Chennai as the allegation was general in nature, but, unfortunately, it was posted before a Bench headed by Justice Swaminathan, who was the judge aggrieved by the earlier Tweet.The purported logic behind courts retaining the power to punish for contempt is to save the institution from scurrilous attack so that the public does not lose its faith and trust in the judiciary. However, recent experience, as well as public criticism by former judges and legal luminaries, shows that the principal source of public disenchantment with the judiciary is the conduct of courts and judges. In 2018, four judges of the Supreme Court publicly accused the Chief Justice of India of misusing his power as Master of the Roster to influence the outcome of cases. Can there be anything more scandalising to the judiciary? Former judges and lawyers routinely pen articles questioning the commitment of the apex court to issues of personal liberty and even hint at complicity and cravenness before the executive. Is there any point in going after laymen voicing their disenchantment with judicial wrongdoing? Criminal contempt is usually closed either by the court\u2019s tolerance or the contemnor\u2019s remorse, but, regrettably, neither happened in this case. If the court viewing any display of magnanimity as a sign of weakness is the \u2018oppressor\u2019s wrong\u2019, the defendant refusing to express regret is the \u2018proud man\u2019s contumely\u2019. In truth, any conviction for criminal contempt is unwarranted, for nothing can really scandalise a court peopled by judges of integrity or save the image of a compromised institution comprising tainted individuals.To read this editorial in Tamil, click hereTo read this editorial in Hindi, click here",

        "full_article": "Politics is indeed the art of the possible. In the Indian political context, this means that anything can happen when leaders are looking to gain or retain political power. Last month, JD(U) leader and chief minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar broke up with the BJP and entered a new alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Since then, he has met various leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Arvind Kejriwal, Akhilesh Yadav, and K Chandrashekar Rao in what is being seen as a bid to forge opposition unity.\nNitish\u2019s moves and his decision to return to the Mahagathbandhan have evoked a range of reactions. One group of observers perceived the coming together of RJD and JD(U) as a revival of Mandal politics against the BJP; another lot saw him emerging as a uniting force, giving opposition politics a new life; yet others went as far as predicting that he would emerge as an alternative to PM Narendra Modi though he himself has denied any prime ministerial ambitions; while the fourth bunch saw it as an example of his extreme political pragmatism and his desire to survive a force like the BJP rather than an attempt to revive the Mandal platform.\nBefore addressing these assumptions, I would like to submit that the political nature of the public in India has changed drastically in the recent past. Along with caste, religious and regional identities based on belonging, development issues now play an important role in determining political choices of aspirational Indians. So, any expectation of a magical impact of any caste-based political assertion may not be fully realised in the current changing political context. Secondly, shifting alliances of parties do not always mean full shifting of the political base of concerned parties in favour of a changed alliance. This was evident in the case of the BSP-SP alliance in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 parliamentary election in which both failed to transfer their voter base to each other. The weakening of OBC, Dalit community-based politics in the past few decades in various parts of India is also an indication not to make easy simplistic assumptions about the political psyche of the Indian voter.\nAfter all, the revival of Mandal-inspired political assertion can\u2019t be based just on caste calculations but also on the issues that may evoke identities and translate into electoral votes. We need to see what kind of programme Nitish Kumar and his new alliance is going to propose to mobilise OBC and other social communities in their favour. Let\u2019s not forget that the BJP has made deep inroads in the past few decades among OBCs and marginal social groups all over India. So, any chance of a strong and intense revival of Mandal politics against the BJP seems quite unlikely.\nAnother reason why Nitish Kumar\u2019s recent political act will fail to transform into the Mandal kind of mobilisational politics in a real sense is that Hindutva mobilisation has shown its capacity to submerge caste-based assertions in recent elections. I am amazed to see how dramatically the capacity of Hindutva politics for inclusion has risen, and it is this that may erode the possibility of any anti-BJP revival of Mandal politics, at least at the national level. Due to the Bihar-centric image of Nitish Kumar, it will be difficult for him to become a political messiah for OBC communities in various states, as they are politically heterogeneous and capable of embracing various political choices of which the BJP is one.\nThe post-\u201990s Indian society, which developed under the impetus of a new liberalised economy and globalisation, produced a huge middle class among OBC communities and other social groups in the country. A large section of this neo middle class seems attracted to Hindutva and works as a political base for BJP in various parts of the country.\nSo, I see Nitish\u2019s act influencing Bihar politics in some sense, but it is unlikely to influence national politics in any transformative way.\u00a0 It is true that opposition politics in India, which is largely divided and suffering from various kinds of crises, may view a face like Nitish Kumar as a rallying point, but it is still difficult to see him as a winnable alternative to Narendra Modi and the BJP in the near future. Nitish\u2019s image is also suffering from a trust deficit due to his various U-turns in the recent past. That may weaken his impact in an anti-BJP alliance.\nThe next few years will tell whether Mandal can be a challenge to Kamandal or whether the lines between the two have blurred.\n\n",

In 13 days, SC disposed of 5,200 cases and admitted 1,135 fresh matters \u2013 70,310 matters were pending as of September 1. There\u2019s a long way to go but pendency will reduce if cases disposed steadily outnumber new cases. Essentially, CJI\u2019s new listing system attempts to expedite hearings in after-notice matters, which keep getting backlogged, by listing more of them on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. Also, more fresh admission matters are being listed on Mondays and Fridays.\nWhile one two-judge bench confessed its inability to hear all the afternoon matters listed, another bench last week had critiqued a lawyer for seeking adjournment despite judges working longer hours preparing for cases since the new listing system began. Promptly filling four vacancies in SC \u2013 by November, there will be seven vacancies if these four are not filled \u2013 can reduce pressure on judges. SC should also be choosier when admitting matters. Many PILs admitted by SC end up in unhelpful court interventions in policy, political and socio-cultural issues.\nSC\u2019s urgency in whittling down pendency must also rub off on high courts where 59 lakh cases are pending. 2019 was a rare year where HCs recorded more case disposals than fresh cases. But the pandemic increased the backlog again. Like SC, around 70% of HC pendency involves admission stage matters. So similar reforms in listing must be pursued in HCs too. Central and state governments, the biggest litigants, must help in upgrading judicial infrastructure, promptly filling judicial vacancies and weeding out frivolous litigation. Why not a one-year action plan to reduce pendency from present levels by 25% in HCs and by 50% in SC?\n\n",

The Fedex age saw the rise of a sporting genius who not only brought back beauty and artistry to the game but did so, despite the flood of encomia, with humility and gentility. At his peak in the 2000s when Federer\u2019s game had reached a zen-like quality, the Swiss maestro wore his crown lightly. His on-court behaviour has always been near impeccable and off-court he remained jovial, courteous and humble despite his belief-defying achievements.\nEven more instructive for all successful people, Federer changed. As a junior talent, he was a cantankerous, racquet-smashing player. And the unconquerable game of his acme years could have turned him into a prima donna. But neither happened. This is all the more remarkable because, especially in recent media-driven decades, too many sporting superstars across disciplines have made in-your-face personalities their calling cards.\nIt was a measure of Federer\u2019s genius that greats from other sports \u2013 ranging from Tiger Woods to Sachin Tendulkar \u2013 gravitated to his matches, recognising in him a true legend. Federer further lived up to that stature when he described Rafael Nadal as his greatest rival and friend, showing that there can always be respect between fierce competitors. In that sense, the Swiss maestro represented ideals that went beyond tennis \u2013 equanimity, humility in success and never taking oneself too seriously.

        "full_article": "We are concerned at the way different government agencies have been trying to occupy the forestland of Cox's Bazar to implement their projects, disregarding the fact that doing so would further deplete what little forest coverage we have, which is critically important for our environment. The latest such attempt was made by the Department of Prison which is reportedly planning to build a prison on protected forestland in Paglirbil in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila. According to our report, after the land ministry allotted 160 acres of land to the prison department, the latter placed demarcation flags around the area. But the forest department removed those flags since no clearance was taken from them, leading to an apparent conflict between the two parties.\n\nWe are not against building a prison which will have many modern facilities for the inmates. However, we strongly oppose building it on protected forestland, and urge the government to take the project somewhere else.\nWhat becomes clear from this state of affairs is that there is hardly any coordination among the ministries and departments involved when it comes to taking or giving lease of any government land, particularly forestland. Otherwise, how can the land ministry randomly allot part of a protected forest to the prison department without following due procedure, and even without asking for approval from the forest department and the department of environment (DoE)?\nReportedly, this is not the first time that a government department has tried to grab the protected forestland of Cox's Bazar. A few years ago, the public administration ministry also planned to build a civil service academy in Cox's Bazar covering 700 acres of land that was declared a protected forest and also an ecologically critical area (ECA). Luckily, later, a parliamentary body strongly opposed the move, while the High Court also issued a stay order on it. Another such attempt was made in July this year, when a part of the Jungle Khuniya Palong reserved forest in Cox's Bazar was handed over to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) by the government for building a residential training facility with funds from FIFA. What is more shocking is that the government de-reserved the 20-acre land for this purpose. This move faced widespread criticism from environmentalists and all concerned.\nComing back to the issue of building an open prison, we would like to make it clear that we are not against building such a facility which will have many modern facilities for the inmates, including scopes for fish farming, gardening and handicraft making. However, we strongly oppose building it on protected forestland, and urge the government to take the project somewhere else where the environmental damage will be minimal. Any incursion into our fast-depleting forest areas, however noble or practical the purpose, must be thwarted.\nWe hope the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, particularly the DoE, will remain vigilant against such moves to destroy our forests. We have ample laws and court directives in this regard and all government offices must abide by them.\n",

        "full_article": "Like all offices run by the state or carrying its seal in some form, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) is not exactly a paragon of good governance. The company, whose main offering of landline service has fallen out of favour since the advent of mobile phone, has been trying to stay afloat by providing a host of related services licensed under the telecom regulator. Yet, to dodge due payments like the way it did over successive fiscal years, as recently revealed by an audit report, is a fresh reminder of how financial mismanagement has been plaguing the public sector.\n\nThis tendency to skip payments has been witnessed, albeit at irregular intervals, since the BTCL was turned into a public limited company in 2008. \nAccording to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which analysed its books for FY 2017-18, the state coffer stands at least Tk 2,258.76 crore short thanks to the BTCL's failure to share a portion of its revenues from different services. As per its licensing terms, it is obligated to deposit the money with the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), which then deposits it with the exchequer. This tendency to skip payments has been witnessed, albeit at irregular intervals, since it was turned into a public limited company in 2008. For example, it skipped payments of Tk 628.40 crore earned from handling local phone calls, and of Tk 944.56 crore earned from handling incoming and outgoing international phone calls, from October 2008 to June 2014. It continued to skip payments later \u2013 notably in landline and international internet gateway services \u2013 despite repeated requests from the BTRC.\nClearly, the BTCL doesn't feel as bound to its regulator, or by relevant rules, as any institution handling public money should. The CAG audit team also found that the BTCL's internal control system was weak, with no responsible officer or cell for monitoring payment of dues. There was no trace of an internal audit system either. All this explains why, despite huge investment made over the years, this once-profitable company has been racking up losses since FY 2009-10. All the modernisation projects taken up since, as well as ongoing projects, seem to have had little effect on its outdated (read: questionable) modus operandi.\nUnfortunately, the BTCL is only the latest in a growing list of state agencies and departments to have been embroiled in accounting scandals. Over the past three weeks, we have had similarly damning CAG reports on the Directorate General of Food, the Directorate General of Health Services, public hospitals, the ministries of agriculture and fisheries and livestock, Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, etc. What was common in all of them was how such irregularities and corruption were allowed to persist year after year without any effective oversight. What's equally problematic is the lack of official response to this Auditgate scandal.\nWe urge the government to take these audit objections seriously and impose strict discipline on the relevant authorities, including of BTCL, to make them accountable. This situation cannot continue anymore.\n",

        "full_article": "In recent news, the government is on the verge of initiating \"Expatriate\u00a0Diplomacy\". The objective of this brand of diplomacy will be to tackle the \"negative propaganda\" coming from non-resident migrant and immigrant Bangladeshis, as well as to highlight the positive aspects of Bangladesh.\nThe foreign ministry claimed that they have a lot of positive information, but there are not enough writers. Thus, they are looking for \"columnists\" (read: mercenaries), who will get remuneration for writing about this.\nSome issues and questions arise in this context.\nFirst, only five to seven people are allegedly spreading \"negative propaganda\" from abroad. Their communication is based on online news portals, Facebook and YouTube. The foreign ministry claims these people will heavily enhance their propaganda efforts during the 18 months before the next election. Thus, \"expatriate\u00a0diplomacy\" will be kick-started to deal with this.\nThe culprits will be identified and their whereabouts shared with their respective host country's authorities, who will then be asked to take due action. Also, \"mercenary columnists\" will be paid to write about the government's good deeds. However, it has not been clarified whether these writeups will be published on local or international media.\nPreviously, the government struck a similar deal with international news outlet CNN. This was reported in The Daily Star on June 3, 2021, where a headline read \"The government yesterday teamed up with global news networking giant CNN International for the promotion of \"Made in Bangladesh\" products worldwide.\"\nThe objective was to highlight the positive aspects of Bangladesh and increase exports. We did not get any further information about the money spent on this, and how we fared against these objectives.\nSecondly, the state-owned television network BTV can be watched from every nook and corner of the nation. BTV only highlights the positive aspects of the government, which claims it is the most popular channel. Every day, multiple talk shows focus on the government's development activities. The satellite channels are also forced to show BTV's news.\nOn top of that, there are almost 25 private channels in the country. All these channels highlight the government's development efforts with utmost importance. Every talk show ensures equal participation from pro- and anti-government individuals. If there are two speakers, at least one of them is bound to be a ruling party leader or supporter.\nSo the question is, why can't BTV tackle these five to seven YouTube and Facebook-based \"negative propaganda\" practitioners? Does this mean more people watch Facebook videos and YouTube channels than BTV? Does this also mean the content generated by leaders, ministers and pro-government individuals on so many TV channels are inadequate in dealing with online content that feature these handful of individuals?\nApart from a few, most of the online portals that are run by migrants are quite obscure. Among the local online portals, including print media and its online versions, only four to five publish articles criticising the government. Very few columnists can be termed as critical or severely critical of the government. So why do we need to search for columnists? If the people do not accept the positive writings of so many columnists, why would they accept content coming from paid writers?\nA cursory look at party publications can also give us insight into current realities. Take, for example, Banglar Bani, which was once Awami League's publication. If bought and read by AL leaders, supporters and workers, its circulation would have been over three to four crores. But Banglar Bani went out of business.\nThen there is Dinkaal, BNP's newspaper. It is still being published, although the circulation is negligible. BNP leaders, workers and supporters neither buy nor read Dinkaal.\nWhy is this so? Because, people do not read anything other than truth and reality. This applies equally to ordinary people and party members. Banglar Bani and Dinkaal are burning examples.\nIn recent times, reports of \"enforced disappearances\" and people going \"missing\" have come up time and again in news media, and law enforcement agencies are being accused of being complicit. In fact, we have seen cases of law enforcement agencies knocking on the doors of the families of victims to get them to sign affidavits that state that no one \"disappeared\" or went \"missing\".\nWhat became of this? The government was already suffering from an acute image crisis thanks to enforced disappearances, and after deploying forces to get such affidavits, the crisis reached its crux.\nIf the objective of \"expatriate\u00a0diplomacy\" is to label the practitioners of \"negative propaganda\" as anti-state individuals and to instigate their host nations to turn against them, will it be successful? The possibility is next to zero. Whatever the government claims, the countries in question will also do their own investigations. And if that investigation reveals that these individuals are criticising the government and people in power, and disclosing events of human rights violation, then the whole initiative can backfire. In fact, it might lead to the conclusion that these individuals could not speak their mind at home without being exposed to torture, and even after coming abroad, they are being muzzled. It is most likely that any North American or European nation will only encourage individuals to criticise their home country's government's irregularities, graft and human rights violations.\nThese five to seven so-called critics, whom the government termed \"negative propaganda artists'', are living in developed nations where broadcast media's independence and freedom of speech are deemed basic human rights. Thus, Bangladesh's government can actually be laughed off by global leadership for these muzzling efforts.\nFinally, there are possibly more columnists who write on the positive aspects of the government as opposed to the critical ones. The same scenario persists among talk show participants. If these elements cannot tackle \"negative propaganda\", then how can this feat be achieved by paid columnists? Even if those columns are published on international media with money, will they have any credibility? We might ask now, was the CNN contract useful?\nWhatever is being planned with regard to \"expatriate diplomacy\" is something that our foreign missions are already doing to a certain extent. Previously, the government spent a fortune to hire foreign lobbyists to build a positive image of\u00a0the nation. Was that successful? The answer would not be a resolute \"yes\". People usually do not accept anything other than truth and reality. Being silent or saying it was started during the BNP era does not wipe things like Aynaghar from people's minds. If proper elections take place, if good governance arrives, and if a vile law like the Digital Security Act is abolished, then the government will no longer have to be so concerned about tackling negative propaganda and their image crisis.\nTranslated by Mohammed Ishtiaque Khan.\n\nGolam Mortoza is the editor of The Daily Star Bangla.\n",

        "full_article": "More people are living in extreme poverty now than they were 10 years ago and by 2030, more than half of the poor in Bangladesh will be urban dwellers. Why is this important, and what can development programmes do to address this shift in poverty dynamics?\nFirstly, it must be noted that Bangladesh has made some considerable developments, with the overall poverty rate falling by 1.2 percent annually since 2000. However, urban poverty has risen from 36.1 to 41.4 percent between 2010 and\u00a02016.\nThe country's rapid urbanisation, growing by 3.9 percent annually, is one key contributor. Additionally, the government and the development sector historically leaned towards addressing rural poverty, leading to a \"neglect\" of the urban poor, seen as a problem to be sent back to rural areas. This culminated in a lack of systemic thinking and integration of how government and NGOs can collaborate to ensure that adequate housing, health, education and social services are accessible to the urban poor.\nThe increase in urban poverty indicates exclusion of the segment by the nation's economic and social advances. As such, a comprehensive approach to alleviating urban poverty is a key frontier for development programmes, especially if Bangladesh is to meet its national target to reduce poverty to 15.6 percent by 2025. A recent report by the World Bank calls for new and innovative methods, including improving programme targeting, to address urban poverty.\nUnderstanding the urban poor and how we define this incredibly complex, wide and varied group is an important first step to developing effective development programmes and policies. If programme designers, implementers or policymakers truly want to work with the urban poor, then understanding the challenges they face is critical.\nIn Bangladesh, when we think of urban poor, we typically think of people living in slums. However, it's not quite as simple. Someone's living location is only one way of understanding and defining urban poverty and if we use a spatial definition, it's important to note that not all slums are similar and not all the urban poor live in slums.\nSo, who are the urban poor and where do they live?\nThey are housemaids living with their families in slums, or a recently evicted family living in squatter settlements while figuring out where to go next. Rickshaw-pullers from the village sleeping on their rickshaw or in a bachelor mess, guards sleeping in the ATM booth or at the corner of a building, RMG workers from the village living in a dormitory, an older woman abandoned by family and living in one room at the edge of a slum, or a group of youth who formed their own family after escaping their own families' violence, and are now living in a small shack. They're the women who escaped the workplace or faced partner violence and are now living in a railway station.\nDespite this incredible diversity amongst the urban poor, the challenges they face and where they live, large scale urban poverty alleviation projects in Bangladesh tend to provide targeted interventions to large sized slums on government land. Why?\nThe obvious answer is that designing for one \"type\" of community or household means more straightforward operations, resulting in wider outreach and more cost-effective interventions. Whilst this is an important consideration enabling a large number of urban poor households to receive benefits, these measures inevitably result in failing to account for those who don't fall within the \"norm\".\nOne study found that one of Bangladesh's most famous urban poverty alleviation programmes failed to reach smaller, harder to access urban poor communities. Despite these communities being highly vulnerable \u2013 they were either too socially marginalised or lived on very precarious land to be included \u2013 it was not efficient for the programme to go to these communities, due to high risks of eviction and mass migration, and thus it ended up \"losing\" participants.\nLarge scale urban poverty projects have focused on \"community-level\" interventions, specifically mobilising communities regarding infrastructural slum-upgrading projects, livelihood activities and building capacity of women to engage in advocacy at the local level. Whilst incredibly important and transformative interventions, these are not initially viable for communities at risk of eviction or have high levels of social fragmentation and low trust within the community. As a result, these highly vulnerable communities and families continued to be excluded by programmes and its benefits.\nThe urban poor have varied priorities. For example, SAJIDA Foundation's Urban Design team conducted a needs analysis with different urban poor communities, including pavement dwellers, squatter settlements, and smaller slums on private and public land, and captured what communities voiced as their priorities. The survey found that communities' priorities included infrastructural improvements (50 percent), access to affordable health care (100 percent), access to education (75 percent), addressing workplace exploitation and conditions (63 percent), and ensuring their communities were strong and supportive (38 percent).\nAdditionally, different families within a community had different priorities due to different situations, households and needs. Some would benefit most from sizeable economic investment into their microbusiness, others investing in their children's education and health. Some needed greater support for women to engage in livelihoods, or older members to be linked with social safety nets.\nWe need to stop viewing poverty alleviation as a formulaic process that can be emulated across all communities or households, and expected to have a similar impact. There are different types of communities, households and needs within this group of people grappling with issues that have economic, health, social, gendered and living condition dimensions. There is instead a need to firstly understand who you are designing for, and then work in collaboration with this population to define priorities, goals and how services can be tailored to meet the many complex needs faced by the urban poor.\nDr Shoshannah Kate Williams is the Head of SUDIN, Urban Programs at SAJIDA Foundation, Email: shoshannah@sajida.org\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are concerned at the way different government agencies have been trying to occupy the forestland of Cox's Bazar to implement their projects, disregarding the fact that doing so would further deplete what little forest coverage we have, which is critically important for our environment. The latest such attempt was made by the Department of Prison which is reportedly planning to build a prison on protected forestland in Paglirbil in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila. According to our report, after the land ministry allotted 160 acres of land to the prison department, the latter placed demarcation flags around the area. But the forest department removed those flags since no clearance was taken from them, leading to an apparent conflict between the two parties.\n\nWe are not against building a prison which will have many modern facilities for the inmates. However, we strongly oppose building it on protected forestland, and urge the government to take the project somewhere else.\nWhat becomes clear from this state of affairs is that there is hardly any coordination among the ministries and departments involved when it comes to taking or giving lease of any government land, particularly forestland. Otherwise, how can the land ministry randomly allot part of a protected forest to the prison department without following due procedure, and even without asking for approval from the forest department and the department of environment (DoE)?\nReportedly, this is not the first time that a government department has tried to grab the protected forestland of Cox's Bazar. A few years ago, the public administration ministry also planned to build a civil service academy in Cox's Bazar covering 700 acres of land that was declared a protected forest and also an ecologically critical area (ECA). Luckily, later, a parliamentary body strongly opposed the move, while the High Court also issued a stay order on it. Another such attempt was made in July this year, when a part of the Jungle Khuniya Palong reserved forest in Cox's Bazar was handed over to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) by the government for building a residential training facility with funds from FIFA. What is more shocking is that the government de-reserved the 20-acre land for this purpose. This move faced widespread criticism from environmentalists and all concerned.\nComing back to the issue of building an open prison, we would like to make it clear that we are not against building such a facility which will have many modern facilities for the inmates, including scopes for fish farming, gardening and handicraft making. However, we strongly oppose building it on protected forestland, and urge the government to take the project somewhere else where the environmental damage will be minimal. Any incursion into our fast-depleting forest areas, however noble or practical the purpose, must be thwarted.\nWe hope the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, particularly the DoE, will remain vigilant against such moves to destroy our forests. We have ample laws and court directives in this regard and all government offices must abide by them.\n",

        "full_article": "Like all offices run by the state or carrying its seal in some form, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) is not exactly a paragon of good governance. The company, whose main offering of landline service has fallen out of favour since the advent of mobile phone, has been trying to stay afloat by providing a host of related services licensed under the telecom regulator. Yet, to dodge due payments like the way it did over successive fiscal years, as recently revealed by an audit report, is a fresh reminder of how financial mismanagement has been plaguing the public sector.\n\nThis tendency to skip payments has been witnessed, albeit at irregular intervals, since the BTCL was turned into a public limited company in 2008. \nAccording to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which analysed its books for FY 2017-18, the state coffer stands at least Tk 2,258.76 crore short thanks to the BTCL's failure to share a portion of its revenues from different services. As per its licensing terms, it is obligated to deposit the money with the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), which then deposits it with the exchequer. This tendency to skip payments has been witnessed, albeit at irregular intervals, since it was turned into a public limited company in 2008. For example, it skipped payments of Tk 628.40 crore earned from handling local phone calls, and of Tk 944.56 crore earned from handling incoming and outgoing international phone calls, from October 2008 to June 2014. It continued to skip payments later \u2013 notably in landline and international internet gateway services \u2013 despite repeated requests from the BTRC.\nClearly, the BTCL doesn't feel as bound to its regulator, or by relevant rules, as any institution handling public money should. The CAG audit team also found that the BTCL's internal control system was weak, with no responsible officer or cell for monitoring payment of dues. There was no trace of an internal audit system either. All this explains why, despite huge investment made over the years, this once-profitable company has been racking up losses since FY 2009-10. All the modernisation projects taken up since, as well as ongoing projects, seem to have had little effect on its outdated (read: questionable) modus operandi.\nUnfortunately, the BTCL is only the latest in a growing list of state agencies and departments to have been embroiled in accounting scandals. Over the past three weeks, we have had similarly damning CAG reports on the Directorate General of Food, the Directorate General of Health Services, public hospitals, the ministries of agriculture and fisheries and livestock, Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, etc. What was common in all of them was how such irregularities and corruption were allowed to persist year after year without any effective oversight. What's equally problematic is the lack of official response to this Auditgate scandal.\nWe urge the government to take these audit objections seriously and impose strict discipline on the relevant authorities, including of BTCL, to make them accountable. This situation cannot continue anymore.\n",

        "full_article": "In October last year, the Ministry of Labour and Employment with the help of the International labour organization (ILO) adopted a National Action Plan (NAP) on occupational safety and health (OSH) to ensure a safe, conducive and productive environment for both employers and workers. Nearly one year after, the same ministry formed a representative committee to oversee the progress in the NAP's execution. Since the Plan is a time-bound one, the delay in constituting a committee highlights the lack of seriousness on the part of the relevant authorities. The foot-dragging might also trigger scepticism among many about implementing the plan itself. The occupational safety of workers at their workplace is a very important issue in Bangladesh. Industrial accidents, including the ones that had claimed the lives of several thousand workers, are common happenings. The collapse of Rana Plaza, and devastating fires in several garment and chemical factories, had made global media headlines and raised deep concern about the safety and security of workers. The incidents followed a flurry of activities involving local and international platforms to ensure workplace safety, primarily in export-oriented garment factories. Undoubtedly, the occupational safety situation in RMG factories is now better than before. Such a change has taken place because the western buyers desired so.Besides, the government amended the Labour Act in 2013, adding a few provisions designed to ensure workplace safety and the physical well-being of workers. The Labor Act now requires the creation of safety committees in each of the factories having 50 or more workers, the establishment of health centres at the premises of factories employing 5000 or more workers and the appointment of safety officers in workplaces with 500 or more workers. The labour inspectorate also has got added responsibilities to pay visits to the factories and ensure compliance with laws and rules. Over nine years have gone by since the addition of the provisions designed to ensure the occupational safety and physical well-being of workers, but nobody knows for sure the actual situation on the ground. But the latest fire incident at a private container terminal in Chottogram has made it amply clear that the situation has remained largely unchanged. Workplace safety is the least discussed issue in sectors and sub-sectors other than RMG. Take the case of the ship-breaking industry in Chottogram. Hundreds of workers are engaged there, but they are vulnerable to accidents. These workers very often dismantle ships that carried hazardous chemicals with no protective gear. Accidental deaths are common happenings at the ship-breaking yards. Besides, thousands of workers have been doing their daily work under inhuman conditions for a paltry wage in small factories across the country. The officials from the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments hardly visit these factory sites. The DIFE is more concerned about the welfare of the workers employed in big manufacturing units. The Directorate also has limitations in terms of workforce and logistics. So, making action plans and bringing necessary amendments to the relevant act/s will not help much in achieving the goals of occupational safety and the physical well-being of workers. Enforcement of the same at the right time across the board will be necessary.",

        "full_article": "This year marks the 16 years of formal launch of the Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative to support the developing and least- developed countries (LDCs) in developing their trade capacity and infrastructure. The aid is part of overall official development assistance (ODA) - grants and concessional loans - directed towards trade-related programmes and projects. Following the decision taken in the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference (MC5) in December 2005, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the following year set up a taskforce to make the aid-for-trade concept a reality. The taskforce recommended a set of dos in this connection. Different international organisations, already working on various capacities to provide aid and assistance to different countries, joined hands to work to that end. A monitoring body in the WTO is also established to undertake a periodic global review based on reports from different stakeholders. After the formal inception of the AfT programme in 2006, the first global review took place in 2007. Since then, the review has been held every two years. Accordingly, it was scheduled to be held last year. Outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, however, compelled the WTO to defer the event. Instead, a stocktaking event was organised in last year to examine the trade impacts of the pandemic and make the case for the mobilisation of AfT financing to support recovery and foster resilience of the affected countries. As the situation improved globally, the eighth global review of AfT took place in Geneva during the last week of July this year.The latest review was held against four global risk factors: the continuing Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, food insecurity, and climate change. So, stakeholders and participants faced more challenges to examine the effectiveness of aid linked with trade.During the event, a joint report titled 'Aid for Trade at a Glance 2022-, prepared by the WTO and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), was released. It showed that AfT commitments increased by 18 per cent in 2020, reaching an all-time high of US$64.6 billion. The amount was around 26 per cent of the total commitment of ODA in the year under review. The amount disbursed as AfD against the commitments stood at around $49 billion which was 21.70 per cent of the disbursed ODA in 2022. The review report also mentioned that a total of US$556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. Time-series data also revealed that AfT had increased over the years. The three major components of AfT are (i) trade policy and regulations (ii) economic infrastructure and (iii) building productive capacity. On average, around 50 per cent of AfT goes for economic infrastructures which include communications, energy generation and supply, and transport and storage. Some 48 per cent goes for building productive capacity and only 2.0 per cent of AfT is used for trade policy and regulations.Nevertheless, the statistics of AfT are ambiguous to some extent and so it is not easy to analyse. For instance, there is no breakup of AfT in-between donation and credit although it is safely presumable that around 90 per cent of AfT is loan or credit. Most of these credits are tied with various conditions and some of these are unfavourable for the recipient countries. And, aid disbursed for development of economic infrastructure is not exclusively beneficial to trade. Even, in some cases, the infrastructure may have nothing to do with supporting trade.WTO-OECD joint report also acknowledges the limitation. In presenting country-wise data, it said: \"The country profiles do not posit a causal link and do not attempt to test or estimate the causal impact of aid for trade at the macro level. Instead, they give a dynamic perspective on a country's development. In this sense, the sequence traced is one of contribution, not attribution. Where such contribution can be discerned, the country profiles provide ground for further in-depth, country-based research.\" The country profile of Bangladesh, presented in the review report, showed that the country received some $6.49 billion in ODA in 2020 of which $2.49 billion is AfT. Thus, 38 per cent of ODA is AfT in 2020 against 16 per cent in 2006. Moreover, transport and storage sector received highest amount of AfT followed by energy generation and supply. In Bangladesh, export diversification is the top priority of AfT followed by environmentally sustainable growth and MSMEs growth and development. On donor part, Japan is the top provider of AfT for Bangladesh followed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, Germany and the United States. These five top donors provide 95 per cent of aid related to trade. Finally, Bangladesh is the second-highest recipient of AfT and India is on top of the list receiving aid worth $2.75 billion for trade-related purpose. All this may seem impressive although some grey areas are also there. If 38 per cent of ODA is AfT, it is important to identify the country's trade efficiency or trade performance in detail which is absent from the review report. In 2020, the country's trade-GDP ratio was estimated at 28.70 per cent. A declining trend in trade cost is, however, visible along with increase in liner shipping connectivity index indicating some benefits of the trade-linked aid. Again, the country is well ahead of least- developed countries (LDCs) in most of the trade-facilitation indicators.As Bangladesh is set to come out from the LDC status by 2026, it will lose preferential market-access benefits consequently. In the changed situation, though AfT will not discontinue, it may decline. Thus, Bangladesh needs to make better utilisation of AfT alongside negotiating for transparency in the aid-delivery mechanism. In this connection, the country itself needs to measure the effectiveness of the trade-related aid and examine it rigorously. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Although the activists untiringly uphold the country's plain-land indigenous communities' rights, their lot hasn't shown any sign of improvement. Instead, their living standard and other indicators continuously demonstrate these people's nonstop decline. Due to their being poverty-stricken, and victims of social and economic marginalisation and other discriminations, many of the country's indigenous people find themselves being on the verge of extinction. Perhaps, due to these reasons the Bangladesh indigenous communities are fast losing their voice. A sense of helplessness has gripped them. This prompts these once socially and prominently visible communities to take recourse to a cocoon of sorts. It's only when they find their backs to the wall, they shake off their passivity --- and try to resist the unjust treatments meted out to them. In most cases, they have to concede defeat.However, in times of their distress people with conscience used to come forward to stand by them. This has been seen in the land since long. But petty mundane interests kill the virtues once extolled. Thus people caring about the indigenous communities cannot realise how the insidious moral rot has been corrupting them. At one point of time, the indigenous communities scattered around the country found themselves left in the lurch. Thus encroachment on the farmlands of the poor Santal, Oraon or Munda communities goes on without strong resistance. What's worse, the unscrupulous elements behind these grabbing spreedo not remain confined to encroaching on the legitimately owned lands of the indigenous people. The face-off between the influential locals and the indigenous people continues to turn bitter. Few have thought that in course of time, these hostilities will end up being bloodied. Unfortunately, this is exactly what has been routinely occurring in different parts of the country over the decades.The weird part of the fierce brawls is the resisting indigenous people are singled out as instigators behind deadly frontal confrontations. The periodic killings of the indigenous protestors by the lackeys of local honchos these days are a normal occurrence. Law enforcers intervene, cases are filed, and a temporary truce is in place. Meanwhile, arrest warrants are issued against scores of people, mostly indigenous people, leading them to opt for the lives of fugitives. With the agricultural lands remaining uncultivated, and, eventually barren, the indigenous fugitive farmers' families go panicky and starving. These impasses have hardly seen a permanent solution.The plain-land indigenous population is different in socio-cultural rituals from the larger segment living in the hills in the country's southeastern and northeastern regions. In terms of educational achievements and social attainments, the southeastern region has been on the path to progress for over two decades. The path, however, is strewn with thorns unique to the areas and its inhabitants. With the impediments removed, non-partisan policymakers predict a bright future for the area. Compared to this region, the coming days of the plain-land indigenous people of the country appear to be thrust into a benighted future. There are 54 indigenous communities in the country at present, speaking 35 languages and their dialects. Of the total indigenous peoples, the Santals, the Mundas, the Oraons --- and the Garos and the Hajongs, feel proud of their literacy rate.The Garo language being a Sino-Tibetan tongue, is spoken in large parts of the Indian state of Meghalaya and also in some areas of Tripura and Assam. It's widely spoken in greater Netrakona and Jamalpur districts. The freedom-loving and once indomitable people, Santals are recognised as the first indigenous community entering Bangladesh centuries ago. Whatever the injustices being done to the indigenous communities, the nation needs them to keep alive its multi-ethnicity. The Bengalees, in essence, are peace-loving. They have embraced all races who have set foot on their soil during their evolution as a perfect nation. This achievement cannot be undone.[email\u00a0protected]",

During the peak tourism season that starts every year in October, an average of over 8,000 tourists stay overnight in the eight-square kilometre island daily along with its 10,000 permanent residents. The government has not yet been able to implement its plan to keep the tourist number within 958 each day. It has also failed to restrict the tourists from visiting Chhera Dwip. The government ban on travelling to the Chhera Dwip part of the island was announced in October 2020. But the tourists have persistently been visiting the southernmost point of the country anyway. The island gets noisy due to the tourists' presence. This frightens marine animals, especially the sea turtles. They are now leaving the island without laying eggs. It is not only about the turtles. All other marine lives are equally disturbed; red crabs have already vanished from the island, and the coral population is dwindling. More tourists in this island means more pollution. Plastic bottles, bags and a host of other things can be found on the sea beach. According to experts, if we can allow only 1,200 tourists each day and ban tourists' overnight stay, it can save Saint Martin's Island. And the authorities concerned should restrict the number of tourists to the island before the next tourism season starts. Otherwise, we may lose one of our precious treasures.
