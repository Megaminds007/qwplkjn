The fiercely contested election has made challenges more difficult for the new government. Mr. Soren has laid out a list of priorities in his second term. At the top of this list is to deliver on the promises of increasing the amount of cash assistance for women under the Jharkhand Mukhyamantri Maiya Samman Yojana to \u20b92,500 a month and to generate jobs, including speeding up recruitment under the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) and the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC). The promise of expediting JPSC and JSSC recruitment faces another challenge \u2014 that of harmonising it with another key poll promise, which is the implementation of a domicile policy based on 1932 records. The issue of domicile has gained new urgency with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the tribal character of the State was being altered by the influx of foreigners. Changes in domicile law will require the approval of the Centre too, and the JMM has accused the BJP of stalling them. Mr. Soren will have to work with the Centre on this as well as on many other governance issues in the State. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to support the State\u2019s aspirations but the BJP\u2019s political calculations may hinder Mr. Soren\u2019s agenda.The new government has to also work on the election promises of increasing the reservation in recruitment for SCs, STs, and OBCs, and implementing the Sarna Dharam Code. Mr. Soren has said that his previous government had passed decisions on all three issues \u2014 the change in domicile policy, the Sarna Dharam Code, and reservations \u2014 and the Centre was the one stalling it. He will also have to find a way to give shape to poll promises such as delivering LPG cylinders for \u20b9450, hiking the minimum support price of paddy to \u20b93,200 a quintal, and increasing the amount of grain provided to households under the free ration scheme. Mr. Soren will have to deal with a more fractious society, the Opposition BJP that is waiting for an opportunity to strike, and weak allies, the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Mr. Soren has been the target of investigations by central agencies that often work according to the political convenience of the BJP. He has a tough task ahead keeping his anti-BJP political posture at the national and the State levels intact and also finding cooperation from the Centre in governance.

        "full_article": "While generally undesirable, centralisation promised to be a boon vis-\u00e0-vis public access to research through India\u2019s \u2018One Nation, One Subscription\u2019 (ONOS) plan. ONOS was first proposed in the country\u2019s fifth draft National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (2020) in response to the hefty fees research journals charged \u2014 and still do \u2014 for scholars and the people at large to access the papers they published. In this revenue model, journals accept and publish papers submitted by scholars and charge those who want to read them a fee. Research institutes also subscribe to these journals, so scholars can avail all the papers through their libraries. As these fees climbed over time, librarians banded up in consortia to increase their bargaining power at negotiations. ONOS, which the Union Cabinet approved on November 25, replaces these consortia with the national government and obliges journals to provide a single fee to access them. The upshot is expensive journals will now become available at underfunded government institutes as well.However, ONOS will be limited to publicly funded institutes; and it allows the stranglehold of commercial publishers on scholarly publishing to continue. Many journals subsist on publicly funded research while also charging people money to access it. ONOS may reduce these sums but the government\u2019s willingness to allocate \u20b96,000 crore for three calendar years for 30 major publishers must be seen against the backdrop of the gross expenditure on research and development as a fraction of the GDP having become stagnant. The government could have promoted the adoption of \u2018green\u2019 and/or \u2018diamond\u2019 open-access models that guarantee public access by default or have supported, as a matter of policy, home-grown journals sensitive to Indian scholars\u2019 circumstances while enhancing the discoverability of their research. The decision to instead channel a large sum of money to publishers abroad does not factor in India\u2019s potential to influence research access modalities in the developing world. The lack of transparency is also perturbing, including over whether the list of journals will be monitored to cull titles that have become irrelevant or predatory, or to add those that have gained currency in recent years. Most of all, at a time when many journals have switched to \u2018gold\u2019 open-access \u2014 where researchers pay to have a paper published that is then available for free \u2014 and preprint papers are gaining in popularity as a means of communicating research, the government\u2019s justification for adopting the ONOS strategy in its present form is weak. Add to this the absence of consultation with the institutes on their specific needs, and any celebration of ONOS will have to be deemed premature.\r Published - November 30, 2024 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        journals and diaries\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        science and technology\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        research",

        "full_article": "So, who\u2019s in charge of money these days?\nMoney is the engine of our world, writes David McWilliams in Money: A Story of Humanity. Money is trust. To mess with money is to rip the fabric of society and mess with people\u2019s heads. The book is an accessible account of money through historical eras \u2013 from notches in bones dated to 18000 BCE, and found in Congo, to Mesopotamian tablets containing forecasts for livestock investment, to coinage-enabled sophistication of ancient Greece. The Roman Empire turned their conquests into credit, and thus began the world\u2019s first private corporations, its first credit crisis, and central bank.\nPutting today\u2019s price on tomorrow is another characteristic of money. Interest rates and mortgages are the price put on time, expressed through money. The Sumerians had simple and compound interest, more than 5,000 years ago. The Indian invention and Arab transmission of zero made money digital, made big numbers, precision and empiricism possible for commerce.\nAfter the Dark Ages in Europe, medieval merchants became newly powerful \u2013 banking, trading, settling, hustling. Florentine guilds minted their own currency, the florin, breaking the power of the king and the mint. While paper money was invented during the Song dynasty in China, banknotes emerged in 1609 with the Dutch Wisselbank. 17th century Amsterdam was a monetary metropolis, pioneering the stock exchange and modern financial instruments.\nFiat money is the most important innovation since coins, and US is at the centre of this system. Central banks underpin global financial architecture. But are they really in charge, or does finance have its own runaway logic in real life?\nSince the time of the Sumerians, there have been two types of money: The first is currency, anchored by something like gold or the guarantee of the state, the second is finance, created by commercial banks and governed by commercial law. Currency makes up about 10% of the money supply, the rest is finance, the energy that can propel or sink economies and societies.\nContrary to the textbook idea that the central bank pushes money into commercial banks, the $12tn secret is that it\u2019s the other way round; money is pulled by large commercial banks through offshore \u2018Eurodollars\u2019, aparallel capital market that dominates international finance. This is why we have recurrent banking and financial crises \u2013 the people in charge are not in charge.\nMoney is a trippy substance, says the book, pointing to the financial crisis and asset price meltdown of 2008, where leverage distorted prices, easy money and mass delusion gave way to panic and implosion, and deposits fled the banks. After that, central banks tried to refloat the balance sheets with quantitative easing, but commercial banks lent this new money to the already wealthy, creating huge inequality between the owning class and the \u2018left behinds\u2019.\nCryptocurrency? On blockchain-enabled private currency, the book is sceptical. Its volatility makes it dysfunctional as a means of payment, and it\u2019s not even an asset since it entails no cash flow or legal claim on anything. For now, it fails both as investment and as money.\n\n",

Ten years on, yearly mileage may not have changed but the car population has multiplied. If each car emits just one gram of carbon dioxide (CO2) per km, annual emissions add up to roughly 5-16kg per car. But cars don\u2019t emit 1g/km. For 2022-23, govt asked carmakers to ensure their fleets \u2013 all cars sold that year \u2013 averaged CO2 emissions of less than 113g/km. Some models, presumably bigger and heavier, could emit more as long as others emitted less and the average was met. Eight carmakers failed.\nThat\u2019s bad news because rising CO2 levels are making earth warmer and causing climate change. Higher CO2 emissions also indicate higher fuel consumption and a heftier fuel import bill. Govt expects average fleet efficiency of at least 21km/l and, happily, two of India\u2019s top three carmakers by volume are compliant. What stops others? Not tech but physics. Ceteris paribus, monstrous SUVs will guzzle more fuel than light hatchbacks and aerodynamic sedans.\nCarmakers have no special fondness for any car type. They make whatever buyers want. Since bigger, heavier and more powerful vehicles command premium prices, they won\u2019t stop making them just because govt threatens to impose penalties. It\u2019s yet another tax they can pass on to buyers who want 18-inch wheels, 4-wheel drive and a sunroof for the morning milk-bread-eggs run. Small cars were Indian automotive industry\u2019s bread and butter before Covid. But consumers will have to want them again.\n\n",

The larger point in all such disputes, and the violence that follows, is that at the root of these conflicts is history, which is told as a long reel of conquest and subjugation. Accounts of battles and empires ignite sentiments, create false memories, whether these be of valour, or of humiliation and revenge. We are taken hostage by history, forgetting our present interests and the reality of those around us.\nLook at current conflicts. Manipur\u2019s civil warfare involves claims stretching back to pre-colonial times. The Ukraine-Russia war has its roots in colliding notions of the past. Zionists believe in a biblical-cum-historical claim on the land of Israel. Palestinians are not persuaded. This time, it\u2019s Gaza paying the price of history. In India and Pakistan, school histories teach our common freedom struggle in dramatically different ways. Whether it is the portrayal of figures like Gandhi and Jinnah, or the view of events like the 1857 rebellion, Independence and Partition, each nation-state has its own ideology, which informs their interpretations and storytelling. These memories can simmer for a frighteningly long time. For instance, Britain and France have been on the same side for a couple of centuries, but their rivalry and mutual scorn die hard. Recently, the West has also seen protests, street fights and statue topplings of historical figures, disputes over textbooks that allegedly paper over a racist imperialist past.\nHistory is always a play of perspectives. We can never find peace or progress in litigating abstract bygones. What\u2019s more, the past is not a story of power and humiliation alone. There are far more interesting threads to follow, which are more relevant to our lives. Many recent histories have explored human societies through objects and technologies, commodities like sugar or coffee, or horses or porcelain. Today\u2019s Mindfield (below) reveals the march of time through the story of money. We may never be able to settle what happened at the beginning of the universe, but we can explore our curiosity about the world right under our noses.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are concerned about the disruption of academic activities in a number of crisis-hit educational institutions in Dhaka. Among them are five colleges embroiled in senseless violence last week, leading to the suspension of their classes and affecting the education of at least 40,000 students. The alarming frequency of such incidents since the ouster of the Awami League government deals a blow to the dream of building a robust academic environment in line with the spirit of the uprising. For a sector already plagued by systemic challenges, this is exacerbating its vulnerabilities.\nThe five institutions now facing disruptions are Government Shaheed Suhrawardy College and Kabi Nazrul Government College (both affiliated with Dhaka University), as well as Dr. Mahbubur Rahman Mollah College (DMRC), Dhaka National Medical College Hospital (DNMCH), and St. Gregory High School and College. According to a report by this daily, in addition to regular classes, their exams have also been halted. Among them, DMRC suffered heavy losses as it was the epicentre of the violence. The involvement of two of its affiliates also prompted Dhaka University to postpone final exams for first- and fourth-year students in all seven of its affiliated colleges, taking the number of institutions affected by one cycle of violence to 10.\nAll this apparently began over alleged medical negligence at the DNMCH, where a DMRC student died, resulting in clashes that spread to nearby colleges. The mindless mayhem witnessed on November 24 and 25 in particular was quite disturbing. Around the same time, we also saw clashes between students of the Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX) and Dhaka Polytechnic Institute, as well as between Dhaka College and City College. The violent sit-ins and protests by students of Government Titumir College and other DU-affiliated colleges, demanding university status for their institutions, also align with the pattern of disruptive mobilisations that have been taking place since August 5.\nWhile these expressions of discontent are not unthinkable in a post-conflict society, their consequences are dire. The dream of a better Bangladesh, born from the sacrifices of so many people, cannot be realised if the education sector remains in disarray. If the country is to prepare a generation of leaders capable of driving it to greater heights, ensuring a stable and productive academic environment must be a top priority. The question is, what can we do to prevent frequent disruptions?\nThe issues students face are multifaceted but not something that cannot be resolved through proper engagement and initiatives. However, the authorities must first understand the long-term consequences of such turmoil, and act decisively and judiciously, both in enforcing the law and addressing student grievances. In the short term, immediate steps should be taken to restore normalcy in the five affected colleges so that the future of ordinary students is not jeopardised in any way.\n",

        "full_article": "November 29, the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, is observed each year to reaffirm the global community's commitment to Palestinian rights and draw attention to the ongoing struggles faced by the people of Palestine. This day serves as a solemn reminder of the enduring conflict, the unresolved question of Palestinian statehood, and the suffering endured by millions of Palestinians. Yet, despite its symbolic significance, the day often raises the same question, what tangible action has been taken by the international community, and more importantly, by the Muslim world, to address the plight of Palestine beyond mere statements of solidarity?\nDecades of conferences, resolutions, and pledges from the Muslim world have failed to alleviate the daily suffering of Palestinians or halt the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has played a significant role in advocating for Palestinian rights, issuing resolutions, providing humanitarian aid, and raising global awareness about the Palestinian struggle. However, despite these achievements, its adopted measures lack the strength to enforce international accountability or pressure Israel to end its occupation. Given its vast resources and potential, can the OIC overcome internal divisions and transform from a platform of declarations into an engine of real change in the pursuit of Palestinian justice?\nThe enduring Sunni-Shia divide continues to sap the strength of the Muslim world, turning potential allies into rivals. Rather than uniting for the Palestinian cause, regional giants like Saudi Arabia and Iran remain locked in ideological competition, often using Palestine as a symbolic prop for their own ambitions. This division has rendered the idea of collective action nearly impossible, despite the fact that Palestine's cause transcends sectarian lines. How long will the Muslim world allow internal divisions to impede solidarity on a cause as universal as Palestine, which hosts one of its holiest sites, the Al-Aqsa Mosque?\nCalls for a joint Muslim military force to defend Palestine have long circulated within the Muslim world but remain unrealised. Instead, Muslim nations spend billions on fragmented military operations within their own borders or against one another, while Israel continues to expand its military superiority. Even during the most critical escalations, such as the blanket bombardments of Gaza\u2014where the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) great-grandfather Hashim is buried\u2014the Islamic world fails to present a coordinated military or defence strategy to protect innocent Palestinian civilians and its historic heritage. Why has the Muslim world, with its vast resources and military spending, failed to organise a defence mechanism for one of its most pressing humanitarian causes?\nThe combined military capabilities of the Muslim world represent a significant force that, if properly coordinated, could have a profound impact on global geopolitics. With over 50 Muslim-majority countries, the collective military expenditure of the Muslim world ranks among the highest globally, surpassing even the combined defence budgets of some major Western powers. If these nations were able to transcend their differences and pool their military resources, they could create a powerful deterrent to any aggressor and offer tangible security to Palestine. The question, however, remains: with such overwhelming potential, why has the Muslim world not yet unified its military might to defend Palestine and promote regional stability for the greater good?\nCollectively, Muslim-majority countries control a significant portion of the world's energy resources, with the Gulf states alone accounting for nearly a third of global oil reserves. Additionally, the Muslim world represents around two billion people, a demographic that spans continents, cultures, and markets, making it one of the largest and most diverse blocs on the planet. Economic leverage, particularly in the form of oil, has historically proven effective in shaping global politics. Yet today, Muslim-majority nations seem reluctant to use their collective economic power for Palestine, prioritising trade deals and energy partnerships over justice. Why has the Muslim world abandoned its most potent weapon for plausible pressure? Can't two billion Muslims shield two million Gazans, or is the weight of a centuries-old conflict just too much for even the largest ummah to carry?\nThe Muslim world is further strategically positioned with key geographic advantages that could enhance its global influence. It controls vital chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal, critical to global oil and trade routes. The region also holds vast mineral resources, including oil, gas, and rare earth metals essential for technology and energy. Additionally, the Bay of Bengal is a major trade hub, with nearly half of global container traffic passing through its ports. These assets provide Muslim-majority countries with significant strategic leverage and key roles in global supply chains. In a world where energy security and access to critical minerals are paramount, the Muslim world's control over these resources should be a powerful bargaining chip in shaping international policy. Yet, despite this wealth of resources, why has the Muslim world failed to wield its natural advantages for the cause of Palestine and broader regional empowerment?\nThe fact remains that, on the international stage, Muslim nations lag far behind Israel in diplomatic and media influence. Israel has mastered the art of lobbying, soft power, and public diplomacy, securing support from Western governments and global media outlets. In contrast, the Muslim world has not managed to leverage its substantial economic and demographic strength to shape global narratives or policies. Why has the Muslim world not invested in the cultural and diplomatic tools necessary to counter Israeli propaganda and build better global alliances? Nonetheless, the Muslim world possesses a wealth of intellectual and diplomatic skills, with influential voices in politics, academia, and international organisations. If this power were harnessed collectively, pooling resources for common causes, advocating for justice, and pressing for global change, it could shape the international landscape in profound ways.\nHistory has shown that global movements, from South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle to Bangladesh's national uprising against discrimination and fascism, have succeeded through a combination of unity, strategy, and sustained pressure. The Muslim world has the resources, influence, and moral imperative to act, yet its disunity and complacency have left Palestine increasingly isolated. As the world marks another day of solidarity, the Muslim world must ask itself: will it remain a bystander in history, or will it rise to meet the moment?\nDr Iftekhar Ul Karim is assistant professor at BRAC Business School, BRAC University.

        "full_article": "We are once again at that time of the year when the air we breathe becomes dangerously polluted, not just in the capital but across the country. This year is no exception. Over the past few days, Dhaka's air quality has consistently been classified as unhealthy or hazardous, and there is a concern that pollution levels will worsen as winter intensifies. For instance, on November 27, the concentration of PM2.5 in the city exceeded the WHO standard by 43 percent\u2014an ominous sign for public health.\nAccording to a report by IQAir, a Switzerland-based organisation, Dhaka has ranked among the top two or three most polluted cities globally throughout November. On November 24, Dhaka's air was rated the second worst in the world, with an IQAir pollution score of 291. Just two days later, the score rose to 324, indicating hazardous conditions. The situation is clearly dire, and without immediate action, we risk a public health crisis in the near future.\nIt's unthinkable that we have come to a point where air pollution has become so dangerous, thanks to the failure of successive governments. Between 2000 and 2019, $6.5 crore was reportedly spent on two major projects to combat air pollution, in addition to other initiatives funded by hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid. Yet, despite these efforts, Dhaka remains one of the most polluted cities globally. High Court directives aimed at curbing air pollution\u2014over 20 rulings, summons, and orders\u2014have also been ignored, reflecting a failure of accountability and enforcement.\nToday, illegal brick kilns continue to operate on the city's outskirts, spewing toxic smoke into the air. Outdated vehicles emitting black smoke ply the roads, while poorly planned construction projects scatter dust and debris throughout the capital. These persistent issues reveal the mismanagement and inefficiencies of successive governments.\nTherefore, it is imperative for the interim government to take decisive action to combat this invisible yet deadly threat. We welcome the recent formulation of a national action plan to tackle air pollution. However, its immediate and effective implementation is critical. Additionally, the government must provide clear guidelines to citizens on how to protect themselves from the health hazards posed by polluted air. The time to act is now. Failure to address this crisis will only deepen its impact on public health and the economy.\n",
