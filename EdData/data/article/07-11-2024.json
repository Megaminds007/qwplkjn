His likely win represents many firsts: at 78, he will be the second oldest person ever thus elected; he will be the first Republican to win the popular vote in 20 years; he may be only the second President to serve non-consecutive terms in 132 years; and he would certainly be the first two-time President to also have been impeached twice by Congress. Despite these facts, Mr. Trump prevailed by winning in swing States and achieving a small swing across almost all States in favour of the Republican Party \u2014 thus gaining the keys to the electoral college and the popular vote, even if final counting and the formal call for each State is yet to be completed. While Democrats unsurprisingly held on to their stronghold States, most of which are situated on either coast, there appeared to be a \u201cred shift\u201d underway across the political system. This was seen in Republicans succeeding in seizing control of the Senate \u2014 especially through critical seats won in Ohio and West Virginia \u2014 and likely retaining the chair in the House of Representatives. If this pans out, the second Trump administration will benefit from a trifecta of the executive and two branches of the legislature and potentially have far-reaching political power that could dramatically shape domestic and foreign policy in line with the 47th President\u2019s vision.There could not have been more at stake in this consequential election \u2014 for the two major parties, for the American people, and for the world. Domestically, voters appeared to lash out against Ms. Harris for her association with an administration that did some serious policy heavy lifting towards the U.S.\u2019s post-pandemic economic renaissance, yet apparently failed to bring price levels of everyday goods down sufficiently. In parallel, Mr. Trump has continued, ever since demitting office under the cloud of inciting insurrection in January 2021, to issue dire statements about migrants and asylum seekers stealing U.S. jobs, once again appealing to the financial heartstrings of the blue-collar workers, as he did in his 2016 election campaign. This polarising tactic of whipping up fear of the \u201cother\u201d in a society that, in its ideal form as envisioned by its forefathers, would welcome and harness the power of immigrant workers of all hues, appears to have combined with disenchantment over stubbornly high price levels to end Ms. Harris\u2019s presidential run. Beyond the bread-and-butter issues, though, lies a deeper churning in the collective psyche of the American voter, one that has bestowed Mr. Trump with a profound second victory \u2014 the potentially irreversible death of not just of political correctness but also of fundamental political principles. Mr. Trump faces four criminal indictments, the most serious of which relate to his role in spurring a violent mob attack on the Capitol buildings in early 2021, the culmination of his democracy-threatening strategy of denying the 2020 election results. How did his supporters find it so easy to look past that? Is there not irrefutable evidence in the Georgia case against him of his attempts to tamper with official proceedings and lean on State election officials to misrepresent the outcome of the election? Does not the fact that he is a convicted felon awaiting sentencing in the Stormy Daniels case link him to criminal acts under law, rather than represent a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by dispirited liberals?\rIf the electorate has answered these questions with its vote, then that can only mean one thing \u2014 that his supporters explicitly condone their leader\u2019s chosen courses of action and that may include \u2014 however grey the legal logic might be for it \u2014 his eventual issue of a self-pardon or assumption of immunity from prosecution for all culpable acts, official or otherwise. He will also likely continue the trend of his first term in office of pardoning his close allies accused of a variety of crimes and use the punitive power of the state\u2019s machinery to go after the media and individual journalists who might irk him \u2014 as indeed his campaign team has already revoked the credentials of a senior political correspondent who apparently commented on internal anxiety over early voting numbers in Pennsylvania.\rAmerica will have no choice but to deal with the consequences of its voting decisions in 2024, but what might it mean for the world? In the economic sphere, tariffs are likely to be back in play, not only the 50%-60% rates that Mr. Trump has promised on goods from China but also a tariff of close to 20% on all U.S. imports, which could again risk triggering an all-out global trade war. For India it might raise the spectre of his labels of New Delhi as a \u201ctariff king\u201d and \u201ctrade abuser\u201d including in the context of the controversy over Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In the strategic space, Ukraine may be forced to accept unpalatable concessions towards finding a truce with Russia, and in Gaza and with Iran, Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu may relish the prospect of a laissez-faire attitude by the State Department. Under Trump 2.0, the Hindu nationalist project in India might continue apace with the confidence that no blowback would emanate from Washington on human rights and minority rights concerns.\rWhile the \u201cMAGA movement\u201d has most certainly seen a powerful revival in the outcome of the 2024 election, the rules-based international order founded on the bedrock of universal rights and liberal values is far from dead. When the personality cult of Mr. Trump ebbs in 2028, there will have to be a reckoning.

        "full_article": "The call by the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Lieutenant Governor (LG), Manoj Sinha, for restoration of Statehood to the Union Territory must be seen as both a demand from the newly elected regime and a reiteration of the promise made by the Centre. Being part of the LG\u2019s customary address to the Assembly, it obviously reflects the demand of the new dispensation headed by the National Conference, and is in accordance with a recent Cabinet resolution. At the same time, the LG also represents the President, who administers all Union Territories. One cannot forget that the Union government had given a solemn promise to the Supreme Court that J&K, which was downgraded and divided into two Union Territories (UT) in August 2019, will get back its Statehood. Although no timeline was given, the promise holds good with greater force now, as Assembly elections have been held and a representative government installed. The assurance had been given during the course of the hearing on the validity of the Presidential notifications abrogating the State\u2019s special status under Article 370 and the adoption of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act by Parliament. It was on the basis of this assurance that the Constitution Bench decided that it would not decide the question whether the State\u2019s reorganisation into two UTs was permissible under the Constitution.The reasonably high turnout in the Assembly elections had demonstrated the faith reposed by the people of J&K in democratic institutions, and their desire for a return to popular rule. While the removal of the State\u2019s special status may continue to rankle for many, few would disagree that the restoration of Statehood is a matter of priority for the people. The election of a new regime has strengthened democratic processes, and there is really no reason or excuse for any further delay in conferring Statehood. There is some cause for concern over the security situation, as evidenced by a spurt in militant attacks. Both civilians and soldiers have been killed, and many of the victims were non-local workers in the Valley. The most likely explanation for the escalation is that militant groups want to create a sense of fear among non-local workers and provoke a backlash from the security forces. However, neither any spike in terror attacks nor the fact that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre could not realise its hope of being in power in J&K should be seen as a possible reason to delay a positive decision on its Statehood. The need for the elected regime to have its governance space expanded by the benefits of full Statehood brooks no delay.

        "full_article": "Every American has this to celebrate: Democracy has won. Divisions can do with healing\nIn a two-party democracy, visuals from the two party HQs as election results wrap up are a study in contrasts. Yesterday, when Trump took an early victory lap at Mar-a-Lago, enthusiastic supporters at different hangouts looked full of joy, there was colour and music and chants of USA! USA! USA! Over at Howard University, the Kamala Harris election party dispersed into gloomy silence. As understandable as it is, to get locked into this binary is myopic and needlessly stressful.\u00a0\u00a0\nFree and fair elections are the work of generations and are still out of reach of half the world. US election day this time happened to coincide with Guy Fawkes Day across the pond, when too someone had tried to blow up a political system. But giving the lie to all the catastrophising ahead of Nov 5, voter access and counting proceeded smoothly, high turnouts were processed skilfully. This is as much a cause for celebration as all that had gone before \u2013 the dance of democracy drawing in a broad swathe of citizens instead of passivity and apathy.\nTheir passion also means that their differences are deeply felt. But for all that, after the election, democracies have to be open to the healing. This is central to their origin story. The first electoral handover of American presidency was in 1801. This disciplined transition from one party to another that US and India and Western Europe have long enjoyed, China and Russia have never seen.\nRemember Walt Whitman\u2019s wise words: \u201cDo I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d It is elections, and the peaceable acceptance of their results, that enables the vast diversity of countries like US and India to hold together. This is palpable in the voting queues as well, where people line up to vote for competing parties with a smiling camaraderie.\u00a0\nCelebs like Taylor Swift and Oprah can rain down endorsement confetti, and voters can \u201cShake it off.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t have to remain locked into identity traps, they can vote across colour and gender lines. While to be politically engaged is to be mindful of \u2018winning\u2019 or \u2018losing\u2019, this does not have to crumble into heartbreak or BP troubles. Institution-strong democracies have tonnes of continuity between different govts. Certainly any and every US president would seek to advance its economic and geopolitical interests. As for other countries, their greatest ask of the 47th Potus is ending the West Asia and Ukraine wars. Now that would make the celebrations global.\n\n",

        "full_article": "What else is there to think about? Money is power. Everybody else is thinking of money, don\u2019t be worried. Even those who are thinking of the other world are also thinking of money. Money represents power; with money, you can purchase power.\nYour saints are also thinking of money \u2013 they call it virtue. By virtue, you can purchase a better house in heaven and a better car. A few people are not that greedy: they are thinking only about money. A few people are greedier, they think of the other world.\nThe whole world is thinking in terms of money. Those who think in terms of power politics are thinking in terms of money because money is nothing but a symbol of power. That\u2019s why you can go on accumulating more and more money, but the desire to have still more never leaves you \u2013 because thirst for power is unlimited, it knows no end.\nPeople are thirsty for power because deep down they are empty. Somehow, they want to stuff that emptiness with something \u2013 it may be money, power, prestige, respectability, character, virtue. Anything will do; they want to stuff their inner emptiness.\nThere are only two types of people: those who try to stuff their inner emptiness, and those rare precious beings who try to see the inner emptiness. Those who try to stuff it remain empty, frustrated. They go on collecting garbage; their whole life is futile and fruitless. Only the other kind, very precious people who try to look into their inner emptiness without any desire to stuff it, become meditators.\n\nMeditation is looking into your emptiness, welcoming it, enjoying it, being one with it, with no desire to fill it \u2013 there is no need, because it is already full. It looks empty because you don\u2019t have the right way of seeing it. If you put your mind aside and look into your emptiness, it has tremendous beauty, it is divine, it is overflowing with joy. Nothing else is needed. Only then a person stops thinking about money, stops thinking about power, stops thinking about paradise \u2013 because he is already in paradise, because he is already rich, because he is already power\u2026\nLive the moment, drop the future, and money will lose its glamour. Live the moment with such totality and abandon, as if there is no other moment to come to you again, as if this is the last moment. Then all desire for money and power simply leaves you. If suddenly you come to know that today you are going to die, what will happen? Will you still be interested in money? Suddenly all desire for money will leave you.\nI will not tell you to renounce money. That has been told to you over the ages; it has not changed you. I am going to tell you something else: celebrate life, and obsession with money disappears automatically. And when it goes on its own accord, it leaves no scratches, it leaves no wounds behind, it leaves no trace behind.\nA bridged from The Book of Wisdom/ OSHO Times International/www.osho.com\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s rare to find people who love the sound of their voice when they hear it recorded for the first time. For bathroom singers, it\u2019s no less than a painful epiphany. Their whole world comes crashing around them when they hear the gem recorded when the family was away and neighbours were on vacation.\nThe wannabe crooners sound so bad to themselves that they reconcile themselves to never singing again before recording more songs. Soon their minds cannot process which song is worse than the other and they take it as a sign that they are ready to shift from the bathroom to the main hall. They begin by giving soft signals like humming while waiting for breakfast or turning the dining table into a tabla. When the food arrives, a rare praise comes their way and the family deals with the bombardment using earbuds.\nThe amateur singer then shifts his attention to his extended family and friends by sharing music-related forwards in WhatsApp groups before uploading his songs, first with nervous anticipation and later with sadistic pleasure. Out of deference for age or relation, group members respond sooner or later. They wonder who will bell the cat but play safe themselves.\n\nWhile they debate whether more emojis can open the floodgates, the songster has started dreaming about Open Karaoke sessions at office parties and religious festivals in societies. As D-day approaches, the self-taught artiste repeats the tunes buried in his head.\nThe society members brace themselves for the onslaught. Some avoid commenting on the singer\u2019s talent by volunteering the name of the film or the original singer or by digressing into topics like the golden era of film music.\nOn singing apps, insincere praise goes to the next level. Once adjectives like marvellous are exhausted comes the ultimate, where were you all these years? Or, you sound better than the original.\nIf one species is susceptible to flattery it\u2019s bathroom singers. But the only time they are actually taken seriously is when they are at the wheel on a highway. With a captive audience, they belt out numbers no one wants to hear. Passengers may exchange sideways glances but they dare not antagonise him. They hesitate to intervene and let him croon with gay abandon. By now he\u2019s started liking the sound of his own voice. What if he closes his eyes in bliss?\n\n",

        "full_article": "History, it was said, was made when a black woman was elected to lead Britain\u2019s Conservatives, who are in opposition after getting thumped by Labour in national polls. Kemi Badenoch ticked two identity boxes, black and woman, that have never been ticked by one Tory leader. She won in a scrupulously fair intra-party election. But there\u2019s history and, as clever Brits say, there\u2019s history. A minority in a major political job in any democracy is great news \u2013 but what\u2019s key is how coveted the job is when it\u2019s up for grabs and what was the calibre of other contestants.\nThree things of note here. First, when Tories got walloped in polls, several of its heavyweights lost. As British press noted, those grandees losing robbed the leadership contest of potential contenders. The candidate field was weakened. Second, among experienced Tories who survived the election bloodbath, there would have been the feeling that this wasn\u2019t exactly the best time to want to lead the party. Third, the first benchmark, support of a proportion of MPs, for nominating candidates for Tory leadership came down sharply \u2013 because the party has only 121 MPs. Anyone who could get 10 MPs to plump for him/her could get onto the ticket. All of this suggests Badenoch had a far easier time getting the top Tory job than would have been the case had the party been riding high.\n\nNone of this is to suggest Badenoch won\u2019t be an effective Tory leader. She\u2019s a standout minority community candidate anyway because she champions several views associated with cussed old white men of privilege \u2013 she\u2019s anti-woke, she\u2019s said \u201cnot all cultures are equally valid\u201d, she\u2019s anti-immigration, and she wants to cut taxes and reduce regulation. That makes her a perfect rightwing Tory leader. But not necessarily a history-making one.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The unbelievable has happened. In a moment of historic consequence for American democracy, Republican Donald Trump has won the 2024 US presidential elections that will see him return to the White House come January 20, 2025. This is indeed a remarkable comeback for the former president\u2014\"a phoenix from the ashes,\" as a Fox News anchor described it\u2014as he overcame a criminal conviction, indictments, apparent assassination attempts, and persistent accusations of authoritarianism on his path to re-election. In so doing, he also avenged his loss to President Joe Biden four years ago.\nAs per the latest count, Trump has secured 292 electoral votes (against Democratic contender Kamala Harris's 226 votes), thus taking control of the Senate and possibly the House of Representatives, with votes still being counted after early projected wins in key battleground states.\nWhat does a second Trump presidency mean for the world, and indeed Bangladesh? While the world braces for potentially disruptive and far-reaching impacts on global policies, Bangladesh, too, has its share of concerns that it will seek clarity on sooner rather than later. To understand some of the concerns, it is crucial to consider Trump's past policies and recent statements. Experts say a Trump presidency is likely to bring some, if not substantive, changes to the US foreign policy for Bangladesh, with potential ripple effects on issues covering trade, political dynamics, climate change, and Bangladesh's relations with regional powers.\nIt may be recalled that Trump, before the election, commented on the \"barbaric violence\" against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities in Bangladesh\u2014a portrayal that is both unfair and unfounded. There is a concern among some that the US may be prompted to view Bangladesh through India's lens, and we hope such concerns will be duly addressed in the coming days.\nA Trump presidency may also emphasise more transactional diplomacy, echoing his \"America First\" stance, which could potentially impact Bangladesh-US trade. The US is our biggest trading partner. But given Trump's history of raising tariffs and protectionist policies, Bangladesh's dependence on exports to the US could, theoretically, face disruptions. His climate policy is another issue of concern. Trump's earlier stance on climate change, marked by US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and reduced engagement with global climate initiatives, was alarming for vulnerable nations like Bangladesh that depend on climate adaptation financing. His track record with the WHO also shows potential for strained relations with global health bodies, which could potentially impede Bangladesh's access to international health resources.\nThere are many other areas of mutual interest where Bangladesh and the US will likely cross paths in an increasingly complex and changing reality.\u00a0It remains to be seen how the relations between our interim government and the upcoming Trump presidency shape up, however. For his part, Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has been quick to congratulate the president-elect, expressing optimism for strengthened bilateral ties and future cooperation. Going forward, we hope the government will properly engage with its US counterpart to ensure that our interests are protected.\n",

        "full_article": "The night started off, as it does, with red states. But unlike 2020, there was no confusion. The percentage of votes counted quickly began to show a clear picture: Donald Trump's victory.\nTrump won the presidency through the electoral system and the popular vote, which has not happened in the past two decades. He overperformed in several states, following the trends of the previous two elections that polls underestimated his voters. In three consecutive election cycles, pollsters have not gotten a grip on Trump supporters. The media has engaged in many satirical theories to understand the mass support for Donald Trump in the US. What's clear is that the US media and institutions in general need to figure out what can aptly be described as a shift to the far-right. No comparisons with Hitler, no cases, could stop him.\nIn 2016, when Hilary Clinton lost, precisely the same way by losing the \"Blue Wall\"\u2014Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014the underlying reasons behind Trump's victory were not addressed. Rather, the analysis focused on the glass ceiling and Clinton's loss. Doing so for this election would be the gravest mistake. While it could be true that Harris's gender has a part to play in her loss, it is well-known that Joe Biden would have lost against Trump as well. When asked in several interviews what Harris would change about the Biden-Harris administration, she reverted to her pride, steering clear of showing how she would drastically differ from her boss.\nWhile a comprehensive major picture of the voter turnout is yet to emerge, the early voter turnout\u2014more than 80 million US citizens cast their votes before November 5\u2014was high. As it happened in 2020, mail-in ballots proved to switch the game for Biden; we waited days as votes were being counted during the pandemic. The high turnout, especially early, when juxtaposed with the sheer number\u2014not just in the Electoral College\u2014of votes for Donald Trump and the fact that he might also win the popular vote, is telling of the national sentiment in the US. While a lot is to be seen in the coming days, it's clear that the US is shifting to the far-right. It's incumbent on all of us to reconcile, as hard as it may be for some, that US politics has moved to a state that an imprudent person is preferred over diplomatic human beings.\nKamala Harris underperformed in commonly Blue counties in the battleground states, where her boss, President Joe Biden, performed better in 2020. For example, in upscale Detroit, Michigan, Harris performed much worse than Biden in 2020. Though the causes of her underperformance will emerge more in the coming days, and data needs to be gathered to understand where Harris went wrong\u2014one fact is clear: Harris's centrist campaign in a polarised US simply did not work. In many ways, it was a clever strategy on paper: reviving the John McCain and Mitt Romney type of Republican. But for now, it can be concluded that centrism is hardly reading the room in a country so polarised. In North Carolina, for example, where Trump won, several counties shifted left while others shifted right, according to\u00a0The New York Times. Standing in the middle ground, the classic case of trying to please every party undoubtedly played a role in Harris's unexpectedly disappointing performance in the elections.\nAnd whatever strategy the Democrats have deployed in electioneering along with their policies now stands to be proven as outdated. It must be noted that the Republican turnout machine\u2014largely powered by allied conservative groups\u2014focused on getting reliably conservative voters back to the polls for Trump. And it worked.\nRepublicans took over the Senate, retaking the chamber for the first time in four years. The House is also poised to be Republican. Everything, from the president-elect's policies on taxes to healthcare, will depend on the makeup of the two chambers of Congress. The Senate is solely responsible for confirming a president's cabinet officials and judges\u2014from the federal, district and Supreme Court. Four of the nine justices\u2014other than Trump's appointees\u2014are in their 70s.\nA Republican-led Senate would boost Trump's far-right presidency, and it was the only institution that provided the necessary logjams for Trump's loyalist tendencies and his \"I can do whatever I want\" mindset as the leader of a democratic nation. Though there are moderate voices in the Senate, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who was outspoken against Trump, this Senate is more likely to defer to him, who will be all the more recharged with a second term in the White House.\nThe implications for a Trump victory are far-reaching for the turbulent political atmosphere in the US. Donald Trump is a man who openly favours loyalty over the country, yet he is still favoured by citizens, for whatever reasons. A second Trump term, along with the Republican sweep, means we are possibly looking at a completely new version of US politics. The country is in need of some soul-searching, now more than ever.\nRamisa Rob\u00a0is in-charge of Geopolitical Insights at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The July 2024 uprising in Bangladesh marked a pivotal moment as students and citizens rallied for transformative change, challenging established political hierarchies. Unlike previous movements, this protest operated independently of any political party leadership, underscoring a grassroots demand for reform that had eluded mainstream opposition efforts for over a decade. For the first time, a mass uprising forced the removal of a seemingly entrenched regime through sheer public resolve, demonstrating the often-overlooked power of collective action\u2014an \"event\" as described by eminent French philosopher Alain Badiou: a disruptive break from the status quo of conventional political order.\nOn August 8, the formation of an interim government emerged as a critical turning point in Bangladesh's political landscape, briefly uniting opposition forces, including the BNP, around a shared agenda for paradigmatic change. Initially supportive of the student movement, some argue that the BNP later tempered its endorsement, seemingly distancing itself strategically from some of the demands for structural reform of extractive institutions widely seen as enabling the rise of illiberal, authoritarian governance, epitomised by the recently ousted regime. Notably, the BNP is now subtly yet unmistakably shifting away from calls for the immediate resignation of the sitting president\u2014a figure closely tied to the discredited past\u2014and towards advocating for a more cautious, electoral roadmap. This strategic repositioning has allowed the BNP to present itself as a stabilising force focused on continuity and gradual reform through electoral processes, a choice that critics argue reflects a conservative impulse to preserve familiar structures.\nAccording to cultural theorist Frederic Jameson, understanding such political decisions requires analysis through multiple lenses or \"horizons.\" On the \"political horizon,\" Jameson's first level of analysis, the BNP's reluctance to support student-led calls for immediate presidential removal can be viewed as a tactical move to balance reform aspirations with stability. By prioritising an electoral roadmap over sudden upheaval, the BNP is perhaps portraying itself as a seasoned opposition force. This approach positions the party as a measured alternative amid calls for radical change\u2014a strategic choice to avoid being swept up in what it might see as \"instant gratification\" in favour of long-term goals. However, critics argue that this approach risks the party appearing overly conservative and misaligned with the youth-driven energy fuelling the July uprising.\n\nThe \"social horizon,\" meanwhile, explores deeper class and institutional interests that shape political choices, often unconsciously. Here, the BNP's distance from grassroots reform demands can be seen as aligning with the entrenched two-party system, which has long structured politics in Bangladesh. By prioritising incremental reforms and institutional stability over radical transformation, BNP implicitly supports structures that have historically benefited both itself and the Awami League. This reluctance to disrupt institutional power structures could be understood through Jameson's concept of the \"political unconscious,\" where underlying class interests influence behaviour that may appear pragmatic but, in effect, serves to protect established hierarchies. The BNP's stance could be reflective of this tendency, preserving a status quo that risks sidelining the radical reforms that some segments of the public are increasingly demanding.\nIn the \"historical horizon,\" Jameson's final layer of interpretation, BNP's response to the uprising can be seen as part of Bangladesh's cyclical political struggles. Rather than embracing a transformative shift, BNP's positioning could suggest a reluctance to break from long-standing political rivalries, framing itself as the ideological heir to the student movement's anti-Awami League sentiment while resisting a deep engagement with systemic overhaul. But this positioning could risk reducing the uprising's transformative vision to another episode in the Awami League-BNP rivalry. In Jameson's view, such cyclical politics underscore a missed opportunity for genuine change, as BNP's actions could hint at continuity within Bangladesh's familiar political pattern to some, rather than a break from it.\nFrench philosopher Alain Badiou's concept of the \"moment\" underscores the unique potential of the July 2024 uprising to introduce new political realities. For Badiou, such a moment represents a radical rupture from established norms, challenging entrenched power structures and creating the possibility of unforeseen political reforms. The uprising's mass mobilisation of public sentiment without major party backing exemplifies that this kind of \"event\" informed disruptive rupture, a grassroots force demanding structural change that bypasses established political channels.\n\nHowever, Badiou also warns that these transformative moments can be co-opted or neutralised if not sustained by active revolutionary commitment, or what he calls \"fidelity\" to the event. The BNP's stance, which shifted from initially aligning with the students to later portraying the president as a stabilising figure, could risk dissipating the transformative potential of this \"moment.\" By reverting to conventional political processes, BNP's approach could undermine the movement's radical energy, restoring the status quo ante, rather than actualising the profound systemic reforms demanded by some people.\nUltimately, the BNP's decision to prioritise stability over radical change illustrates a complex dilemma: straddling the aftermath of a revolutionary \"event\" and realpolitik. While the party's cautious stance may preserve order and avoid immediate risks, it also places the BNP at odds with some segments of society that have become increasingly disillusioned by traditional politics. This hesitance could alienate reform-minded citizens, especially younger voters who may view BNP's position as self-serving or evasive. Rather than merely adopting the movement's ideological legacy, BNP's strategic ambivalence risks positioning it as another entity within the political duopoly that the uprising implicitly critiques.\nBNP's strategic choices in the wake of the July uprising reveal a tension between preserving continuity and embracing transformative potential. While Jameson's \"Three Horizons\" show how the party's stance aligns with established power structures, Badiou's concept of the \"moment\" underscores the revolutionary potential that the BNP risks missing. By aligning itself too closely with stability, and gradualism, BNP could marginalise itself in the eyes of a public yearning for meaningful change. To truly capture the movement's spirit, the party may need to move beyond mere strategic positioning and fully engage with the grassroots demands that fuelled the July uprising\u2014demands that traditional, incremental politics can no longer afford to overlook. By the same token, this challenge also calls for a delicate balancing act of realpolitik, as the party weighs transformative ambitions against the pressures of political continuity and stability in an unpredictable landscape.\nFaridul Alam\u00a0lives in and writes from New York City, US.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
