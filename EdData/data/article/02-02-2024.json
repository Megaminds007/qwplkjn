Echoing the Finance Ministry\u2019s review of the economy\u2019s performance, and stating that Mr. Modi had inherited a situation replete with \u2018enormous challenges\u2019 when he assumed office, Ms. Sitharaman asserted that those were surmounted through \u2018structural reforms, pro-people programmes and the creation of opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship\u2019. A reinvigorated economy had helped ensure that the fruits of development started reaching the people at scale, imbuing them with a sense of purpose and hope, and translated into a bigger mandate five years ago, she averred. In a clear sign that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led regime is far more confident of returning to power this time around, Ms. Sitharaman eschewed any announcements that could be seen as targeting a particular constituency of voters. Instead, the focus was on talking up the commitment to \u2018an inclusive and sustainable policy approach that had led to the attainment of a more comprehensive GDP of governance, development and performance\u2019. A nonchalant observation that the government would detail a road map for attaining a \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 by 2047 in its full Budget in July, was premised on the certainty of winning a \u2018resounding\u2019 electoral mandate.The Budget numbers posit a continuing journey on the path of fiscal consolidation, with the Revised Estimates (RE) pegging the current year\u2019s fiscal deficit at 5.8% of the GDP, a 10 basis points improvement from last February\u2019s Budget Estimate (BE) of 5.9%. This, the Minister has achieved by pruning effective capital expenditure by \u20b91 lakh crore in the RE, a moderation in nominal growth estimates notwithstanding. For 2024-25, she has projected a sharper consolidation and pegged the deficit at 5.1% by factoring in a 14% jump in revenue receipts on a BE basis, that is expected to help offset an 11% increase in estimated capital expenditure to \u20b911.11 lakh crore. Ms. Sitharaman, who emphasised a tripling in the capital spending outlays over the past four years that had had \u2018a multiplier impact on growth and employment creation\u2019, however, glossed over the fact that the budgeted increase in capital spending next year is set to be sharply lower than the 28% jump in the RE versus last fiscal\u2019s actuals. At a time when official estimates for private consumption spending show growth at its lowest ebb since the pandemic, the Budget\u2019s stress on fiscal prudence does carry the risk of undermining economic momentum. The bigger challenge is the more worrying possibility of rising inequality.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\nbudgets and budgeting\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\nemployment\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus\n\n/\n\nsocial issue",

        "full_article": "Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Hemant Soren stepped down as the Chief Minister of Jharkhand on Wednesday moments before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him on allegations of money laundering. Mr. Soren faces charges of benefiting from tribal land transactions based on forged documents. The judiciary will examine these allegations, but what necessitates the arrest of an accused is a serious question that the judiciary needs to settle in clearer and enforceable terms. The ED, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), commands sweeping powers of arrest. Barriers for bail are very high in PMLA cases. Petitions challenging the July 2022 judgment of the Supreme Court upholding these powers are pending before it. Meanwhile, the ED has raised the stakes by arresting a Chief Minister of an Opposition party, which cannot be viewed as a routine law enforcement event. Mr. Soren\u2019s lawyers mentioned in the Court on February 1 that this has implications for the polity of the country, seeking an urgent hearing of his plea against the arrest. Meanwhile, the ED has asked Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal to appear before it on February 2, after his failure to turn up for questioning four times. Mr. Soren has called for \u2018a war against a feudal system that oppresses poor, dalit and tribals\u2019, terming the case against him an assault on the tribal communities that he represents.Faced with allegations, politicians often seek cover behind their community identities, but it is undeniable that the long arm of the Indian law reaches the weaker sections of society more easily. The JMM\u2019s troubles did not end with Mr. Soren\u2019s arrest. The selection of a new Chief Minister became entangled in a family feud. Instead, as a compromise, it will be a veteran fighter for tribal rights, Champai Soren, but the Governor has not yet invited him to form the government. The Jharkhand police has filed a first information report based on a complaint by Mr. Soren under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, but it is unlikely to stand. That said, ED investigations have now established a pattern that fits perfectly with the political designs of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Soren\u2019s arrest follows the reengineering of the alliance in Bihar that brought the BJP back to power, where the Governor acted swiftly to facilitate it. As on multiple occasions, leaders under the ED\u2019s scanner magically turned clean once they joined hands with the BJP. The distinction that central agencies make sometimes appears to be not between the corrupt and the clean, but whether one is with the BJP or not. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nJharkhand Mukti Morcha\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\narrest\n\n/\n\nmoney laundering\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nlaws\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\ntribals\n\n/\n\nGovernor\n\n/\n\ninvestigation\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party",

Commission\u2019s terms of reference were set out in December along with the appointment of economist Arvind Panagariya as its chairman.\nFederalism\u2019s lynchpin |\u00a0As an institutional arrangement, finance commissions are at the heart of India\u2019s federal architecture. Mandated by the Constitution, FCs are primarily meant to recommend a division of resources between GOI and states. In the process, they also set out how the resources that flow to states from GOI are to be distributed among them. GOI\u2019s budget arithmetic is influenced by an FC\u2019s recommendations. This makes FCs more important in resource transfers, even if it is budgets that hog attention.\n\nTwo asymmetries |\u00a0Expenditures incurred by states as a percentage of GDP are greater than that of GOI. However, for administrative efficiency, GOI is empowered to raise most of the taxes. It leads to vertical asymmetry in India\u2019s federal system. Separately, states are very different in terms of financial needs and capabilities. Addressing these two asymmetries smoothly determines how harmonious a federal system is.\nLimited ToR |\u00a0FCs function according to terms of reference (ToR) they are given. 16th FC has a limited ToR compared to its predecessor\u2019s. 15th FC was given three terms that determined the incentive structure underpinning grants given to states. That level of detailing is missing in ToRs for this FC. It\u2019s not unusual for FCs to be given ToRs halfway through their functioning. Therefore, there\u2019s a possibility the current ToRs will be expanded.\nData gaps, delimitation fears |\u00a016th FC will function against the backdrop of inadequate data and political anxiety among southern states about the possibility of delimitation of parliamentary seats. A delay in conducting 2021 Census deprives this FC of valuable data, particularly a recent baseline for population projections. While delimitation is unrelated to an FC\u2019s remit, politics around it is unlikely to leave 16th FC untouched. It will require deft handling as FCs are far too important to be ensnared in political cross-currents.\nFCs make their recommendations after extensive consultation with both GOI and states. FC\u2019s functioning over the next 21 months before the October 2025 deadline will make it a real-time experiment in federalism. It\u2019s critical that its effort is seen as being even-handed.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The recent government decision to slash cash incentive rates for over forty export products might raise concerns, especially in the context of the country's less-than-ideal export performance this year. The central bank this week announced fresh cash incentives for 43 export products for the remaining six months of this fiscal. The move came in the form of a revision of the earlier decision in August 2023 setting the rates of incentive to apply to the products for the entire fiscal (FY 23-24).The rationale behind continuing with cash incentives-the other name for cash subsidy--has been debated for some time, with some arguing that it doesn't significantly boost exports, although conclusive evidence is lacking due to the absence of comprehensive studies. Nevertheless, it is believed that cash incentives did help certain products, especially new and non-traditional products, in accessing export markets. However, according to WTO rules governing international trade, such incentives are seen as hindering free market principles, and thus, the WTO prohibits this practice for all but the least developed countries (LDCs). While Bangladesh, as an LDC, is exempt from this restriction, it will be obligated to cease offering cash incentives for exports upon its anticipated graduation from the LDC status by the year 2026. Therefore, reducing incentive rates well in advance of this transition aligns with the evolving situation. Newspaper reports, quoting the central bank, have said that the move is part of the gradual phasing out of the incentives which by 2026-the year of the country's graduation-would be prohibitive. That is to say, instead of withdrawing the facility abruptly, the central bank has opted for phased reduction potentially providing exporters with some time to adjust. This approach appears pragmatic.A closer look at the revised scheme indicates that the reduced rates are not overly severe and should not cause significant shockwaves for exports. The number-one export product, readymade garment (RMG) will get 0.50 per cent cash incentive for the next six months against 1.0 per cent earlier. For product and market diversification, RMG exporters used to get a 4.0 per cent incentive, which has now come down to 3.0 per cent. Other important items which will face cut on rates between 2.0 to 5.0 per cent include agricultural products, jute products, light engineering and plastic. The reduction of the rate in respect of active pharmaceutical ingredients from 20 per cent to 10 per cent appears to be rather steep.While the country's anticipated graduation from the LDC group to the developing country status by 2026 is undoubtedly commendable, it brings forth a host of changes, notably the loss of certain privileges and preferential treatments enjoyed as an LDC. The cessation of cash incentives is one such, and hence preparing for the future without such government support is indeed prudent and in line with competitive market dynamics.",

        "full_article": "To have a rogue state as an immediate neighbour can never be to the liking of any nation, much less when the latter has to shelter the former's 1.3 million refugees for years together. This becomes particularly challenging when the international community and aid agencies slash their contribution to the refugees by one-third. In March 2023, the monthly food allocation for each Rohingya was reduced from $12 to $10 and then from June the same was cut further to $8.0. The pretext was the reduction in international aid for refugees. There are, however, reports, not so widely published, that the aid for the refugees has been diverted substantially to Ukraine for its war against Russia. The US under Joe Biden and its allies have lined up ---better say toeing the American strategic policy of expanding the West's spheres of influence---to go whole hog on the mission of taking on Russia and perhaps their agenda was to stop China once the truncated Soviet Union weakened beyond recovery. Unfortunately, the strategy backfired and additionally, Russia and China became closer to each other. It is the European Union (EU) and Britain that are feeling the heat now. America may have reaped from the bonfire it started the benefit of its dollar as the most widely accepted foreign currency globally but for small and emerging economies this has spelt disaster. Bangladesh is no exception to this order. Geopolitical rivalry between competitive powers has put this small country in a tight corner because of its strategic location. The country has slid from a vibrant economy to a struggling one because of this adverse international economic regime and power rivalry. Even its tight-rope walking is looked at with suspicion and if there is any perceptible tilt towards any camp, the other becomes irate. In fact, the country has no staunch supporter because each has its own calculations for preserving its own interests. Both India and China, regional rivals, vociferous about standing by Bangladesh have a common diplomatic stratagem not to exert their influence on the military government in Myanmar lest their commercial and economic interests in the vast energy and natural resources of that country get hurt. Now the insurgent groups known as ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) representing the minority ethnic populations such as the Karen, the Kochin, the Mon and the Rohingya, all aligned with the National Unity Government (NUG), have closed their ranks to launch a concerted armed aggression against the military regime with tremendous success. Right at the moment, fighting is going on in Rakhine State where the military headquarter has fallen to the Three Brotherhood Alliance. This follows a series of reversals suffered by the Myanmar military known as Tatmadaw and its loss of personnel, equipment and territories to the rebel fighters in the country's eastern, northern and western parts. The military has been pushed back to the heartland in central Myanmar. The eruption of conflicts has prematurely stalled the process of Rohingya repatriation, throwing the fate of the refugees into uncertainty and prolonging the bearing of burden on Bangladesh now undergoing severe economic stress. The offensive, codenamed Operation 1027, launched on October 27 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance composed of the Rakhine Arakan Army (AA), the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance (MNDAA) and the ethnic Ta'ang/Palaung Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) has captured several towns and more than 300 military installations all across Myanmar. Thousands of government troops, police officers and militia members have lost their lives to the unrelenting offensive. Now Bangladesh has to suffer directly or indirectly because of the instability in Myanmar. That disruption of trade carried mostly through Rakhine State has been responsible for loss at the rate of Tk 30 million a day since the October 27 attack by rebels is, however, small compared to the social, economic and environmental costs Bangladesh has already suffered and the threats posed to its national security. The majority ethnic Bamar-controlled administration has often launched ethnic cleansing drives against the Rohingya since 1978, forcing them to flee to Bangladesh. This latest flare-up of armed conflicts in Rakhine and Chin both of which have common borders with Bangladesh, has accentuated the political, economic, humanitarian and security challenges before the country. Apart from the direct violation of borderline and airspace due to escalation of fighting between the junta troops and rebels, influx of more refugees cannot be ruled out. The Myanmar junta has often resorted to the \"Four Cuts\" strategy based on cutting off sources of food, funds, information and recruits for EAOs against the ethnic groups. It is one such campaign in 2017 that compelled about a million Rohinya to flee their home and hearth for Bangldesh. Now the Rakhine may join them.The most dreaded scenario is the escalation and lingering of the war which has the potential of smuggling of more and more drugs---this has already become a headache for the Bangladesh government --- and weapons into the restive Chattogram Hill Tracts and Southern Chattogram Division. In fact, the route of drug smuggling opened by Myanmar has set a vicious rot to the social body of Bangladesh with hardly any remedy. Either way, the insidious spectre the Myanmar conundrum now unfolds is expected to have seriously adverse impacts on Bangldesh. If the AA defeats the military to take control of Rakhine, Bangladesh shares a statelet border; if it loses the battle, this country may end up receiving unwittingly disguised AA fighters. In a situation like this, Bangladesh's options are limited. The stalled process of repatriation of the Rohingya mediated by China cannot be taken ahead because of the uncertainty. Gambia's lawsuit at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the Myanmar junta regime for violation of various provisions of the Genocide Convention may not force the regime to comply but a favourable verdict can be a moral victory for the Rohingya and Bangladesh. This can be complemented by judicious use of the weak-kneed UN forums to bring the humanitarian crisis to the notice of the civil societies across the world instead of governments. Massive global public opinion thus formed can force intransigent governments to restore aid flows for the refugees and even help open avenues for their repatriation. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The central bank of late is talking loudly about the impending reform of the country's banking sector, which has been long overdue. Bangladesh Bank governor Abdur Rauf Talukder during a meeting with the managing directors of banks in Dhaka on Wednesday talked tough and advised the latter to be prepared for harsh reforms.Why is there a sudden change in the BB's mood? As reported in a section of the media, the BB governor addressing the bank MDs explained the reasons for being serious about banking sector reforms.\" Since there is a specific commitment in the election manifesto to carry out reforms in the banking sector, we need to implement that. There is no political pressure on us. In the event of their failure to improve their financial health, the weak banks will be merged with other banks\", the BB governor was quoted as saying in a vernacular business newspaper. Mr Talukder told the meeting that about 40 out of 61 banks were performing well and the rest will face mergers with other banks. The governor's statement highlights one basic weakness that the central bank has been demonstrating year after year. Despite having all the powers under the relevant laws, the men who presided over this regulatory body failed to gather enough courage to make independent decisions in matters of giving licences to new banks, regulating errant banks and ensuring good governance in the banking sector. The central bank is not supposed to be guided by the electoral manifesto of any government. By the law, disciplining the entire financial sector is its basic responsibility.The BB government has listed 21 banks as weak. The number could be a little bit more. A rigorous check on the financial health of all banks might help get the actual number of candidates for merger or other appropriate measures.The central bank reportedly has finalised 17 action plans to ensure reforms and good governance in the banking sector. A tough ask, no doubt, for the rot has gone too deep. The central bank has more or less preferred to be an onlooker when a section of borrowers plundered the resources of banks. Taking advantage of regulatory slackness, the delinquent borrowers have become hardened defaulters over the years.Mergers might help solve an all-engulfing problem partially. To give the most important signal that the BB is serious about reform, tough measures need to be initiated to get back banks' money from top defaulters, who had deliberately withheld loan repayments taking recourse to various mechanisms, including loan rescheduling and structured loan facilities, using their political connections. The BB governor reportedly asked the MDs of banks to examine the issues of merger of financially weak banks with strong ones. Technically, the governor is right in his approach as MDs are responsible for all financial, and operational matters of banks. But the fact remains that all powers lie with the bank boards. In many cases, sponsor directors of banks have political links which had helped them get bank licences. One cannot dismiss their power and influence. These people are likely to oppose tooth and nail any merger move. The members of the bank boards will be unwilling to part with the financial power and authority they have been enjoying. The Farmers' Bank, now Padma Bank, is a case in point. This bank proved itself a strong candidate for so-called M&A. But it did not happen. Some state-owned scheduled banks and investment entities were forced to put in a big amount of money to save the sinking Farmer's Bank. But the bank is yet to come out of the woods. Merger does happen when a relatively strong enterprise makes all its assessments of the outcome and agrees to be a part of the process. It cannot be thrust upon unwilling partners. In Bangladesh's situation, a merger could prove a difficult task. Merger should be the last step under the BB's action plans. Getting back the banks' funds from top defaulters, schemers and scammers and resisting political interference in bank management and loan issues remain the central bank's priority tasks.

For the youth, consistent physical activity yields manifold benefits, including enhanced cardiovascular health and fortified muscles, tissues and bones. Moreover, exercise triggers the release of endorphins, natural mood enhancers that mitigate stress in today's frenetic milieu, thereby fostering an overall sense of well-being.In addition, prioritising mental well-being is also important for the younger generation. Regular exercise not only instills confidence and a positive body image but also optimises cognitive function, aiding in the management of emotional distress. By advocating an active lifestyle, we can empower youth to navigate life's challenges with resilience and a buoyant disposition, essential for personal growth and progress.Inculcating a holistic approach to wellness necessitates more than immediate gratification; it entails sowing the seeds for future mental and emotional fortitude. By encouraging activities such as hiking, cycling, or yoga, we can provide avenues for rejuvenation and mindfulness amidst life's hustle and bustle. Through such endeavours, we can imbue young minds with a sense of equilibrium and mindfulness, equipping them to confront the vicissitudes of an ever-changing world.Teaching holistic wellness entails laying the groundwork for a future where mental and emotional well-being holds as much significance as physical fitness.
