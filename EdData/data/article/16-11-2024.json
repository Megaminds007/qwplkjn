The BJP\u2019s sharp focus has been on the rhetoric of \u201cBangladeshi infiltration\u201d, which it is linking not only to the State\u2019s demographic changes but also to crimes against tribal women, land alienation, and what some Adivasi communities perceive as a gradual dilution of their indigenous cultural practices. The party accuses the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance of encouraging \u201cinfiltrators\u201d to bolster the alliance\u2019s voter base. This campaign has been running alongside the BJP\u2019s efforts to stress the importance of unity among SC, ST and OBC groups using the messaging of \u201cek hai to safe hai (safe when united\u201d), suggesting that the BJP\u2019s campaign is targeted at having a coalition with more place for Adivasis alongside the party\u2019s existing base of non-Adivasi Hindu voters. Amidst the blitz of campaign speeches by the BJP\u2019s star campaigners, the ruling alliance\u2019s campaign led by Chief Minister Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana Soren, has squarely put the onus of checking alleged \u201cinfiltrators\u201d on the Centre, without explicitly negating the claim of the BJP. The INDIA campaign also tries to drive home the point that as Jharkhand has no international borders, the onus of checking alleged infiltrators should be on the Union, where the BJP is in power.Another central theme in the INDIA bloc\u2019s campaign strategy has been the promise of implementing land registries as they had been surveyed in 1932 for the purpose of determining domicile. But the JMM and its allies are careful here too, as Jharkhand has had a history of settlement with migration from neighbouring States in waves ever since. Some senior BJP leaders have suggested a National Register of Citizens in the State, though the party does not mention this in its manifesto. The BJP is talking up charges of corruption that sent leaders such as Mr. Soren and the Congress\u2019s Alamgir Alam to jail. The JMM has been questioning the announcement of the election in the State a month before the term of the current Assembly ends, calling it as a BJP ploy to disrupt the welfare schemes of the Soren government. While the BJP is going all out to attack the popularity of these schemes by questioning their implementation at the fag end of the alliance government\u2019s term, its manifesto has tried to outdo the JMM\u2019s in terms of sops being promised for the youth, women and farmers in the State.

        "full_article": "It is an unambiguous and resounding mandate for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP), a coalition that includes civil society groups and trade unions, in Sri Lanka\u2019s just-concluded parliamentary election. The election has demonstrated the NPP\u2019s growing appeal among all sections, who had in 2022, frustrated with economic hardships and the old political establishment, thrown out what they despised as a corrupt regime. Having elected JVP chief Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the country\u2019s President in September, the people have now provided the ruling alliance with a hard-to-get over two-thirds majority. The NPP, which has secured 141 seats, with around 6.87 million votes in 196 seats, bagged 18 more seats under the system of proportional representation, giving it 159 seats in total in the 225-member legislature. The NPP has accomplished what former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could not get in the 2010 poll after the LTTE\u2019s defeat.The significance of the poll also lies in the extent and geographic span of the NPP\u2019s victory. It has been a remarkable show in Jaffna and Vanni in the Northern Province, that is home to Tamils and the stronghold of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi. Except for Batticaloa, the NPP emerged the top party in the east, with its sizeable population of Muslims, and in the Central Province\u2019s Nuwara Eliya district, with its majority hill-country Tamils. In its vote share, island-wide, the coalition outperformed Mr. Dissanayake, who touched the 50% mark only in four electoral districts in the September poll. The rise of the coalition, from three seats with 3.84% vote share in 2020, to a super majority now, is remarkable. The political calculations of Mr. Dissanayake, who called for a poll within days of assuming office, have paid off, as the Opposition did not put up a fight. Though Sajith Premadasa\u2019s Samagi Jana Balawegaya remains the principal Opposition party in Parliament, its vote share has dropped considerably. The parties backed by two former Presidents, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mr. Rajapaksa, have performed miserably. While voters have spared Mr. Dissanayake the compulsion of seeking allies to pursue his reform agenda, he should still consult all sections. His promises at the time of the presidential poll, such as the abolition of executive presidency, a new Constitution, and the repeal of oppressive laws, cannot be fulfilled merely with support in the legislature. The big takeaway from the November 14 poll is that the country has voted for decisive change that it sought from the time of the citizen\u2019s uprising in 2022. Mr. Dissanayake, at the commencement of his innings, described the unity of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, and all Sri Lankans as the bedrock of the new beginning. He can now build on this unity.

Judges have the latitude to read the law basis own values \u2013 and they\u2019re plucked from the very society they serve, so such a reading is unsurprising. For, the real cruelty is such attitudes to daughters-in-law remain routine.\u00a0\nBeti-beti welfarism of several decades ensured much progress in how far the \u2018daughter\u2019 has come. But it remains a scary road to \u2018daughter-in-law\u2019 status. Will the marital home be a safe space? Or hell? In the marital home, her \u201cduties\u201d are sharply defined, but her basic rights ambiguous \u2013 if anything, a source of conflict. Her well-being is at the mercy of in-laws\u2019 expectations. Suffice to note studies show the number of grandkids is decided on grandma\u2019s preference, where bahu is less educated than mom-in-law.\nPopular culture without pause reiterates the daughter-in-law code of conduct: \u2018obedience\u2019 numero uno. Society celebrates \u2018bahus\u2019 juggling multiple roles till the last breath, but hey, not a choo of complaint \u2013 it is but her \u2018dharma\u2019 to serve us so.

Survival of the family as society desires it rests 100% on controls over the daughter-in-law. Is it killing her? Of course it is. But apparently, that\u2019s alright \u2013 even for HC judges.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Technology is dooming us to virtual unreality\u00a0\nToday, the line between the online and offline worlds is blurred, as phones and algorithms mediate more of our daily activities. Most of what passes for authentic experience is vicarious and virtual. The Extinction of Experience: Being Human in a Disembodied World by the philosopher Christine Rosen reminds us of the value of the physical reality we share.\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. Direct experience is our first teacher. A fighter\u2019s scar, stretch marks from pregnancy, metaphors about a broken heart, or a nosy neighbour, these remind us that we experience things with our bodies. Face to face interaction is how we learn patience, and a sense of public space. It helps us conceptualise a shared reality.\u00a0\nBut now, online communities tell us how the \u2018real world\u2019 works. Consensus reality seems insubstantial, as more of us mistrust our actual experience and live in these mental cocoons. Increasingly, young people prefer virtual interactions. To minimise awkward human contact, airports rely on kiosks to check-in and salespersons are replaced by iPads.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re meant to look at each other. Our intuition rests on the ability to read faces, physical signals, postures, micro-expressions. Encountering each other on screens, through texts and posts, deprives us of that ability. Children\u2019s first experience of play, music, words, might now come from screens. Teachers struggle to hold their attention in real classrooms. Reading emotion and intent needs extended in-person contact, a capacity that children and teens are increasingly missing out on as physical playtime shrinks.\n\u2018Veja du\u2019 is what some technologists call this illusory reality: the sense of having done something virtually without having experienced it in real life. We consider ourselves familiar with famous destinations through VR, or imagine what we\u2019ll look like when we age, or even simulate romantic relationships with fictional characters.\nThis means losing out on embodied cognition. We think with our bodies, by making things physically. Note-taking on a laptop means shallow processing. Architects who draft by hand know the connections between mind and body that they are trading off for the efficiency of computation.\u00a0\nWe now perform our emotions, with memes, gifs and emojis. One study found that college kids score 40% lower on empathy than those from 30 years ago, and this decline coincides with smartphone adoption.\nTech is also racing to supply what we miss in terms of bodily cues. Sensors and gadgets to measure breathing, heart rates, autonomic nervous signals already exist, but could soon be a standard smartphone capability. Persuasive tech, armed with huge amounts of precise data, could manipulate us and subvert our intentions.\u00a0\nEven the mediated pleasures of online living \u2013 the capacity to experience travel, sex, food, art, music \u2013 are overstimulating, the book says. \u201cArtificially strong explosions of strong synthetic experience\u201d habituate us, weaken our ability to notice the less intense moments of real life, which are more like \u201cfleeting whispers of pleasure\u201d. As public places in cities \u2013 pavements, parks, cafes \u2013 became spaces where we are half in and half out, absorbed in our phones, we are robbed of serendipity and civic bonds.\nWhile such panics have accompanied all new technologies from telegraph to television, the book warns that the digital takeover has had sudden and sweeping effects, and that it is important to recognise what we lose with every convenience we gain.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Voters want a shake-up, so long as he delivers\nThe lib commentariat, all shook by the breadth of the Trump win, didn\u2019t even get a chance to catch its breath, before his selections for key govt positions started coming in fast and furious, and had them gasping all over again. Some of these picks have a comfortable conventionality, such as Marco Rubio for Secretary of State. Many do not.\u00a0\nTulsi Gabbard, his pick for Director of National Intelligence, says that resistance from \u201cthe swamp in Washington\u201d is to be expected. How long the Trump govt will stay on the right side of this anti-establishment tilt will of course depend on how his eventual crew delivers on his promises. It will have to square several odd pledges too, such as raising tariffs and reducing inflation.

Insofar as his post-2020 candidacy has been even more disruptive than in 2016, the mandate he has got is for an even more Trumpian govt.

We have heard similar promises when a party was not in power only to see them being forgotten after coming to power. Nevertheless, the promises made by BNP in its reform agenda sounds promising on paper.\nTarique emphasised building a Bangladesh where not even the prime minister could abuse power, highlighting principles such as the rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, transparency, and accountability. Drawing from BNP's \"31-point Outline for Structural Reforms,\" he reiterated some objectives that are both novel and ambitious. For instance, no party has previously placed much emphasis on ensuring a free press. But Tarique declared his resolve to enable the media to \"speak truth to power\" and openly criticise the government. If implemented, this would mark a significant departure from the Awami League's harsh persecution of dissidents and journalists. Furthermore, the proposed reforms to curtail the government's excessive power\u2014including the introduction of a bicameral parliamentary system and limiting the prime minister's tenure to two consecutive terms\u2014suggest that the party might be embracing more mature political practices.\nUnfortunately, if we observe the party's actions, we can deduce that it is already faltering in realising some promises, mainly that of curbing corruption. For example, there have been multiple reports of \"BNP-linked\" groups extorting citizens, with its party members or activists allegedly filling the void of AL-established syndicates\u2014as well as regular infighting within the party. While BNP leadership has issued warnings against such behaviour, more decisive actions are necessary. Otherwise, such incidents will continue to cast doubt on assurances from BNP's leadership and make it harder for citizens to place their trust in the party.\nBNP's pledge to build an inclusive, liberal, and democratic Bangladesh\u2014by balancing power among the legislative, judicial, and executive branches and dismantling the tools of oppression used by past governments\u2014is commendable. However, sincerity is the key to achieving such a transformation. Much of the scepticism surrounding BNP\u2014as well as other political parties\u2014could be addressed if the party itself practiced democratic principles, such as decentralising its decision-making process. Additionally, it could move away from the failed dynastic politics of our region, which has acted as an obstacle to the democratisation process.\nThe July uprising demonstrated that people are fed up with dynastic politics driven by violence, oppression, and corruption. Many have sacrificed their lives to break free from this system and secure the rights of all citizens. All political parties, including BNP, must honour these sacrifices and ensure they are not in vain.\n",

        "full_article": "Agriculture, one of the most dynamic sectors of our country, has faced challenges and monopolistic syndicates since the country's independence when its contribution to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) stood around 60 percent. By 2010, this figure dropped to 17 percent and, after nearly a one percent reduction every two years, stabilised at 12.7 percent in 2020.\nFollowing that, last year, it further declined to 11.20 percent.\u00a0 In line with the international trend, obsessing over industrialisation results in the country's strong suit \u2014agricultural strengths \u2014 being left behind. However, agricultural startups like iFarmer, ShobjiGram, Agroshift, and Freshie Farm, have been inspiring people from diverse backgrounds to explore this unconventional yet viable path. Surprisingly, many of these startups' founders lack formal agriculture backgrounds . They simply realised that the country's most flourishing sector was being overlooked for a long period, and saw it as high time to revisit the sector.\nIn rural areas, almost every labourer has basic knowledge of primitive forms of farming. Yet, exiguous wages in less-facilitated traditional farms oblige them to switch agriculture jobs. On the other hand, in recent times, agriculture startups usually prefer a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model to sell their products. Consequently, it reduces the intermediaries, and their possibility of defending the local syndicates tends to be higher than others. As a result, it enables startups to sell quality products to customers at the market price. On the other hand, it also enables them to hire labourers at fair wages. This is why experienced workers' participation in agriculture startups is eye-catching. Experienced workers are behind the scenes of improbable outputs within a\u00a0relatively short time in agriculture startups, which were suppressed in the loop of local syndicates for a long time.\n\"Suppose a new pest starts to ruin your cornfield. Your first point of contact should be the district agriculture officer. But interestingly, you will never find them because they haven't been at the office for two or three \u00a0years,\" stated Muntasir Hafiz, co-founder and CEO of ShobjiGram, in an interview. Several government-run agriculture research centres have existed for a significant period of time in Bangladesh. However, thoughtheir research achievement is remarkable, implementation in the country is negligible. We often see agriculture officers conducting training sessions for grassroot farmers only on television; in real life, these are rare. Low wages, local syndicates, reluctance of the private sector, insufficient funding, unexpected natural calamities, scanty amount of governmental support, skyscraping transportation expenses, and some other issues continue to intensify the frustrations of farmers day by day, leading to striking cultivable lands remaining abandoned in almost every district.\nNow, Vietnam is known as an \"Agriculture Powerhouse\" and a core competitor of Bangladesh in the agriculture sector. Vietnam's farming sector is diversified, with items like rice, nuts, fruits, and fish\u2014nearly similar to our country. Despite this, Bangladesh struggles to prosper due to the lack of national interest in this particular sector. Many of us still regard white-collar jobs as respectable professions, regardless of whether there is social encouragement or not.Meanwhile, choosing a profession that requires working in a muddy field with farmers to ensure there is food on your dining table is discouraged. In contrast, the Vietnamese government, along with the private sectors, have embraced new farming methods, modern technology, and proper infrastructure\u2014successfully illustrating their country as a global agricultural model.\nIn his book A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions, Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser to the interim government, urges the youth to break the chain of inequality, massive unemployment, and environmental destruction in this world.\nCulturally, in Bangladesh, where instant gratification is preferred, agriculture startups could spark interest through their comparatively low investment costs and swift returns. Furthermore, a thriving agriculture startup sector would contribute to other visions of DrYunus. This Nobel laureate's perspective also breaks apart the narrow mindset of those who think cultivating and grazing is a fragile profession. The success of iPAGE, a United Nations award-winning Bangladeshi startup that aids farmers through securing information, technology, training, and services for farmers, also highlight the viability of this approach. This startup also works on reducing negative impacts on climate and the environment.\nAs farming sector investment does not require a brokerage house hassle, and with a BO (Beneficiary Owner) account maintenance and 24/7 data-driven awareness like the stock market, the farming sector can be more effective for investors. Conversely, investors cannot sell their agricultural shares anytime like the stock market due to its lack of liquidity. Despite this, agriculture startups still offer convenient investment opportunities.\nIn 2022, Agroshift raised $1.8 million, and iFarmer raised $2.1 million in funding. Moreover, Freshie Farm offers projectile investment where investors can trace the project performance through the website and app. Fashol, another agri-tech startup, raised $1 million in pre-seed funding last year.\nHowever, no country can keep pace in the global run by only focusing on agricultural progression. Technology and advancement in industrialisation are equally crucial. Indeed, the ignorance of existing agriculture expertise might cost lifelong compensation. When you cannot breathe fresh air, your city is unsuitable for living, and the country's experienced farmers are unwillingly choosing inhumane professions like paddling rickshaws, technology startups alone can seem like a luxury. Supporting the farmers through agriculture startups, alongside environment-friendly industrialisation and relevant digitalisation, can ease the pathway toward a self-sufficient Bangladesh.\nFaizur Rahman Khandaker is content writing intern at NSU Startups Next of North South University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Dr Samina Luthfa, associate professor at the Department of Sociology in Dhaka University, talks about the recent controversy surrounding Shilpakala Academy and the theatre scene in Bangladesh with Monorom Polok of The Daily Star.\nThe halting of a theatre performance at Shilpakala early November caused quite a stir. Could you share your thoughts on this incident?\nThe decision to halt the theatre performance on November 2 was an unprecedented and unfortunate event in the history of Bangladeshi theatre. A group of people came and threatened to set fire to the Shilpakala Academy, attempting to attack the premises. This incident created a sense of insecurity and fear among the theatre group and audience members\u2014and I fully acknowledge that there were real and genuine security concerns for us all.\nIn such a situation, what do you believe should have been Shilpakala Academy's role?\nShilpakala Academy has a responsibility to ensure the safety of both theatre practitioners and the audience. Although other institutions across Bangladesh had resumed normal operations, the academy was the last to reopen, and even then, only on a limited scale. Although the venue finally reopened post-uprising, Shilpakala Academy has not returned to its usual state. The halls are still heavily guarded, with the army stationed there. The academy, once a cultural centre, has effectively become an army encampment. We understand that the army's presence is necessary for maintaining law and order, but why should they occupy Shilpakala?\nThe state should find an alternative solution. If the army needs accommodations, there are other options. Placing them at Shilpakala shows how cultural activities are not prioritised by the government. The prevailing attitude seems to be that shutting down artistic spaces temporarily will not have any serious consequences. But this approach is fundamentally flawed. Using Shilpakala to accommodate the army reflects a lack of appreciation for the power of cultural practices in challenging authoritarian mindsets.\nHas this incident impacted the financial stability of theatre groups? Could you explain how?\n\nThe decision to open only the largest hall, which is costly to use and requires a significant audience turnout, has placed tremendous financial pressure on theatre groups. Even so, groups have tried to continue performing on Fridays and Saturdays. However, staging plays at the National Theatre Hall remains economically challenging, and one group, even after paying for their performance date, was unable to complete their show. Symbolically, this incident has damaged the government's image, while also creating severe financial difficulties for the theatre group involved and discouraging audiences from attending performances. Such outcomes have seriously harmed the theatre and cultural scene.\nThe director general of Shilpakala has claimed the performance was halted to ensure audience safety. Was this the correct response in your view?\n\nThe director general of Shilpakala claimed that the performance was stopped to ensure audience safety. But when a small group of 10-15 people threatened to set fire to the building where the army was stationed, the situation was clearly mishandled. I understand that he faced a difficult dilemma: defying the mob's demands, aligned with the sentiments of the July uprising, or upholding the age-old tradition of \"the show must go on.\" He chose to halt the performance, a choice that has had significant repercussions. Had the incident been handled more decisively, it might have been prevented. Instead, indecision triggered a ripple effect, worsening the situation.\nAn additional complication arose because one or two members of the theatre group were known supporters of the previous fascist regime. But if you look across Bangladesh, you will find numerous people affiliated with the Awami League. There are undoubtedly many AL supporters within the theatre community as well. Yet, would it be justified to punish a person for their speech in the new Bangladesh? Does it make sense to condemn an entire troupe for one person's opinions? On November 2, protesters demanded that this individual be handed over to them. This signifies a complete disregard for judicial processes, suggesting an intent to enforce their own form of justice.\nI am not defending this individual's actions. His Facebook posts were inappropriate and crossed boundaries of decency. However, punishing an entire theatre group for one person's actions is unfair, and cancelling a performance on these grounds is indefensible.\nIronically, those causing disruptions did not even know the name of the theatre group or the person they were targeting, who wasn't a performer but a member of the ensemble. This highlights how the cultural enablers of Hasina's regime\u2014as well the leaders of Dhaka's theatre scene\u2014have created a disconnect between their so-called \"holy shrine\" of art (Shilpakala Academy) and the masses.\nThis seems to highlight a deeper issue of intolerance in the public sphere. How would you describe the behaviour of the disruptors that day?\n\nThe disruptors seemed to lack an understanding of theatre customs and norms. They attempted to incite violence in a coordinated way, which should not be tolerated by the government, as it ultimately harms its reputation. Additionally, theatre activists need to engage with these individuals and bring their art closer to the public to bridge this divide.\nThe day after the incident, theatre practitioners protested outside Shilpakala Academy. We submitted our six-point demand to the director general, including the immediate resumption of the play at no cost to the group and the reimbursement of incurred expenses. Additional demands, such as removing the military presence, were also raised. If the venue had been accessible to theatre practitioners and audiences, a small group of disruptors would not have caused such chaos. This was evident on November 8, when a large number of theatre workers were present, preventing further disturbances.\nDespite efforts of resistance, the conflict continues to escalate. The Federation of Theatre Groups has organised more protests, and some groups have suspended performances in protest. But this could have been prevented if the initial error had been handled differently. Now, even the fascist enablers situated abroad are organising protests, stating that the government has shut down all cultural activities in the country. Meanwhile, concerts, festivals, and events continue across Dhaka, yet theatre at Shilpakala remains in turmoil.\nWere incidents like this common under previous regimes, or have things changed over the years?\n\nNo, nothing like this occurred under previous regimes. Historically, Bangladesh's theatre community supported the AL. They actively defended the party's actions and suppressed dissent. In the 1980s, groups like the Group Theatre Federation opposed Ershad's dictatorship through street protests and protest theatre. However, over the last 10-15 years, many of these same figures aligned themselves with the AL's cultural agenda.\nThis cultural control stifled dissent, equating criticism of the AL government with anti-Liberation War sentiments. Organisations like the Group Theatre Federation enforced this narrative, determining performance schedules, government grants, and resources based on political loyalty.\nIs this the first time that theatre has been used to protest issues beyond politics, like environmental concerns?\nOne example is the play by the group Tirandaj, which was cancelled during the Sundarbans movement in 2016. They planned a debate on whether a power plant near the Sundarbans was justified, unrelated to their play. Yet, the play and the debate were both cancelled. This decision was met with little resistance from theatre groups, except for a few. Our group, BotTala, opposed this injustice and was subsequently denied performance dates at Shilpakala Academy for 18 months, until we threatened legal action.\nAnother incident involved attacks by Awami League's youth wing activists during a university theatre performance, where the audience and performers were harassed. Instead of condemning the attackers, theatre practitioners held a meeting to admonish those who spoke out against the violence on Facebook. This pattern of silencing criticism persisted, with cultural enforcers protecting the political interests of the last government.\nTheatre should be a space for expressing reality and confronting injustices. We cannot have genuine artistic expression unless those who have supported authoritarian practices in the last regime admit their mistakes. True artists must have the courage to acknowledge their errors and seek reconciliation. If someone has publicly justified violence, the massacre in July, or enabled cultural fascism, they must apologise and make amends. Only then can we move forward.\nFor those of us who use theatre as a medium of protest and expression, it is difficult to share space with people who have vilified and undermined the July uprising, its martyrs, and their sacrifices. We cannot forget the harm they have done, both to individuals and to the cultural landscape. Reconciliation must begin with accountability from those responsible for past harms. Otherwise, our commitment to art and social progress will be meaningless.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
