While this is only the tenth such occasion since the onset of the GST in July 2017 that revenues have been over \u20b91.4 lakh crore, that mark has been consistently topped for nine months now. The two highest GST monthly receipts so far \u2014 over \u20b91.67 lakh crore in April and \u20b91.51 lakh crore in October \u2014 were partly bolstered by taxpayers filing quarterly returns. Discounting periodic spikes in compliance, one can possibly peg the \u20b91.4 lakh crore as the new normal baseline for monthly GST revenues hereon. With almost \u20b912 lakh crore already in the GST kitty this year, the Government is likely to end up with a not-insignificant surplus over its Budget. This is welcome fiscal headroom, especially since the Centre\u2019s subsidy bill on items such as fertilizers and foodgrains has also surpassed the Budget math, and may help the Government stick to its fiscal deficit target. On the flip side, however, November\u2019s GST revenues are not an enthusing indicator about the state of the broader economy.The 10.9% overall GST revenue growth in November, reflecting transactions undertaken in October when the major festivals, including Deepavali, occurred \u2014 is the slowest uptick recorded since June 2021. November revenues were the lowest in three months and marked a nearly 4% dip from October\u2019s kitty. E-way bills generation, broadly indicating outflow of goods from producers to the wholesale and retail supply chains, dropped a steeper 8.6% sequentially, perhaps as factories recorded higher downtimes amid extended holidays. One would have expected festive consumption to spike the GST intake despite the e-way bills decline, as inventories were already built up in anticipation. That effect appears muted and it is quite puzzling that revenues contracted year-on-year in as many as seven States, including Gujarat and Kerala. Growth in inflows from domestic transactions slowed from 18% in October to 8% last month, while revenues from imports of goods rose to 20% in November \u2014 a possible sign that the consumption recovery remains uneven, with goods consumed by higher income groups seeing a better rebound. December\u2019s post-festival GST collections could yield a clearer picture, both on the sustainability of the headline revenue numbers and the growth trajectory of the economy. The GST Council, meeting this month after another prolonged gap, must expedite long-awaited action on pending issues to bolster compliance, and not lose sight of the larger, currently-deferred plan to rationalise the tax rates with a view to spur broad-based and sustainable consumption growth.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntaxes and duties\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nUnion Budget\n\n/\n\ngovernment",

The nerve-wracking dance of fancied teams be it in triumph or defeat and the soul-uplifting flight of the underdog have all shimmered under Qatari skies. Football remains the greatest sport and over a fortnight, the ballet between twirling feet and the ball has caught global attention despite the footprints of a waning pandemic or the devastation of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Qatar has managed to host this mega-event with minimal fuss even if whispers of human rights violations during the construction of the various stadiums continue to linger. That sport cannot be oblivious to the circumstances prevailing outside the grounds was emphasised when the Iranian men remained silent during the rendering of the national anthem ahead of their game. This act of solidarity with the women fighting for equal rights back home, comes at a time when many athletes are wary of taking a political stance. The World Cup has come a long way from the inaugural edition in 1930 when host Uruguay emerged as the champion after defeating Argentina. That Uruguay crashed out now while Argentina remains alive, is another pointer to sporting evolution. The trope of South American and European nations being football\u2019s bulwarks is also changing.The African and Asian nations believe that they are here to compete and not make up the numbers. The exposure to the European leagues, the prevalence of a solid grass-roots structure and adequate coaching expertise have all combined to lend bite to the efforts of Morocco, Senegal, Japan and South Korea. The quartet entered the pre-quarterfinals and kept the African and Asian flags flying high. Meanwhile, it is a sobering reality that India has never qualified for the World Cup. Sunil Chhetri\u2019s men and the units that succeed them may launch a tilt at football\u2019s ultimate championship. The 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico will feature 48 teams, a significant increase from the current 32 and whether India, ranked 106, will qualify through an enhanced Asian quota, remains to be seen. But for now in a World Cup with its focus on Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and an injured Neymar, maximum thrills have emerged from Asian and African boots. Even if Cameroon did not qualify, it defeated Brazil, as did Saudi Arabia which dished out a similar fate to Argentina during the initial phase. South Korea\u2019s incredible 2-1 win over Portugal just as the group stage concluded is the perfect interlude as the World Cup\u2019s business-end begins.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022",

        "full_article": "G7 plus Australia have imposed a price cap of $60 a barrel on seaborne export of Russian crude oil in an effort to squeeze the country\u2019s revenue and thereby undermine its war-fighting capabilities. The price cap represents a 30% discount to the price of the benchmark Brent crude. The \u2018price cap coalition\u2019, which has elicited the support of the EU, plans to enforce the ceiling price by using its clout with the major shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies headquartered there. The stated aim is to weaken the Russian military without triggering a spike in oil price.\nIt\u2019s bound to fail. But notwithstanding that, many beleaguered emerging market economies will be affected by the collateral fallout of this attempt. The eight months of sanctions on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February have neither brought the fighting to an end nor had any impact on the former\u2019s behaviour. It provides more evidence that sanctions are a blunt tool that end up hurting countries unrelated to the problem, without achieving any of the core objectives of Western nations imposing sanctions.\nThe most egregious example of the futility of sanctions are the series of efforts initiated by the US on Iran since 1979. None of the sanctions have had a meaningful impact on Iranian foreign policy. Ironically, as the American media reported, Iranian drones used by the Russian military have sourced critical components from both Europe and the US. Clearly, none of the sanctions have prevented Iran from developing its armament capabilities while they have hurt countries such as India that sourced crude oil from there. Given this background, India did well to ramp up purchases this year of discounted Russian crude. Russia is now India\u2019s third largest crude supplier from being practically irrelevant a year ago as a source of supply.\nThe new price cap has enough loopholes to keep Russian oil exports going. However, using Western dominance on the global financial system to squeeze seaborne Russian oil supplies will end up hurting a country like Bangladesh, which handled the pandemic without serious economic disruption but finds itself facing a tough balance of payments situation because of an energy shock. Finally, the meaningless nature of the current price cap is reflected in the Ukrainian government\u2019s view that it just won\u2019t achieve its core aim of deterring Russia. Just what good are sanctions?\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a strategically significant admission, navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar has said that India\u2019s second indigenous aircraft carrier could be a repeat order of the recently commissioned IAC-1 or INS Vikrant. This means that the proposed IAC-2 would most likely not be the 65,000-tonne carrier that was initially planned and will be around the sub-45,000-tonne range. This has ramifications for our ambitions to have a blue water navy and obtain deep-strike capabilities. Simply put, the bigger the carrier the more equipment and offensive platforms \u2013 fighter jets and attack helicopters \u2013 it can be packed with. For example, the 40,000-tonne IAC-1 can carry about 35 aircraft. A 65,000-tonne carrier can carry almost 50 aircraft.\nChina\u2019s indigenous aircraft carriers, Shandong and Fujian \u2013 the latter currently being outfitted \u2013 are both above 60,000-tonnes. True, plans for IAC-2 could undergo further revision as things are still in the discussion and study phase. However, it is understood that cost is a big factor in determining the final shape of the carrier. And given budgetary constraints, both on account of competing social welfare programmes and the armed forces\u2019 huge salary and pension bills, the navy might be ultimately forced into a compromise on critical military platforms.\nGoI is cognisant of this challenge. Agnipath\u2019s four-year job scheme for soldiers is aimed at reducing the pension bill. But the hard reality is that India\u2019s economy needs to grow faster if it is to meet its strategic military needs. And given the maritime challenge in the Indian Ocean Region from China, which already has the largest navy in the world, the future orientation of the Indian military must have a serious naval component. Having heavy-load aircraft carriers in the 60,000-tonne category is a vital part of that reorientation.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In its latest report, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that Bangladesh is suffering from \"severe localised food insecurity\" owing to a number of factors including economic constraints, floods, high prices of major food items, etc. Poverty has risen too, it said, meaning that people's ability to buy food, even if it's available, has taken a severe hit. Having lived through such sobering assessments and forecasts for the better part of a year, we are hardly surprised by the FAO report. There is nothing remarkable except perhaps the recurring nature of these problems, and their seemly inexhaustible capacity to exacerbate one another. One thing is evident, though: Unless we change how we are approaching these problems, their effects will continue to be felt long after any end to the Russia-Ukraine war, despite what state officials tell us.\nA food crisis is, of course, the most pressing concern right now. It's important to expand the definition of food crisis to include factors other than nonavailability of food \u2013 such as an artificial crisis caused by exorbitant prices, and people's inability to buy. Bangladesh, from that perspective, is already having a crisis, with the poor hit particularly hard, as various studies suggest. It will be easy, and justified to some extent, to blame the government for all these, but it will be unfair to think the blame lies with it only. Perhaps a more accurate portrayal is one in which the government is both an architect and a victim of the present crisis, as it is allowing pre-existing governance issues or \"legacy issues\", as some experts called it, to mar its response to external challenges like the impacts of climate change and the war.\nIn case of the food crisis, one may ask: Why are we still paying \"wartime prices\" when global prices are falling? That was the subject of a recent report that showed that consumers in Bangladesh are having to pay as before despite steadily declining global prices, as imports of some major food commodities, including wheat and sugar, have slowed over the last few months. According to the FAO's price index, global food prices eased further in November. But because of falling imports and lack of efforts to adjust domestic prices, citizens continue to suffer. The government can blame the prevailing dollar and gas crises, as well as harvest setbacks caused by flooding, but it must look inward to know what made us so vulnerable to external shocks in the first place. Why is there still no functional monitoring system to check market manipulations? Where's the urgency to minimise people's sufferings?\nTo address the lingering food insecurity, the government must remove barriers to maximising food production, normalise food imports, prevent wastage in domestic food supply chains, punish greedy intermediaries and orchestrators of crisis, and most importantly, take steps to improve people's purchasing ability. It must address poor governance in the economic sector, which made us vulnerable in the first place.\n",

        "full_article": "We have no words to express our frustration about the continued poor performance of Bangladesh Railway (BR). The state-run organisation has not only failed to complete a majority of its projects on time, but is also running on losses year after year. According to our latest report, all of the 35 ongoing projects undertaken by the BR to expand its services are running behind schedule. This has, once again, exposed its inefficiency in implementing projects, and raised questions about its capability of executing such a large number of projects simultaneously.\nAmong the 35 projects, the deadlines for 25 have already been extended from one year to 11 years, while 11 of them saw cost escalations. The cost of one such project has even risen by a whopping 873.76 percent! Now, after several revisions, the combined costs of all these projects have risen by Tk 32,008 crore, meaning that while the initial cost of the 35 projects was Tk 1,08,020 crore, it went up to Tk 1,40,028 crore after revisions now. It's hard to justify such a huge cost increase. Had the BR done its job efficiently, without allowing corruption and irregularities to frequently get in its way, the money thus saved could be a great source of comfort at this time of economic turmoil.\nOver the past few years,\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0published a number of reports about the BR's lacklustre performance in project implementation, identifying a number of reasons contributing to that. Reportedly, corruption and irregularities of the project implementing authorities, poor feasibility studies and problems over land acquisition are some of the major reasons. Earlier this year, a report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) also found delays in material supply from abroad, frequent changes in project designs, changes in work scope, complications over appointing consultants and frequent changes of project directors as the key reasons for the time and cost overruns. But, unfortunately, no amount of reporting or revelation about its inefficiency and weaknesses could wake the institution up from its deep slumber, and take measures to rectify its mistakes and enhance its efficiency.\nThe result is, the railways ministry is the lowest performer in terms of project implementation among the five ministries that received the highest development fund allocations in the past decade from the government. According to an IMED report, the ministry could not even achieve the average ADP implementation rate twice in the last six fiscal years. Furthermore, it has incurred Tk 13,492.70 crore in losses between FY 2008-09 and FY 2019-20.\nThis situation is totally unacceptable. We urge the government to hold the BR accountable for its chronic incompetence and inefficiency as well as repeated failures in improving its services. It must prevent the wastage of valuable public money in the name of implementing development projects. The transport agency needs a complete overhaul to stop it from becoming a burden on the government and taxpaying citizens.\n",

        "full_article": "Jessore Cantonment, East Pakistan\nNovember 14, 1970\nTwo days after landfall\nHafiz Uddin Ahmad leafed through the stack of day-old newspapers in the officer's mess, scanning headlines in Bengali, English, and Urdu. He scrounged for details in articles that had precious few to give. Some papers said fifty dead. Others reported that a thousand people along the coast had perished. Hafiz guessed it was probably a lot more than that.\nThe night of the Great Bhola Cyclone, Hafiz had slept under a clear sky at Jessore Cantonment. Two years ago, he was one of the country's most popular football players. Now he was one of just a few Bengali officers in the entire Pakistan Army. The base was a hundred and fifty miles northwest of the Bay of Bengal and didn't see a single storm cloud that evening. His family, however, lived right in the cyclone's path, on Bhola, the next island over from Manpura. Worse, his father was in the middle of a busy reelection campaign\u2014he was pushing Mujib's Awami League platform of Bengali self-determination and autonomy throughout his coastal district\u2014and was likely to be away from home. Exposed.\nHafiz hoped his family was safe, but there was nothing he could do but wait for news. He reread the papers, hoping\u2014and fearing\u2014that he'd missed something. No luck. He finally gave up and went outside, where he watched the clouds grow thick, then gradually clear away into a perfect November breeze. The soldiers in front of him drilled lackadaisically. Hafiz was too distracted to reprimand them.\nAfter a day of waiting and praying, a telegram arrived for him on yellow paper. It was from his mother. She never sent telegrams. Hafiz took a deep breath to calm himself before reading it.\nHafiz. Please come home. Many people dead. Including family.\nHafiz exhaled in relief. If his sister or brother or father had died in the storm, surely his mother would have mentioned it. At least he hoped so, but there just wasn't enough information to be sure. \"Including family\" was ominous. His mind raced through images of favorite cousins, uncles, and aunties. His battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jalil, sympathized with his plight and granted him leave to go home.\nHafiz rushed out of the cantonment, hiring a rickshaw to take him to the nearest river launch. From there, he caught a coal steamer to the port at Barisal. Shortly after they pulled out onto the river delta, the landscape started to change. Hafiz saw more and more bare palm trees with their fronds spilled across the ground and the battered thatched roofs of hundreds of shacks. But he still wasn't anywhere near the coast where the papers said that the storm's most violent winds thrashed the land. At Barisal, he caught a small ferry, which was currently the only vehicle able to navigate the narrow passages to Bhola. It was a four-hour journey.\nHe saw the first dead body about two hours after launch. It was a man's corpse, completely naked with fingers clenched toward the sky in some sort of grim repose. Hafiz motioned to the boatman, who simply nodded grimly.\nThe boat motored on. The engine's hum drowned out the sound of water lapping along the bow. Hafiz saw the next corpse just a few minutes later, followed by a trio of bodies\u2014perhaps a family\u2014caught in an eddy along the riverbank. It seemed that more people had died than the papers reported. A lot more. They'd only gone half of the way, and the number of corpses in the river seemed to grow exponentially.\nDread didn't truly take hold of Hafiz until the wind shifted and he started to smell the devastation. It was faint at first\u2014and almost sweet\u2014but that didn't last. Notes of decay filtered in. The farther they travelled downriver, the more pungent and fetid the odour turned. This wasn't the smell of an odd corpse rotting on its own in one forgotten wallow. It had a darker character. It was the smell of mass death. When the boat approached a river bend, Hafiz made out another twenty bodies clustered in a cove, mixed in with rotting buffalo and goat corpses. He'd already seen as many bodies on this one short stretch of river as the papers reported dead in the whole country. And they were multiplying.\nThe clusters of bodies gave way to massive rafts of decay. The corpses of men, women, children, and animals, along with the flotsam of a thousand houses, clogged the waterway. At times, especially in the smaller channels, it was impossible to navigate through the water without corpses thunking against the aluminum frame. The boatman was careful to slow down when he got near women's bodies, lest their long, tangled hair get stuck in the propeller.\nThough it only took four hours, Hafiz felt he'd aged a year when he finally arrived at the ghat at Bhola Island. He desperately scanned the motley group of survivors for familiar faces, then when he saw his father, a man in his fifties with a regal demeanor, waiting in a hastily assembled shed by the boat launch, Hafiz's face cracked into an impossible smile.\nHis father smiled back, with perhaps a hint of pride creeping into the corners of his mouth, at the sight of his son in a crisp officer's uniform.\n\"How did you survive?\" Hafiz asked.\n\"I was on the roof of the Arzu Hotel,\" his father replied. The Arzu was a dilapidated tin-roofed hotel-restaurant, which just happened to be the tallest building on this part of the island. \"I was there all night. I was safe, but there was nothing I could do to help our people. My sisters died. Our village is . . . gone.\"\nHis father then explained that Hafiz's uncles, cousins, sisters, and brothers\u2014at least twenty of his family members\u2014were gone without a trace. His grandmother had only survived because her servants tied her to a tree. Over the course of the storm, she watched them all drown, one by one.\nHafiz looked out at the sea of floating bodies. He'd seen enough to know that corpses littered more than just their small nook of the delta; they were scattered along its entire length\u2014across dozens of islands and clogged channels. It would take more than a few families coming together to rebuild. Simply burying the dead would require the organizational capabilities of the entire nation. Hafiz stiffened his spine to the task ahead.\nThere was no telling how any of this might affect his father's chances of being elected a minister in the national election just a few weeks away. There was no time to think about those things right now.\nHafiz felt his father's hand rest on his shoulder. He watched his dad studying his uniform in admiration. Hafiz felt it was the first time his father saw a man as he stared out at the wreckage, not a footballer.\n\u2026\u2026\n\"It doesn't look so bad.\"\nGripping an ice-cold beer, Pakistan president Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan directed his casual assessment both to the pilot and to himself as they hummed around in a Fokker Friendship propeller plane three thousand feet above what was left of the East Pakistan delta. Yahya took a swig and peered out the window again. Only the occasional palm tree jutting above the water pierced the rice paddies.\nYahya chucked the empty out the window then reached for another. He drew the aluminium hoop back with a pudgy finger adorned with a dictator-size ring. Reports estimated that 500,000 people might be dead from the Great Bhola Cyclone, making it the worst disaster in human history\nYahya thought the whole flyby was a waste of time. He'd arrived in Dacca the night before from Peking, where he'd single-handedly negotiated what was possibly the biggest diplomatic coup in Pakistan's history while simultaneously altering the course of the Cold War. That deserved a celebration. After landing, a boozy Yahya shooed away the governor and made a beeline for the house of a Bengali businesswoman who was throwing a party in his honor.\nThe next morning, Yahya's advisers reminded their hungover boss that the situation in the delta was quite serious. It would be good to show a display of concern. So, he boarded the plane, a gold-tipped cane in one hand and a plastic cooler of imported pilsner in the other. Now he was staring at watery trash. He was ready to get back to Islamabad.\nIn truth, Yahya's visit to Peking had been a roller coaster. Formally, the visit was called a trade negotiation, but US president Richard Nixon gave Yahya a secret mission known only to three people in the entire world: unite China and the United States for the first time in 20 years.\u00a0\nNixon and Yahya shared a camaraderie built on their mutual struggle to keep a lid on the disrespectful miscreants who refused to respect their authority. And aside from a certain banker in Florida, Yahya might have even been Nixon's only real friend in the world. The one big thing that the unlikely pair understood, above all else, was that everyone was always out to get them. So, both men had no qualms about getting their hands dirty in pursuit of defending their respective nations.\u00a0\nThe China plan was that Yahya would dangle a few enticing ideas, then lay the groundwork for an official visit by Nixon's right-hand man, Henry Kissinger, next year. Yahya expected that the trip would be a raging success: China would welcome Nixon with open arms and sign some impressive trade agreements that would make Yahya look like a major dealmaker who pulled his country's economy out of the doldrums.\nMao knew that Yahya was the impressionable sort and that every minute of his experience would be relayed back to Nixon, so he pulled out all the stops. He threw an impossibly lavish welcome party.\nIn a bid to sweeten whatever diplomatic offering might come of their relationship, Chinese emissaries plied Yahya with liberal helpings of liquor, women, and compliments. Yahya didn't realize until too late that he'd walked into an ambush. The regal welcome quickly gave way to a daylong scolding by Premier Zhou Enlai, who made it clear to Yahya that any meeting with the Americans was going to happen on China's terms or not at all. Yahya hadn't told a soul in his delegation about the secret agenda of his visit, so he was alone with his wits while Zhou had an army of advisers at his disposal.\nThe talks dragged into a second, then a third day, but they felt like they were going backward. With the pressure high, Yahya cracked, stumbling over words at crucial moments. Zhou remained unimpressed. The Chinese were wary of Kissinger; they agreed to see the American secretary of state only if Yahya could smuggle him in without anyone knowing. Yahya knew that Nixon wouldn't be happy with this.\nEven the trade talks, which were the simplest part of his visit\u2014and really more of a formality for the newspapers\u2014were falling apart. Yahya feared what he would come home to if he failed to close the deals he'd promised to everyone. He didn't care about losing the support of the Pakistani bureaucrats, but the military was a different matter. He knew all too well that leaders rarely caught wind of a coup until it was too late.\nAbove all, Yahya's biggest concern was losing the people. He needed to raise the spectre of something more terrifying than his own failings in order to distract the press. They were always suckers for India fearmongering, so he'd rattled some sabres in that direction before he'd left for China, blaming Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for all of Pakistan's ills. After all, everyone in Pakistan hated her.\nPakistan was ailing after five years of crippling economic sanctions, and now Yahya's former Punjabi supporters in West Pakistan were up in arms. Unemployed students and underpaid workers rioted against factory owners and the police.\u00a0\nYahya started to panic. The democratic election that was meant to cement his legacy was taking place in just three weeks, but what if that wasn't enough to save his rapidly eroding popularity? Everything was spiralling out of control, and everyone pointed at one man to blame: General Yahya Khan. Yahya needed some way to show the people that he was the man they needed most\u2014the only man who could save them.\nYahya needed a miracle.\nAs day three of Yahya's talks with Zhao neared its end, a staffer wearing a squarish, ill-fitting suit that epitomized Pakistan's sluggish bureaucracy, interrupted the president's ramblings. He waved a telegram in Yahya's face. The exact text is lost to time, but it likely would have had something typed out about a once-in-a-lifetime storm hitting East Pakistan.\nYahya couldn't believe his luck. The cyclone news added the very sense of urgency to the China talks that he'd been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to achieve. He immediately told Zhao, who shared the news with Mao. Both men were concerned about the storm's impact, so they relented on their posturing and offered to get at least the economic trade package squared away. After that, Mao relented on the military deal, which to be honest was in both their interests anyway.\nHis confidence suddenly bolstered, Yahya turned on the charm for his coup de gr\u00e2ce, and even Mao succumbed to Yahya's silver tongue and infectious smile. He convinced Mao to start secret communications with Nixon, under two conditions: First, the only communication would come through secret couriered letters; and second, those could only go through Yahya himself. The telegraph had turned everything around.\nWhile the cyclone might have saved Yahya's hide, that didn't necessarily mean he thought it worth touring its aftermath a few days later. The whir of the propellers just a few feet away gave him a headache that beer wasn't powerful enough to numb, and the wind scuffed the thick waxed eyebrows he took such great care to shape. He tried anyway, downing the entire six-pack in the hour they circled. This whole cyclone business seemed blown out of proportion. Hell, one hit the coast two months earlier and only killed a few people. The delta always recovered.\nHe glared down at the black flecks of corpses bobbing on the surface of the water. The pilot suggested landing for a closer look at the damage. Yahya recoiled. He had no interest in stumbling over debris in front of some destitute peasants who would just claw at his suit. The press knew that he'd seen some of the devastation himself, maybe that would be enough.\nThey flew back to Dacca.\nYahya boarded his personal plane for Islamabad without leaving the airport\u2014or meeting the officials tasked with the Bhola response. He refused to declare East Pakistan a disaster area or worthy of a national emergency, two actions that would have allowed the local government to reallocate their meagre resources to relief.\nYahya had more important things to worry about: spectacular news that he wanted to telegram to President Nixon as soon as possible. Abandoned by Yahya, the first responders held a press conference later that day, asking the journalists in the audience what they should do.\u00a0\nThe presser ended with journalists and bureaucrats walking out of the room together in a confused, dreadful silence.\nJason Miklian, Ph.D., is a Senior Researcher at the Centre for Development and Environment, University of Oslo (Norway).\n\nScott Carney, is an investigative journalist and New York Times bestselling author.\u00a0\nThe above mentioned writers are the authors of the book, titled The Vortex:\u00a0 The True Story of History's Deadliest Storm and the Liberation of\u00a0Bangladesh, HarperCollins India(2022).

        "full_article": "When the Awami League came to power in 2009, the amount of defaulted loans stood at Tk 22,481 crore. During its tenure in the government, that amount increased to a mammoth Tk 134,396 crore as of September 2022. This happened despite the government repeatedly providing scope for defaulters to reschedule their loans and allowing for the real amount of defaulted loans to be understated through accounting manipulation which, if calculated properly, might amount to more than Tk 2 lakh crore, according to Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (Sanem).\nEven the judiciary, which has not always had a stellar record in holding the executive branch accountable, has repeatedly expressed its disappointment at how different government institutions have failed to hold those responsible for the rising non-performing loans (NPLs) and financial scams to account. The High Court, for example, reprimanded the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on November 9 for its failure to complete the investigation of any of the 61 cases filed seven years ago over the misappropriation of more than Tk 4,000 crore from BASIC Bank branches. The court also chastised the commission for not prosecuting and arresting the main perpetrators, i.e. former chairman of the bank Sheikh Abdul Hye Bachchu, his associates, and the bank's board of directors.\nThe commission had filed cases against 153 junior officers in 2015 over a series of defalcations that nearly bankrupted the once profitable bank. But the bank's former chairman escaped prosecution in all of the cases, despite him being involved in the scams, as per the investigations of the Bangladesh Bank and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Similarly, the court also said that the fleeing of PK Halder, another major embezzler, from the country, even after the court slapped a travel ban, spoke of an unholy\u00a0entente\u00a0between different agencies to save the perpetrators of such crimes.\nIt has also been reported that bankers, including top officials of the Bangladesh Bank, have helped many perpetrators of embezzlement and other forms of corruption to benefit from such malpractices. The High Court, in fact, had ordered the ACC to take actions against 249 Bangladesh Bank officials, including three former deputy governors and six executive directors, involved in a number of financial scams worth Tk 3,700 crore, but to no avail.\nOn November 27, a High Court bench, while hearing a bail petition of a former official of Shahjalal Islami Bank Limited, which extended a loan of Tk 110 crore to the Bismillah Group, observed that the ACC was preoccupied with catching petty criminals instead of the big ones. In most cases related to embezzlement and shady loans, the ACC had failed to bring the perpetrators to justice \u2013 the owners of Bismillah Group, which took about Tk 1,200 crore from five banks, for example.\nRecently, the\u00a0New Age\u00a0reported that the Chattogram-based S Alam Group had taken more than Tk 30,000 crore from the Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd (IBBL), which the business group controls, despite the group only being entitled to borrow a maximum of Tk 215 crore from the bank as per the existing rules. According to a Bangladesh Bank audit report, the group used its influence in the bank's board and management to obtain the loan mostly through unethical mechanisms. The\u00a0New Age\u00a0report also quoted a senior Bangladesh Bank official as saying that the central bank did not allow its officials to conduct inspections freely into banks controlled by the group for unknown reasons. Nor did it approve their inspection reports and take action based on them.\nDespite being one of the most profitable banks in Bangladesh in the past decade, Islami Bank had an observer on its board the whole time it was doing well financially. Usually, the central bank appoints such observers in banks whose financial health is poor \u2013 the observer is then withdrawn once the bank's financial health improves. But, as this daily reported on December 1, the opposite happened in the case of Islami Bank. The Bangladesh Bank observer in Islami Bank was withdrawn in March 2020 without any explanation and, ever since then, the bank has been caught up in all sorts of irregularities and chaos. Was that a coincidence?\nAccording to Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), the central bank's decision to remove its observer allowed scamsters to take loans, ignoring banking norms. If we deeply analyse the other financial scams that have occurred over the last decade, nearly all of them have the same story. And these stories draw a pattern.\nThe pattern seems to be, as the High Court observed, that an unholy nexus of powerful people has been aiding and abetting financial criminals \u2013 some of them powerful individuals or groups themselves \u2013 to commit crimes that are ruining the financial health of our banks and is pushing the overall financial sector into the abyss. And this has been going on for so long that, at this point, it has become quite clear to everyone \u2013 except for the finance minister, it seems.\nBut the finance minister himself should have been aware of this \u2013 firstly, because it is his job, and secondly, because his predecessor himself had admitted in parliament that what was happening in the financial sector was plain and simply \"dacoity.\" And that these dacoits could not be held accountable because they were being backed by his own party members.\nUnfortunately, within the government at present, no other official seems to have the courage to admit what the former finance minister did \u2013 certainly not the current finance minister, who apparently seems unaware of what is going on in our financial sector. As for the government, it seems to be hell-bent on pursuing the policy of saving the perpetrators which, if it continues down its current trajectory, will ultimately end up destroying our economy.\n\u00a0\nEresh Omar Jamal\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "In its latest report, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that Bangladesh is suffering from \"severe localised food insecurity\" owing to a number of factors including economic constraints, floods, high prices of major food items, etc. Poverty has risen too, it said, meaning that people's ability to buy food, even if it's available, has taken a severe hit. Having lived through such sobering assessments and forecasts for the better part of a year, we are hardly surprised by the FAO report. There is nothing remarkable except perhaps the recurring nature of these problems, and their seemly inexhaustible capacity to exacerbate one another. One thing is evident, though: Unless we change how we are approaching these problems, their effects will continue to be felt long after any end to the Russia-Ukraine war, despite what state officials tell us.\nA food crisis is, of course, the most pressing concern right now. It's important to expand the definition of food crisis to include factors other than nonavailability of food \u2013 such as an artificial crisis caused by exorbitant prices, and people's inability to buy. Bangladesh, from that perspective, is already having a crisis, with the poor hit particularly hard, as various studies suggest. It will be easy, and justified to some extent, to blame the government for all these, but it will be unfair to think the blame lies with it only. Perhaps a more accurate portrayal is one in which the government is both an architect and a victim of the present crisis, as it is allowing pre-existing governance issues or \"legacy issues\", as some experts called it, to mar its response to external challenges like the impacts of climate change and the war.\nIn case of the food crisis, one may ask: Why are we still paying \"wartime prices\" when global prices are falling? That was the subject of a recent report that showed that consumers in Bangladesh are having to pay as before despite steadily declining global prices, as imports of some major food commodities, including wheat and sugar, have slowed over the last few months. According to the FAO's price index, global food prices eased further in November. But because of falling imports and lack of efforts to adjust domestic prices, citizens continue to suffer. The government can blame the prevailing dollar and gas crises, as well as harvest setbacks caused by flooding, but it must look inward to know what made us so vulnerable to external shocks in the first place. Why is there still no functional monitoring system to check market manipulations? Where's the urgency to minimise people's sufferings?\nTo address the lingering food insecurity, the government must remove barriers to maximising food production, normalise food imports, prevent wastage in domestic food supply chains, punish greedy intermediaries and orchestrators of crisis, and most importantly, take steps to improve people's purchasing ability. It must address poor governance in the economic sector, which made us vulnerable in the first place.\n",

        "full_article": "We have no words to express our frustration about the continued poor performance of Bangladesh Railway (BR). The state-run organisation has not only failed to complete a majority of its projects on time, but is also running on losses year after year. According to our latest report, all of the 35 ongoing projects undertaken by the BR to expand its services are running behind schedule. This has, once again, exposed its inefficiency in implementing projects, and raised questions about its capability of executing such a large number of projects simultaneously.\nAmong the 35 projects, the deadlines for 25 have already been extended from one year to 11 years, while 11 of them saw cost escalations. The cost of one such project has even risen by a whopping 873.76 percent! Now, after several revisions, the combined costs of all these projects have risen by Tk 32,008 crore, meaning that while the initial cost of the 35 projects was Tk 1,08,020 crore, it went up to Tk 1,40,028 crore after revisions now. It's hard to justify such a huge cost increase. Had the BR done its job efficiently, without allowing corruption and irregularities to frequently get in its way, the money thus saved could be a great source of comfort at this time of economic turmoil.\nOver the past few years,\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0published a number of reports about the BR's lacklustre performance in project implementation, identifying a number of reasons contributing to that. Reportedly, corruption and irregularities of the project implementing authorities, poor feasibility studies and problems over land acquisition are some of the major reasons. Earlier this year, a report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) also found delays in material supply from abroad, frequent changes in project designs, changes in work scope, complications over appointing consultants and frequent changes of project directors as the key reasons for the time and cost overruns. But, unfortunately, no amount of reporting or revelation about its inefficiency and weaknesses could wake the institution up from its deep slumber, and take measures to rectify its mistakes and enhance its efficiency.\nThe result is, the railways ministry is the lowest performer in terms of project implementation among the five ministries that received the highest development fund allocations in the past decade from the government. According to an IMED report, the ministry could not even achieve the average ADP implementation rate twice in the last six fiscal years. Furthermore, it has incurred Tk 13,492.70 crore in losses between FY 2008-09 and FY 2019-20.\nThis situation is totally unacceptable. We urge the government to hold the BR accountable for its chronic incompetence and inefficiency as well as repeated failures in improving its services. It must prevent the wastage of valuable public money in the name of implementing development projects. The transport agency needs a complete overhaul to stop it from becoming a burden on the government and taxpaying citizens.\n",

        "full_article": "Two macroeconomic developments relating to strengthening of forex earning sources could not have come about at a better time. Set against the backdrop of foreign exchange crisis topped up by depreciating local currency with recession in the backdrop and in the foreground looming globally with a ripple effect, the increased inflow of remittance and augmented export earnings are quite reassuring. Bangladesh Bank data show that in November Bangladeshi expatriate workers remitted foreign currency worth US$ 1.59 billion --- up by 4.34 percentage points compared to the earnings in October. But the pre-August level has yet to be reached. Yet the break with the pattern is significant though the remittance figure in the essence lags behind. At any rate, it gives a respite to the foreign exchange market smarting under immense stress in recent months because of the reserve downturn. The remittance uptake is attributed to the depreciation of local currency and conversely appreciation in dollar value which together have prompted migrant workers to send more money home. Simultaneously, Bangladesh posted the highest ever single month export earnings with an overall US$5.09 billion income, marking a 26 per cent year-on-year growth with apparel shipment rebounding. An element of sustainability in the rising RMG sector is embedded in the fact that Bangladesh was elevated to the second position in the global export market in 2021 having been pushed back in third position by Vietnam in 2020. A WTO statistical review pointed out that RMG exports from Bangladesh rebounded strongly in the last year posting a 24 per cent annual growth. All this, however, points to the dominant single item export basket requiring for a long time its diversification, a largely pending agenda.Now how to maintain the tempo, in other words sustain the upbeat trends both on remittance and export fronts? For bolstering remittances new destinations will have to be added, minimizing the existing differences in exchange rates on introduction of innovative product lines on the money market. Incentivising the remitters like allowing them to retain a reasonable percentage of their sent money in dollar may be considered, depending on the size of remittance. In fact, emphasis needs to be laid on responsible and patriotic transactions getting the better of profit motive because after all welfare of the recipients and the country's economy should be uppermost in the minds of the overseas workers. They are doing a great job by investing their sweat and tears, the highest form of value addition to the country's future.So far as diversifying exports is concerned, priority may be accorded to two areas as an overall strategic approach. First, the plethora of economic zones and FTAs that are in the horizon need to be geared to breaking new grounds in export markets. Secondly, the sectors lately demonstrating negative growth like jute and jute goods, agricultural items such as vegetables, fruits and dry foods, pharmaceuticals, frozen and live fishes need resuscitation. Last but not least, sectors doing well like leather and leather goods, plastic products should receive encouragement. Shipbuilding is another area requiring to incubate and churn in a positive mould.",

        "full_article": "Nowadays the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasing by leaps and bounds. This is happening in most cases even without our knowledge. The smartphone the common people are used to in their everyday communication has many of its features powered by AI. The voice assistant functions, photography and facial recognition, to mention but a few, are AI-driven. The Google searches for any information that researchers, academics or even its most plebeian users make may or may not know that they are using AI. But then why is the controversy still raging over if AI is going to replace humans at workplace or that it is even becoming a threat to human existence? One may recall here what a great mind of our time, Stephen Hawking, thought about AI. He even warned that the super smart computers (run by AI) one day could spell the end of human race! Hawking said this after he upgraded the system that enabled him to write and communicate despite his inability to perform these tasks due to the motor neuron disease that disabled him. What worried the great physicist was that the AI-powered system he was using could anticipate what he would like to write next. That was an eerie feeling of prescience on the part of the system that was helping him. Hence was his warning for the rest of humanity.So, many are of the view that if the progress on the AI-front is to continue, the future AI should be taught to be benign and if possible, ethical. The world's richest man, Elon Musk, even donated US$10m to the cause of making AI more beneficial. But not only Musk, Bill Gates, who has become one of the world's richest man through software business, too, expressed his fear about AI's potential to destroy humanity. If the world leader in making computer software has such fear about AI, then can one blame those outside the realm of computer science for their prejudice about the technology that mimic humans? Consider the open letter drafted by the 'Future of Life Institute', an organisation of which professor Hawking and Elon Musk were advisers. The letter titled, 'Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence'. An Open Letter', was first circulated among the AI researchers at a conference and then in January, 2015, it was made public. The self-explanatory title of the letter unambiguously point to the benefits society might draw if used conscientiously. It further stressed that researchers must be alert to the possibility of creating a monster that they cannot control. So, developers of the AI algorithms (programs) are also getting scary about the destructive potential of the technology which may surpass humans in intelligence some day! Or has it already?Remember the IBM's supercomputer, Deep Blue, the chess expert, which defeated chess's then world champion, Gary Kasparov, in the late 1990s? Kasparov, outmanoeuvred by Deep Blue at every move began to think that somehow the machine could read his mind. In fact, the world champion in chess was already psychologically beaten before he finally accepted the defeat. But was that an instance of the rising power of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), not the special purpose of AI like the Deep Blue? For the Deep Blue was just a chess expert and not one at card game such as bridge or the quiz competition called 'Jeopardy!'. But AGI, as is being imagined, would possess all the faculties of human thought including its intuitive and other abilities. But a super computer like Deep Blue can analyse the enormous volume of data on all possible moves that can be made on a chessboard (millions and millions of them), sift through database on the endless number of opening moves and at the same time examine the data on the history of Kasparov's playing style. The computer can make such analyses in the twinkling of an eye and can predict and pre-empt every move the chess world champion made. This was humanly impossible. But Deep Blue could do the data processing only for chess. It could not do so for other types of games of which it had no memory. So, the general-purpose AI or the so-called AGI, or self-conscious machines pursuing humans to destroy them can be found only in Hollywood movies. Those have been around even before the advent of the digital revolution. The AI's speciality is it can process and analyse a great amount of data with the help of the set of instructions (algorithm) that asks it do tasks at hand. As it can crunch so huge amounts of data and give results that earlier computers were not capable of, AI seems to have excelled humans in its intelligence. But that is a gross misconception. Like before, those are just digital machines. They still do what they are told to do. They are not able to think, or reflect the way humans do. Neither can they transfer their expertise in a particular domain of experience to another. If properly used, AI can help solve many issues that humanity is faced with at the moment including in the field of health and medicine, agriculture, space research, climate science, you name it. But problem may arise if the humans giving the AI-run machines instructions have evil motives. In that case, AI at its more advanced level of development could indeed cause great harm to humanity. It all depends on how the powerful would like to use it. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The incident of crushing, dragging and both together of victims fallen off a small and slow moving vehicle when hit from behind by a bigger one happened before. In all such cases of rear-end collision, the drivers were, as usual, those who were professional but hardly educated. In one such deliberately caused incident, a gang of muggers from a microbus snatched the vanity bag of a woman on a rickshaw on the Mirpur Road near the New Model Degree College. Entangled with the strap of the vanity bag, she was dragged half a kilometre towards the Jatiya Sangsad until the straps gave in. The woman had no chance of survival and she died. Muggers and drivers who are expected to be less sensitive than people in better positions in society or pursuing a meaningful life's calling committed such inhuman acts in a number of cases to the outrage of society. But on Friday it was perpetrated by none other than a former associate professor of the University of Dhaka. Not only did the man behind the steering wheel rammed his car into a motor cycle from behind but also continued his frenzied speed without stopping. Both motor cycle riders were thrown out of their motor cycle when the collision happened in front of the fine arts building of DU. Although the man driving the motor cycle also fell but survived, it was the pillion passenger, a woman, whose clothes somehow got entangled with the car. In that critical moment any sensible person should have opted for a hard brake but the former DU teacher could not care less. He continued driving until he reached Nilkhet intersection ignoring the screams of the victim and the shocked pedestrians who were witness to this horrific scene. How could a man of teaching profession commit this inhuman act? Was it panic or was he simply out of mind? It can be assumed his academic record was good enough for taking to teaching at the country's highest seat of learning. But the vice-chancellor of the university informs that he was terminated in 2018 because of his long absence from academic duty. This professional history speaks volumes for the man. A DU teacher cannot be sacked without following due procedures. Any teacher or someone from other professions certainly is at liberty to leave his/her job for better prospects or other reasons. But this is also done following rules and regulations. One cannot do so without informing the proper authority. One must be found guilty of not complying with the set rules before one is terminated from job. But leaving the job without information is one thing and driving a car on a human being and dragging her a kilometre under it, ignoring shouts and screams for bringing the car to a halt is a completely different thing. Human life is too precious to be treated as sport. In a country where a sadistic streak runs strong, an addition of a teacher's inhumanity to it will send a wrong message to carefree and happy-go-lucky drivers. Even if he is accused of murder and awarded the punishment he deserves, the sad fact that he ignored the intense physical pain of the woman when dragged under the car for a kilometre will haunt people forever. Unless one is a brute and has a heart of stone, one cannot help shuddering at the thought of doing anything similar. He has not only disgraced his profession, his teaching fraternity but also human values that are an exclusive preserve of the most rational animal. This is an act of denial of respect for human life. One who can do so may be anything but a normal person. When a highly educated academic should set example of humanitarian service and quality of head and heart, this man has acted like a criminal of the vilest kind. People will be waiting for what he has to say in his self defence. That will give an insight into his dark reaches of mind. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

These accidents reportedly also left 747 people injured. Reckless driving is killing many people every day in Bangladesh. However, the death of Rubina Akhter, recently killed in a horrific road accident on Dhaka University campus, is shocking, inhumane and brutal. A car rammed into a motorcycle, causing ill-fated pillion passenger Rubina Akhter, 45, to fall down and somehow get stuck under the car. Her brother-in-law, who was driving the bike, also fell down as the car hit them. The car then dragged her along the road for a kilometre. Onlookers kept screaming for the driver to stop but the vehicle kept moving. She could have been saved, had the driver stopped, then. The onlookers and university students chased the car down at Nilkhet intersection, retrieved the woman and rushed her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. But it was already too late. She was the mother of a schoolboy, who lost his father as well around one year ago. It is unfortunate that we are losing many of our loved ones on roads and highways quite frequently. The authorities concerned do not seem to have any concern for lives lost in such incidents. It looks like that for them these precious lives are just numbers. Most of these tragic accidents are avoidable. What we need is just to implement the Road Transport Act 2018.
