This article is for the benefit of both journalists and readers who will be following the climate conference and want to understand what will be happening there over the course of two weeks.\nAs one of the few people who has attended every single one of the previous 25 COPs, I would like to share some tips on what events to follow, and how to follow them effectively.\nThere are a few prevailing misconceptions about COPs in general, and some misperceptions about COP26 in particular. The first misperception is that it is being described as a summit of government heads who are coming to Glasgow in order to make a new agreement.\nThe COP is an annual meeting of officials from every country that is a party to the UNFCCC, to review progress and agree on new actions. It takes place over two weeks, with the first week involving a meeting among technical experts and bureaucrats, and the second week involving a high-level meeting where ministers arrive to make the final political agreement.\nSo the COP is not a summit of leaders, but the heads of governments are sometimes invited by the head of the government of the host country. In this case, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indeed invited world leaders to attend the opening day, which is designated as the Leaders' Day. Many heads of governments, including US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have accepted this invitation. Others like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the event in person, but their governments will be fully represented at the conference.\nSo, whether a world leader goes to Glasgow or not is completely immaterial to the success of the meeting. Even if they go, they will only have a photo with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but will have no real input for the negotiations, which will only begin after the leaders have left Glasgow.\nThe second misperception is that a new agreement will be negotiated in Glasgow, which is not at all correct. The main agreement was the Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015, and subsequent COPs are focusing on how to better deliver the Paris Agreement, rather than coming up with a new Glasgow agreement.\nIt is important to note that there are many things happening in the city hosting the COP each year, of which the official negotiations by governments is only one part. Of the tens of thousands of people from around the world who go to the COP, most are not negotiators, but represent different groups of stakeholders, including civil society, companies, youth, indigenous peoples, mayors, and parliamentarians.\nOf course, due to the restrictions on international travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be fewer people in attendance this year. Nevertheless, there may be up to 20,000 people in Glasgow during the two weeks of COP26.\nThe location where the official government negotiations take place is designated the Blue Zone, and for the duration of the COP is under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. Access to Blue Zone is restricted to the UN badge-holders only.\nThe COP host country also provides another venue for holding many side events and meetings in the Green Zone, where access is much easier and where many NGOs and others hold networking events.\nThe business community also has a big presence in every COP, but they usually book all the five-star hotels in the city and hold their own events, where they can wine and dine selected delegates from key countries.\nIn recent COPs, we have also had the presence of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and thousands of youth who not only hold their own events, but also organise a big march on Saturday in the middle of the two-week conference.\nThis march by youth and others can bring up to a 100,000 people to the streets.\nFinally, there are many journalists who attend the COP, usually towards the end of it, to cover the final outcome. Nowadays, in addition to the usual global media, there are also many journalists from developing countries. Bangladesh usually has a good number of journalists at the COP each year, including several TV channels who do daily live reports from the venue.\nNow, let's look at the major issues that are likely to be on the agenda for COP26. Although there are a large number of agenda items to discuss, three major issues stand out. The first and most important is how we are doing in maintaining the cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise, as per the agreement at COP21. This will be calculated by adding up each country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which gives their plans for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unfortunately, as per the NDCs submitted so far, we are headed for a 2.7 degrees Celsius rise\u2014much higher than the planned 1.5 degrees\u2014so every country will have to raise their ambitions severalfold.\nThe second important item is money. The developed countries pledged to provide developing countries with USD 100 billion a year starting from 2020 onwards, but failed miserably to fulfil that pledge. They must deliver it to regain any semblance of credibility going forward.\nThirdly, and this is indeed new, the issue of loss and damage from human-induced climate change, which has become a reality that needs to be discussed at a high level in COP26 to be considered a success. My own litmus test for the success of COP26 is the extent to which the developed countries are willing to take the issue of loss and damage seriously.\n\u00a0\nDr Saleemul Huq is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at the Independent University, Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "I grew up in a mixed family\u2014my father was a practising Hindu and my mother was a practising Muslim. Even today, if somebody asks me about my religion, I fail to identify as just one of them; I am both, and definitely not one over the other. I grew up in Dhaka city at a time (1980-1990) when democracy was more under threat than religion. So, during my childhood years, I experienced a beautiful confluence of two faiths. My mother's family loved their Hindu jamai (son-in-law), and my father's family loved their Muslim bou (daughter-in-law). It was never an issue in our household whether we were celebrating Eid or Puja. We had the blessings of celebrating and enjoying both, without anyone raising any complaint about our celebrations.\nGrowing up in a mixed household gave me enough understanding about both religions, and I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to see and experience the beauty in both faiths. I have many Muslim and Hindu friends in and from Bangladesh, and never in my life have I had the feeling that they had any issue with my religious background. I know the recent violence in Bangladesh on Hindu communities during Durga Puja is a stark opposite of the confluence of religions that I experienced in Bangladesh. Therefore, I feel obliged to write to both my Hindu and Muslim communities.\nTo my Hindu community\nSince 1947, the Indian subcontinent has experienced a lot of religious violence. The \"divide and rule\" principle of the British rulers worked well on us, and the religious people that had lived together amicably for centuries suddenly found a new weapon to kill each other. It is indeed sad, but understand that violence is the display of fear and weakness of extremists who just wait for occasions to harm the innocent. Is it okay? No. Should a country like Bangladesh tolerate it? Again, no. However, can it happen? Yes, it can, and it will continue to happen if the majority does not take a stand against it. Statistically, any country will have at least 2.5 percent of the population who lean towards extremism. The 2.5 percent of about 165 million people in Bangladesh would be more than four million, which is indeed a large number. So, yes, any minority group living in Bangladesh is at relatively high risks. However, I would say the risks or challenges of living in Bangladesh are also high for many other reasons\u2014e.g. non-religious crimes and road accidents. Is the risk due to your religion more threatening than the other reasons? No, not at all.\nSo, please do not consider leaving Bangladesh fearing that your security is compromised because of the recent events. Living in Bangladesh has never been fully safe. I hope no one has forgotten the 2016 terror attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, which happened in a privileged neighbourhood of the city to an apparent majority group by another majority group (as they identified themselves as such).\nTo my Muslim community\nI know the majority of you do not support violence against minority communities. However, not supporting violence is one thing, and staying silent and not standing up for your Hindu friends is another. Keeping silent is a crime in itself. Bangladesh has long observed and tolerated many crimes against minority groups, and the minority population in the country is decreasing at an alarming rate. If you do not stand up for your Hindu brothers and sisters now, those extremists I described previously will one day come after you. If you want your family to be safe and not be harmed by your neighbours, then please speak up, stand up for your minority friends and neighbours, and say out loud that you are there for them, and they are not alone. It is not the time to tolerate the heinous crimes that have been committed in the name of religion.\nTo the extremists\nI would say that Bangladesh is now in a far better shape to take action against the extremists. The digitisation initiative by the current government has made crimes and criminals much more visible than before. So, do not even think that you can get away by committing a crime against humanity. Our prime minister has demonstrated her intolerance against crimes and criminals time and again; I believe that she will ensure that justice prevails.\nTo the general population\nReligion is a personal interpretation of an individual. Because there are nearly eight billion people in the world, there can theoretically be eight billion interpretations of different belief systems. If someone has a lousy understanding of religious rules, I don't think it is fair to take it out on the entire religion. Religion itself is generally good; it is always the followers and what they do to follow their own religion that turn it bad. I can safely say that neither Islam nor Hinduism supports violence. Those who support violence are not more religious; they are just trying to diminish the humanity of the majority. It is the need of the hour that we become human first, then a Hindu or a Muslim.\nThe world has just started to recover from a global pandemic. Covid-19 has shown us that united we stand, and divided we fall. The British left us 70 years ago\u2014we don't need to follow their legacy of division anymore. Let's prove to the world as a nation that breaking walls down should be the new norm, not building them; a fresh reality of harmony, peace, and compassion should be our goal going forward.\n\u00a0\nSudipa Sarker is an assistant professor of business development and technology at Aarhus University, Denmark.

        "full_article": "Josip Broz Tito was one of the founding leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). He was undeniably a significant world leader loved by many around the globe, and was also harshly criticised by many people\u2014especially by the non-Serbs in former Yugoslavia for not doing enough to deter the Serbian hegemonic aspirations, despite anticipating the outcome far ahead.\nTito was born and raised in the idyllic Zagorje region of Croatia. His mother was Slovenian and his father Croatian. He started out as a locksmith. He first became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia\u2014not to be confused with Slovenia\u2014at a young age, and later joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, gradually rising to leadership.\nTito was a popular leader. He mobilised people with socialist aspirations in the territories of Yugoslavia during World War II against the Nazis, fascists and other groups. After winning the war, he led the Yugoslav communist revolution.\nIn the early years of his leadership, Tito intended close relations, but felt pressure by the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. In order to counter Soviet influence, he began to receive outside help, including military assistance from the Western countries. In 1953, he made a tripartite Balkan Pact with NATO members Greece and Turkey, with the aim to act as a deterrence against the Soviet expansion. Although Tito was known to have reservations about the Western influence and pluralist systems as threats to his own ideal communist state, the pact was obviously intended to protect Yugoslavia from the USSR.\nThe death of Stalin in 1953 would not diminish the looming Soviet threat against the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Sharing the concerns of other countries caught between the two powerful blocs, Tito, together with the leaders of India, Egypt, Ghana and Indonesia, co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).\nBoth the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of the Sino-Indian Agreement in 1954 and the Bandung Principles inspired the foundation of NAM.\nAfter the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, many things changed in the international arena. Although many countries were progressively reformed, some took the opposite direction. The economic reliance of many NAM members, especially on the West, was the new trend in the international order after the Cold War.\nWith the winds of change in the former Eastern Bloc countries, popular demands for transition to a multiparty and more liberal system began to rise in Tito's Yugoslavia as well. Unlike the USSR and other former Eastern Bloc nations, the transition was excruciating in Yugoslavia. The Republic of Serbia, as an \"internal hegemonist\" of the federation, disrespected legitimate demands of other constitutive units for peaceful breakup of ex-Yugoslavia and undermined peaceful transition. Serbia saw the transition as an opportunity to expand its borders.\nSlobodan Milo\u0161evic's Serbia shattered the spirit of coexistence from the Tito era and tried to replace it with Serbian domination and nationalism. A seemingly socialist regime would make the Serbian Orthodox Church the mouthpiece of Milo\u0161evic's hate speech and propaganda, while the Yugoslav Army a guardian of Serbian nationalism through the ethnic Serbian generals. Milo\u0161evic, who later turned out to be a war criminal, created paramilitary groups by driving thousands of crime machines like \u017deljko Ra\u017enjatovic Arkan into battlefields. As the dominant power among the republics of former Yugoslavia, Serbia had constantly violated the basic principles of NAM through its actions. Serbia, during that time, attacked the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the other constitutive units, resorted to violence, interfered in their internal affairs, and breached the principle of equality and peaceful coexistence of all people and nations in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Serbia's aggression also sparked wars and humanitarian crises in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Slovenia, Northern Macedonia, and Montenegro were also affected, but they survived more easily than the others. The culture of conflict that prevailed did a lot of damage to the Serbs as well.\nMore than 20 years have passed since the wars of ex-Yugoslavia.\nWhile the Western Balkan countries are prioritising the integration process to the European Union and everyone is expecting a more prosperous future, Serbia is, unfortunately, signalling new fears again, through aggressive rhetoric and by using Serbian elements in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Montenegro. Taking the actions that can lead to repeating old habits can be the biggest mistake in the Western Balkans.\nThe current president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, was an MP from the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party in the National Assembly of Serbia during the Bosnian War. During the Kosovo War, he served as the minister of information. President Vucic, who has never expressed regret for his aggressive rhetoric and damages caused in the past, is now paraded as a \"moderate leader\" of the Serbs, which is yet to be seen. During the high-level commemorative meeting on the occasion of NAM's 60th anniversary, Vucic pretended to be keeping Tito's ideals alive. Instead, the event turned out to be a propaganda ground by the Serbian leadership, targeting Kosovo exclusively. Serbia, still reluctant to give up its hegemonic dreams, parades itself as the sole inheritor of the former Yugoslavia, when the legacy of Yugoslavia belongs to all its constitutive units, as much as Serbia.\nIdeals of living under one federation were destroyed mostly by those responsible for the murder of more than 150,000 innocent people in former Yugoslavia. Marshall Tito, a leader who earned the hearts and minds of people from many NAM countries, passed away in 1980. His spirit of unity was gradually destroyed in the past 40 years, mostly by the hegemonic ambitions of Serbia. This conjuncture led to the emergence and increase of influence of other nationalist movements as well.\nThe people of the Western Balkans are virtuous. They will eventually find a way to have good neighbourly relations in a pluralistic and democratic environment. The only solution can be reached by genuinely adopting the values of the modern European Union by all Balkan countries. The European Union, despite some issues, will remain a miracle of the 20th century and a model system for the world. Without repeating mistakes of the past, the leaders of the region\u2014especially of Serbia\u2014could relieve their people of the feelings of hostility, and make them look to a peaceful future. We can only achieve it together as independent states by championing mutual respect and democratic principles.\n\u00a0\nG\u00fcner Ureya is the ambassador of the Republic of Kosovo to Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "An untimely flood wreaked havoc on the Teesta basin in Bangladesh, beginning on the night of Wednesday, October 20. A sudden onrush of Teesta water flooded the area to a level that has not been witnessed since 1968. Several people have died, while thousands of people have lost their crops, their houses have been damaged and destroyed, their clothes and other belongings have been washed away, and the infrastructure of the area has been damaged to a large extent.\nThe apparent cause of the flooding has been unusual rainfall in the upper catchment area of the Teesta River (Sikkim and northern parts of West Bengal), leading to a sudden increase in the river flow, which was then passed on to Bangladesh by the Gajoldoba Barrage operators by opening all the gates. According to local sources, the water reached the Teesta Barrage at Dalia by the evening of Wednesday, though the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) officials did not wake up to the information and the situation till Thursday morning, when they too decided to open the gates of the Teesta Barrage. However, by that time, the water accumulated at the head of this barrage had burst out of the river confines and flooded the area. The volume of the water was so huge that even opening the gates and the flood bypass\u2014so the river water could spill over into the downstream reaches (from Teesta Barrage) of the river too\u2014was not enough. The entire region of greater Rangpur was affected.\nThe affected people will need a long time to recover and rebuild in the aftermath. They need immediate assistance to shore up their lives. In particular, they will need clothes and blankets to survive through the impending winter. The local activists of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa) and Teesta River Bachao Andolon are at the forefront of the relief operation, using whatever resources they could muster, working from Wednesday evening. However, the people in the affected area will need broader and more significant assistance from the government agencies.\nGiven the government's disaster management capability and other resources, the relief and rehabilitation operations will probably go well, and the situation will be stabilised. However, greater questions still remain: What is the guarantee that a similar frightful episode will not happen again soon? What can Bangladesh do to avoid such catastrophic floods and manage to cope with them when they actually happen?\nBangladesh's rivers and water resources face threats from three sources: global, regional, and domestic. All these combined to produce the latest nightmare in the Teesta basin. The global threat worked through climate change, causing the untimely torrential rainfall in the Teesta upper catchment area. The regional threat worked through the decision of the Gajoldoba Barrage operators to open all the gates, apparently without timely and adequate consultation with the BWDB officials of the Teesta Barrage. The domestic threat found manifestation in the fact that the country is not prepared to accommodate unexpected large volumes of river overflow in a safe and controlled way. What can Bangladesh do to mitigate threats from these three sources?\nRegarding climate change, there is no doubt that Bangladesh has to make its voice stronger in the international fora, and as the chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has an important role to play in view of the upcoming COP26. It can be hoped that Bangladesh will live up to its expected role at this conference. However, one does not have to be too pessimistic to realise that the impact of Bangladesh's initiatives in halting and reversing climate change and its various effects is going to be limited. That being the case, it is important to think what Bangladesh can do to mitigate the regional and domestic threats.\nRegarding the regional threats to the Teesta River, it is well-known that Bangladesh has been striving for a long time to reach a treaty with India. The focus of the proposed treaty has been, however, on the share of the dry season flow\u2014as was the case with the Ganges sharing treaty signed in 1996. What the recent event has shown is that this focus needs to be extended to cover river control throughout the year. It is not appropriate for India to build a controlling structure and then use it for its own interest only. Bangladesh should have a say in its management, because it has to bear the brunt of the decisions made. To add force to this demand, Bangladesh needs to sign the 1997 UN Convention on Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. Article 7 of this convention forbids upstream countries from carrying out such interventions in shared rivers that cause \"significant harm\" to lower riparian countries. Other articles\u2014such as Articles 20 and 23\u2014also provide protection to lower riparian countries.\nOf course, signing the UN convention alone will not solve the problem. It will also be necessary to bring about some changes in Bangladesh's water diplomacy with India. So far, Bangladesh has conducted this diplomacy relying on goodwill. However, as German statesman Otto von Bismarck said, international relations are based on interests. Just as India is leveraging its upstream location to impose its will on Bangladesh regarding rivers, Bangladesh may also leverage its geographical location to reconsider issues of transit, trans-shipment, port facilities, and even trade and employment. Otherwise, Bangladesh will be increasingly at the mercy of the barrage operators of India.\nWhile Bangladesh has limitations regarding what it can do to mitigate global and regional threats, it does not face such limitations regarding domestic threats, which are unfortunately self-created. What the recent Teesta flood episode has shown is that Bangladesh has to have a lot of storage space for river overflows. The active floodplains of the country used to serve as this storage space. They also served as additional passageways for the overflow to pass on to the sea. Unfortunately, following the Cordon Approach for the past 70 years, Bangladesh increasingly disconnected the floodplains from the rivers. To cope with the new normal created by climate change, Bangladesh has to reverse this process and reconnect the floodplains with rivers by adopting the Open Approach. It has to adjust the living conditions and economic activities in the floodplains to suit the open conditions.\nThe recent Teesta flood also shows the inappropriateness of the proposed Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project (TRCMRP). According to a YouTube video prepared by the vendor company, Power China, the Teesta River, under this project, will be artificially narrowed from its current average width of about 3km to only 0.8km. Though it has been suggested that the depth of the river will be increased to 10 metres through dredging, analysis makes it clear that this gain in depth will be nullified in a few years by about 49 million tonnes of sediment that the river carries each year. What that means is that the river will be incapable of holding normal peak season flows, not to speak of unexpected large volumes like the one we've seen\u00a0over the last few days. Going ahead with this project will therefore only make matters worse.\nWhat is instead necessary is to rejuvenate the connections of the Teesta River with all its tributaries, distributaries and waterbodies of its basin so that wider storage capacity is restored. Meanwhile, the changed strategy of water diplomacy may help to restore the dry season flow of the river, thus triggering a natural process of restoration of the original, healthy morphology of the river. These are the few lessons from the current usual Teesta flooding.\n\u00a0\nDr S Nazrul Islam is an economist, founder of Bangladesh Environment Network (BEN), and the initiator and vice-president of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa).\n",

        "full_article": "Many have this image of a police constable as someone wielding his baton, chasing after peaceful bystanders, unnecessarily harassing the commuter or a rickshaw puller, or taking bribes from anyone he can by exploiting his distress. This enduring image, however incomplete, often comes with unprintable adjectives, which shows that the challenge a constable faces is not just on the streets. But little do we understand or care to know about the kind of life they live as a part of the police force\u2014under strenuous conditions, navigating a gruelling work schedule. Do we ever spare a thought for those constables who, while we enjoy our holidays, are out on the streets to ensure that we are safe?\nA constable occupies the lowest rung of the hierarchy in the police force. He has to be ready 24/7 to respond to any call. While the number of police members in Bangladesh has exceeded 200,000 by now\u2014the majority of them being constables\u2014the people-to-police ratio (1:816) is still woefully below the United Nations or international standards. Thus, the law keepers are constantly overworked and consequently physically and mentally overstressed.\nAs per a report published by this paper, a constable has a long work shift consisting of nearly 12 hours. Considering the other ancillary duties and obligations, they hardly get a full night's rest before starting on the next day's round of duty. And the pay and allowances they get are hardly enough to maintain a family under the present conditions. Therefore, many of them have to resort to irregular means to make both ends meet. It appears from the report that many of the new entrants to the post end up disillusioned by the nature of their duty, because it is not quite what they expected before joining. Instead of excitement, they are facing drudgery. To cap it all, they hardly get a break from their job to go on leave. This takes a heavy toll on them, which some cannot endure and end up taking their own lives.\nWe believe that there should be a serious analysis of police personnel's duties to see whether they are being employed optimally, and how manpower resources can be managed to make the best use of the existing workforce without excessive pressure on individuals. No human being can work 24/7 or round the year without getting a break. Leave must be allowed under all circumstances, and that calls for efficient HR management. A taxed mind and overworked body are not only inefficient, but prone to making mistakes as well. And if that person happens to be a policeman, it can be very dangerous\u2014for him as well as the public.\n",

As police continue their investigations into this latest spate of communal attacks, we are deeply concerned to find that links between the recent violence and individuals with political backgrounds and/or connections are beginning to surface.\nAccording to a report in this daily, Iqbal Hossain, the man suspected of instigating the violence in Cumilla by putting a copy of the Quran at a puja mandap, named an aide to Cumilla Mayor Moinuddin Ahmed Babu as one of the people who incited the crowd to carry out the attacks. On Saturday, Rab disclosed that a local Chhatra League leader and his accomplices instigated the mob to burn down homes and shops of the Hindu community in Rangpur's Pirganj upazila on October 17. Media reports also suggest that leaders and activists from different political groups have been arrested in Chandpur, Chattogram, Feni, and Noakhali, including a former UP chairman, although a majority of them are from BNP-Jamaat backgrounds.\nWhile we commend the actions that have been taken so far to bring the perpetrators to book, we cannot help but point out the gravity of the situation, where members of political parties are suspected to be stoking the fires of sectarian violence. Affiliations of these alleged perpetrators with the ruling party are all the more concerning, since it is the mandate of the party in power to protect minority communities and ensure their security and ability to live in peace.\nWe hope that the government will make every effort to ensure that justice is served, but that is not enough\u2014the authorities must take serious and concerted measures to ensure that communal and anti-liberal ideas are not allowed to take root in party politics. In this regard, every political party in the country has to make a commitment. The damage to communal harmony that has been caused by the recent attacks is an issue of national security that cannot be taken lightly, and anyone who is part of this sinister plan must be dealt with accordingly, regardless of their political affiliations.\n",
