The government has been struggling in recent years to formulate an appropriate regulatory response to deal with the pandemic-era upsurge in advertisements soliciting investment in virtual assets as well as reports of actual investment. A July 2021 online report by BrokerChooser.com, for instance, had estimated India as being the country with the highest number of \u2018crypto owners\u2019, at 10.07 crore, which was more than threefold the number of owners of crypto assets in the second-ranked U.S. Even if this is discounted as a speculative guesstimate, measures and disclosures by the government indicate that the volume of trade in unregulated virtual assets has grown sizeably in recent years. Last month, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed the Lok Sabha that the Enforcement Directorate was \u2018investigating several cases related to cryptocurrency frauds wherein a few crypto exchanges had been found involved in money laundering\u2019. And that as much as \u20b9936 crore had been attached or frozen as on January 31, on being deemed to be proceeds of crime. The decision to mandatorily bring all trade in virtual digital assets under the PMLA now lays the onus of ascertaining the provenance of all activity, including safekeeping, in such assets upon individuals and businesses participating in or facilitating these transactions.\rThe intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \u2014 the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog \u2014 has been continuously flagging the potential that virtual digital assets have for criminal misuse considering the speed and anonymity with which they can be traded worldwide. As it has pointed out, the fact that a few countries have moved to regulate virtual assets, and some others have banned them outright, while a majority have not taken any action has created a global system with loopholes for criminals and terrorists to abuse. India, which holds the presidency of the G-20, has been repeatedly stressing the need for a globally coordinated regulatory response to deal with crypto assets. While the Centre\u2019s decision to add the PMLA monitoring requirements, following the introduction of a tax regime for virtual digital assets in last year\u2019s Budget, has been interpreted by the crypto assets sector as moves towards regulating rather than proscribing it, the RBI\u2019s consistent advocacy for a ban needs to be seriously weighed before any decision is taken on the fate of the long-delayed draft legislation on virtual assets.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nmoney laundering\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\ncryptocurrency\n\n/\n\nG20\n\n/\n\ncrime",

        "full_article": "The downward slide in relations between the world\u2019s two biggest powers fast appears to be reaching a point of no return. That was certainly the message from Beijing, where, during the on-going annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress or Parliament, Chinese leaders took aim at Washington\u2019s recent approach to ties. Xi Jinping, now reappointed for a third five year-term as President, told a parliamentary delegation on March 6 that China was facing \u201cunprecedented severe challenges to the country\u2019s development\u201d because \u201cWestern countries, led by the U.S., have implemented all-round containment and suppression of China\u201d. That Mr. Xi chose to directly name the U.S. underlined starkly how relations have deteriorated. China\u2019s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang said the U.S. was seeking \u201cto encircle China\u201d. He also rejected the Biden administration\u2019s claim that \u201cit seeks to out-compete China but does not seek conflict,\u201d saying it \u201c... means to contain and suppress China in all respects\u201d. He added that \u201cif the U.S. does not hit the brake... there will surely be confrontation\u201d.If the hope was to \u201cresponsibly manage\u201d competition, as the two leaders put it at their G-20 Indonesia meet in November 2022, recent events do not inspire confidence. A scheduled visit early last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was cancelled after the sighting of a Chinese balloon over the U.S. Washington saw the \u201cspy balloon\u201d as a grave provocation on the eve of a visit aimed to restart engagement. Beijing slammed the U.S. decision to shoot down a \u201ccivilian meteorological airship\u201d as reflecting a sense of \u201chysteria\u201d in Washington when it comes to China. For the rest of the world, recent events suggest the rift is here to stay. Beijing, which is increasingly looking at the rest of the world through the prism of its all-encompassing U.S. rivalry, appears to be mending fences with Europe, while courting its neighbours. Beijing is planning a major Central Asia summit this year, while its strained relations with Japan are warming. The U.S., meanwhile, is shoring up alliances and partnerships in the region. While India has so far adeptly managed the fallout from the Ukraine war by adhering to its self-interest, China poses a unique challenge given the Line of Actual Control crisis. After Beijing\u2019s increasingly vocal objections to the Quad, India will have to remain prepared for continued pressure along the land borders, even as it assesses whether the worsening China-U.S. rift may alter Beijing\u2019s calculus as it grapples with two fronts, though Taiwan remains its primary concern. India must be nimble enough to exploit the opportunities in an increasingly divided world full of uncertainty and difficult challenges.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nIndia-China",

The otherwise scenic seaside town became clouded in toxic fumes after the Brahmapuram dumpyard caught fire on March 2. Many people in close vicinity were forced to shift out temporarily, but the winds carried noxious dioxins and furans inside faraway homes. Turns out that this waste treatment plant has been operating without a licence since 2016 because it kept failing at various mandated benchmarks, from plastic waste segregation to bio-mining of legacy waste. But as the only dumpyard in Kochi, the debris kept being sent its way.\nTragically, this is a familiar occurrence across the country. Unsanitary mixed waste dumps are regularly leaking serious health hazards into the air, whether it is the Adharwadi and Deonar landfills in Maharashtra or the massive garbage mountains in Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa in Delhi. The capital\u2019s eyesores were supposed to be gone by now, all their legacy waste remediated. Instead, fresh wet waste continues to be dumped there daily. What feels extra painful in the Kochi case is that household waste segregation is now widespread there, but all that work is being undermined at the end point, with municipal authorities failing to correct the poor practices of Brahmapuram waste treatment.\nWhen the Kerala high court hauled up the Kochi corporation, its response was that such fires are occurring across the country. This is how uncaring municipal bodies are, they fear no accountability. This is totally unsustainable. More urbanisation is generating more waste daily. Its scientific management is like the backbone of our cities, without which \u2013 as Kochi has so viscerally experienced \u2013 we cannot do healthful work at all.\n\u00a0\n\n",

They now need to follow the relevant KYC standards and also report suspicious transactions. To put this development in context, go back to the Parliament\u2019s winter session of 2021. Prior to it, GoI indicated a bill to regulate crypto assets would be tabled. However, a bill was never introduced.\nSince then, GoI has gradually come around to accepting it as one among the menu of financial assets on offer. It also acknowledged the limitation of having a stand-alone domestic regulation for virtual assets. For instance, in February, GoI informed Parliament that as crypto assets are not confined by national boundaries, regulation will be effective only if there\u2019s international collaboration on evolving a common regulatory framework. Therefore, India is utilising the G20 platform to catalyse a common framework. Separately, RBI had asked financial intermediaries it regulates to follow KYC norms and other relevant standards for remittances following transactions in crypto assets.\nED\u2019s investigated transactions it has deemed suspicious. As on January 31, the agency had arrested five people and attached assets valued at Rs 936 crore in relation to those transactions. Given this background, GoI\u2019s latest notification is a corollary to recent developments. Crypto assets need to be treated as a financial asset with intermediaries required to follow reporting standards.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Last week, I had a meeting in Dhanmondi for which I had to take the Science Lab road. As everyone was running late, I was browsing through my phone when the news popped up: an explosion had taken place on the road I had just passed, killing three people on the spot and injuring 40 others. I heaved a personal sigh of relief. The accident, however, added to the growing sighs from which there seems to be no relief.\nTwo days after that, there was another explosion at a building in a busy old part of town in Gulistan. The death toll has risen to 22 (as of 8pm, March 9), with many others in critical condition. The building housed an illegal basement market of sanitary items with the branch of a reputed corporate bank above. On the eve of a holy night, many people were on the streets buying savoury items from that area, which is famed for its traditional delicacies. There were people waiting in line at a bus stop nearby. The explosion changed it all.\nDifferent threads of stories are beginning to unravel. A young man went there to get food for his mother who was fasting. He never returned. Two brothers went to buy some bathroom fittings from a shop in that building. One left a bit early as he was not feeling well, while the other remained inside to collect the receipt of their purchase. Little did he know that the memo was his last. A witness who was driving by recalled how a body flew out of nowhere and landed on his car bonnet; he tried to lay the victim aside to flee the area when he saw that part of the skull had been blown off by the blast. There are many other sad, gory accounts.\nAccidents, by definition, are unintended and unfortunate incidents that cause harm. Then again, questions must be asked when these unfortunate events occur as the result of negligence on part of the authorities or agencies concerned. In the absence of regular monitoring, regulations or upgrading of the systems, we have allowed our operating system to be vulnerable. A culture of impunity has further made this system corrode, if not collapse.\nAn explosion in a city is like the rupture of a blister. Just like our skin accumulates fluids in a blister to suggest infections within and then bursts open to announce that something is not right in the body, these explosions signify a sick city. When gas gathers in old pipes, when cheap and spurious items are used in air conditioners, when low-grade electricity cables and equipment are used, and when regular servicing of utilities is not done, it is hard to call these incidents accidents. These are deliberate, caused by human errors or oversight. Someone must be held responsible. Handcuffing the building owners after the event is not the solution. The smart thing to do in a planned smart city is to routinely intervene and monitor.\nLet's not forget that the utility services of a city are true indicators of the economic, social, and environmental performances of modern life. The network of water, waste, electricity, gas, and telecommunication systems forms the infrastructure conduits that allow modern cities to operate. The nature of service is fast growing in complexity, making its vulnerability both imminent and evident. And there is no option but to upgrade for the new changes and challenges.\nThree different agencies are investigating the accident spot in Gulistan. The Titas Gas authority washed their hands of the accident, saying that the surviving riser on their gas pipes suggests that the explosion is unlikely to be gas-related. Forensic experts of the police are hinting at a gas deposit in a septic tank that was not cleaned for a long time. The outdoor units of the air conditioners in the void between the buildings can be another source of the explosion. The fire department confirmed that, given the extent of the explosion, this accident was not electricity-related. The entire building has caved in and declared unsafe.\nAll these resources that have come together to do a post-mortem of an exploded building could have very well been used for regular monitoring instead. There is no glory in giving sagacious comments over the dead. The challenge is to keep the city alive before you make it smart.\nThe plain and staid utilities of the present time are completely inadequate and inefficient for our future growth. Many people who are moving to the capital are unaware of their civic responsibilities. Many don't even know how to maintain utilities in a manner that is safe for them and others.\nWithout collaboration and community engagement, service providers can never ensure the functionality of every piece of equipment that is being used. In most households, for instance, gas cylinders are stored side by side, making them a ticking time bomb. Private companies are supplying these cylinders, which remain outside the purview of state agencies. Local authorities can initiate community awareness meetings to protect the safety of these cylinders. Utility experts and city officials can come together to undertake a pilot programme to ensure a resilient service network. Retired officers can volunteer to form local monitoring teams to check the equipment that is being used.\nLet's relieve the city of its illness by having preventive measures.\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is a professor of English at Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is a paradox that when foreign aid worth billions of dollars is remaining unutilised, the government, due to forex reserve crunch, has been constrained to cut expenditures on economic activities that require foreign currency. A recently-published report by this paper citing data from the Economic Relations Division (ERD) says that last fiscal year (FY22), committed foreign aid worth over US$50 billion has accumulated in the pipeline waiting to be spent in development projects. But thanks to the lack of, or tardiness in, project implementation, such an enormous sum of foreign fund could not be utilised. This is unfortunate. But who is at fault for such delays in project implementation? Obviously, it is the project implementing agencies and persons operating those are to blame. So, to get around this implemental hold-up, the first thing that the government should do is to hold those in charge of the projects accountable. In this context, one is dismayed to see that every fiscal year, following implementation failures, the government, in its revised budgets, has been reducing funds for the foreign-aided projects under the Annual Development Programmes (ADPs). Surprisingly, no heads have been seen rolling for the sloth or lack of performance in executing development projects.Some experts are of the view that unless the government punishes the heads of the slow, or non-performing projects and rewards the successful ones, the situation of underutilisation of foreign aid will never improve. The lack of timely project implementation, as noted in a recently-published ERD report, can be traced to faults in project design having to do with inadequate feasibility study prior to taking a project leading to planning mismatch. Shortage of trained personnel to run the projects is another important reason for the poor performance in project implementation. These lacunae in the development projects lie behind the inordinate delays in project implementation and result in budgetary or cost overruns. Worse, it slows down disbursement of project aid. So, urgent steps are necessary to be taken to address the issues coming in the way of expeditious implementation of development projects.One would like to recall at this point that the global lender, the World Bank (WB), during a recent meeting with the government on reviewing the status of some poorly progressing development projects it supports financially, even warned of withdrawing the unspent project money if the authorities in question failed to execute those projects in time. Such a stern reminder from the WB on slow project implementation should be taken with due seriousness. For the ever-bulging aid-pipeline for Bangladesh, as the aid money could not be duly released due to various implementation bottlenecks facing development projects, is apt to send a wrong message to the country's international development partners. In such a crunch time, especially, across the developing world, the demand for foreign aid, which is a critical resource for economic growth, is obviously on the rise. Under substantial pressure from foreign exchange reserve crisis, Bangladesh could well benefit from the unspent foreign aid, if only the development projects could be executed in time. But that is not to be. In that case, the donors might even think of diverting the aid money to areas where it is urgently needed. Under any circumstances, a foreign-exchange-starved country like Bangladesh can hardly afford that to happen. It is more so at a time when the economy is well on its path to graduate from a least developed to a developing one.",

        "full_article": "In an interesting development, the World Bank (WB) apparently is considering diverting US$0.5 billion from the development funds it has given to Bangladesh over the years. The government has approached the lender for two instalments totalling $0.5 billion in the form of \"budgetary-support credit as it needs to minimise growing budget deficit.\" This would indeed be a departure from the norm, as the original plan had been to provide the government a total of $1.0 billion -- $250 million and $750 billion in two instalments. The latter would have come from WB's Green, Resilient Inclusive Development (GRID) programme. Now that addressing the budgetary deficit is increasingly becoming more difficult, the plan for financing it with external support is also being revisited. Bangladesh's inability to expedite the implemention of its foreign-assisted development projects over many years has been a constant irritant -- both for funding agencies and also the government and this requires a closer scrutiny. It is interesting to note that successive national budgets have simply grown in size. Again, every proposed budget has had to be trimmed in the form of revised annual development plans when it became apparent that the capacity to both absorb billions of dollars in soft loans/grants and implement the same was missing from the equation. For years development partners (and their respective financial institutions) giving loans have been insisting on reforms. Unfortunately, when it came to reforms, successive governments have doggedly avoided going that way or going half-way and then expecting bilateral / multilateral agencies to accept the status quo.What is now clear is that the WB is having a second thought about billions of dollars stuck in the development pipeline in the country. According to reports carried in this paper, \"at a tripartite meeting among the ERD, the WB and project-implementing agencies in the first week of March, the Washington-based lender warned of pulling out the funds from the WB-funded slow-moving projects\". Some eight slow-moving projects have been discussed with funds committed ranging from $100 -$700 million. There are projects here that have seen only partial implementation and a fraction of the funds committed utilised. Indeed, when it is seen that public agencies have failed to utilise the billions committed to development projects and that the failure to increase the capacity of project implementation agencies, who can blame the WB for opting to withdraw idle funds? According to a recently released report of the Economic Relations Division (ERD), the confirmed development assistance has ballooned to $50.35 billion as of the last fiscal year (FY 2021-22). How did things get so bad? Economists have a different perspective on this issue. They say that a lack of accountability of implementing agencies is partially to blame for the pileup of unutilised aid, year-on-year. Then what is the point of asking for more funds when there are billions lying idle? That question can be answered not just by the government, but also by funding agencies. So on the one hand there is disbursement, which apparently has picked up recently. Nothing much has improved on the implementation side. Yet, multilateral and bilateral development partners, including the WB, have continued to commit funds for specific projects and work done on those projects. Although the rate of implementation increased by 5.5 per cent in FY22 over FY21, things were not so rosy for the many fiscal years in the past which has contributed (negatively) to the buildup in overseas development assistance fund. As pointed out in an ERD report, such slow implementation of projects results in slow disbursement of aid; which leads to time and cost overruns. This in turn, leads to increased borrowing from domestic sources. ERD believes that projects are often taken up without proper planning and feasibility studies are seldom conducted prior to project design. There is a lack of requisite training for those involved with project formulation and when funding dwindles, cost overruns occur long before project commencement. Since ERD is part of the government machinery, what excuse is there for not accepting its observations? This has been going on for decades. While it is easy to cut project aid from the budget, is it impossible to make those in charge of these projects accountable? Precisely, how is the government's objectives fulfilled if large numbers of projects fail to get off the ground, especially when these are foreign-funded ones. The lack of accountability and transparency leads not only to the threat of cancellation from lending institutes, but also to set the stage for souring relations. Does the country benefit from any of those? The time has surely arrived to take a step back and look at what works and what doesn't. This is election year and it is understandable that policymakers would want to complete and commission as many projects it can before the electoral fanfare arrives. But without meaningful reform, a lot of those projects will simply not be completed and the government's credibility as a reliable development partner will be brought increasingly into question. Time to cauterize the wound, while there is still time.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Last week Bangladesh Communist Party (CPB) observed its 75th founding anniversary in a befitting manner. Though the communist ideology has lost its appeal in the country for a long, the existence of the party indicates that only a few people still bear the flag of communism. It is a dream to establish greater societal equality through state control of the economy. Public, not private, ownership, especially of the means of production, distribution and exchange of goods in a society, is the core thing in communism so that the capitalist class can no longer profit at the expense of the working class. It aims to remove class privilege and rejects the market economy.The CPB had its origin in the communist movement in British India during the 1920s. In 1925, the Communist Party of India (CPI) was established. After the partition in 1947, at the second congress of CPI in Kolkata it was decided to establish the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP). On March 6, 1948, CPP was officially founded. In 1968, the Communist Party of East Pakistan was formed. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, it became the CPB.The party has a fascinating history of the socio-political movement in this region. Once upon a time, it had attracted a large pool of youths nationwide. Though most were from ordinary families, many well-off family members joined the bandwagon. Again, many of them were meritorious and devoted themselves to rigorous study and hard work. Other political parties also affiliated with communist or socialist ideology also developed such a workforce. Leaders and activists of the communist party played a critical role in the Language Movement and the 1969 uprising. They also participated in the country's Liberation War under CPB-NAP-BSU guerrilla forces. In post-independence Bangladesh, the communists and their allies have gone through a troubled journey. Their role in every democratic movement, especially against the authoritarian regime of Ershad, is well recognised. Their influence on academia and the cultural arena is still significant. Nevertheless, the party failed to reach the mass people and inspire them. That's why the communists and socialists have failed to win in any parliamentary elections so far. The dream of communism shattered globally following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The party leaders in Bangladesh were divided on dissolving the CPB or maintaining the original form. Finally, the Marxist-Leninist group, in 1993, resolved in favour of the independent existence of the CPB. Since then, the communist and socialist ideologies have lost their appeal. The country's two main political parties-- the Bangladesh Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party - also adopt a free-market economy as their core economic policy that encourages private investments and entrepreneurship. Globally, communism is already labelled as a 'failed project', and only five countries are now known as communist countries. These are China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam. To what extent these countries implemented the communist ideology is a big question. Except for the rule of a strict authoritarian regime, which is an essential component of communism, China is a capitalist economy in disguise. Vietnam also adopts a similar path. Laos is also an open economy. Only Cuba and North Korea continue the centralised economic model, which may collapse anytime soon. Nevertheless, communists and socialists in the country still believe that they will be able to overthrow the highly discriminatory socio-economic-political structure. They are correct that the country's economic growth is fuelling income disparity by concentrating resources into a few hands and allowing rent-seeking activities. They have also been continuously raising their voices of protest, no matter how limited and muted they are. The red march with the red flag is still there. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Ragging has recently become a trend in many universities of Bangladesh. However, it is badly affecting our youths. Senior students conduct foolish activities in the name of ragging their juniors. Ragging is getting more and more widespread as not many people are aware of the mental trauma that it can cause. Teachers too are not making any worthwhile efforts to curb this abusive practice. The impunity that university students now enjoy for ragging the freshmen should come to an end. To many, ragging is the worst in Jassore University of Science and Technology (JUST). Stories are doing the rounds on social networking sites with accounts of recent victims of ragging. The extent of abuse is so severe that some students no longer want to return to their classes. However, those who have committed such crimes have been spared of punishment by the university authorities. The abusers were made to apologise to the victims. This is unacceptable as freshmen's safety comes first. There should be no mercy for those who commit crimes in the name of ragging. No doubt, forgiveness is a great virtue. But what happens when after receiving a pardon, criminals celebrate it as a victory for their crime. In many developed countries, ragging is a crime. There must be strict punishment for those who are involved in such activities. Ragging not only affects a person mentally but sometimes it can lead to physical harm. I urge the JUST authorities to bring an end to this ragging culture as soon as possible and take appropriate action against those who are involved in ragging.\nAshikujaman Syed,Research Assistant,Bioinformatics Research Lab,Center for Research Innovation and Development (CRID),[email\u00a0protected]",
