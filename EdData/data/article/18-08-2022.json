Wanting to do good must be matched by knowing the right thing to do in the circumstance, and in the case of children, be guided by child-centric policies. Whether the recent recommendation of a parliamentary panel to bring more abandoned children into the adoption process will fulfil these parameters is an issue that warrants further discussion. A recent report, \u201cReview of Guardianship and Adoption Laws\u201d, by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances and Law and Justice has pointed to the huge mismatch between the number of people wanting to adopt children and the number of children legally available for adoption, and suggested that the way to remedy that would be to ensure that \u201corphan and abandoned children found begging on the streets\u2026 are made available for adoption at the earliest\u201d. To do so, it has suggested periodic district surveys to identify children who are orphaned/abandoned. The report argued that in a country with millions of orphans, only 2,430 children were available for adoption. It is true that there are always more people wanting to adopt children than the number of children actually available for adoption; it has been so historically, but the increasing chasm, as the report indicates, will undoubtedly have to be addressed. According to the report, there were 27,939 prospective parents registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) as on December 2021, from nearly 18,000 in 2017. There were 6,996 orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children residing in childcare institutions considered adoptable, but only 2,430 were declared legally free for adoption by Child Welfare Committees. It claimed that the waiting time for adoption had increased to three years from one year, in the past five years. The total number of children adopted in 2021-22 was only 3,175.But the process of adoption in the country was tightened \u2014 procedurally and legally \u2014 in response to rampant malpractices and inter-country adoption rackets. CARA was installed as the nodal body for in-country and inter-country adoptions, to monitor and regulate the process, ensuring through stringent rules that the adoption is in the best interests of the child, and no illegality is involved. While the parliamentary committee has interpreted that there is automatic happiness when a child in an institution is placed in a home, it is important to exercise caution. No doubt, the country should take care of its children orphaned due to circumstances, but even as it acknowledges that institutionalisation may be detrimental over the long term, it should pay equal attention to the finer aspects of child care, and allow itself to be guided by a child-centric philosophy. There are no shortcuts in ensuring orphaned children come to no harm.",

The collective euphoria over the nation\u2019s fine performance at the Commonwealth Games was yet to fully die down when FIFA, late on Monday, wielded the sledgehammer citing \u201cundue interference by a third party\u201d. The third party in question was the Supreme Court of India-nominated Committee of Administrators (CoA), formed in May to temporarily assume charge of AIFF and finalise a new constitution after the previous executive committee was deemed to have overstayed its tenure. The bone of contention was CoA\u2019s decision to give players 50% representation \u2014 with voting rights \u2014 in the new AIFF Executive Committee, on a par with State associations. FIFA\u2019s recommendation was 25% and it duly suspended AIFF, much to the chagrin of the CoA, which on Tuesday said that a middle ground was close to being found. The Court has now tasked the Union Government to engage with FIFA to break the logjam so that India does not suffer the ignominy of losing the hosting rights to the U-17 Women\u2019s World Cup in October. In addition, India\u2019s international friendlies, participation of its clubs in international competitions \u2014 Gokulam Kerala FC in the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship and ATK Mohun Bagan in the AFC Cup \u2014 and developmental funds from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation are all under threat.It may be argued that the CoA was overzealous in what prima facie appeared a good-faith attempt to make players equal stakeholders in AIFF. But what is undeniable is the role of the erstwhile AIFF establishment, led by president Praful Patel, in triggering the crisis by holding on to power well past the 12-year tenure sanctioned by the National Sports Development Code of India, 2011. Violation of norms concerning membership, age-limits and tenures as prescribed in the Sports Code is rampant in Indian sports; table tennis, hockey and judo have all been placed under court-appointed administrators in 2022. On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court brought the Indian Olympic Association under a CoA, relying on the Supreme Court order in the AIFF matter. If one has to knock on the doors of the higher judiciary to enforce a government-mandated code adopted for the overall benefit and health of the sport, it points to a sorry state of affairs. At a time when India is diversifying its sporting culture and producing newer champions, it can ill-afford administrators who bring the very game they claim to be custodians of into disrepute.",

The Supreme Court asked the Centre yesterday to ensure India doesn\u2019t lose the right to host the U-17 Women\u2019s World Cup in October. Hopefully, a solution will be found \u2013 otherwise an even bigger embarrassment awaits Indian sports management. The suspension has already put Indian football in a limbo with teams like Gokulam Kerala FC, which had travelled to Uzbekistan for the AFC Women\u2019s Club Championship, being effectively grounded.\nBut the crisis with AIFF is symptomatic of a deeper malaise that plagues sports administration in India. Like the football body, both Hockey India \u2013 which could lose hosting rights to the men\u2019s World Cup next year \u2013 and the Indian Olympic Association may also be looking at a similar fate. The common thread among the three is that their management has been taken over by court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) due to various violations of the Sports Code. The CoAs were in turn supposed to restructure the management of these bodies and reform their leadership. However, the international parent bodies of these sport federations see such top-down reforms as third-party interference, which is against their respective charters.\nThus, sports governance in India is caught in a jam. Most heads of sports bodies, whether politicians or otherwise, have little incentive to follow the Sports Code, which puts restrictions on the age and tenure of office bearers. This reluctance is in part because of the system of patronage that sports administrators enjoy. Many politicians therefore find it a natural second career. The larger problem is that India lacks the ecosystem that produces enough administrators who love and respect the sport they want to administer and therefore will respect the Sports Code. However, since the creation of such an ecosystem is far tougher than winning an Olympic gold, stakeholders including the sports ministry must work towards a system where federations voluntarily adopt the Code. Participation of our sportspersons in global events is at risk. We can\u2019t hope to better our Olympic record in Paris with sports federations losing global legitimacy.\n\n",

True, this May the Supreme Court had ruled, without going into the merits of the case, that the Gujarat government must decide on the convicts\u2019 freedom based on a 1992 policy that allowed remission for those who served 14 clear years of their life term. But this made it a matter of discretion for the state, and there were enough grounds for it to apply the discretion the other way.\nFirst, there\u2019s an SC verdict, Laxman Naskar vs Union of India, in which the court ruled that the state must determine \u201cwhether the offence is an individual act of crime without affecting the society at large\u201d before granting remission. Surely, the horrific nature of the crime and the tragic context \u2013 14 people including several women and Bilkis\u2019s daughter were massacred and a pregnant Bilkis herself was subjected to gangrape during the 2002 Gujarat riots \u2013 made the Naskar judgment relevant here? Second, in June, Union home ministry guidelines on remission clearly stated that life convicts and rapists were not to be granted special remission.\nThe Naskar judgment and the MHA guidelines should have provided more than enough ground for the Gujarat government to keep the 11 lifers in jail. That it chose to do otherwise seems even more of a blow to natural justice given what Bilkis Bano had gone through after her trauma. There were attempts to destroy evidence in the case, for which doctors and police officials were convicted. The trial had to be shifted to Mumbai to allow Bilkis to depose safely. In 2019 SC had belatedly granted her Rs 50 lakh compensation, recognising the injustice dealt to her at various stages of her long ordeal. The question of judicial review of the Gujarat government\u2019s decision is complicated by SC granting discretion to the state. But that such a review would be ideal is not in the slightest doubt.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Fifty-one years ago, Bangladesh was founded on many noble principles such as nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism. Without oversimplifying, to a large extent, the truth remains that the 1971 revolution and the plight of the Mukti Bahini were rooted in anger against a very real threat to democracies around the world: Unfair elections.\u00a0\nIn December of 1970, the Awami League won an absolute majority of the seats in the constituents' assembly elections. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's party won 167 of the 169 seats assigned to East Pakistan in the National Assembly; this gave the AL an overall majority in a chamber of 313 members. Sheikh Mujib and the AL party had the constitutional right to form a government and, if all was fair, Sheikh Mujib would have served as prime minister for the entirety of Pakistan. This would then have allowed the AL to implement its six-point programme, meant to provide a constitution that would be fair to both wings of Pakistan.\nBut Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party, refused to allow Sheikh Mujib to become the PM, instead proposing that Pakistan should have two prime ministers, one for each wing. This incident triggered Bangladesh's War of Liberation. Looking back, it should also have set precedence for the people's right to elect its candidate and its leaders' right to be elected.\u00a0\nBangladesh as a nation was founded on a key principle of fair democracy. Five decades ago, an independent country was built on the belief that elections are a reflection of the people's desires. When the people were not heard, the people revolted. Because after all, what is a democracy, if not a reflection of the people's wants? This brings one to question what our politics look like today and this history should be a reminder that politicians serve us, not the other way around. Politicians should always be a reflection of the people's choice.\nToday, because elections are a preplanned ordeal and political campaigns are almost non-existent, politicians rarely interact with the common people \u2013 largely because they don't have to. Complex democracies require politicians to interact, to be well-liked, propose new policies, garner the most votes and, most importantly, be held responsible by the people. But at times, Bangladeshi politics, from the outside, looks like a chess game being played by the ultra-rich, and it's time for a change.\u00a0\nFor much of Bangladesh's history, election tampering has taken place. The first general election took place in 1973, and as one foreign journalist wrote, \"Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would have won handsomely even if the election had been conducted by the United Nations and supervised by the Red Cross.\" Despite this truth, the legitimacy of the electoral mandate has been compromised by a handful of AL workers who \"resorted to strong-arm methods, and false ballots in their desire to win all of the seats of government.\"\u00a0\nThe issue this country faces is not a lack of active political participation; people want to vote. There are millions of young people that are ready to use the political process to see their country grow and develop in a better direction. The issue is that voter registration is difficult and elections are determined by party leadership before an election even takes place.\u00a0\nAs we approach the next general election, it is worth asking ourselves: In a country that was born in response to an unfair election, why is it so hard to conduct a fair one?\u00a0\nAlifa Chowdhury is an undergraduate student studying Political Science and South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA.\n\nThe above article does not endorse any particular political party.

        "full_article": "For several reasons, the recently conducted Population and Housing Census 2022 of Bangladesh was of interest to people in different sectors, especially the policymakers and researchers. This is primarily because census data can be a crucial source of information not only for academic research, but also for effective policymaking. Besides this, due to the change of population structure over time, there is growing attention towards the transition of demographic profile, which can be better understood through the information gathered in censuses.\nWe already know that Bangladesh is going through a demographic transition, under which there has been a gradual shift from a high mortality and high fertility scenario to a low mortality and low fertility one, resulting in a slowing down of population growth and an increase in the proportion of people within the age range of 15-64 years. This change in demographic profile has also been reflected in the recent census data: according to the 2022 census, the proportion of the working-age population is 65.53 percent, which was 60.62 percent in the 2011 census. The dependency ratio, which is the ratio of working-age population (15-64) to the dependent population (0-14 years and 65 year and above) has declined considerably from 73.00 in 2011 to 52.64 in 2022. This demographic shift can have important implications on the economy, as this working-age population, through effective investment in human capital development, can be translated into a productive labour force. Through higher savings and greater investment in growth-enhancing activities, this labour force can eventually lead the country towards a higher growth trajectory.\nHowever, we must also keep in mind that, for Bangladesh, this window of demographic opportunity will close around 2040, therefore the policy focus must be on investing in the youth population and creating employment opportunities for them. In this context, it is worth noting that, in terms of the \"quality\" of our youth, as high as 8.79 percent within the age range of 15-29 years have no formal education, and only 5.9 percent have tertiary education (Labour Force Survey 2016-17).\nAccording to the preliminary results of the census, among those above seven years of age, around two-thirds (74.66 percent) have basic literacy. Though this figure shows significant progress over time (the literacy rate was found to be 51.77 percent in the 2011 census), it reflects our inability to effectively reap the fruits of demographic transition. The census data, however, reveals an optimistic scenario in terms of expansion and usage of technology of the population: 72.31 percent of adults (86.72 percent male and 58.83 percent female) were found to use mobile phone devices, and 37.01 percent were found to use the internet in recent times (46.53 percent male and 28.09 percent female). Despite the gendered segregation of such usage, this reflects a positive scenario in terms of skills development of the population. Nevertheless, we must keep in mind that technology usage does not guarantee possession of technical devices, nor does it confirm access to knowledge for skills development.\nIn addition to ensuring the quality of the working-age population, one crucial condition for exploiting the opportunities of positive demographic transition is the ability to utilise the youth population for the country's development while creating suitable employment opportunities. In this context, with the low level of private investment and slow pace of industrialisation, the capacity to create jobs is rather limited (employment elasticity of growth for 2013-2017 was around 0.17, with a declining trend over time). It's also worth mentioning that it's not only the quality of the working-age population or a lack of employment opportunities, but also the mismatch between demand and supply sides that leaves a gap in the effective utilisation of a favourable demographic profile.\nAn important as well as interesting finding of the 2022 census was that the sex ratio declined to 98.00, with 50 percent of the total population being female. As for the youth population, as high as 16.76 percent of females were found to be within the range of 15-24 years (24.67 percent within 15-29 years), where the corresponding percentages for males were 14.77 percent (21.23 percent within 15-29 years). With female labour force participation in Bangladesh being only 36.3 percent (male participation rate being 80.5 percent), the challenge of reaping the benefits of demographic transition hinges partially on investing in the development of human capital of female youth through education and training. However, gender-centric norms prevailing in society remain the real challenge for the female youth, which prevents and discourages women to acquire skills and education, and particularly to engage in the mainstream labour market. As a consequence, or at least partly so, as high as 49 percent of females aged 15-29 years were found not to be in education, training or employment, reflecting a loss of potential youth workforce and an inability to reap the benefits of demographic transition.\nBased on the preliminary findings of the latest census, and comparing its findings with the previous census, it can be inferred that, though there has been a gradual transformation of our demographic structure in favour of a young labour force, due to impediments on both supply and demand sides, we might partially miss this opportunity. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to prioritise the needs of the youth population in both national planning and allocation processes. In this regard, the importance of investing in skills development and education while focusing more on the quality of education cannot be emphasised more. With the increased automation of industries and the importance of 4IR-related technologies, greater concentration is needed in updating the existing curricula of training programmes, providing skills training for the trainers, introducing internationally acceptable certifications, introducing 4IR-related sophisticated skills in education and training, and, more importantly, dealing with the challenges of skill mismatch. Besides this, to reorient education programmes catering to the necessities of the labour market, increased emphasis is needed on training programmes involving cognitive and interpersonal skills.\nThe Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) programmes must be at the core of the strategies concerning the youth labour force. In this context, it is extremely crucial to deal with the social stigma attached with TVET programmes, and a greater incentive is needed for this. In addition to the policy initiatives to prepare our labour force to meet growing needs, it is crucial to stimulate private sector investment, as well as to provide monetary and non-monetary incentives, like low-interest credit, information facilities, tax rebate, etc to small-scale entrepreneurs.\nTo remove the bottlenecks in boosting female employment, the prime focus must be given towards dealing with certain inherent constraints like child marriage, and safety and security in the public sphere, along with policy interventions to deal with the challenges related to gender-centric norms. In relation to the latter, innovative policies like linking the financial incentives (e.g. tax rebate and exemptions, subsidies) to gender-sensitive strategies such as daycare centres at workplaces, child care vouchers, flexible working hours as part of post-maternity employment, etc can be considered.\n\u00a0\nDr Sayema Haque Bidisha\u00a0is a professor at the Department of Economics of Dhaka University.\n\n",

Six bodies were recovered by fire officials. Employees of a hotel on the ground floor, the deceased were sleeping in a break room after having worked all night. Only one person has been identified. The nature of their injuries mean the other five cannot be recognised, even by their own families.\nCan we continue to call these accidents? A cursory look through the last few months' news makes it clear that it was only a matter of time that people would end up being killed. And these are only the fires in plastic factories. There have been many more incidents of other factory fires, such as in a garment factory in Gazipur in early June, and a printing and packaging factory in Narayanganj in early July. The running theme is a complete lack of safety standards in workplaces that puts lives in danger, and total apathy from the relevant authorities, including the government, in bringing about change.\nThe fact that this most recent fire occurred in Chawkbazar raises a number of red flags. We all remember the deadly fire that originated from a chemical warehouse in Chawkbazar on February 20, 2019, killing 67 people on the spot. It is impossible to forget the images of distraught family members lining up to hear about their loved ones, many of whom could only be identified through DNA evidence. At the time, our reporters found that in 2017, Dhaka South City Corporation fined several chemical and plastic warehouse owners for not moving out of the area, yet they continued to operate there. Again, in 2019, a task force was formed to eject the factories from this congested part of Old Dhaka. Yet here we are again, reading about more deaths from factory fires.\nTo only add to the horror, our reporters also found that nine female workers were locked inside a plastic godown opposite this most recent blaze. This was done by the owner to ensure that nothing was stolen, although he \"reassured\" the workers that if the fire came too close, they would be let out. We are reminded of how this same line of thought meant that when the Hashem food factory caught on fire in July last year, 49 workers, many of them minors, burnt to death because the only exit was locked.\nWe can talk about criminal liability. We can ask for justice, or at least for compensation. We can talk about safety standards, and about probe committees and task forces that ultimately do nothing. But today, the only question we want to ask the government is, why do the lives of our underprivileged workers have so little value in this country?\n",

        "full_article": "It is an alarming revelation that about 1.7 crore women, aged 15-49 years, suffer from nutrition deficiency in the country. A recent study points out that, despite the gains made over the past decade as far as women's empowerment is concerned, women and girls' nutritional status is yet to improve.\nMalnourishment in women of reproductive age groups has been a persistent problem in Bangladesh, which has its roots in the patriarchal family structure. In an overwhelming majority of families, particularly in the villages, a boy child receives preferential treatment, including the tastiest and most nutritious food, while the girl must make do with the leftovers. As she grows older, she learns to repress her own needs, being the last to eat after everyone else has been fed. Traditionally, malnourished girls as young as 12-14 are forced into marriage by their parents. These victims of child marriage in turn give birth to babies with low birth weight (LBW) who suffer from various illnesses since birth. Thus, the cycle continues.\nThe study also highlights another condition affecting an increasing number of women: Obesity. The proportion of overweight women has increased from 12 percent to 32 percent over the last decade, and it is estimated that if the trend persists, about 46 percent of married women of reproductive age will be overweight by 2030. However, this new phenomenon, which is equally affecting mothers and children and thereby creating an \"inter-generational challenge\", is yet be addressed by the country's maternal and child health programmes and policies.\nPublic health experts appear to be handling a double-edged sword at the moment. Women with nutritional deficiency are less immune and thus more prone to suffer from different infectious diseases, while obese women are at higher risk to develop non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and cancers. Effects of malnutrition are further devastating for women because it not only affects their own health but also increase the risk factors for infant survival, growth, and overall development.\nWhat is particularly challenging for public health experts is that they must undertake different strategies to address undernutrition and overnutrition, as interventions for one may exacerbate the other. To address undernutrition, we need to raise awareness within families about its devastating impacts, ensure low-cost food options for low-income households, and ensure nutrition-related support at healthcare facilities, among other interventions. To address obesity, we need to promote healthy lifestyles, regulate marketing of packaged foods and beverages and provide healthy meal options at schools and workplaces.\n",

Six bodies were recovered by fire officials. Employees of a hotel on the ground floor, the deceased were sleeping in a break room after having worked all night. Only one person has been identified. The nature of their injuries mean the other five cannot be recognised, even by their own families.\nCan we continue to call these accidents? A cursory look through the last few months' news makes it clear that it was only a matter of time that people would end up being killed. And these are only the fires in plastic factories. There have been many more incidents of other factory fires, such as in a garment factory in Gazipur in early June, and a printing and packaging factory in Narayanganj in early July. The running theme is a complete lack of safety standards in workplaces that puts lives in danger, and total apathy from the relevant authorities, including the government, in bringing about change.\nThe fact that this most recent fire occurred in Chawkbazar raises a number of red flags. We all remember the deadly fire that originated from a chemical warehouse in Chawkbazar on February 20, 2019, killing 67 people on the spot. It is impossible to forget the images of distraught family members lining up to hear about their loved ones, many of whom could only be identified through DNA evidence. At the time, our reporters found that in 2017, Dhaka South City Corporation fined several chemical and plastic warehouse owners for not moving out of the area, yet they continued to operate there. Again, in 2019, a task force was formed to eject the factories from this congested part of Old Dhaka. Yet here we are again, reading about more deaths from factory fires.\nTo only add to the horror, our reporters also found that nine female workers were locked inside a plastic godown opposite this most recent blaze. This was done by the owner to ensure that nothing was stolen, although he \"reassured\" the workers that if the fire came too close, they would be let out. We are reminded of how this same line of thought meant that when the Hashem food factory caught on fire in July last year, 49 workers, many of them minors, burnt to death because the only exit was locked.\nWe can talk about criminal liability. We can ask for justice, or at least for compensation. We can talk about safety standards, and about probe committees and task forces that ultimately do nothing. But today, the only question we want to ask the government is, why do the lives of our underprivileged workers have so little value in this country?\n",

        "full_article": "It is an alarming revelation that about 1.7 crore women, aged 15-49 years, suffer from nutrition deficiency in the country. A recent study points out that, despite the gains made over the past decade as far as women's empowerment is concerned, women and girls' nutritional status is yet to improve.\nMalnourishment in women of reproductive age groups has been a persistent problem in Bangladesh, which has its roots in the patriarchal family structure. In an overwhelming majority of families, particularly in the villages, a boy child receives preferential treatment, including the tastiest and most nutritious food, while the girl must make do with the leftovers. As she grows older, she learns to repress her own needs, being the last to eat after everyone else has been fed. Traditionally, malnourished girls as young as 12-14 are forced into marriage by their parents. These victims of child marriage in turn give birth to babies with low birth weight (LBW) who suffer from various illnesses since birth. Thus, the cycle continues.\nThe study also highlights another condition affecting an increasing number of women: Obesity. The proportion of overweight women has increased from 12 percent to 32 percent over the last decade, and it is estimated that if the trend persists, about 46 percent of married women of reproductive age will be overweight by 2030. However, this new phenomenon, which is equally affecting mothers and children and thereby creating an \"inter-generational challenge\", is yet be addressed by the country's maternal and child health programmes and policies.\nPublic health experts appear to be handling a double-edged sword at the moment. Women with nutritional deficiency are less immune and thus more prone to suffer from different infectious diseases, while obese women are at higher risk to develop non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and cancers. Effects of malnutrition are further devastating for women because it not only affects their own health but also increase the risk factors for infant survival, growth, and overall development.\nWhat is particularly challenging for public health experts is that they must undertake different strategies to address undernutrition and overnutrition, as interventions for one may exacerbate the other. To address undernutrition, we need to raise awareness within families about its devastating impacts, ensure low-cost food options for low-income households, and ensure nutrition-related support at healthcare facilities, among other interventions. To address obesity, we need to promote healthy lifestyles, regulate marketing of packaged foods and beverages and provide healthy meal options at schools and workplaces.\n",

        "full_article": "At a time energy crunch has prompted countries, including developed ones, across the planet to either go for austerity in electricity use or reverting to coal-based power production, Bangladesh can count itself fortunate for having an alternative option. The option, moreover, is for a cleaner energy in the shape of natural gas. That the country has not done justice to this precious resource is partly because of its initial myopic or arcane policies and the attendant corruption and also partly because of a lack of required expertise and technology. Foreign companies took advantage of this and got away with even after incompetent handling of gas exploration and extraction leading to massive blowouts in gas fields, courtesy of leeway in agreements. Bangladesh has not proved it is a good bargainer when exploration of gas and sharing it are concerned. It is exactly against such a backdrop, any proposal submitted by foreign companies either for exploration of gas reserve or development of gas fields not yielding enough volume of an economy of scale is placed for consideration, many keep their fingers crossed. The fact is that the Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company (BAPEX) Ltd has by now achieved appreciable capacity for exploration of gas but it runs short of sophisticated machines and cutting-edge technological support both for exploration of gas, particularly the off-shore stock, and development of on-shore wells. Now that the economy is under stress on account of rising costs of imported fuels, there is a reinforced incumbency on the country to fall back upon its own available sources of energy. Experts find the origin of the malaise in the long neglect the domestic energy base has suffered due to wrong policy of overdependence on imported fuel oils and liquefied natural gas (LNG) along with maintenance of prolonged contracts with rental and quick rental power plants. Now Chevron, a US energy giant, producing the bulk of Bangladesh's current gas output, has placed a proposal for exploration of two on-shore gas fields and part of another gas field. It has, however shown its interest in doing so under an 'unsolicited' agreement. This is to avoid the long process of tendering as part of a quick response to the outsize energy emergency. The company that produces 61.52 per cent of natural gas right now certainly qualifies for the job. But the problem is that Chevron has not made its intention clear as to how it would like to do this: either under a profit-sharing contract (PSC) or under a joint venture (JV) with the BAPEX. In fact, the proposal is welcome if, of course, the agreements are reached to ensure fair shares and mutual benefits. The post-Covid energy crisis should teach the country a lesson. It is that decades of gains can be negated if domestic energy sources ---preferably the renewable, given the devastating impacts of climate change all across the globe ---are not tapped and developed adequately. Funds wasted on useless power generation projects or plants could have been used for developing the country's energy base. In time of crisis, a host country loses its bargaining power further. But multinational firms or companies treated as development partners with long-term stakes and interests can be convinced of the merit of ethical business practice. The need is to look beyond immediate business.",

        "full_article": "Human ingenuity has caused wonders throughout the long --- and lengthening --- course of civilization. An instance of it is the incredible journey of the James Webb Space Telescope into a discovery of the beginnings of time and space. And yet as we imagine the moment of Creation, the joy which religions have constantly upheld through the ages, we cannot but reflect on the gigantic damage people have done to Earth. It is the only planet we call home. And home has been under assault because of the predatory instincts which have consistently guided us. We have wounded Earth beyond measure.Imagine this situation. Ah, but there is little to be imagined here, for it is the rude reality in our times. In certain areas of the United Kingdom, the government has officially announced a drought in regions that have been going through the intense heat wave of the past many weeks. Lakes have shrunk, the water level has gone down, the green grass is burnt out and crop fields have begun to resemble the desolation we have generally associated with the planet Mars.Of course, we keep speaking of carbon emissions, of summits like COP-26 --- and COP-27 is on the way --- of what global leaders need to do to ensure that civilization survives by rolling back the damage that has already been caused to the climate. Forests have vanished, a reality we experience in our very own Bangladesh. And if you take a look at Brazil, where someone like Jair Bolsonaro has held sway as President, the picture gets more depressing. In the Amazon, trees have been cut down with impunity, on the watch of a government which brazenly ignores climate change as it has ignored the terrible malady known as the coronavirus.And that is but one small example of the human condition degenerating to human predatory behaviour in undermining the very place we call home --- this planet we inhabit. There are few people around us who can emulate the late Wangari Maathai, the Kenyan politician whose Nobel Prize for Peace came on the back of her achievement in planting thousands of trees in her country. The desperation we feel, all around the globe, of a whole world moving rather inexorably toward self-destruction, is palpable. You tend to ask yourself: How is it that when Earth's resources were being exploited, especially in the aftermath of the industrial revolution in the West, no one ever imagined that there would come a time when we would be up against the danger we now confront?The ice on the mountains --- and we speak of mountains all around --- has been melting at a rate that frightens us. Now consider this: the way in which we have struck down nature, have squeezed every ounce of energy from within the core of the planet, has now translated into this new threat of ice caps melting, of icebergs sinking to the bottom of the sea. Volcanoes, some of them long dormant, have exploded in fury, carrying homes and lives in their heat. When mountains go through a depletion of ice and snow, the same we have traditionally celebrated down the generations, it is the next worry which assails us. The rivers that owe their origins to that natural bounty on the mountain-tops will in course of time run dry.When a river loses its way or ceases to exist, it is human civilization which is threatened with extinction. Could similar circumstances not have been the cause behind the end of life, assuming life was ever there on the planets in our neighbourhood, those in the solar system we study all the time? Observe Bangladesh again. A land historically known for the charming ubiquity of its rivers, it is now faced with the dire possibility of a goodly number of those rivers simply running out of life. Indeed, there are places in the country where bridges once built across rivers to facilitate people's movements are now a stark image of the rivers having gone dry, of people simply walking across the beds of rivers that once were, of bridges that remain a mockery of human folly. Besides, the unbridled commandeering of rivers by unscrupulous elements continues to threaten the future of other rivers in the country. And if climate change is not reversed, it our coastal regions that could be swallowed by the Bay of Bengal.The damage we have done to the climate shines in dark brilliance in the floods which have ravaged South Korea, in the forest fires which have repeatedly engulfed the legendary woodlands of California. In these past many weeks, the flames that have leapt out of forests in France and Spain and Italy and Greece are a back-handed tribute to ourselves for the contributions we have made in the exploitation of the planet's resources. Factories go on emitting smoke. Those countries which have been the biggest contributors to the making of the climate crisis pretend that the malady is the responsibility of all nations. The ravaging of nature has not been the work of the world's underdeveloped societies and yet now we are all condemned to dealing with a situation where every nation needs to pitch in with help in rolling back the tide of destruction. Can we do it? A simple question, but one the answer to which could end up being ambivalent.It is all so very unfair, but then again, we cannot go on arguing back and forth over which nations have given us a world which we could lose sooner than we know it. In such traditionally cold regions as Pakistan's Balochistan province, the degree of snowfall which once defined it is no more there. Snowfalls are as good as being a tale of the past. But observe how in the past week torrential rains in Balochistan have caused unprecedented floods in the province and claimed the lives of no fewer than 130 people. Homes were simply washed away.The Glasgow Climate Pact set out four objectives on the implementation of which the future of the planet rests. A net-zero target to be achieved by the middle of the century and ensuring that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degree Celsius, adaptation toward protecting communities and natural habitats and coughing up the finance needed for the job are all there.Are these goals good enough? Rainforests are vanishing, animal populations are in steep decline, fishes are hardly in adequate supply any more. We are scrambling to stave off disaster. What if disaster gets the better of us?

        "full_article": "When Imran Khan was in power, the economy of Pakistan faced the biggest shock. The rampaging Covid-19 pandemic across the world sent its economic growth into the negative territory. As soon as the pandemic subsided, the economy started to recover. The growth rate recovered from -0.47 per cent in 2020 to 3.94 per cent in 2021. In 2022 the growth rate was set to exceed the 6.0 per cent mark. Then came the Russia-Ukraine war, another shock for the global economy. The global oil market started to boil. Once at the freezing point, the oil price rose as high as US$ 80 per barrel. But Prime Minister Imran Khan chose to move ahead without rocking the growth boat. He made no price adjustment in the domestic market, kept the subsidies unaffected. He was battling a far higher growth in import payments and an inflation rate of nearly 13 per cent.The opposition political camp brought an allegation of economic mismanagement against him. Without elaborating how they will correct the course, they brought the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan in the National Assembly. Imran Khan warned that it would be the economy that would be the worst sufferer. The opposition did not heed what he said. Finally, Imran Khan lost the vote and the government led by Shehbaz Sharif took over.As soon as they came to power, they started rocking the boat instead of steadying it. The axe fell on subsidies. In June last they raised the fuel oil prices to secure IMF funding as the forex reserve was depleting fast. That hit power generation and some factories reportedly closed. The inflation rate soared to around 23 per cent. To cut the current account deficit, they started tightening their grip on imports. Resultantly, the economic growth in the full fiscal year of 2021-22 slowed to 5.97 per cent.In July last they raised electricity prices despite rampant inflation to cut the gap with power generation costs. In the month the import costs were reduced by nearly US$ 2.0 billion. If the US$ 2.0 billion accounts for luxury goods, there remains no problem with the import cut. But if imports of raw materials or capital machinery are cut, that remains a cause of concern. Already the budget for the fiscal year 2022-23 targets a slower growth rate of 5.0 per cent. Now all eyes are riveted on how the incumbent government steers the boat in the turbulent waters in the days ahead. [email\u00a0protected]",

The tragedy occurred exactly a month after a worker was killed by a falling crane in the Gazipur part of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Another girder of the BRT under-construction project collapsed near the Dhaka airport in March 2021. The recurrence of such accidents has raised the question of public safety among the agencies implementing the projects. Such accidents look like nothing but a sheer negligence of the contracting organisation. Why didn't the construction authorities take the vehicles off the road while installing heavy things like girder? The construction of flyovers and elevated expressways is important. But for the authorities, more important is to ensure taking enough precautions so that not a single person is harmed. There should be no movement of vehicles or people at such places where risky work is going on. The workers involved in the construction work should also be ensured the highest type of safety and security. If we do not take measures now, there is every possibility of such accidents taking place again and again in the future. Those who are responsible for such an accident should be brought to book. And the bereaved family should be compensated for loss they suffered at the earliest. What we want now is just a guarantee of normal death. AB Siddik, Pirganj, Rangpur",
