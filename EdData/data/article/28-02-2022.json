The Russian veto of resolution 8979 was a predetermined outcome: as a permanent UNSC member, Russia has vetoed UNSC resolutions earlier that were critical of its decision to send troops into Georgia (2008), and Crimea (2014), and could hardly have done otherwise. What was perhaps more disappointing for the western coalition was that it was unable to move India from its consistent position of abstention. China shifted from its support for Russia in the previous vote to abstention after the U.S. and Albania, the two \u201cpenholders\u201d of the resolution, agreed to drop the reference to Chapter VII (the authorisation of the use of force against Russian troops). The coalition against Russia is making a political statement at the UN, but not setting much store on the global body\u2019s effectiveness. Instead, the U.S. and the EU have adopted unilateral sanctions which they hope will cripple Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to sustain a longer assault on Ukraine, and also excised the Russian economy from the international SWIFT transaction system. In addition, the U.S., Germany and other countries have announced weapon supplies for Ukrainian forces. However, in the absence of direct air power assistance and foreign troops, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to change the balance of power in the equation with Russia easily. India\u2019s abstention from the UNSC resolution too was perhaps a foregone conclusion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decision to take a call from Mr. Putin before the vote indicated that India would not take any stand against Russia. Apart from the India-Russia defence and strategic partnership, Russia is India\u2019s most trusted P-5 ally when it comes to blocking intrusive resolutions on Kashmir. In contrast, Mr. Modi only accepted the call from the Ukrainian President after the vote, and rather than offering support, requested assistance for the safe exit of Indian students. While India\u2019s hesitation to take a stand against Russia is understood, New Delhi must now consider whether its aspirations to be a \u201cleading power\u201d can be achieved without having a clear position on a conflict that threatens global security, even as the Modi government focuses solely on the well-being of Indians amidst the peril faced by others. This will be especially true if the Russian military operation in Ukraine is prolonged, and the Government\u2019s ambivalence is read as active support for aggressive transgressions by a more powerful neighbour over a weaker one, something India has protested in its own neighbourhood.",

        "full_article": "The war in Ukraine has brought to the fore the plight of Indian students, many of them pursuing medicine. Amidst the turmoil, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a webinar on the Union Budget announcements on the health sector, stated that many young Indians were going to \u201csmall countries of the world for medical education\u201d and, therefore, the private sector should be encouraged, along with cooperation from States, to set up more medical colleges and hospitals locally so that such aspirants remain in India. His remarks are well-meaning, but the dynamics of India\u2019s medical education system are complex. The most sought-after international destinations \u2014 traditionally, for medical education the U.S., the U.K. and a few west European countries \u2014 are, however, too expensive for most Indians. In the last few decades, Russia, China (countries larger than India) and Ukraine (one of Europe\u2019s largest countries), with their historical commitment to public health care have been able to offer more affordable, yet quality, education. India\u2019s huge population still continues to be predominantly rural, but most of the trained medical doctors, paramedics and nurses gravitate towards cities for well-known reasons. The very nature of medical education, an empirical field, requires significant infrastructure \u2014 land, equipment, and trained faculty at the post graduate level \u2014 all of which are in short supply and uneven in their spread. Without correcting these deficiencies, India cannot expect to dramatically increase the availability of medical personnel. The Government needs to make health care the centrepiece of its economic rebuilding.The anaemic spending on health is not unique to this government; for several years, India\u2019s spend on health care has consistently trailed several countries comparable to its size which is why there is barely one doctor for every 1,000 Indians and specialists often a tenth of what is required. These shortcomings have lubricated the phenomenon of young Indians seeking affordable, quality, health-care education in other countries. But merely having private establishments start medical schools, without a long-term commitment to offer necessary training and post-graduate education, could lead to a repeat of the engineering fiasco after the dotcom boom: a surfeit of engineering colleges without adequately trained faculty or infrastructure that churn out students who need a further skills upgrade to be employable. The Government must instead ease procedures for establishing medical colleges, spend more on infrastructure, and provide incentives for a health-care ecosystem to develop in rural areas. While not a quick-fix, over time this could facilitate the growth of private and public medical colleges that could stem the outflow of students aspiring to be doctors. Private investment in medical education by itself will nowhere be enough.",

        "full_article": "The recent announcement by the government to introduce a universal pension scheme (UPS) in Bangladesh from the 2022-23 fiscal year is a welcome and timely move. The ruling party committed to the scheme during the 2008 general elections, and it has been planning to introduce it since FY2017-18. The aspiration to provide support to the country's senior citizens is featured prominently in various government documents. The seventh and eighth Five-Year Plans have both outlined the need for UPS. The 2015 National Social Security Strategy (NSSS), too, talks about social safety for all.\nThe need for a UPS is felt particularly because the average life expectancy in Bangladesh has increased\u2014currently, it's 73 years. While this increased longevity, in a way, indicates our better socio-economic situation, the absence of any old-age support mechanism puts our senior citizens in a vulnerable position. The average age of the Bangladeshi population is only about 26 years, indicating the prospect of a useful demographic dividend. But the size of our ageing population is also increasing. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), old people will make up 20 percent of our total population by 2031, compared to 11 percent in 2017. Except for the public sector, there is no opportunity for pension in Bangladesh. There is the option of provident fund and gratuity in some organisations in the private sector and autonomous bodies. Meanwhile, the government provides old age allowance under its social safety net programme. But about 40 percent of the population currently don't have any pension.\nTherefore, this initiative to provide security during old age through the UPS could bring relief to many people. However, it all depends on how the scheme is implemented. A number of issues will have to be taken into account and several preparatory activities undertaken to successfully implement the scheme.\nFirst, in the face of increased government expenditure and a very limited fiscal space due to extremely low revenue collection effort, implementing the UPS will be a challenging task. The government is already facing difficulty in continuing several infrastructure projects, whose costs are rising manifold from their originally estimated costs. The finance minister is expected to spell out where the government's contribution to the scheme would come from.\nSecond, the issue of accountability and good governance is at the forefront as the proposed UPS is discussed, since there are instances of poor governance and misappropriation of resources whenever a large amount of money is involved. This is not uncommon even in the case of social safety net programmes. The government has several such programmes that provide direct cash support to the poor and old people. However, studies and reports have found many incidents of mistargeting and rent-seeking from those allowances. Many of the poor remain excluded from the beneficiary lists, while many others who are financially better off manage to be included in the list through bribing.\nThird, the institutional and legal framework of the UPS will have to be designed with specific terms of reference for the authority of the pension scheme. The government has prepared a strategy paper on the proposed UPS, and will also prepare the legal and regulatory framework to operationalise it. It also plans to have a separate authority to implement the UPS. Issues such as responsibility and modality of work of the pension authority will be crucial to the scheme's smooth operation. The authority has to ensure good quality of services to the UPS beneficiaries.\nFourth, proper management of this fund will be crucial. In many developed countries, banks manage pension funds by investing in profitable ventures. Sadly, Bangladesh's banking sector suffers from various governance-related challenges. This sector should prepare adequately to manage the UPS fund, doing which will require institutional reform to put an accountable system in place. Investment decisions must be made in a way that will generate higher income and ensure smooth transfer of people's income after their retirement.\nExamples of good practices may be a guide for us in implementing the UPS. The underlying factor behind effective pension schemes in other countries is the efficient management of such funds backed by a strong legal framework. The governments in those countries are investing the funds to earn profits, and using a part of the fund to cover the operational costs while the other part goes to the people. This is a smooth process, since the governments don't have to face any pressure, and the people are happy to receive their pension income.\nFifth, transparency is of paramount importance on issues such as how and where the pension fund will be invested, and how the profits will be distributed. People want to have their money safe and get it back without hassle. The operational and administrative costs should be within acceptable levels, so that the pension account holders receive a good return on their money. A robust supervision and monitoring system should be in place to avoid wastage. The beneficiaries should receive regular statements with updates on their income. The UPS should be fully automated with all relevant information available to the pension account holders.\nOverall, the government's initiative to introduce a UPS is praiseworthy. This is commensurate with Bangladesh's aspiration to become an upper middle-income country by 2031 and an advanced country by 2041. Its implementation will determine whether we are moving towards that direction or not. This fund should not become another source of corruption, and pensioners should be able to receive their money instantly\u2014without giving any bribe.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).

        "full_article": "Our RMG industry has been characterised by the phrase \"feast or famine\" these last two years. After Covid-19 broke out in early 2020, clothing orders were extremely hard to come by for a period of time. Business picked up briefly, then slumped again, then really gathered pace towards the end of 2021. It has not stopped since.\nThis volatile business environment presents several challenges before us, the RMG manufacturers, and one of them is staffing. Forced to let workers go during the pandemic, RMG factories are now scrambling to hire workers to meet record orders. Unfortunately, the demand for workers is exceeding supply, and skill shortages are now a real issue in our industry. Rumours I have heard suggest that we have a worker shortage of 15-20 percent. In terms of numbers, this represents hundreds of thousands of garment workers\u2014the lifeblood of our industry.\nWhy do we have this problem? There are several factors at play. The first is the unprecedented uptick in orders. Bangladesh broke records in RMG exports in the last quarter of 2021, and this momentum has been carried over to 2022. The shipping crisis in China doesn't look like it will go away until the end of this year either. So, Bangladesh has become a safe haven for RMG production, even if we ourselves are not completely immune to logistical challenges at the moment.\nAmid the record number of orders, we face a crisis of labour. Many of the RMG workers who were terminated as orders were cancelled were forced to return to their village homes. There is evidence that suggests that many of them have left the garment industry for good. If this really is the case, it's a huge loss for our industry. Besides, many garment workers have gone abroad in search of work in other RMG-producing countries. I recently saw a report quoting that 40,000 Bangladeshi workers are currently employed in the Jordanian garment sector. Others have left to work in the garment industries in Mauritius and Malaysia.\nWe need these workers now more than ever, in what looks to be a huge year for our RMG industry. Our factories might typically run at 50-60 percent capacity, but at present, many are operating at around 90 percent. Record levels of garment exports are on the cards in 2022, but this success story could turn into a pipe dream if we don't tackle the staffing crisis in time.\nHow do we address this crisis? I believe there are several options.\nIn the short term, there are several tactics that we could adopt. We could raise wages and other fringe benefits to attract more workers to join our factories. This could include bonuses or benefits such as sign-on incentives. Another option is flexible working practices. This includes facilitating the re-entry of working mothers into the workplace through implementing alternate working hours, creche facilities, and so on. These are areas that a progressive business should be addressing anyway, so now might be a good time to invest in such human resource strategies.\nIn the medium-to-long term, two obvious solutions spring to mind. The first is a better, more coordinated skill strategy for our industry. There is compelling evidence that upskilling workers results in near-term efficiency gains and a reduction in defects. Are our current workers skilled enough to meet future staffing requirements in our sector? During the pandemic, Shimmy, an industrial edtech startup that upskills RMG workers, conducted the Apparel Automation Pulse study in Bangladesh. The study uncovered increased investments in advanced machines in the sector, and the skill gaps alongside it. There is no time better than now to expand this type of research and make sure that we have the right systems and processes in place.\nThe second step is to look at production levels as well as automation. Are factory workflows in our industry established as efficiently as they could be? Could better, more qualified management make a difference in this area? The two go hand in hand. It is also time to consider possibilities for investment in technology that could boost productivity. If orders remain high, factories will have the opportunity to boost cash reserves. This should improve the opportunities to invest in operational capacity and efficiency. Some amazing new solutions for garment factory automation are available right now. With the world's textile events and exhibitions now opening once again for face-to-face business, we as factory owners need to be looking at ways we can use them to future-proof our industry, and to help us better manage fluctuations in orders and output requirements.\n\u00a0\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is Managing Director of Denim Expert Limited, and Founder and CEO of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange (BAE) and Bangladesh Denim Expo.\n",

        "full_article": "An article in this daily, titled \"Women don't want to be superhumans\" (published on February 2, 2022), has inspired me to write this column. The author, Afia Jahin, made valid points about how women are expected to be superhumans\u2014juggling jobs, relationships, raising children and caring for the elderly in the family. Women's acceptance of grown-up men acting immature for their age, with widely used phrases like \"boys will be boys,\" perhaps enables the latter. The other widely known stereotype is that men are \"serious\" at their jobs, and so women must be \"family-oriented\"\u2014even if a woman is smarter than her spouse. These stereotypes continue to enable men's bad behaviour.\nWhile travelling across Bangladesh for work, I often get to hear narratives similar to what Afia presented in her article. Women and girls think they have to \"make sacrifices\" for the greater good, that they have to \"hold the fort\" of family struggles, and take on tasks both at home and outside. These perceptions become the reality when people are asked about their future: most boys would say that their aspirations were to get ahead in life, choose the right career path and travel abroad, while the majority of girls would say they wanted to rear children and have happy family lives. But just as girls should aspire to be successful in their careers, shouldn't boys also aspire to grow up and be responsible fathers? Since boys don't set family life as a priority, their attitude towards family life often results in entitled (read: bad) behaviour towards their spouses and children.\nUnless we start teaching children\u2014both boys and girls\u2014that they all need to be responsible for their families and work together with their partners, these patriarchal notions will continue to hinder our growth, both as individuals and as a nation. A few real stories that I have heard over the years depict Afia's points clearly.\nExhibit A: Lisa (not her real name) has accepted that boys will be boys. Her mother and grandmother have convinced her that boys don't grow up\u2014that they can get away with acting immature and not fulfilling their duties at home. So when she found out that her husband was having an affair with his co-worker, she accepted it. He was coming home late, looking at his phone most days and not paying any attention to their children. She was aware of the reality, but blamed herself for her husband's bad behaviour. Her own mother told her to stay quiet and pretend nothing happened. Even though Lisa studied economics, she got married and had children right after graduation. If she wanted to keep her dignity and move out with her children, who would take care of them? She had no prior work experience. She was afraid her husband wouldn't pay for their children's education if she left, and she would have to face hassle in society.\nExhibit B: Marufa's husband beats her, but at least she has a husband. She works as a housemaid and wanted to receive additional training to earn more. When asked how her relationship at home was, she bluntly said that her husband beat her once in a while. She seemed to be okay with it! Her relatives who live nearby in slums often intervene, she and her husband remain distant for a few days, but then everything goes back to normal. When asked why she endured this behaviour, Marufa explained that living in a slum without a husband meant that other men would be bothering her. According to her, women cannot live alone for safety reasons. Even though there are strict laws in that the country against domestic abuse, she said they didn't matter in the slums. Complaining about him would increase problems for her, she said, as even law enforcers would be flirting with her. She cited a similar case of her friend, who raised her voice against her abusive husband, but got blamed for everything instead and had to leave the slum. In Marufa's world, society accepts that men can abuse their wives, and it's okay.\nExhibit C: Deepa's too beautiful to study after Class 10. Her parents fear that if she continues to go to school, the local goons who bother her may harm her even more. She used to get constantly harassed when she was in school, but she was able to complete her SSC examination. Now, her parents want her to marry a man who lives abroad, so that she can have a better future. But one of Deepa's cousins got married at the same age as her's and went abroad, only to return after two years with a child, abused. Deepa wants to continue her studies, complete her graduation and then get married. But she doesn't think her parents will allow that. Her father has made it very clear that unless a woman is married and has children, her duties remain unfulfilled.\nSuch are the cases of millions of girls in Bangladesh. While we understand that we have to treat our girls the same as our boys, we are failing to practise it in real life. In such circumstances, women have to stand up against such \"bad behaviour.\" Men, too, need to understand that how our forefathers behaved in the family was not right, and our household \"culture\" has to change if we want women to move forward. The country's policy and practice should support women to become financially independent. Women are not superhumans, and they should stop accepting bad behaviour from men in society.\n\u00a0\nTasmiah T Rahman is the head of the Skills Development Programme at Brac.

        "full_article": "When Deng Xiaoping launched China's strategy of \"reform and opening up\" in 1978, economists in the West had their doubts. In their view, a vibrant market economy was fundamentally incompatible with China's authoritarian political system. But many in the East\u2014including Koreans like me, who witnessed the East Asian miracle while living under developmental dictatorship\u2014were hopeful. Now that China is the world's second-largest economy, it seems clear that our optimism was warranted.\nBut, as China's economic slowdown suggests, the next phase of its development is rife with challenges. The country risks being ensnared by two traps: the \"middle-income trap\" (the tendency of fast-growing developing economies to lose momentum once they reach middle-income status), and the Thucydides Trap (when tensions between an insecure incumbent hegemon and a rising power lead to conflict). As I argue in my new book on China, global value chains (GVCs) are a key variable linking these two traps.\nThe middle-income trap is undoubtedly formidable, having ensnared Thailand, Turkey and Brazil, to name a few examples. It comes about partly because of the difficulty in building sufficient innovation capabilities to enable the economy to shift from low-wage activities to the production of higher value-added goods.\nBut China has positioned itself to avoid this pitfall. Already, the country's ratio of research-and-development spending to GDP is close to 2.5 percent\u2014far above the average for upper-middle-income countries. As a result, China filed 28,680 US patents in 2021, ranked third after Japan (48,405), followed by South Korea (22,120) and Germany (15,334). And the government has made the continued development of China's innovative capabilities a top priority.\nBeyond innovation, economic research has identified two other variables that determine whether a country can evade the middle-income trap: the presence of large world-class businesses, and the absence of excessive inequality. On the former variable, China is also doing very well. The number of Chinese companies in the Fortune Global 500 soared from 10 in 2000 to 135 in 2021, surpassing America's 122.\nInequality, however, remains a serious problem. China's Gini coefficient\u2014a common measure of inequality, with zero representing absolute equality and one representing absolute inequality\u2014stands at nearly 0.42, much higher than, say, South Korea (0.30). The top 10 percent of the Chinese population own more than 40 percent of the country's pre-tax national income.\nWhile these figures put China roughly on par with the US, they do not bode well for avoiding the middle-income trap. That said, China's government recognises the country's inequality problem and has committed to addressing it through the so-called common prosperity campaign.\nAs for the Thucydides Trap, although the US and China are not currently fighting a conventional war, they are locked in a tense competition\u2014not least over GVCs. The US does not want to rely on value chains led by its rising challenger, so it has imposed tariffs and restrictions on Chinese exports, and banned many Chinese companies from accessing critical technologies\u2014such as semiconductors.\nWhile the US most likely cannot achieve comprehensive economic decoupling from China, it might be able to do so in high-tech sectors, including semiconductors, batteries, and artificial intelligence. This prospect has sent China's efforts to bolster its innovation capabilities into overdrive.\nThe push for decoupling has also disrupted China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was supposed to scale up GVCs, and driven China to attempt to source more intermediate goods locally. Many sectors\u2014including automobiles, batteries, wind turbines, drones, and mobile phones\u2014have embraced the \"all made in China\" ethos.\nIn any case, a partial decoupling from the US would not stop China's rise. Last year, China's GDP was 73.4 percent of the US level, with the share having risen by two percentage points annually for the preceding five years. At that rate, China will catch up with the US by 2035. In terms of per capita income level, China has been gaining on the US by about one percentage point per year, reaching 27.7 percent of the US level last year. This suggests that China could reach 40 percent of the US' per capita GDP\u2014high-income status\u2014by 2033.\nBut whether China achieves this depends upon several factors, including its ability to continue upgrading its global value chains and manage mounting internal risks. To counter the effects of external shocks\u2014especially the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014the Chinese government eased credit conditions, lowered interest rates, and loosened local governments' control over fiscal expenditure. This has boosted corporate and local-government debt, fuelled shadow banking, and re-inflated the housing bubble.\nSome of these developments, especially rising corporate debt and non-performing loans (NPLs), hark back to conditions in South Korea before the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. China is working hard to manage these risks, not least by postponing financial liberalisation.\nBut China's weak rule of law also carries serious risks, including official corruption, which tends to increase inequality and thus could undermine China's efforts to avoid the middle-income trap. In South Korea, democratisation played a central role in strengthening the rule of law and checking corruption, thereby enabling the country to reach high-income status.\nDespite the \"Beijing consensus,\" China has not yet developed a system that can support a similar transition. While China does not have to adopt the Western-style liberal democracy, it will need to devise a viable alternative, which might constitute a third trap facing China.\n\u00a0\nKeun Lee,\u00a0vice-chair of the National Economic Advisory Council for the President of South Korea, is distinguished professor of economics at Seoul National University, and the author of \"China's Technological Leapfrogging and Economic Catch-up: A Schumpeterian Perspective.\"\n",

Often drivers are the only ones deemed culpable for crashes, while their employers are left untouched. While drivers in most cases are the obvious suspects, it's the owners who have the important job to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy, necessary documents are updated, and there are eligible drivers behind the steering wheels\u2014which they often fail to do.\nAs per the BRTA data, as of last month, 508,000 registered vehicles eligible for fitness tests have not renewed their documents. Meanwhile, at least one million registered vehicles are being driven by unlicensed drivers on the roads. As per the Road Transport Act (RTA), 2018, if a vehicle does not have updated documents, its owner would also be made responsible for any accidents involving the vehicle. Unfortunately, this is but one of many parts of the act that are yet to be properly implemented.\nThe pickup van that recently took the lives of six brothers in Chakaria of Cox's Bazar has been found to be faulty, with its papers expired three years ago. Earlier, on November 29, 2021, a bus killed an SSC examinee in Dhaka's Rampura area. Its driver was arrested soon afterwards and is now in jail. But why is the owner still living freely, given that the bus, reportedly, neither had a route permit nor an updated tax token? Similarly, the driver in the Chakaria case is in jail, while the vehicle's owner is reportedly on the run. Given that the responsibility of owners in cases of road crashes are acknowledged in the RTA, why are they not being held to account? Unfortunately, vehicle owners are often influential and politically connected people, making them immune to any fallout from their crimes or the lack of responsibility.\nThis can't be the norm if we truly want to prevent road crashes. We can't continue to grant undue concessions to the influential vehicle owners and transport associations. As per police data, at least 5,088 people were killed in 5,472 road crashes in 2021. This shows the urgency of immediate interventions from the relevant authorities. The government must properly and evenly enforce the road safety law to bring some semblance of order to our chaotic transport sector, and stop the march of deaths on our roads.\n",

We reiterate that the last five years have witnessed the steady stripping of the credibility of this institution, and the consequent denudation of people's faith in elections and politics in general. The steady decline in voter turnout in the polls attests to that. This\u2014for a country whose most important article of faith is pinned on freedom of electoral choice of the people, and freedom to vote without let or hindrance\u2014is a sad state of affairs.\nWe believe that the new EC, with former Senior Secretary Kazi Habibul Awal at the helm, has its work cut out for it. It is up to the CEC and other election commissioners to decide how they would acquit themselves and live up to the expectations of the people. Given the past five years, it is a tall ask. The EC does not have a magic wand. And there are impediments that would take time to remove. However, we hope that the new EC would take objective lessons from its predecessor's acts of omission and commission. Their task is not only to hold elections, but also to do everything to restore the credibility of this institution by providing an electoral process, at every level, that is transparent and free of coercion, and where every participant has a level playing field.\nIt is worth mentioning that the majority of the new commission members are successful ex-bureaucrats. They have been used to working in a milieu that demanded adherence to orders of the higher up\u2014i.e. their political masters. In their new incarnation, they are obligated to no one except the people\u2014and to them, and them only, are they accountable. They should keep in mind that they will be under constant public scrutiny, and therefore must perform in a fair, ethical and morally unimpeachable manner. We would like to caution that failure is not an option, and merely having regrets\u2014for not being able to hold universally acceptable elections\u2014is not an alternative to the \"joy of success.\"\n",
