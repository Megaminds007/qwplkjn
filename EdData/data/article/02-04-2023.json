While the indictment, the first one ever against a former U.S. President, remains under seal and the specific charges and the extent of evidence remain unclear still, media reports and comments by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers indicate that the charges could include the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s erstwhile attorney Michael Cohen paid $1,30,000 to Ms. Daniels on the 45th President\u2019s behalf, apparently to stop her from going public with the story of their consensual (and earlier) extramarital encounter. Mr. Trump is said to have reimbursed the amount to Mr. Cohen after he won the election, which was then passed off as legal expenses. In this regard the charge in the indictment is expected to be a falsification of business records, but that is only a misdemeanour offence in New York, not a felony. To prosecute Mr. Trump for a felony, the onus is on Manhattan District Attorney (DA) Alvin Bragg to not only link the falsified bookkeeping to Mr. Trump directly but also to show that the business records in question were falsified to cover up an entirely different crime. Speculation is rife that the crime that will be cited for this charge will be a potential violation of campaign finance laws \u2014 yet, this is where the prosecution case appears less firm. Following Mr. Cohen\u2019s claim that he had paid Ms. Daniels at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest, there was a question of whether Mr. Trump would be liable under federal campaign finance laws, which require monies received as campaign donations to be disclosed transparently and be subject to specified legal limits. However, a federal investigation into this matter was closed in 2019, which suggests that the weight of evidence here may not have been compelling at the time.The broader question underlying the indictment is whether Democrats are scoring a self-goal. While more serious issues that could be potential charges against Mr. Trump are on the scanner of the Justice Department, including certain dealings of the Trump Organization, his role in inciting the January 6, 2021 insurrection and withholding classified information after demitting office, the Manhattan DA\u2019s reliance on the hush-money case could end up as blowback for the Democrats, especially given the dangers that it will polarise Americans further and be seen as pure political partisanship. Mr. Trump will of course extract every ounce of political capital that he can from what he has described as \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, and that too will likely not favour Democrats in the 2024 election.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nlawyer\n\n/\n\ninvestigation\n\n/\n\nlaws",

        "full_article": "It is the season of Twenty20 and just as the inaugural Women\u2019s Premier League (WPL) concluded at Mumbai, it is time for the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). With Friday night\u2019s clash between defending champion Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the IPL\u2019s annual summer tryst is back in vogue. Launched in 2008, the IPL has become a money-spinning brand while the WPL finally found its feet with five teams. Women\u2019s cricket in India is carving a niche and it is a progressive step as not long ago this brand of sport was deemed an afterthought before the BCCI bridged the gender divide. The board initiated corrective measures including central contracts, pay parity in terms of match fees and the WPL became an essential milestone. In the pathways laid by Diana Edulji, Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami, to name a few, the current generation of women cricketers has also gained commercial heft. And when Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s Mumbai Indians won the maiden WPL with a seven-wicket triumph over Delhi Capitals, it was a significant moment in the history of Indian women\u2019s cricket. With the Under-19 team having won the World Cup recently, the WPL\u2019s arrival should further enhance the quality within the Indian ranks.\rJust as the women rest, their male counterparts are already busy with the IPL that stretches up to May 28. The 10-team championship can sap energy from the very best of players. Not surprisingly, \u2018workload management\u2019 has become an oft-repeated expression as the cricketers look at the immediacy of the IPL while also being aware of the World Test Championship final in England and the World Cup in India, later this year. All-format players such as Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and some bowlers have to make choices while juggling between their IPL stints and India duties. M.S. Dhoni turning out for CSK at 41, is a testament to longevity. Equally, it is revelatory of the career choices that players make these days through staggered retirements starting with Tests, then ODIs while keeping the T20 exit for the last. A Sachin Tendulkar playing top-flight cricket for 25 years will perhaps remain an exception as the present generation pick and choose their formats. The latest IPL has drafted in the \u2018impact player\u2019 concept wherein a team could effect a substitution, as in football, and use the star\u2019s core skills unlike the usual cricketing substitute relegated to just fielding. The stage is set and new stars will emerge in a year during which India could eventually chase glory in ICC events.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIPL\n\n/ \n\ncricket",

        "full_article": "The recent scrapping of Category 2B, which exclusively included \u2018Muslims,\u2019 from the Karnataka state Backward Classes (BC) list by the BJP government has sparked off a debate in the run-up to assembly polls.\nBut let\u2019s look closely at the changes. In Karnataka, based on the Justice O Chinnappa Reddy Commission report, the Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal government reconfigured the reservation matrix in 1994. In particular, the BCs were subcategorised into Category 1 (4%), 2A (15%), 2B (4%), 3A (4%), and 3B (5%). The incumbent BJP government has scrapped 2B, which exclusively housed \u2018Muslim\u2019 as a caste, and relocated it to the EWS (10%) quota. Simultaneously, it has rechristened Categories 3A and 3B, which included the Vokkaligas and Lingayats, though not exclusively, as 2C and 2D. The 4% released by scrapping the 2B Muslim quota has been employed to expand 2C (from 4% to 6%) and 2D (from 5% to 7%), respectively. The opposition expectedly has decried the move as another instance of BJP\u2019s anti-Muslim stance. However, Category 1 and Category 2A already includes many backward class Muslims and both these categories have not been tampered with. In other words, with the scrapping of Category 2B, mostly privileged Muslim castes have been relocated. Previously, all Muslim groups were included, with 2B constituting an exclusive \u2018Muslim\u2019 quota. Is an exclusive religion-based quota tenable?\nPIX CAPTION fine print: The scrapping of 2B category by Karnataka affects mostly privileged Muslim castes\nHistorically, the colonial practice of religion-based electorates and quotas was discarded after Independence as religion had become a suspect category due to Partition. Both the First (1955) and Second (1979) Backward Class Commissions, popularly known as the Kaka Kalelkar Commission and Mandal Commission, refrained from treating Muslims as a monolithic, socially backward community and excluded the privileged castes/groups within them. Interestingly, the central OBC list for Karnataka also excludes privileged Muslim groups like the Cutchi Memon, Navayat, Bohra, Sayyid, Sheik, Pathan Mughal, Mahdavi, and Konkani or Jamayati Muslims. However, in category 2B, the residual Muslim castes \u2014 privileged and lowered \u2014 were clubbed together, with the possibility of the former cornering the quota benefits owing to their cultural capital. If we map the BC quota framework employed by the Centre and states, Karnataka and Kerala form the glaring exceptions in having exclusive Muslim quotas.\nThe exception can be explained by three factors. First, the historical dominance of the anti-Brahmin movements in Karnataka, where all non-Brahmin communities were considered backward and inadequately represented in power structures. This enabled the invisibilisation of hegemonies in other communities. Secondly, the discursive grip of the orthodox orientalist-colonial frame in understanding caste. Caste, a secular category that organised pan-religion symbolic, erotic, and material life in South Asia, was religionised and incorporated as an internal moment of Hinduism. This view, shared widely by the anti-caste tradition and policymakers, renders caste in putatively egalitarian non-Hindu communities, particularly Muslims and Christians, an illegitimate category. However, sociological evidence clearly demonstrates caste-based discrimination in subcontinental Islam and Christianity. Thirdly, the continuing sway of what political scientist Paul Brass phrases as the \u201cmyth of Muslim decline into backwardness\u201d can be traced back to the Hunter Commission Report (1882), wherein the entire Muslim community was spuriously characterised as disadvantaged based on the exceptional data of Bengal. If one reads closely, all the Karnataka BC commission reports \u2014 Miller Committee (1918), Havanur Commission (1975), O Chinnappa Reddy Commission (1990), and so on\u2014are struggling with how to account for caste among Muslims and the myth of all Muslims as a backward category.\nThe scrapping of Category 2B has triggered a polarising debate. While opposition parties like the Congress and JDS have termed the move communal, unscientific, and an election gimmick, the BJP has retorted by emphasising the illegitimacy of a religion-based quota. The moralist and procedural charge of the debate must not blind us to the fact that both the insertion of 2B in 1994 by the Janata Dal government and the more recent scrapping by the BJP are politically motivated: in the former, the Ashraf sections were being appeased, in the latter, the Lingayats and Vokkaligas are. Ideally, all the castes/groups among the Karnataka Muslim community should be positively identified, with the most backward being accommodated within category 1, the more backward in Category 2A, and the privileged in the EWS quota. Similarly, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the inclusion of privileged castes like the Thangals (Syeds) and Koya in the Mappila category could be rethought. Whether successive regimes will follow such a reasonable approach is hard to say. However, one need not necessarily characterise the scrapping of 2B as a \u201cbid to turn the clock back by over 100 years on the issue of recognition of Muslims,\u201d as one report puts it. Instead, this moment also allows us to evaluate the Muslim quota debate afresh and push social policy in more just directions.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It must have been Ramzan in the year 1980 when we had this great plan of walking from College Street in Kolkata to Zachariah Street to arrive just in time for the sunset, and the subsequent revelries. There would be, I knew, sutli kebabs (kebabs so delicate that they need to be held together with a string), slow-stewed nihari served with sweet saffron-scented sheermal, kulfi-falooda bathed in bright pink rose syrup\u2026 At this point in the contemplation, I needed to stop to salivate, but it went on. Biryani, of course, Kolkata style, with eggs and potatoes peeking out from below the pile of rice and golden shahi tukras (ah those days when we never had to spare a thought for fat and sugar). And of course, haleem.\n\nSomebody had the bright idea that we should earn our iftar meal by taking a break from eating. No lunch, she insisted. At 10 am, with breakfast still jostling in our tummy, we all said yes. By 1 pm, brought up on the Bengali diet of at least four good meals a day, we started to wonder about the wisdom of our decision. By 2.30 pm, I was in statistics class, trying to ignore the grumbling in my stomach. Our teacher, never one to fight the innate dryness of the material, was juggling many matrices, but all I could think about is the gooey richness of a haleem, topped with strips of juicy ginger and fried onions. And the fact that there were still four good hours to go before we would get to eat.\n\nThis is why children from low-income families need school meals if we want them to learn well: my friend Rohini Somanathan from the Delhi School of Economics, along with Farzana Afridi from ISI and Bidisha Baruah from IIIE studied what happened when, in 2009, the Delhi government decided to extend the coverage of the free school meals program to upper primary students (it already covered the lower primary). They tested kids by giving them mazes to solve (which is a standard way to measure cognition without requiring the subject to read and understand something) and found that their performance improved sharply once they started getting the meals. It\u2019s hard, as I learnt that Ramzan day, to focus on anything but food when your stomach is rumbling.\nAnd it is obviously not just about food. It is hard to think of anything else when we are waiting for a diagnosis or an exam result for a loved one, or for that matter, that one WhatsApp message from him or her that might never arrive. Our cognition is slave to our affective mind.\nBut for the poor this can be a double whammy: they are robbed of their ability to think clearly and act decisively precisely when they need it the most, when their entire survival is at stake. This might help us understand why, during the \u2018monga\u2019 months (after the crops are planted) of March-April and September-November, when there is no work available in the fields, a large fraction of the poorest families in Rangpur in north-west Bangladesh end up living on a starvation diet of 1,400 calories a day or less, even though there is work available in the cities and those who take up that option can afford a more comfortable 2,200 calories for their families. As the fascinating research by Gharad Bryan and Mushfiq Mobarak (another set of friends and J-PAL colleagues) shows, this remains true even after they, with some encouragement from a local NGO, have successfully navigated one trip to the city and made a bunch more money than they would have not otherwise. They seem frozen in place by the contemplation of what is happening to them.\nMy training as an economist makes this feel slightly paradoxical, since we are used to assuming that people respond to need. At the same time, as someone who can\u2019t help worrying about whether his children would have enough to eat on their one-day school camping trip, it is impossible to really comprehend what it means for a parent to tell a hungry child that there is no food, and there won\u2019t be much more for several weeks. I suspect this brings with it a sense of overwhelming responsibility that can be quite paralysing.\nThis is why, even in a market economy, we need systems of mutual aid. Not charity, though that can be important too, but a norm of helping friends and neighbours in need, so that the act of asking can be easy, and not require us to make the hard choice between begging and starving. Most rural communities across the developing world have a version of this not surprisingly given how little control farmers have over weather, pests and the world markets \u2014 and data from rural areas shows that consumption does not go down nearly as much as income during bad times, suggesting that the households are getting help from somewhere.\nUnfortunately, these forms of social support are far from perfect, and have a tendency to break down exactly when the need is the greatest, like in Rangpur when everyone else around is also in straitened circumstances. This is why governments have to be ready to intervene, but it also helps to be connected to those who are unlikely to be in trouble precisely when we are. This is the distant city cousin who will find us a spot to sleep, and make some introductions towards a job. Migration literature suggests that those connections can be a powerful inducement to leave home \u2014 indeed when I was growing up, many friends had \u201ccountry uncles\u201d who slept in their living rooms and played cricket with us. More than a third of the working men in Rangpur do go to the city during monga. The right connections may be an important part of why they are different.\nCelebrations like Ramzan (or Ganesh puja), where the community does something together, exist in part to underline the importance of these ties. In my youth there used to be iftar parties hosted by wealthy Hindu families, partly to allow their Muslim friends and neighbours to avoid cooking after a long day of fasting, but also as an occasion to reaffirm those bonds. I hope (and suspect) that they still happen, and they serve, what to me is the most magnificent gruel known to man, haleem.\nThis is part of a monthly column by Nobel-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee illustrated by Cheyenne Olivier\nHALEEM RECIPE\nThis is my favourite way to make haleem, courtesy my cousin and foodie extraordinaire, Vineet Shroff\nFry 1 kilo of onions sliced into half rings no thicker than your ear-lobes in a large (ideally 12\u201d) fry pan with \u00bd cup sunflower or some other neutral oil, with \u00bd tsp salt, till they are red-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels or yesterday\u2019s newspaper. Save the oil in the pan.\nPressure cook 1 kilo of well-cleaned bone-in mutton, ideally with 50 gm extra fat from around the kidneys, with 1 cup water, 1/3 of the fried onions, 1.5 tbs ginger-garlic paste, 2 1\u201d pieces of cassia bark/cinnamon stick, 5 cloves, 4 green cardamoms pods, 1 tsp caraway seeds, 1/2 tsp kebab chini or allspice, 1 tbs rose petals, 2 large bay leaves, 1 tsp peppercorn, \u00bd tsp salt and 4 tbs ghee for 35 minutes. The meat should be falling off the bones. Pick the pieces of meat off the bones, and strain and save the stock.\nIn the same pressure cooker (no need to clean), add 3/4 cups of broken wheat (dalia), 2 tsp each of black urad dal, toovar dal, chana dal, yellow mung dal and basmati rice, \u00bd cup cashews, \u00bd tsp salt and 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil (uncovered). Cover with a plate and leave off the heat for 30 minutes before pressure cooking for 20 minutes. The grains should be ready to mash up.\nIn a food processor or a blender, put in 4/5 of the cooked meat and blend to a paste. Take it out. Without washing the bowl, add the grain mixture and blend into another paste. Shred by hand the remaining 1/5 of the meat.\nTo assemble, heat the reserved oil, adding extra to cover the pan\u2019s surface if needed. When it reaches medium heat, add 1 tbs ginger-garlic paste, fry for a minute and add 1/3 of the saved fried onions, \u00bd packed cup each of chopped coriander and mint, slivers from 2 green chilles, \u00bd tsp black pepper and \u00bd tsp turmeric. Cook for another minute, lower heat and add \u00be cup beaten yogurt, 1 tbs at a time, stirring between additions. Add in the meat and grain pastes, the reserved stock and the shredded meat, stirring well to blend and adding water as needed to achieve the consistency of a thick dal. Dribble 2 tbs ghee over the whole thing and bring to a boil. Your haleem is ready to serve. Serve in bowls, garnished with thin slivers of ginger, the remaining fried onions, fried cashews, more coriander and mint and lemon wedges.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Heard the one about the Indian and the Pakistani, abroad in Britain? That\u2019s a variant on the opening line of the wellworn joke convention featuring two people of different nationalities, cultures or professions. Usually, they say or do something that raises a smile while simultaneously addressing a complex issue revolving around stereotype or mindset.\nIn 2023, the joke may be on Britain. The Indian and the Pakistani, both of Punjabi heritage, have been busy doing politics. At the highest level. The Pakistani has taken office as first minister of Scotland, which is roughly analogous to CM of an Indian state. Hamza Yousaf has vowed to lead a campaign to partition the United Kingdom and were he to succeed, he would effectively be setting himself up to be the Jinnah of tomorrow\u2019s Scotland.\nIt falls to the Indian then to be the Nehru of today\u2019s Britain. As the first Hindu and non-white UK PM, Rishi Sunak is the man who\u2019s meant to hold it all together.\nSeparately and together, Yousaf and Sunak have made history. Within six months of Sunak\u2019s ascent to the highest office in Britain, Yousaf has become the first South Asian Muslim to take charge of a western European semi-autonomous democratic country. Both men are deeply conscious of the symbolism and historymaking weight of their ascent. If Sunak is known for lighting Diwali lamps on the doorstep of Downing Street, Yousaf famously took his first Scottish parliament oath back in 2011 in Urdu, while wearing a kilt.\nThe rise of Sunak and Yousaf illustrates the realities as well as the usual platitudes about the depth and breadth of ethnic and faith diversity at the very top of British politics. But more striking by far is the extent to which they have neither tried to remake their nation\u2019s politics, nor signalled any intention to do so.\nThe new first minister is no straight swap for Nicola Sturgeon, who is known as much for her gamine bob and feisty communication skills as for the passionate intensity with which she champions Scottish independence. Instead, Yousaf\u2019s critics sometimes call him \u201cHumza Useless\u201d and in the words of one political sketch writer, he\u2019s somewhat \u201clike a leader created by ChatGPT\u201d.\nDuring the SNP leadership election, his main rival challenged Yousaf\u2019s elevation to Sturgeon\u2019s role withthis devastating critique: \u201cMore of the same is not a manifesto, it is an acceptance of mediocrity. \u201d The plaint is that Yousaf\u2019s ethnicity is more notable than his governing abilities and that he has \u201cfailed upwards\u201d in a succession of ministerial briefs, including transport, justice and health.\nEven his decision to plough the long furrow towards a sunlit future of Scottish independence appears to be based on a somewhat selective reason to seek the brutal political partition of a nation. Five years ago, Yousaf explained to a Scottish political magazine that the 9/ 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York profoundly changed his worldview and that after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he realised independence was the only way to keep Scotland out of British wars.\nIf anything, Yousaf may indicate the importance of a nuanced foreign policy in a multi-ethnic society, but also the need to leave domestic concerns at the water\u2019s edge.\nAs for Sunak, there is little sign he plans to rewrite the country\u2019s political script, seek to seed the British curriculumwith knowledge of the Raj and propel the state towards emollient engagement with the sores of history.\nHis controversial new asylum and migration law is one example. Joining with his home secretary Suella Braverman, another politician of Indian origin, Sunak wants a policy that is not humane, workable or even in line with international law. The European far right is united in praise of the proposed legislation, which follows in the wake of Australia\u2019s brutal and staggeringly successful 20-yearold\u2018stop the boats\u2019 policy towards uninvited migrants. Interestingly, the Sunak-Braverman policies have been criticised as \u201ccruel\u201d, \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d.\nShould we have expected different from Sunak and Braverman? Should Yousaf in Scotland be held to a standard that is more inclusive? Braverman has challenged the idea \u201cthat a person\u2019s skin colour should dictate their political views\u201d and Sunak has previously joked about compliments for his \u201ctan\u201d. It is, as Priyamvada Gopal, Cambridge professor of postcolonial studies once noted, \u201cthe triumph of a carefully managed and trivialised diversity\u201d.\nDiversity is a meaningless word unless it signals real change. The colour, cultural heritage or DNA of those who run the show may be changing. Not the politics.\n\n",

Doctors from private establishments want it to be rolled back. The Indian Medical Association on March 28 issued a media statement threatening \u201caggressive action to protest\u201d if there\u2019s no rollback. But the doctors\u2019 conduct is unacceptable, and patients have borne the cost of the disruption.\nPrivate sector doctors fear that the bill will undermine their business model as they will be forced to offer free treatment. Let\u2019s take a look at the legal obligation. Indian jurisprudence has used the Constitution\u2019s Article 21 to conclude that no one can be denied emergency medical services as the \u201cgolden hour\u201d is often the difference between life and death. Also, Tamil Nadu in 2021 introduced a scheme whereby all hospitals had to provide emergency treatment to stabilise victims. The cost is reimbursed by the state if the patient can\u2019t pay. Therefore, Rajasthan\u2019s RTH bill is not wholly novel or something IMA is unacquainted with.\nComing to RTH, it\u2019s taken six months to make its way through the assembly. During that time, the state government made changes to the original draft to offset the medical fraternity\u2019s fears. For RTH to take effect, rules have to be framed. It\u2019s only then that details about the kind of private establishment covered by RTH and the reimbursement process will be clear. Doctors have reason to be wary of payment delays but there\u2019s opportunity to discuss these matters with the government. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position if India had effective public healthcare. Governments need to spend more torealise it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We stand by the call for an immediate moratorium on the use of the Digital Security Act (DSA) by the human rights chief of the United Nations. In a statement released after the editor of\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0and one of its reporters were sued for a report critical of high food prices, he called upon the authorities to suspend any further application of the law. He also urged them to comprehensively reform its overly broad and ill-defined provisions which have been frequently abused to intimidate journalists and muzzle critical voices online.\nThe UN is the latest to join the ever-growing chorus of rights institutions from home and abroad who are concerned about the government's stubborn refusal to honour its own commitment to ensure responsible use of the law. Meanwhile, the US State Department, which earlier released a report highlighting the impediments to freedom of expression and the internet in Bangladesh, has again reiterated its concern, saying that \"no members of the press should be threatened, harassed, physically attacked, or arrested for simply doing their job.\" Unfortunately, even as these concerns are being raised, there is little indication these\u00a0are reaching the ears of the authorities.\nAs per latest media reports, two cases have been filed against a correspondent of Desh TV in Khulna following a report on a beauty parlour. The cases were lodged with the Khulna Cyber Tribunal on March 21 and 28, respectively. Such assault on journalists using the DSA has been persistent throughout its first four years of existence, as a review by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) has shown earlier this year. An estimate by Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) now reminds us that the threat hasn't been limited to the use of just one law. It says that over the last three months alone, at least 56 journalists from different media outlets have been attacked in various ways. This illustrates how widespread the repression of journalists has been, with the DSA emerging as the crown jewel of all repressive tactics.\nThe question is, how long will the government continue to resist calls for reforming or repealing this law? Freedom of expression, including for members of the press, is especially important in an election year. Citizens need reliable information to assess the performance of their government. They need the insights of journalists and activists to get a sense of what is happening around so that they can hold their representatives accountable. But if restrictions are placed on these vital sources of information and analysis, including through closing down critical media outlets, it is the citizens who are deprived the most, which is the opposite of how democracy works.\nWe, therefore, urge the government to urgently heed calls for an immediate moratorium on the DSA. With the national election approaching fast, this is also a chance for the government to reaffirm its commitment to democracy.\n",

        "full_article": "One of the takeaways from the finance minister's March 19 pre-budget session with economists was the unanimous appeal to the government to address the budget's impact on the common people. It will not be an exaggeration to contend that the budget of the ordinary person has taken a big hit in the post-Covid era. Families in the lower-income categories have seen their real income decline due to geopolitical tensions, food insecurity, global inflation and supply chain gnarls. \"Shrinkflation\" has forced millions to go without two decent meals and cut back on the consumption of fish, meat and eggs, which provide essential nutrients for their body. In today's comments, I will focus on hunger and malnutrition affecting the working poor.\nWhile the government is declaring a victory over poverty, citing the forthcoming Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), eminent independent social scientists in Bangladesh and economists at the March 19 conclave strongly disagreed. \"The way that the price level is increasing, and the impact it had on low and middle-income people, it is counter-intuitive that the number of people below the poverty line would decline,\" said Professor Mustafizur Rahman of Centre for Policy Dialgoue (CPD). Research by South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM) in March only confirmed my view that many more poor people are going hungry now than before.\nAt a recent gathering in the City of Cambridge in Massachusetts, USA, the visiting foreign minister of Bangladesh was questioned on the country's economic conditions. He did not flinch for a second before he declaimed, \"Nobody in the country dies of hunger\". This oft-quoted line, a slogan, repeatedly brandished in the past, particularly during an election year, has now lost its lustre.\nOne needs to be wary of confusing the two threats that the poor face: \"death by starvation\" and the \"pangs of hunger\". They are different. First, government statistics may not reveal any death by starvation, but the pains of hunger and malnutrition are omnipresent. Secondly, the effects of starvation and hunger are clinically quite different, and attempts to equate them are akin to comparing apples and oranges.\nLet's consider starvation first. Last week, the head of the United Nations World Food Programme warned that up to 345 million people worldwide \u2013 or roughly 50 times the number known to have died from Covid so far \u2013 could face starvation as food prices soar and shortages increase. This figure represents a doubling in global food insecurity since early 2020. Bangladesh's poor did not escape this global scourge's wrath. The landless casual workers in rural areas and the urban poor face a bleak prospect. Already, roughly 20 million people in the country are facing acute malnutrition.\n\nI finally ask the leaders, instead of parroting, \"nobody dies of hunger\", why couldn't we raise the bar and say, \"there is not a single child who suffers from malnutrition. There is not a single person who dies from a lack of medical care and there's not a single elderly who goes hungry?\"\nVarious news accounts highlight the coping strategy devised by the low-income and the poor to survive the ire of inflation. Families on a tight budget have turned to kitchen markets known as \"Fokinni Bazar\" which have sprung up in many slum and poverty-stricken areas. One such market that has gained prominence is located under Bijoy Sarani-Tejgaon Flyover and is frequented by rickshaw-pullers, day-labourers, shopkeepers, and other people from low-income groups in the area.\nPeople experiencing moderate levels of food insecurity will typically eat low-quality diets and might have been forced, at times during the year, to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat, while those experiencing severe levels would have gone for entire days without eating, due to lack of money or other resources to obtain food. It's not a big surprise to me that many of our poor and low-income people are cutting back on their budget for food and all the items they purchase.\nTo understand this phenomenon, known as shrinkflation, lets us consider the budget of an urban family with a household income of Tk 22,000 per month. He is the family's sole bread earner, paying Tk 6,000 for housing and spending the rest on food, transportation, school supplies, fuel, entertainment and clothing. For this family of four, the food budget eats up more than half of the income, and its share could have increased if he had some savings. Over the last year, prices of rice, wheat, pulses, edible oils, sugar, salt, protein diets, milk, and baby food have increased by 20-40 percent. But now they have cut back on food since all other bills have gone up. The urban poor, including the rickshaw pullers, service employees, and small business owners, are all confronted with this lose-lose situation.\nThe human toll, as pinpointed by World Economic Forum's Saadia Zahidi, a Forum Managing Director, may be severe: \"Real wages are falling and can't keep pace with surging prices. In low and medium-income countries, food and energy security could easily lead to social unrest.\"\nThe impact on rural and urban poor may show some odd patterns. In recent times, in general, urban people have been facing a higher rate of food inflation relative to the rural population, while the picture is the opposite in the case of non-food inflation.\nTo combat the current situation, our social welfare programmes must reach out to the target groups, including eligible senior citizens. Policymakers should use social welfare policies to protect the poorest from rising prices. Allowances under social safety net programmes for the poor should be increased.\nThese policies could include targeted safety nets such as cash transfers, food, and in-kind transfers, school feeding programmes, and public works programmes. Research also shows that calculating inflation indexes for different income groups provides better information on inflation actually experienced by the poor and should inform the design of social safety nets.\nI finally ask the leaders, instead of parroting, \"nobody dies of hunger\", why couldn't we raise the bar and say, \"there is not a single child who suffers from malnutrition. There is not a single person who dies from a lack of medical care and there's not a single elderly who goes hungry?\"\nThe other day, I asked a rickshaw puller, \"Can you tell me if there are any days when you go without a meal?\" he demurred. \"I have a large family, and some of them have to make sacrifices,\" he added.\nWhen I asked him if his earnings had increased with the rising economic prosperity level, he said, \"No, sir. I hope you understand how we, the poor make a living, but most importantly, how we make our ends meet.\" In other words, they said, we're trying to make do in this day of inflation with less or, as some people said, \"I have\u00a0barkat\u00a0in my family\".\nDr Abdullah Shibli\u00a0is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company.

        "full_article": "One noted thespian has come under public scrutiny for an off-stage speech. Theatre activist and the founder of Aranyak, Mamunur Rashid, lashed out against what he finds a \"famine of aesthetic taste\" that is plaguing our cultural scene. He was referring to the phenomenal rise of Hero Alom as a social media hero.\nThe phrase alludes to Zainul Abedin, who used the phrase in the 1950s to highlight the absence of aesthetic sensibility against which he had to paint his famous sketches on the great famines during British rule. As the founder of the Faculty of Fine Arts (established as the Institute of Arts and Crafts in 1948), Zainul's contribution to Bangladeshi modern art is immense. His generation paved the way for a \"culture\" with a home-grown signature. It is marked by deference from the western import of imperial culture that was confined to the colonial rulers and their local associates. The exclusivity and deference allowed Zainul to become a high priest of our culture, moving away from the cultural habits and preferences of the aristocrats. The appropriation of local figures catapults Zainul into an emerging art scene that was redefining our artistic contour. If Zainul's statement on \"famine of tastes\" is the birth cry of high culture, Mamun's observation is the lament over the death of such a culture.\nMamun is pained to see the growth of trash culture that has become the consequence of what was known as low culture. High culture, by design, is exclusive and accessible to an academically literate or culturally sensible audience. Low culture, in contrast, includes various types of popular culture that are characterised by their mass appeal. There are times when the boundary between the high and the low can be blurred. A commercial film with a huge public appeal can now be nominated for a Cannes award to get the high-brow seal.\nThe rejection of Hero Alom as a cultural entity hints at deep-seated social anxiety. It is not the first time he has been thrown out of the mainstream culture loop administered by some cultural police. In one instance, he was nabbed and humiliated by a police officer for wearing a police uniform in one of his B-movies. Alom was sanctioned for trying to sing Tagore's songs out of tune. Somehow, this self-starter uses this bad publicity to promote himself as a subaltern. He poses himself as someone who is taking arms against \"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\" He is not a prince who is born with a silver spoon. He does not have the look or social standing. Yet he has the desire for social mobility. In a democratic culture, such desire is usually encouraged. He exercised his right to be a spokesperson for the mass by becoming a public representative. He managed to give the impression that he had been wronged at so many different levels, prompting public sympathy and attention.\n\nAt one extreme, there are the sympathisers of the high priests who lament the glory days of high culture. At the other extreme, we have the defenders of Hero Alom who are critical of Mamun and co. for not allowing the downtrodden to move up the socio-cultural ladder.\nWhen Mamun critiqued Hero Alom as a symptom of the trash culture that is eroding our cultural norms and practices, the reaction is forked. At one extreme, there are the sympathisers of the high priests who lament the glory days of high culture. At the other extreme, we have the defenders of Hero Alom who are critical of Mamun and co. for not allowing the downtrodden to move up the socio-cultural ladder. With the rise of internet users, the second group is winning the verbal battle as they are making more noise. A TikTok artist or a YouTube influencer has more followers than the number of people who would go to Bailey Road or Shilpakala Academy to watch a play.\nTake the instance of the British actor Sir Ian Murray McKellen. His career spanned over six decades. He was shot to fame for his stage performances in Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre. The high-brow actor is now a popular cult figure for his performance as Gandalf the magician in\u00a0The Lord of the Rings\u00a0or as Magneto in\u00a0X-Men\u00a0films. The fulcrum of the mass has shifted.\nThose who have been traditionally performing public piety must reassess their roles amid the changing culture. Hero Alom knows that there is a glass ceiling that stops someone from a humble origin to move up. His rustic accent, skinny figure, and apparently talentless performance work against him. To compensate for his shortcomings, he appeals to those in his condition: a multitude that wants to change their lot. Alam plays the victim to pose as a martyr in the culture wars. I guess, he deserves credit for his ambition. Instead of curating his artistic desire or channelling his energy into something productive, the cultural and political police have constantly side-lined him only to confirm his victimhood.\nWhen I started attending Jahangirnagar University as a freshman student of English literature, we had many cultural activists coming from small provincial towns. They were the ones who reigned the amphitheatre, and dominated the cultural and political organisations. Those of us who travelled from Dhaka could sense the condescending attitudes they would have toward us. Likewise, we would hold them as a bit rustic to our taste. Then there were the students from the locality. Even among my friends, despite our hours of hangouts, I could sense the invisible barriers of social upbringing, cultural orientation, and economic condition. We outgrew the silent resentment by spending more time together, and by understanding one another.\nThe problem that we are now facing is that of subtle racism. The high brows like Mamun consider the Hero Aloms as \"upstart crows beautified with our feathers,\" a remark that Elizabethan playwright Greene made about the rural Shakespeare who was trying to join their league. The tendency to trash the trash culture while highlighting the sweetness and light of high culture is an age-old phenomenon. It was Matthew Arnold who thought of culture as the best thoughts created by bee-like artists who gather sweet honey and waxed candlelight. Now we know the culture as a way of life, a set of practices that endeavour to make meaning for a group. The social media rebels are doing the same. They are no less different than the artists who searched for artistic meanings in life.\nInstead of cancelling each other, it is time that we try to learn from each other. We are, after all, on the threshold of a huge cultural leap.\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is a professor of English at Dhaka University.\n",

        "full_article": "We stand by the call for an immediate moratorium on the use of the Digital Security Act (DSA) by the human rights chief of the United Nations. In a statement released after the editor of\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0and one of its reporters were sued for a report critical of high food prices, he called upon the authorities to suspend any further application of the law. He also urged them to comprehensively reform its overly broad and ill-defined provisions which have been frequently abused to intimidate journalists and muzzle critical voices online.\nThe UN is the latest to join the ever-growing chorus of rights institutions from home and abroad who are concerned about the government's stubborn refusal to honour its own commitment to ensure responsible use of the law. Meanwhile, the US State Department, which earlier released a report highlighting the impediments to freedom of expression and the internet in Bangladesh, has again reiterated its concern, saying that \"no members of the press should be threatened, harassed, physically attacked, or arrested for simply doing their job.\" Unfortunately, even as these concerns are being raised, there is little indication these\u00a0are reaching the ears of the authorities.\nAs per latest media reports, two cases have been filed against a correspondent of Desh TV in Khulna following a report on a beauty parlour. The cases were lodged with the Khulna Cyber Tribunal on March 21 and 28, respectively. Such assault on journalists using the DSA has been persistent throughout its first four years of existence, as a review by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) has shown earlier this year. An estimate by Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) now reminds us that the threat hasn't been limited to the use of just one law. It says that over the last three months alone, at least 56 journalists from different media outlets have been attacked in various ways. This illustrates how widespread the repression of journalists has been, with the DSA emerging as the crown jewel of all repressive tactics.\nThe question is, how long will the government continue to resist calls for reforming or repealing this law? Freedom of expression, including for members of the press, is especially important in an election year. Citizens need reliable information to assess the performance of their government.

        "full_article": "We are concerned by the haywire manner in which medical waste is handled in Bangladesh. A recent report by this daily highlights that half of the healthcare facilities in Khulna city lack their own waste disposal mechanisms and dump unsorted garbage in street bins, according to the city authorities and the DGHS. Of the 12-14 tonnes of clinical waste produced every day in Khulna city, two NGOs \u2013 Prodipan and Sadichha \u2013 collect only seven to eight tonnes from 172 out of the 406 hospitals and clinics regularly.\u00a0\nMedical waste includes amputated body parts, stool, urine, blood, phlegm, bandages, syringes, needles, etc. All this is discarded on the streetside or in regular garbage bins not just in Khulna, but across the country. A Brac study from 2020 found that around 93 percent of medical waste in Bangladesh was unmanaged.\nOur concern regarding such mishandling of clinical waste is twofold. First, of course, is the danger that such disposal of clinical waste poses to public health. Not only HIV, and Hepatitis B and C, but antibiotic-resistant germs (superbugs) and other dangerous germs, too, can spread from medical waste and affect people through touch and inhalation. Second, many medical staffers have made a business out of reselling used medical equipment such as syringes to syndicates. This seems to be a part of the culture of our healthcare facilities, given that even during the worst phases of the Covid pandemic, we witnessed the flagrant disregard with which medical waste (including PPE likely containing the deadly virus) was disposed of. In fact, a Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) study last year found that around 60 percent of hospitals do not have bins to store medical waste, while 83 percent have no waste treatment system.\u00a0The same TIB study also pointed out the severe lack of accountability and rules to check the corruption and irregularities that plague medical waste management in the country. Clearly, this situation is deeper than just the carelessness of medical and city authorities.\u00a0\nWe urge the medical facilities across the country to recognise this epidemic of haphazard medical waste management. For starters, they must set up adequate waste processing plants and not rely on a handful of NGOs to deal with hundreds of tonnes of medical waste. It is also crucial that the government wakes up to the dangers of this issue. The Medical Waste Management and Processing Rules, 2008 that we have is inadequate in its current form to hold the city authorities responsible for the rampant mishandling of medical waste. This must change. Not only should the disposal of medical waste be safer, but the syndicates that profit from mishandling waste (which includes corrupt officials) must be brought to book as well.\n",

        "full_article": "The recently published Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2022 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has given rise not just to confusion but disbelief! Contrary to numerous other surveys and reports by the country's think tanks and opinion of economists, the BBS would have us believe that the country's unemployment rate has declined to 3.6 per cent from 4.2 per cent five years ago. The claimed unemployment rate of the last LFS conducted five years ago also had given rise to debate and the findings of the latest LFS would surely trigger more questions about the credibility of data dished out by the BBS from time to time.Precisely, how BBS could come up with such conclusion is a big question. The fact that a large number of people lost jobs and sources of their regular income during the Covid-19 pandemic that wreaked havoc on life and economy of the country during 2021-22 has been recognized through surveys conducted by both private and public think tanks. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has only aggravated the unemployment situation. The global economic slowdown has affected most countries and Bangladesh is not an island. Many small-scale apparel units have been forced to pull down their shutters for lack of orders received from large factories on sub-contract basis. There is no denying that agriculture being the largest employing sector has remained afloat during the time of crises. But overall situation has not been that conducive to any notable generation of employment. Looking at published data, BBS would have one believe that a mere 2.63 million were unemployed last year. This is not the first time that the bureau has come up with such figures. Over the last decade, some lawmakers on a number of occasions have raised questions about quality of BBS data. Problems with statistics published by many state entities are quite common. Even the incumbent planning minister on one occasion expressed his dissatisfaction over the quality of data of a particular government organisation. BBS is the government's eyes-and-ears, as it is the repository of information and data -- the very data policymakers rely on to make national plans economic or otherwise. Thus, it is all the more important for government to have a serious rethink about precisely what BBS has been doing all these years and whether it is time to overhaul the bureau with the right personnel. Statisticians are needed, not members of the general cadre, to prepare right kind of data. As this particular body deals with data, statisticians must be employed and they must be trained to deal with raw data, to come up with realistic interpretations. There is a general tendency in administration to paint a rosy picture of the economy. That is the last thing they need. The policymakers need to know where things are going wrong so that corrective measures can be taken to improve the economy. This survey should be revisited at the earliest.",

        "full_article": "Zakat is a mandatory charity on the part of solvent Muslims who have a minimum amount of wealth after their own consumption, which is usually paid during the holy month of Ramadan. But there is no religious binding that Zakat has to be paid only in the month of Ramadan.Those who are eligible may settle his or her obligation at any point of time of a year, Islamic lunar year to be precise. Nevertheless, there is a growing trend across the Muslim world to collect and distribute Zakat during Ramadan. Many Muslims choose the first day of Ramadan every year to calculate their Nisab, the minimum threshold of wealth required to be eligible for paying Zakat. On a particular day of a lunar year, if the market value of someone's wealth becomes equivalent to or more than the required minimum, s/he has to pay at least 2.5 per cent of the wealth as Zakat.The main principle of Zakat is to collect and distribute part of the surplus resources of well-off Muslims to assist in improving the living standard of the poor and the needy members of their community within a period of time. The ultimate objective is to eliminate poverty and create an equitable society in the end. So, Zakat is not only an obligatory charity but also an economic tool in Islam. Being recognised as one of the five core pillars of Islam, it is important to determine the right amount of Nisab so that a Muslim can pay Zakat properly.There are two standards - gold and silver - to determine the Nisab. If any Muslim possesses at least seven and a half tolas or vori (87.50 grams) of gold or equivalent amount of money after dispensing all necessities and clearing liabilities in a year, it is the Nisab in gold standard. Similarly, possession of minimum 52.50 tolas or vori (613 grams) of silver or equivalent amount of financial wealth is Nisab in silver standard.There are some differences of opinion among the Islamic scholars on which standard to follow to calculate Nisab as there is a big difference in the market prices of gold and silver. Many argue that except gold or gold ornaments, Nisab for all other financial assets and wealth have to follow silver standard. They add that by following silver standard, anyone having minimum amount of surplus wealth will be eligible to pay Zakat which is beneficial to the poor and needy people who are eligible to receive Zakat. Some argue that except for silver or silver ornaments, Nisab for all other financial assets and gold or gold ornaments have to be in gold standard. The third view leaves it to the choice of the Zakat payers to follow gold or silver standard on calculating Nisab for financial assets (like cash, bank balance, bond etc).Let's check the difference in this connection. On March 23, per-gram price of 22-carat silver was Tk 147. Thus, total price of 613 grams of silver stood at Tk 90,111. If any individual wants to sell silver, s/he will get around 20-percent less from the quoted market price. So, actual value of 613-gram silver stands at Tk 72,090 and it is the Nisab amount in silver standard. Again, on March 23, per-gram 22-carat gold price was Tk 8,370, according to Bangladesh Jewellers' Association (BAJWS). So, the quoted market price for 87.50 grams of gold stood at Tk 732,375. By deducting 20 per cent from it, one will get Tk 585,900 and it is the Nisab value in gold standard.Clearly is there a big difference between gold-standard Nisab and Silver-standard Nisab. By following the silver standard, more people will be subject to pay Zakat as the threshold is lower in this case. At the same time, there is a chance to exclude many people who really need Zakat due to their low income and having tiny assets. In Bangladesh, it is not surprising that many low-income people possess a net balance of one lakh taka at the end of a year, which means they have Nisab amount of wealth in silver standard and so are obliged to pay Zakat. And a Zakat-payer cannot be a Zakat- receiver no matter how needy or poor he or she is. In Bangladesh, different charity organisations used to collecting and distributing Zakat and encouraging eligible Muslims to follow silver standard on estimating their due Zakat. As there are no national guidelines regarding the Nisab for Zakat, it sometimes creates confusion. So, the government may consider declaring indicative or suggestive Nisab amounts on gold and silver standards in a particular day. It may help the Zakat-payers to calculate their due amounts accurately. A national guideline for Zakat may also be developed.Early this year, the national parliament passed a fresh law on collection and distribution od Zakat under government management. The objective of the move is to streamline the existing structure of Zakat collection and distribution procedure by the Zakat Board of the Islamic Foundation, Bangladesh. The new law, titled Zakat Fund Management Act 2023, replaces the Zakat Fund Ordinance 1982 and outlines a number of measures to make the management of Zakat efficient.The new act seems to be limited to the management of Zakat by the government only. Under the act, a national Zakat board has to be formed which will be entrusted with the task of designing policies to collect, distribute, manage and operate Zakat in the country. It is not clear whether the policy will be applicable to the private management of Zakat also though the act has empowered the board to create a government Zakat fund. Rules and regulations under the act have yet to be developed. It is necessary to fast-track the work in this regard to streamline the overall Zakat management in the country.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Amid Dhaka's unbridled rise in pollutants, its air quality moves back and forth in the zones of 'unhealthy' and 'very unhealthy'. On a day last week, the city's air quality index (AQI) score was found at 155, reported a news agency. Dhaka ranked seventh in the list of cities worldwide with worse airquality. A city's score at 150-200 means its air quality is 'unhealthy'. The varying scores for Dhaka between the extremes often make it vulnerable to hazardous air quality points. To speak briefly, the city's air quality remains stuck in the unhealthy zone. Meanwhile, the World Bank has broken upsetting news. In a report it said on March 28 thatparticular pollution is responsible for nearly 20 per cent of the total premature deaths annually in Bangladesh. In the report, it has underscored actions to cut down on smog, a modern-day urban scourge. The WB report has shown that there are economically feasible and cost-effective remedies to achieve clean air in the nine South Asian cities plagued by air pollution. A grim state of air pollution has been prevailing in Dhaka for years in a row. In spite of the delicate situation, the Dhaka residents remain nonchalantly indifferent to it and its future bleak turns. In the event of going through the much feared 'hazardous' zone, the city residents may have to brace for serious health hazards. This has yet to occur in the capital this year. Air pollution is considered the most dreadful of pollutions besetting Dhaka. Thanks to air pollution's grave nature, many local and overseas environmental groups continue to watch its latest developments in Dhaka, and the identified cities in Bangladesh. Densely populated and industrially growing, these cities include Gazipur, Rajshahi and Narayanganj.The components that comprise air-borne pollutants include five types of particulate matter, ozone etc. They directly hit the persons exposed to pollution outside, and later lodge in the lungs and heart. Their passages are the throat and nose. The process of air pollution is purely imperceptible. It assaults people in the form of automobiles' exhaust fumes and various noxious gases. A basic point to ponder is the average people, including the educated, do not much bother about air pollution. The general people are hardly seen covering their face with even their hands and arms during a dust-storm. However, it's heartening to see many people compulsively use face masks even after the pandemic intensity is over. They evidently use the masks to protect themselves from dust and pollutants.Dhaka is fast becoming a city of pollution of myriad kinds. The air pollution apart, those related to noise, and rivers and canals have unleashed lots of untold miseries for the city dwellers. Coming to noise pollution, Dhaka might appear to be one of the worst polluted of the developing countries. It seems socio-economic status has a lot to do with creating noise or reining in the menace. Being a country on the path to LDC graduation, Dhaka doesn't seem to be least bothered about its inaction in cutting down noise pollution. It's interesting to see that many otherwise polluted cities around the world strictly control urban noise and its sources. A lot of these cities are situated in the South and Southeast Asian countries.Unlike the air pollution menace, noise pollution's presence affects people instantly. The mechanised, and at times piercing, sounds of automobile movements, and their horns, continue to create untold miseries for the road users. Road traffic-prompted loud noise is one of the worst types of urban sound pollutions. It has both physical and psychological impacts, not to speak of the unbearable annoyance caused by it. The organ most affected by this pollution are the ears. The exposure to long-time urban noise may lead to hearing impairments. It has long been proved medically. All these pollutions, including those related to river water, are a day-to-day reality. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Job seekers have long been demanding the extension of recruitment age limit for government jobs to 35 years from the existing 30 years. And it is a rational demand. There are many countries including Russia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and the UK, where qualified people can get jobs even a day before they reach their age of retirement. When average life expectancy was 45 years, age limit for getting government jobs was 27. But now that average life expectancy is 72 in Bangladesh, the age limit for getting a job should also be raised. Increased age limit will provide organisations with the scope to choose the candidates they are looking for from a large number of job aspirants.Unfortunately, the private sector of the country blindly follows the age limit set by the government for entry level jobs. Almost all private organisations including commercial banks, insurance companies and others avoid appointing candidates over 30 years of age. As a result, the private sector does not get experienced manpower. Moreover, there are some job-aspirants who cross the age limit of 30 for different reasons including session jam, going abroad for higher education, joining a private job, etc. Then there are people who after serving in the private sector or in foreign countries want to get jobs in the public sector. These potential candidates just cannot apply after the age of 30 due to current age limit criteria. Md Ashraf Hossain,Bashabo, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
