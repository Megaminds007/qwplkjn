By contrast, BJP\u2019s presence was confined to the main roads. It hadn\u2019t yet successfully penetrated to lanes and alleyways of the city.\nRead full story on TOI+\n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s a near-universal phenomenon: The cult of youth. Books to movies and music, most countries\u2019 cultural indicators would have us believe that it is their young who are really living it up. While the elders are sighing it down. In reality, the picture is rather uneven. This is an interesting aspect of World Happiness Report 2024. It highlights a wider social science finding that there is divergence between countries on whether the young or the old report greater life satisfaction. India, interestingly, is an outlier among its income-group peers.\n\nHappy old men |\u00a0Generally, high-income countries report overlapping increases in age and life satisfaction. Highly representative of this income-group is US, with those under 30 seriously lagging those 60 and older. Many experts put the blame squarely on social media and an overall decline in \u201cpro-social behaviour\u201d. India is at a very different stage of economic development. What would explain younger people already showing lower life satisfaction here?\nHappier old women |\u00a0Equally interestingly, higher levels of life satisfaction are reported for older Indian women than older men. Here, too, a crucial hinge is older women\u2019s wider and more diverse social networks, including more friends and confidants. Loneliness can be hydra-headed in its impact on perception and memory, leading one to attach more importance to the negative aspects of one\u2019s life.\nGroup pic |\u00a0Thinking seriously about these fuzzy matters is quite important. Not to lock everyone into the same idyllic picture of youth or age. Or push some draconian mass treatment. Individual experience of well-being forms the bedrock of the collective experience. Policymakers need to learn the right lessons, to nudge the collective in the direction of greater overall well-being.\nYoung and stuck |\u00a0The shortage of quality jobs has to be taking a toll. Fixing this is obviously imperative. But another reason Indian and US youth could be experiencing something similar despite living in different-stage economies, is that the smartphone became our nerveline at the same time. In both countries, influencers could be shaping unrealistic expectations of work-life balance to comparable degrees.\nHoli-by-self |\u00a0There will be infinite Holi selfies today. And these will tell us little about how much happy exchange of colours is taking place between family, friends and strangers. Watching cricket on a personal screen is one thing, playing it in the neighbourhood gully quite another, endorphins wise.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The making of a nation is the ultimate occasion for celebration because it recognises the uniqueness of a people and sets extra energies to burst forth for realisation of their collective dreams. But not all nations emerge in an environment of peace and poise; instead, for some it is tortuous and bloody enough to allow them the luxury of savouring the day's significance. The Bangalees had the misfortune of suffering under the yokes of two successive colonial regimes before they finally overcame those to claim their rightful place in the comity of nations. For them the Day of the Independence was not the day of deliverance; rather the night before saw the beginning of one of history's worst genocides against them. So the indiscriminate killing of people including some of the best sons of this soil the night before casts a grim shadow on the day's celebration. When the sun kissed the eastern horizon at dawn fifty-three years ago this day, the people knew they were pitted against a brutal enemy that is not only dead set to subjugate them but also exterminate them if possible. The memory brings immense pain and agony for those who have lost their near and dear ones or were a witness to the massacre. The event of the day was the beginning of a nine-month ordeal, humanitarian crisis, tragic loss of lives and property and sacrifice. But had all this been the story of this nation, it would never become sovereign and independent. The brutality and atrocities of the Pakistani army brought out the best in the Bangalee people. Their steely resolve to defend themselves and also defeat the marauding army triumphed ultimately to free their motherland. Sure enough, the nation had to pay a heavy price for their independence: three million lives were sacrificed and about 300,000 women suffered the ultimate dishonour.Against such a grim perspective, the nation pays tributes to the martyrs and the freedom fighters who survived the war. But the offering has waned into a mere ritualistic ceremony. The governing motive that went into spurring the Language Movement from 1952-56, and the subsequent 1962 Education Movement, the 6-point movement in 1966, the mass uprising of 1969 before the nation's liberation was the creation of an exploitation-free and equalitarian society. Unfortunately, the country has failed to live up to this most cherished mission and today it is riven by atrocious social discrimination and disparities with oligarchy reigning supreme. The best tribute the nation could pay to the founding fathers, the martyrs and freedom fighters was by relentlessly striving for establishment of the rule of law, economic justice, cultural and religious freedom for all the citizens. Notwithstanding its wealth creation and progress on many fronts, the nation wobbles on upholding the ideals and principles that propelled its journey to freedom. By living up to those ideals development must be redefined in order to ensure that all members of society get the opportunity to savour the fruits of Independence.",

        "full_article": "We were part of the team that completed one of the most extensive collections of documents on the History of the war of Independence. The 15 volumes are almost entirely based on official narratives/documents, which are official- governmental and administrative or political. However some volumes are partially based on oral evidence. They relate to genocide and the military war. The last volume is a collection of interviews which were done as many aspects were not known and they were expected to fill the gaps. The genocide-related documents were partly collected from the Bangla Academy archive on the events of 1971.. These documents were handed over to the History Project in 1980. Although they are not always consistently reliable or thoroughly corroborated, they contain many experiences of suffering and genocide, individual and collective that occurred in 1971. The other volumes that contain some narrated documents are the 3 on military activities of the war. It's a good indicator that the war itself was not formal and documenting was not done systematically. It also includes narratives by non-officers and civilian freedom fighters ( FFs) Another great source of info are materials that were published in the media and interviews taken by the History project researchers. It should also be noted that the army office didn't wish to share the information with the History project. This was also the case with several ministries including the Foreign Ministry. Later, the army published several volumes of history and they are available for public consumption. The fate of other official Mujibnagar documents is not known. It was around the early 80s that I was struck by the absence of women in the history of 1971. They were half of the population but except for the mentions in the genocide and repression volume they were absent from any records. So in many ways, it had become a historical documentation of the men's war. But why were women absent? It's from this point that I began to question the limitations of our own work, that is formal historiography. A history of a liberation war by all definitions should be inclusive but it wasn't because documents only reflect the formal and the official point of view. It's as if the records of the state making had decided that their role was not significant enough to be recorded. They could only be allowed to be victims in the historical narrative and their experience limited to only 1 volume, symbolically speaking. As time went on, I realized we historians had excluded not just women but society at large. Officials, politicians and the powerful had found space in history but not ordinary people including women. To an extent, it was an inevitable by- product of mainstream historiography and its limitations generated by its role in providing legitimacy to the ruling class. Building an inclusive history process never took off because the ruling class didn't need it. If anything they needed was to avoid it.In 2001, I finished producing a documentary on 1971 as an executive producer of Ekushey TV but the authorities refused to air it. We had focused on ordinary people and also lesser known facts and elements of 1971 and the contents didn't fit the ideas that the TV channel had of 1971. They had the right to exercise that option but the raw footage was not preserved and all were so damaged by neglect that several hundred hours of primary history source materials were lost forever.We then decided to do a documentary of our own on Women and 1971. The effort was supported by the Grameen Trust and we felt free as we had no political axe to grind so it was great. We chose women for the reasons explained above. Our objective was to show society in 1971 and we realized that the best entry point were the narratives of women. Here are some excerpts from the documentary. ROKEYA BEGUM  Rokeya Begum was expecting a child when the war broke out. Her husband used to bring his fellow freedom fighters home that Rokeya used to feed. This brought the wrath of the Razakars upon Rokeya. Following their threat Rokeya decided to take food to the nearby island where the freedom fighters were camped. To make sure that she was not being followed by anyone Rokeya used to get out at night and reach the island on a boat steering all by herself. She also used to keep their weapons in the well of her house. Sometimes the FFs spent nights in her house and on those nights Rokeya would stay awake to keep a watch. \"People said many things, I am a bad woman, I go out alone at night and chat with the Muktis\u2026But fortunately my husband always stood beside me\". \"WIDOW'S VILLAGE SHOGAPUR Shohagpur Kakurkandi is located in Sherpur district. One early morning, on the 10th of Srabon, a company of Pakistan army soldiers swooped down and killed the male in the village. It gained the name, the \"widow's village\" but while the massacre is mentioned, the tale of survival is less told. These widows worked as labourers in the Nalitabari market and did farm work which they had not done before. They not only buried their husbands and male children but looked after the survivors and made sure none died. They starved themselves but didn't let their children die of hunger. In many ways, this was the most symbolic face of Bangladesh in 1971, suffering but resilient with an overwhelming will to go on living and helping others survive.And it's on standing in these households that society itself survived in 1971. That's where the root and core of 1971 history lie. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Like any other developing country, out-of-pocket expenditures for healthcare eat up a significant portion of family income in Bangladesh. A study done by the Health Economics Unit (HEU) under the Health Service Division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare found that in Bangladesh, the money spent on medicine in a year comes from four sources. And among those, families are placed at the top as they spend the highest amount. In fact, families from their own income bear 94 per cent of the cost for medicine. The government spends 6 per cent of the cost, while from the development partners come 0.37 per cent and from the nongovernment/private agencies 0.12 per cent. The information, however, is dated as the HEU has come up with its findings through analysing the data of national health account of 2020. The HEU's findings further show that 86 per cent of the medicines produced in the country go to the pharmacies. And out of every 100 taka spent during treatment at a health clinic, a patient's out-of-pocket expenditure is more than 68 taka. And of course, the lion's share is spent on medicine and as noted in the foregoing, 94 per cent of the cost is borne by families. Hospital services cover 10 per cent of a patient's total expenditure, diagnostic tests cover 12 per cent and the rest is spent on transportation. The sum and substance of the HEU study is that patients and their families are actually bearing around 75 per cent of the treatment cost, which health economists would like to term out-of-pocket expenditure (oope). And the government's share in the public's healthcare expenditure is negligible. How does the public meet their healthcare-related expenses? Obviously, they have to earmark a large chunk of their family income for healthcare purposes and the share of this amount is increasing with the passage of time. And in case, there is need for surgery or other types of expensive medical intervention, a patient or her/his family may have to dispose of valuables, in many cases landed properties, to meet treatment costs. For low income families, such health emergencies are like a death sentence. Instances abound where families go broke after paying the medical bill for the treatment of a (family) member. Health experts view this as a major barrier to introducing universal healthcare in the country. So, to ensure sustainable healthcare, the government should increase its share of expenditures on medicine, health experts opine. Also, it is time health insurance is introduced.Actually, what the health economics unit of the health service division tells in figures, the public already know from their day-to-day experience. And it is hardly surprising that medicines dominate the scene. What one would find on a doctor's prescription is a long list of drugs and tests. And outside a doctor's chamber one would often come across more representatives from drug companies than patients. And as soon as a patient comes out of the doctor's chamber, the people from drug companies, also called medical representatives, will start jostling and shoving one another to have a view of what medicines the doctor has prescribed for the patient in question. So, what can the doctors, or for that matter the government, do? It is an era of commerce and the government has to promote business, whatever its nature.Universal health care is no doubt a great idea to discuss at forums organised by those concerned about public health. But in practice, it has remained a utopia. So, the best the government can do is at least keep lifesaving drugs, some 1,500 in number, according to the Directorate of Drug Administration (DGDA), affordable for the common people. And, at the same time, elongate the list of medicines (now 117 in number) whose prices it can dictate. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, buyers must ensure the value of the gold before making a purchase, as gold is not only a precious metal for adornment but also a significant investment for future savings.Investing in gold can serve as a cornerstone for your future, as its value is one that never diminishes. The global gold market is currently valued at approximately 14 trillion dollars. Gold ornaments have been a part of Bengali culture for centuries, serving both as a form of adornment and financial security.To ensure the quality and purity of gold jewelry, hallmarking has emerged as a crucial process. Hallmarking involves testing the jewelry on various machines and conducting lab tests to confirm its value and authenticity. The hallmark logo, company name, and carat are all mentioned in one mark, ensuring customer satisfaction and confidence in the shopkeeper.Hallmarked jewelry is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it ensures the right quality of the customer's hard-earned jewelry. Secondly, it prevents the sale of self-made ornaments with fake hallmarks, which is illegal. To obtain a hallmark, the value must be determined, and a lab test certificate must be provided. Therefore, all customers are advised to request hallmark and gold test reports before purchasing gold ornaments.The importance of hallmarked gold jewelry cannot be overstated. It guarantees the authenticity, purity, and value of the gold ornament, providing the buyer peace of mind and ensuring the longevity of the investment. As the festive season approaches, buyers must be aware of these factors and make informed decisions when purchasing gold jewelry.\nMd. Asifur RahmanStudent, BBANorth South University",
