Much of the frustrations of ordinary people could be handled better only if public rights and the government's obligation to citizens were at all on the radar of our bureaucrats and planners.\nIt is true that governments often need to take unpopular decisions. Among them, raising prices of essentials is the most troubling both for the government and the citizens. For the former, it leads to an immediate decrease in popularity and general unrest, and for the latter, an increased economic burden, making life more difficult to bear.\nA good example of that is the government's decision to raise fuel prices on November 3. On that day, the government raised the prices of diesel and kerosene by 23 percent, from Tk 65 to Tk 80\u2014two items that directly impact the economy and the lives of the most disadvantaged segment of society. The total consumption of diesel is four million tonnes, 70 percent of which is used by the transport sector and 20 percent by the farmers. Kerosene's total demand is 100,000 tonnes, mainly used for cooking, lighting and aviation fuel.\nTwo reasons were given for the rise: One, too great a price difference between India and ourselves will lead to fuel smuggling. How will this be stopped with diesel price being Rs 101.56 as of November 1, which is equivalent to Tk 124.41 per litre, while our diesel will now cost Tk 80? Price differential of Tk 44.41 per litre (more than 50 percent) will remain, which is sufficiently a big margin for smuggling to continue. So, this argument does not hold water.\nThe second reason was straightforward: the rise in international prices. In the July-September period, the average price of oil shot up by 71 percent to USD 73 per barrel. Then in October, it hit USD 83.7. So, we must raise our prices\u2014was the government's logic. The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) was losing Tk 20 crore a day. This bleeding had to stop, and raising the price by 23 percent would be the minimum that they could live with.\nThe energy ministry's logic is that domestic prices will have to reflect international prices, and since diesel and kerosene prices have gone up, so must the prices at the consumer end. We would have found this argument acceptable if domestic prices were actually adjusted with the fluctuating international oil prices, meaning our prices not only go up, but also reverses when the international prices dip. But it seldom does\u2014and when it does, there is only a marginal adjustment.\nImmediately after the Covid-19 pandemic struck the world and the global economy slumped, oil prices came down to USD 27 per barrel. From 2015 to 2021, the BPC made a profit of Tk 43,138 crore. Where did this \"profit\" come from? From the public, who were forced to pay a much higher price for diesel and kerosene than they should have had to, as the international prices were quite low. By what right did the energy ministry extract additional payment from ordinary citizens? It is, in our view, equivalent to a form of extortion by the government under a false pretence.\nIf we accept BPC's claim that it is losing Tk 20 crore a day, then the yearly loss roughly comes to Tk 7,300 crore\u2014far less money than what PK Halder robbed from our banks. This could have easily been offset from BPC's accumulated profit from the last six years. Even today, in the midst of our pandemic recovery, the government will earn a near equivalent amount from VAT and duties on fuel, which it can use to pay the BPC, thereby obviating the need for energy price hike. But the energy ministry chose to \"extract\" the money from the consumers, who are mostly lower middle-class, if not downright poor, and risking gravely damaging our economic recovery.\nWhich brings us to the question of timing. Why now? Just when we are recovering from Covid, just when our exporters are beginning to put their feet on the ground, when our domestic manufacturers are steadily putting their houses in order, when our labourers are beginning to find jobs, entrepreneurs are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel, just when our farmers\u2014who kept us well-fed during the height of the pandemic\u2014are finding a way out of their depressed situation, to suddenly impose a price hike that will hurt us the most appears more like a sabotage of our recovery than a policy to ensure our growth.\nNobody benefits from this, except the BPC and its parent ministry. It appears that people's\u2014if I may dare say, the government's\u2014interest has been set aside to serve that of a corporation.\nThe price hike hit at the very root of the transport sector\u2014which acts as the pivot in maintaining market stability\u2014forcing the owners of these vehicles to raise fares. But they also took advantage of the situation to demand a hike in fares far higher than was necessary. Though the government said it was 28 percent, the market reality was 50 percent. For the transport owners, it was a golden opportunity to hold the public hostage and force the government's hand, under the threat of strike, to concede to their proposals. The bus and truck owners claimed that the last fare hike was in 2015, which for launch owners was in 2013. Hence, all their pending demands had to be fulfilled now.\nFinally comes the issue of the method in which the government implemented the fuel price rise.\nThere is a practice of holding a hearing in which stakeholders' voices are given a play. Whether they are ever taken into consideration, we have very little evidence of. But the ritual is held and, if nothing else, the media covers it so that the people come to know, at least, what are the issues at stake.\nThis time around, even this ritual was not held, bypassing the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) which usually hosts these hearings. Why? So far we have had no answer. As a result, the declaration of the price hike took everybody\u2014save those who were responsible for formulating it\u2014by total surprise. The first people to react were the transport owners, whose vehicles stayed off the road and demanded new passenger tariffs to be fixed before they resumed their services. After three days' strike and the resultant public sufferings, the government increased bus fares by 28 percent and launch fares by 43 percent. The BPC's interest as well as the bus, truck and launch owners' interest were served.\nGuess whose interest has not been served? You are right, the interest of the people\u2014the daily commuters. They have no union, no lobby group, no rich benefactor. Our public representatives are supposed to represent them. But the reality is that most of them have their own respective economic axes to grind. Where is the time to think of the public? Our parliament has much better and more important things to do. People thought they had votes that they could cast every five years and bring their wishes to the fore. Since that does not count\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014anymore, they have no option but to accept whatever is made to come their way.\nLet's do some common-sense reasoning. The bureaucrats of the energy ministry and that of the BPC knew full well what the impact of raising fuel prices would be on the economy, and how ordinary people would suffer. They also knew very well that transport owners of all types would make all sorts of exaggerated demands and, through a sudden strike, force the government to accept their demands. Knowing all this, shouldn't they have had some sort of a dialogue with the relevant stakeholders first? The fare hike could have easily been calculated based on the 23 percent hike of diesel and kerosene prices, agreed upon, signed and sealed and then made public, saying that from such and such date, fuel prices will be raised by the government and all those sectors affected by it will be allowed a rise of fares as detailed. This would have saved the public so much trouble and hardship.\nInstead, a chaos followed in which commuters suffered immeasurably. The decision to raise fuel prices was taken on November 3. It came to the press on November 4. No high-level meeting was held till the following Sunday\u2014due to Friday and Saturday being weekend holidays\u2014after three days of harassment, physical suffering and precious loss of time for the poor and the ordinary. When meetings did take place, they only formalised the owners' demands, as if the fuel price rise was actually an excuse for the government to sanction price rises for the bus and launch owners.\nIt is our view that such things happen because of a fundamental disrespect for anybody who is not a part of either the officialdom or the ruling party of the day.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh ranks third in the world among the countries most hit by natural disasters. Its low elevation and high population density make it particularly vulnerable to these climate hazards, including cyclones, flooding and rising sea levels.\nDespite these odds, Bangladesh is recognised as a success story due to its climate action policy, which includes strong community-wide training, education campaigns, anticipatory and preparatory action, and significant infrastructure investments. As the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) enters its final week, we have an opportunity to reflect on and recognise some leading climate change and environmental initiatives taken by Bangladesh.\nThe presence of close to one million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in 34 congested camps in Cox's Bazar district\u2014the largest concentration of refugees globally\u2014also poses additional climate related challenges. In the first six months following the arrival of more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees in 2017, the Bangladesh government generously allowed them to find refuge in an area spanning over 6,000sq-m of natural forest reserve. The rapid influx and a lack of preparation led to trees being cut down to set up shelters, and the timbers used as firewood for cooking and covering the refugees' most basic needs. In turn, this led to increased risks of landslides and flooding in the camps, not only posing grave risks to the lives of the refugees, but also adding to one of Bangladesh's, and the region's, main environmental challenges\u2014deforestation.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian actors, together with the Bangladesh government, are working to \"build back better\" by enhancing the resilience of the refugees and the local communities both to climate-related risks, including cyclones and monsoons, and environmental risks such as land degradation, soil erosion, and deforestation.\nMore than 3,000 Bangladeshis and Rohingya refugees have received training on how to manage tree nurseries, plant and care for seedlings, and protect young trees. Through the \"regreening\" project supported by the UNHCR, they have replanted over 600 hectares and added grasses at streams to help treat wastewater and reduce pollution levels.\nThe volunteers' tasks also include replanting trees ripped out by landslides, protecting wildlife, and raising awareness in their communities about the need to protect the forests in the lush corner of southern Bangladesh. Trained volunteers also carry out disaster risk reduction activities, including slope stabilisation to mitigate exposure to landslides and land degradation during monsoon.\nThe success of reforestation has also depended on the introduction of clean cooking alternatives, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), to the local and refugee communities. This has prevented people from requiring 700 tonnes of firewood every day to meet essential needs. Since September 2018, the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have provided over 70 million kilograms of LPG to both Bangladeshis and Rohingyas living in the Cox's Bazar district.\nThe introduction of LPG has also yielded social cohesion dividends between refugee and local communities, reducing tensions related to the deforestation on host community land, and has had additional benefits for the communities themselves, reducing cooking times and allowing women to focus on other tasks, including gardening and supporting their children's education. Notably, incidences of gender-based violence have also reduced as women no longer have to walk long distances alone, sometimes in the dark, to collect firewood for cooking. Use of LPG also freed up shelters and homes from smoke and toxic gases, which are harmful to health.\nAs part of a community-wide training initiative, over 200,000 individuals in the Bangladeshi and refugee communities in Cox's Bazar received information or training on how to respond in case of an elephant encounter, as the forest is home to the famous and endangered Asian elephant. With additional support, 100 Elephant Response Teams have been formed and equipped. They help ensure community safety by preventing human-elephant encounters, reducing the number of human deaths from 14 in 2017, to zero since the programme started in 2018. The success of this collaboration can also be witnessed by the recent birth of 10 baby elephants, marking huge strides in protecting the critically endangered species.\nTo anticipate and prepare for recurring seasonal weather events such as cyclones, over 2,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshi volunteers have been trained by the UNHCR partners to hoist warning flags, make loudspeaker announcements, evacuate households in flood-prone areas, and be first responders to damage in the camps in the initial hours following landfall. Their training has built extraordinary community resilience and saved lives. These are just some examples of the UNHCR's commitment to empowering refugees and their host communities to prepare for, and adapt to, the impacts of climate change in Bangladesh. There are hundreds more.\nCapacity sharing and strengthening initiatives among the government, local population, refugees, and humanitarians play a key role in empowering individuals to build resilience and disseminate knowledge within their communities to create a better future for all.\nCOP26 has reignited the urgency of climate action across the globe. At the UNHCR, we commit to providing support to affected countries and displaced communities who have the least amount of resources to prepare and adapt. We also encourage the meaningful participation and leadership of the displaced people in the planning and implementation of climate action policies. In Bangladesh, we reiterate our commitment to continue to \"build back better\" in Cox's Bazar, and support Bangladesh to continue their climate action work and sharing of innovative climate action practices at a global level.\n\u00a0\nJohannes van der Klaauw is the UNHCR representative in Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "We are not really aware of how much we use plastic materials in our day-to-day lives. From our daily grocery and vegetable shopping to ordering food online, from buying soft drinks and juices to the much-needed bottled water\u2014we end up using and storing all kinds of plastic and polythene bags, without even realising it. The only time we realise just how much plastic we have piled up is when we try to reuse or discard the empty bags, packets, boxes and containers of food items. While we can reuse some of the materials, most of them cannot be reused and go straight into the garbage bins.\nThe other day, I went to the food court of a shopping mall in the city with a friend. We were impressed to find a small shop which was selling only salad items. As we picked the food ourselves into a ceramic bowl and paid for it, the young shopkeeper handed us two sets of plastic forks and spoons. When my friend asked the young man why they were using throwaway plastics, instead of the regular, washable stainless-steel cutlery, he replied that it was difficult for them to wash the regular cutlery, and that plastic cutlery was more convenient. I was horrified to think about the amount of plastic cutlery the shop must be throwing away every single day, which eventually end up in our landfills, drains, canals, and eventually into the rivers.\nThe use of throwaway plastic materials is so pervasive in Dhaka that even the vendors who sell achar or bhorta of seasonal fruits on the streets use them without a second thought these days, whereas even a few years ago, they would use sheets of old newspapers to serve street food.\nMany of the items that we purchase during our rounds to the groceries or the kitchen markets\u2014chocolates, biscuits, powdered milk, sugar, salt, flour, etc\u2014can be packaged in a more environment-friendly way. For example, I used to buy tins of powdered milk imported from the UK. At first, I thought the beautiful tins were made of plastic, so I decided to reuse them. I only realised that it was actually made of paper when I went to wash it. It was amazing how the company had used paper to make this durable tin to package this essential baby food that is exported around the world.\nWhile one may argue that Bangladesh is not technologically advanced enough to improve the packaging of food items in a way that is eco-friendly and sustainable in the long run, I believe it has more to do with our lack of willingness to do so and less to do with our technological constraints. Our scientists have already invented jute polymer and biodegradable packaging materials from corn, which could be used as alternatives to polythene. Reportedly, jute polymer is not only biodegradable, but it is 1.5 times stronger than polythene, and both water- and air-resistant. Has the government come forward to support the scientists, or taken any steps for mass production of these polythene alternatives? Bangladesh, being one of the major jute producing countries in the world, should have also done more to produce and popularise the use of traditional jute bags among the people.\nThe result of our indifference is that plastic pollution has increased at an alarming rate in our country. Polythene bags and other single-use plastic items can be found everywhere\u2014from the roadsides and dustbins to the landfills, from the drains and canals to the rivers. According to the Earth Day Network, Bangladesh was the 10th most plastic-polluting country in the world in 2018. Plastic contributes eight percent of the country's waste, which is equivalent to 800,000 tonnes. Reportedly, plastic waste has gone up from 178 tonnes per day in 2005 to 646 tonnes per day in 2020 in Dhaka city alone. Every year, around 300,000 tonnes of plastic waste are dumped into the water bodies and open spaces in the country.\nPlastic pollution has become a serious threat to the Buriganga River's survival. While the tanneries that were situated on the bank of the river have been relocated to Savar to prevent the dumping of industrial waste into the river, it has not been possible to save this once-mighty river from plastic pollution. This daily has published many reports and photos over the years, exposing how the river has been polluted by polythene and single-use plastic bottles, which have filled up the riverbed.\nThe Turag, the Shitalakkhya and many other rivers flowing through the country are facing similar threats. Reportedly, the dredging of many of these rivers in recent times were obstructed due to the massive amount of polythene and plastic items accumulating at the bottom of the rivers. A report published by this newspaper in March this year revealed how the cost of dredging of the Karnaphuli River had increased due to the thick layer of plastic waste stored in the riverbed. What is even more concerning is the fact that, every year, about 200,000 tonnes of plastics flows into the Bay of Bengal from Bangladesh, exposing marine resources and fisheries to microplastics, which they consume and eventually die.\nThe problem is all-pervasive, and resolving this requires a strong commitment from all stakeholders. Stringent actions from the government, public awareness, workable alternatives to plastics and a sustainable plastic waste management system are all necessary to tackle the plastic menace in our country. It is incomprehensible as to why, being the first country in the world to impose a ban on polythene bag use in 2002, we have failed to enforce it to this day. Despite the High Court ordering the government to strictly enforce the ban across the country through regular market monitoring in 2020, polythene bags are still openly sold and used under the very nose of the law enforcement officials, who take no action against the violators of the rule. Sadly, the government has still not managed to close down the illegal polythene manufacturing factories in the country, as directed by the High Court.\nOn January 6, 2020, the High Court gave another directive to the authorities concerned to ban single-use plastic products in coastal areas, hotels, motels and restaurants across the country within a year. More than a year has passed since then, but no visible progress has been made on that front either.\nIt is true that as a country we are still lagging behind in terms of formulating and enforcing regulations to curb plastic use, developing a proper waste management system where plastic waste can be segregated at their sources, setting up recycling facilities, and coming up with more biodegradable alternatives to plastic and establishing the facilities for their mass-scale production. But what could possibly be the reason for not complying with the government-imposed ban and the High Court's directives in this regard?\nWhile we must ask these questions to the authorities concerned, and hold them accountable for not abiding by the state-imposed rules, we also need to raise awareness among the public of the environmental hazards created by single-use plastics and polythene bags. It is also important to look at ourselves, see what we are doing at an individual level to reduce our consumption of plastics and reuse them where possible. Some small changes in our day-to-day behaviour can go a long way in protecting our environment from the curse of plastic pollution.\n\u00a0\nNaznin Tithi is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "A diverse diet is the key to good nutrition. However, in South Asia, diets have been traditionally cereal-heavy; in Bangladesh, about 70 percent of daily energy intake per person comes from cereals. Our diets need to be diversified urgently, and two categories of \"nutrient-dense\" food are particularly important: fruits and vegetables; and food from animal sources, i.e. eggs, milk and meat. The vitamins and minerals in these food groups are critical to many aspects of our well-being, such as cognitive development, good eyesight, adequate socio-emotional abilities, and healthy immune systems. Fruits and vegetables also offer protection against heart disease, stroke and some cancers. Animal source foods are important in preventing childhood stunting and the lifelong disadvantage that stunting brings. In Bangladesh, over 50 percent of children and women of reproductive age are affected by micronutrient deficiency\u2014a lack of vitamins and minerals. Around 36 percent of children under the age of five are stunted, 14 percent are wasted (parts of or full body emaciated), and 33 percent are underweight. Meanwhile, 22 percent of children in Bangladesh are born with a low birth weight. While providing nutrient supplements or fortifying foods addresses specific deficiencies, dietary diversification, with particular reference to nutrient-dense foods, holds the key to holistic progress.\nHowever, South Asia has a long way to go in this regard. For example, in Bangladesh, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the average fruit and vegetable intake was only 203.8 grams per person per day in 2018, compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark of 400 grams per person per day. The shares of vegetable expenditure and fruit expenditure in the total food expenditure are only 9.24 percent and 3.77 percent, respectively. While overconsumption of some animal source foods has potentially negative implications for health and the environment, Bangladesh is currently among the consumers of the least amount of meat and milk in the world on average\u2014despite being ranked 12th for livestock production. Even these averages do not paint the full picture, and there are significant segments of the population\u2014often the poorest\u2014who consume much less.\nHow can this situation be improved? We would argue that the key solution lies in understanding the markets for nutrient-dense foods and supporting these markets to deliver these foods affordably and equitably. In South Asia, we have good experience in improving the consumption of producers\u2014e.g. via home gardens. This is very important, but to spread the benefits of nutrient-dense foods to the wider population, including the poorest and the landless, we need the market mechanism to make these foods widely available and more affordable for all.\nOften, when thinking about markets, the tendency is to focus on the upstream parts of the value chains\u2014e.g. connecting farmers to markets, improving farm storage, etc. These are vital first steps in encouraging nutrient-dense food production, getting more produce on to the market, and eventually lowering prices for consumers. How can we ensure that the market system puts these nutrient-dense foods within the reach of the poor and the nutritionally vulnerable? This is not an easy challenge. In a research project called Market Intervention for Nutritional Improvement (MINI), we have been investigating this question in Jashore, Bangladesh and Bihar, India. One implication of our findings is that some value chain \"upgrades\" that connect farmers to wider markets have the consequence of pushing produce into premium market channels that serve the better-off in cities such as Dhaka, Khulna, Faridpur, etc. There is not much incentive for supplying to smaller, less lucrative markets in small towns and rural areas, where many poor live.\nThese smaller, more neglected markets are often characterised by poor transport connectivity, inadequate market facilities and infrastructure and poor integration into information systems on prices, arrivals, etc. A big challenge with major categories of nutrient-dense foods is that they are marked by high perishability and spoilage, and are prone to food safety hazards. These problems are multiplied in small markets, where there is typically no cold storage and little infrastructure or information available to safely handle food. All of this reduces the incentive for produce to flow towards these markets.\nSo we need a strategy that applies a consumption and equity lens to markets for nutrient-dense foods, focusing on neglected markets and the downstream areas of value chains. This could include developing market information systems that include small markets, investing in small-scale, inexpensive market-side cold storage at small markets, upgrading market facilities more generally, and designing market-based food safety interventions that are appropriate for these markets. At the same time, it is important that behavioural change and other consumer-focused strategies are used to boost the demand for nutrient-dense foods among the populations served by these markets.\nFundamentally, the need of the hour is to think of markets for nutrient-dense foods not only from a farmer perspective as we are used to, but also from a consumption, nutrition and equity perspective. When these markets are supported by appropriate policies, they are capable of delivering nutritious foods at scale in an affordable and efficient way.\nIn the United Nations Food Systems Summit, held on September 23, 2021, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina provided five directives, including nutrition, resilience, and an inclusive food system. For achieving those directives, inclusive markets that better balance the interests of producers and consumers, including the poorest, are a must-have.\n\u00a0\nDr Bhavani Shankar is an economist researching food system and nutrition linkages at the University of Sheffield in the UK.\nDr Mohammad Jahangir Alam is a professor at the Department of Agribusiness and Marketing in Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU).\n",

        "full_article": "According to a report by this daily on November 11, due to the recent hike in diesel price\u2014which has gone up from Tk 65 to Tk 80 per litre\u2014the production cost in the agriculture sector has already increased by at least 30 percent in the northern region of Bangladesh. Reportedly, this hike will not only impact the ongoing harvest of Aman, the production of winter vegetables and Boro paddy will also be affected, since farmers mostly depend on diesel-run machines to cultivate, irrigate, and harvest the crops.\nOver the years, the number of the low-lift pumps, shallow tube-wells and semi-deep tube-wells\u2014used to irrigate the cropland\u2014have increased significantly in the country, and all of these are run by diesel. According to an estimate by the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), 48.5 percent of the region's 691,437 hectares of land, which need irrigation, currently rely on diesel-run pumps. Moreover, the use of combined harvesters, reapers, planters, power tillers, tractors and threshers, which run on diesel, have also increased significantly in the region.\nThis price hike will have an impact on the transportation and fertiliser costs. According to the farmers, the transport service providers have already increased their fares by Tk 200 for transporting paddy of every bigha of land, while the pump owners have increased the irrigation cost by Tk 30 for every hour of irrigation. If things go on like this, the production cost of Boro crop, which makes up more than half of the country's total rice production, will increase by about 15 percent\u2014and many farmers have already decided not to cultivate Boro this season if the price of diesel does not come down.\nUnder these circumstances, in order to save our farmers from incurring losses and to protect them from the burden of additional production cost, the government should reconsider its decision and reduce the price of diesel. It should also consider giving subsidies on fuel prices and other agricultural services to farmers, so that they can not only bear the production cost, but also earn enough to live a decent life.\n",

        "full_article": "On Wednesday, Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujon) placed its final draft of the proposed law titled \"Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioner's Appointment Act, 2021.\" We call on the government to consider their submission with utmost seriousness. Despite the constitution providing for the formulation of a law to establish the Election Commission, no government has taken such an initiative in the last 50 years. That successive governments have ignored such a serious constitutional mandate, which concerns the people's right to democratically elect their own representatives, is alarming for our democracy.\nAgainst the backdrop of widespread mistrust in the Election Commission and an alarming apathy among voters, and with the tenure of the incumbent election commissioners ending in February, now would be the perfect time for the formulation of such a law\u2014which could have previously saved us from a host of election-related controversies. However, with the complete collapse of voter participation in elections\u2014as recently witnessed during the Sylhet-3 by-polls held on September 4, which had only a 34 percent voter turnout, and the Dhaka-10 by-polls on March 21 last year, which saw an embarrassingly low turnout of only around five percent\u2014it is clear that our democracy has never been in more danger and in greater need of such a law. The practice of candidates getting \"elected\" unopposed\u2014for example, when 43 chairman candidates were elected uncontested once 160 union parishads went into elections in September\u2014is indicative of the true state of democracy in Bangladesh, or lack thereof. When neither voters nor opposing candidates feel the need to participate in an election, it is a strong sign that our electoral system has failed.\nThere is only one way to revive our electoral system: to create an environment where free, fair and credible elections can be held, and which are acceptable to the public. Formulating a law that can spell out in detail how election commissioners are to be appointed, through conditions that are satisfactory to the public, different political parties in the country and all other stakeholders, is an essential first step in that process, and there is no other substitute for that. The excuse that there is not enough time to formulate a law is not something that we can accept. There is still plenty of time to frame the law, and experts and eminent citizens have already made that clear, as well as their willingness to help the government in that process.\nIf the ruling party truly believes in its own claim that its popularity has never been higher, then it should not be afraid to work overtime to create a conducive environment to hold free, fair and credible elections. The conditions necessary for such elections should be made clear through law. Most other South Asian countries have been successful in formulating such laws\u2014then why can't we? It is clear that it isn't because of a lack of time or any other factor. The only thing that we see missing is the political will. And mustering that up is where the true challenge lies.\n",
