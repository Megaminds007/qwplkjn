Governor Anusuiya Uikey did not issue the notification summoning the House, even though the Cabinet had advised her on August 4 itself to call for the session on August 21. The delay on the part of Raj Bhavan in issuing the notification is presumably due to the political and law and order situation in the State. Legislators of Kuki ethnicity, across party affiliations, have expressed their inability to attend the Assembly session due to the prevailing atmosphere, as violence continues in parts of the State. It is unlikely that the Governor is unaware of the constitutional position that she is bound by the advice of the government with regard to summoning the Assembly. A Constitution Bench had made this clear in Nabam Rebia (2016). Whether the Governor is guided by her own wisdom or the Union government\u2019s assessment of the situation, it is difficult to justify the failure to hold the Assembly session as sought by the Council of Ministers. The last session of the Manipur Assembly was held in March, and the House has to meet again before the expiry of six months from its previous sitting. The period ends on September 2.There have been both political and civil society demands for the Assembly to meet and discuss the violence that broke out early in May over a High Court order that directed the Manipur government to respond to a communication from the Union Ministry for Tribal Affairs on recommending the grant of Scheduled Tribe status to the Meitei community. The delay on the Governor\u2019s part in notifying the session casts a shadow on the legitimacy and authority of the government headed by Chief Minister N. Biren Singh. The Governor would be well-advised to act on the Cabinet\u2019s recommendation. On another issue, there appears to be an unusual delay in the appointment of Justice Siddharth Mridul, a judge of the Delhi High Court, as the Manipur High Court\u2019s Chief Justice. The court has been under an Acting Chief Justice for several months now. Reports suggest that the Centre has forwarded the Collegium\u2019s recommendation to the State government for its consent. The question arises whether any constitutional functionary in the State is holding back the process. The chain of events set off by an order passed by the Acting Chief Justice has already witnessed much violence and disorder, and the State should not lapse into further constitutional disarray. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nGovernor\n\n/\n\nReservation\n\n/\n\ntribals\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\nconstitution",

It is often in the vanguard of creating a more equal society, of seeking to eliminate outdated notions of male exceptionalism and nudging the world at large to embrace broader social reform. The FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, which ended on Sunday following Spain\u2019s narrow 1-0 victory over England, forms a crucial part of this movement. Under the dazzling Sydney night sky, a whopping 75,784 fans at Stadium Australia witnessed Spain lift its maiden World Cup to join Germany as one of only two nations to have secured both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s titles. The Guardian reported that an average of 30,000 fans attended each match over the course of a month in Australia and New Zealand and nearly two million tickets \u2014 a record \u2014 were bought. These are astonishing numbers for a standalone women\u2019s event, the kind of which has suffered from administrator and spectator apathy in the past. Much of it was down to the on-field excellence, with the likes of Spain\u2019s Aitana Bonmati, the player of the tournament, Olga Carmona, who scored the winning goals for Spain in both the semifinal and final, Japan\u2019s Hinata Miyazawa, the highest goal-scorer (5), and England\u2019s Mary Earps, the best goalkeeper, mesmerising the audience.The World Cup also showcased the wide geographic spread of women\u2019s football. Where nations from Europe and South America have been the hegemonic forces among men, in the short nine-edition history of the women\u2019s event, only four times have the winners come from these two regions \u2014 Germany twice, Norway and now Spain. In 2023, Germany, apart from being upset by Colombia, crashed out in the group stage. Japan, the 2011 world champion, hammered eventual winner Spain 4-0 in the preliminary round. Morocco made history by qualifying for the round of 16 while hosts Australia\u2019s fourth-place finish was its best ever. Four-time champion United States of America, marshalled by the retiring star Megan Rapinoe, missed the podium for the first time, but it just proved the tournament\u2019s overall depth in quality. As Marta, the legendary Brazilian who played her sixth and final World Cup, said, \u201cWhen I started there were no idols in women\u2019s football. Twenty years later, we have become a reference for many women....\u201d To harness this positive energy, governing body FIFA has a lot of heavy-lifting to do. Addressing the massive remuneration gap between men and women \u2014 a World Cup prize money purse of $440 million against $152 million \u2014 can be a good start in the long road towards normalising sporting excellence by women. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nsoccer\n\n/\n\nSpain\n\n/\n\nAustralia\n\n/\n\nNew Zealand\n\n/\n\nJapan",

        "full_article": "Suddenly, Tamil Nadu\u2019s fishing community is having a good catch. And it\u2019s coming from the land, not the sea. Addressing a conference in Mandapam last week, chief minister M K Stalin announced increasing financial assistance to fishermen during the annual fishing ban from \u20b9`5,000 to \u20b9`8,000, loans to 45,000 fishermen and house pattas to 5,000. More: Subsidy for kerosene will be 3,700 litres, up from 3,400 litres; those with motorised boats will get 4,400 litres, up by 400 litres.\n\nAnd then came the big one: Retrieving Katchatheevu islet from Sri Lanka will be the only solution to the problem of Tamil Nadu fishermen being attacked and captured by the Sri Lankan navy. \u201cThe continuing attack on our fishermen means the Narendra Modi government is weak,\u201d the chief minister said. That was a few days after Modi said Indira Gandhi was responsible for ceding the islet off the Ramanathapuram coast to Sri Lanka in 1974. While being criticised for sailing with the Congress that was in power then, Stalin has taken pains to explain that M Karunanidhi, then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, had opposed the Union government\u2019s decision.\nAlmost a month before Stalin looked seaward, BJP state president K Annamalai had kicked off his six-month-long \u2018En mannu, en makkal\u2019 (my land, my people) campaign in Kanyakumari in Amit Shah\u2019s presence. Of the 1,068km, he plans to cover in six months, Annamalai has trudged mostly through the coastal districts in the south as the BJP let float the rumour that Modi may contest the 2024 polls from Ramanathapuram. With the general elections less than nine months away, we can expect other politicians to soon make a beeline to the beaches. Edappadi Palaniswami, who has been busy organising the golden jubilee conference of the AIADMK in Madurai, could be the next.\nPoliticians have long ago identified coastal hamlets as a catchment area for votes. The numbers show why: Tamil Nadu, has the second longest coastline (1,076km) in the country, after Gujarat (1,215km). Fifteen of the 38 districts in Tamil Nadu have a shoreline. This means the fishing community will be a decisive factor in almost half of the 40 Lok Sabha seats (including Puducherry).\nWhat makes this constituency \u2013 the coast that spreads from Kanyakumari in the south to Tiruvallur in the north \u2013 crucial for all parties is that it, unlike some regions which are considered strongholds of either the DMK or the AIADMK, is relatively fluid (they did go with the wave during the big wins) in its affiliation towards a party or a leader. The exception was MGR, who endeared himself to the fishermen community with his 1977 movie \u2018Meenava Nanban\u2019 (Fisherman\u2019s Friend). The demography too makes it complex: There are at least 18 castes within the fishing community of more than 10 lakh that includes about 65% Hindus, 25% Christians, who are concentrated along the southern coast, and 10% Muslims.\nAs parties go fishing ahead of polls, it\u2019s time for fishermen to demand their pound of flesh. Despite the sops and promises, the community continues to live in squalor. While fishermen themselves are often responsible for getting in the crosshairs of the Sri Lankan navy, the government has done precious little to empower them with technologies that can make their lives safer and easier. Tamil Nadu has a marine fisheries production of about five lakh tonnes a year. With remote sensing (to detect fish density) and global positioning system (for navigation), fishing could get much more scientific for the benefit of the fishermen families and the country (in terms of export revenue), but political masters manage to keep them happy with kerosene and a meagre compensation during fishing bans.\nWhile large sections of fishermen families live in penury, big boat owners, who have earned enough, send their children away from the traditional vocation. Fisherman was the first hunter-gatherer of humankind. He could well be the last to get a decent life.\n\n",

What challenges does India face in pursuing this objective? And should India take proactive steps to promote rupee internationalisation?\nDomestically, a currency such as the rupee serves three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. When the buyer and seller of a product who are both in India transact, the rupee serves as the medium of exchange. Because the price of the product is denominated in the rupee, it also serves as the unit of account. And insofar as the seller may have no immediate use for the rupees but is willing to hold them till such need arises, the rupee also serves as the store of value.\nInternationalisation of the rupee means that it serves one or more of these functions when either the buyer or the seller, or both are located outside India. In the extreme case, think of the rupee as the only currency in circulation in the world. It will then be the medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value domestically as well as internationally.\nRead full story on TOI+\n\n",

Sprucing up of roads and monuments, plastering of summit insignia and other art on public walls, overnight spread of dust-free flora and LED lights \u2013 these have been a few of the common touch-ups for various G20 meetings. There is nothing objectionable about such improvements. Yet, in many cities all this \u2018beautification\u2019 raises questions for citizens. In Mumbai for example, the potholes getting filled for a bit and the curtaining of slums have been criticised as VVIP appeasement. The touch-ups end up highlighting how bad the year-around ground reality is.\n\nThe quality of life in Indian cities suffers not only in comparison to the rich West. Many of our Asian neighbours have also raced far ahead in recent decades. Gated communities have provided private islands of world-class living, but these can hardly be immune to overall urban disrepair. Last year\u2019s flooding of Bengaluru\u2019s elite tech parks served this reminder vividly. This year the rains have combined with substandard drainage to wreak havoc across north India. Still, new flyovers remain louder priorities than more sewage treatment plants or drainworks. This pivot on showiness worsens a situation where urban infrastructure has fallen far behind today\u2019s needs, let alone tomorrow\u2019s.\nThere is broad expert consensus on the problem: that there is too little real devolution of powers to local government. An RBI report points out that despite getting constitutional recognition in 1992, there has been no distinct rise in overall municipal revenue since 1946-47. Meaningful urban renewal needs local interests and supervision to be in the driving seat. That\u2019s how citizens\u2019 perspectives get incorporated and they feel connected to various projects. In Pune it did not even take a week after the G20 meeting wrapped up for the \u2018beautified\u2019 stretches to return to \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 full of garbage and empty of flowers.

In the first two days of this week alone, some 400 individuals have been reportedly injured in clashes between BNP activists and members of the AL and police combined. We express our concern over the never-ending nature of confrontational politics where the nation's streets are turning into battlefields, leaving citizens in a constant state of fear and uncertainty.\nThe first of the latest series of clashes took place when BNP activists held road marches in Habiganj, Barguna and Narayanganj, demanding the release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, and law enforcers baton-charged them, resulting in a chase and counter-chase situation. The day after, the district AL unit in Habiganj organised a march, protesting the \"terror and anarchy\" of the BNP. AL activists reportedly attempted to attack the home of a local BNP leader, which resulted in another showdown. In typical fashion, the former claimed it was BNP that had first attacked their march. Each time an incident like this breaks out, the same blame game plays out, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle.\nWe have previously criticised the ruling party's attempts to disrupt BNP's street programmes as a violation of its constitutional right to peaceful assembly. Such attempts have been particularly evident after the BNP launched its one-point movement for holding the next parliamentary election under a non-party interim administration. Police's role in resulting clashes has been equally troubling. Just last month, a BNP activist was killed in Lakshmipur during a clash that ensued after police and AL activists reportedly obstructed a BNP procession. It goes without saying that, until the ruling party changes its current approach and exercises restraint, the prospect of a fair and participatory election will remain distant.\nUltimately, if the AL and BNP truly care about the public, they will have to find a way to compromise, and engage in dialogue rather than violence. As the party in power, the AL must lead the way to prevent the history of violent confrontation from repeating itself.\n",

        "full_article": "Last week, British director Daniel Gordon's new documentary\u00a0Billion Dollar Heist\u00a0was released. The film highlights the seriousness of cybersecurity issues the world faces today. Unfortunately, the subject of Gordon's documentary is our central bank, the Bangladesh Bank, which was almost robbed of around a billion dollars by hackers in one of the worst instances of cybercrime in the world. Reviews published in some of the leading international newspapers, including\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0and\u00a0The Financial Times, remind us that the 2016 heist remains quite a mystery.\nNearly three years after the heist, our government enacted the Digital Security Act, 2018, promising it to be \"an Act to make provisions for ensuring digital security and identification, prevention, suppression and trial of offences committed through digital device and for matters ancillary thereto.\" But instead, from its beginning, it has been another tool for suppressing free speech and political dissent in the country. According to Law Minister Anisul Huq, as of January 31 this year, more than 7,000 cases have been lodged under this law since its enactment. This means that, on average, 4.5 cases are filed under the DSA each day. The number of people sued and arrested has not been released by the government, but could be speculated to be three to four times the number of cases. This clearly indicates that the DSA has been weaponised to intimidate and harass dissenters.\nIn more recent years, there have been quite a few instances of serious security breaches that one would have thought could not happen following the lessons learnt from the Bangladesh Bank heist. The latest in this series of shocking failures was a 38-hour shutdown of our NID server and trouble with a few other critical networks following threats from hackers, allegedly from outside Bangladesh. Before this, there was a breach into more than 50 million Bangladeshis' personal information, which remained unnoticed by the local authorities until a South African cybersecurity expert, Viktor Markopoulos, went public with the information (following weeks of waiting) to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for keeping the data secure.\nAfter nearly five years of resisting the demand for scrapping the DSA, both from within the country and from international development partners and rights groups, the government has now decided to replace the law. Unfortunately, the publication of its replacement, named the Cyber Security Act (CSA), is already another disappointment.\n\nIn a world where most democracies reform their cyber laws to provide better protection for their citizens' freedom of expression and right to privacy, Bangladesh is moving in the opposite direction and instead criminalising dissent and critical views.\nThe most contentious provisions of the DSA \u2013 which have been viewed as a harsh deterrent to free speech \u2013 Articles 21 and 28, have been retained practically unaltered, save for a nominal reduction of sentences. Provisions related to the authority for removal of content, search and seizure of devices, and arrest of suspects without warrants given to law enforcement agencies also remain unchanged. Rights groups have been alleging that such abuses have inflicted great suffering on thousands of activists and innocent citizens, not to mention they caused the death of writer Mushtaq Ahmed under custody.\nDespite the reduction of sentences and allowing of bails on a few of the offences which were previously non-bailable, experts have pointed out that the unchanged vagueness and the wider scope of the act's application will likely be the most worrying aspects of the proposed CSA. They have argued that the retention of about nine articles from the DSA will continue to impede independent journalism and freedom of expression and opinion. Changing the name of the law and the implementing agency perhaps symbolises all that is proposed by the government: a simple relabelling of a tool of suppression.\nMinisters have said innumerable times that the DSA is not very different from that of most other countries. Some of them even questioned whether digital regulations in Western countries were actually less repressive. In an interview on May 2, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told US broadcaster Voice of America's Bangla service that the digital security law does not exist only in Bangladesh, but in all other countries of the world. Furthermore, the PM said that her government was looking into the contents included in the digital laws of other countries, such as the US, the UK, and in European countries. She also added that if it is discovered that there are punishments in the laws of these other countries which are tougher, then those sections in our law, too, will be reformed.\nThe draft CSA does not hint, however, that the government has examined relevant laws in either the US or the UK. Firstly, under the First Amendment of the US constitution, its citizens enjoy almost unfettered freedom of expression and opinion, be it online or offline. The United Kingdom, prior to January 1, 2021, was a member of the European Union and hence still follows EU principles and legislations in regulating cyberspace, especially in relation to the protection of citizens' rights. There are a number of national legislations in the EU regarding digital security, but all of them are aligned with the Convention on Cybercrime adopted in 2001 (otherwise known as the Budapest Convention) which has been ratified by 68 countries. Currently, negotiations are ongoing to improve it further and make it a global charter. The Budapest Convention states that signatories be: \"Mindful of the need to ensure a proper balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental human rights as enshrined in the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other applicable international human rights treaties, which reaffirm the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and the rights concerning the respect for privacy.\"\nNotably, in the digital security laws of other countries, the independence of law enforcement agencies (including police) is such that they can be guided by the law, not the whims of politicians. These countries also have powerful watchdogs which work free from government interference. With fast-changing technology, lawmakers are under pressure to update their legislations more frequently and, as a result, the EU enacted a new Digital Services Act (DSA) last year to make companies more transparent and accountable in relation to protecting citizens' rights (not the political ideology of a party or of the politicians in power). A similar legislation, the Online Safety Bill, is currently being considered by the UK parliament.\nIn a world where most democracies reform their cyber laws to provide better protection for their citizens' freedom of expression and right to privacy, Bangladesh is moving in the opposite direction and instead criminalising dissent and critical views. As a result, the state is increasingly infringing upon citizens' privacy. Relabelling the DSA as CSA is not the answer to making the law compliant with human rights standards. Our authorities must draw lessons from democracies.\nKamal Ahmed\u00a0is an independent journalist. His X handle is @ahmedka1\n\n",

        "full_article": "The application of \"green\" concepts holds significant importance across various sectors, including in production and manufacturing, supply chain management, technology, e-commerce, engineering, environment, healthcare, and governance, and others. Bangladesh is considered to be among the nations most susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, the country has already adopted environment-friendly practices in various sectors, particularly in the areas of eco-housing projects, renewable energy, and the readymade garments (RMG) industry.\u00a0\nBut while the national election holds significant importance within Bangladesh, our current election campaign practices remain largely traditional. They include the use of banners, posters, festoons, and loudspeakers, and are not environmentally sustainable. While citizens dream of a clean and healthy country, the posters, banners, and festoons (made with paper or plastic) affect not only the appearance of our surroundings and public health but are also in conflict with the SDGs. So, is it not imperative to think of implementing environmentally conscious election campaign strategies using technology (like telecommunication and social media) in order to safeguard public health and social well-being? This will surely move Bangladesh one step closer to achieving the SDGs and the government's vision of a Smart Bangladesh.\nThe use of posters, banners, and festoons is a widespread practice throughout the year in both urban and rural areas. However, it is crucial to consider the consequences of this from an environmental standpoint. I sweetly recall my time spent in Wuhan, China, walking and cycling under the green-adorned flyovers. But, after returning to Dhaka, I find myself seldom exploring the city's roads due to the endless noise of vehicles and the unnecessary use of posters, banners, and festoons along the roadside.\u00a0\nAlthough the cost of these materials during campaigns is not known with absolute certainty, the figure can be guessed to not be insignificant. A substantial amount of funds is probably expended by the candidates for these posters and banners, which is not only ecologically irresponsible but there is also no societal benefit derived from the utilisation of these materials. Similarly, the use of loudspeakers is another major issue. Although regulatory agencies point to several restrictions, such as the fact that the use of loudspeakers is strictly prohibited in front of schools, hospitals, and places of prayers, the reality is that these restrictions are usually violated, thus adversely impacting public health.\nThe global landscape now is predominantly symbolised by a technologically-driven atmosphere, with a particular emphasis on telecommunication and social media platforms. A report released by DataReportal on \"Digital 2023: Bangladesh\" states that, at the beginning of 2023, the number of internet users in Bangladesh totalled 66.94 million, while the number of social media users reached 44.70 million. The latter figure corresponds to approximately 26 percent of the overall population. In early 2023, the number of active cellular network connections in Bangladesh amounted to 179.9 million, representing 104.6 percent of the country's total population. Hence, the utilisation of technology within the context of green election campaigns has the potential to greatly augment the nation's scope, engagement, effectiveness, and overall efficacy in relation to the SDGs and the concept of Digital Bangladesh.\nTo reach voters, political parties and candidates can embrace digital strategies and enhance their online presence in the digital age. They may make use of live-streaming to interact with citizens, initiate email campaigns, advertise through social media and text messaging, conduct virtual events, and more. Moreover, by broadcasting events, speeches, and development activities, parties and candidates can reach a wider audience and allow citizens to participate remotely. This interactive approach fosters a sense of inclusivity and enables individuals to actively engage with the green election process.\nDespite the merits of this approach, the possibility of a breach in cybersecurity cannot be neglected. A data breach might have severe consequences if the relevant stakeholders are unable to adequately safeguard their data. Incidences of hacking and data breaches can be avoided if political parties and candidates take precautions to protect voter information and election campaign data.\nHowever, a green election campaign that prioritises protecting the environment can yield numerous benefits for society. It can result in a cleaner environment and a peaceful community without noise pollution. The prevalence of clean spaces has been shown to have a positive impact on the psychological and physical well-being of citizens. It promotes sustainable living, recycling, waste reduction, and responsible resource consumption. All in all, a green election campaign may boost societal, monetary, and environmental benefits, promoting a more resilient and environmentally conscious society. Ahead of the upcoming national election in Bangladesh, each political party and candidate is accountable to the country to uphold social welfare.\u00a0\u00a0\nDr Najmul Hasan is an assistant professor and researcher of Information Systems at Brac Business School, Brac University.\n\n",

In the first two days of this week alone, some 400 individuals have been reportedly injured in clashes between BNP activists and members of the AL and police combined. We express our concern over the never-ending nature of confrontational politics where the nation's streets are turning into battlefields, leaving citizens in a constant state of fear and uncertainty.\nThe first of the latest series of clashes took place when BNP activists held road marches in Habiganj, Barguna and Narayanganj, demanding the release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, and law enforcers baton-charged them, resulting in a chase and counter-chase situation. The day after, the district AL unit in Habiganj organised a march, protesting the \"terror and anarchy\" of the BNP. AL activists reportedly attempted to attack the home of a local BNP leader, which resulted in another showdown. In typical fashion, the former claimed it was BNP that had first attacked their march. Each time an incident like this breaks out, the same blame game plays out, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle.\nWe have previously criticised the ruling party's attempts to disrupt BNP's street programmes as a violation of its constitutional right to peaceful assembly. Such attempts have been particularly evident after the BNP launched its one-point movement for holding the next parliamentary election under a non-party interim administration. Police's role in resulting clashes has been equally troubling. Just last month, a BNP activist was killed in Lakshmipur during a clash that ensued after police and AL activists reportedly obstructed a BNP procession. It goes without saying that, until the ruling party changes its current approach and exercises restraint, the prospect of a fair and participatory election will remain distant.\nUltimately, if the AL and BNP truly care about the public, they will have to find a way to compromise, and engage in dialogue rather than violence. As the party in power, the AL must lead the way to prevent the history of violent confrontation from repeating itself.\n",

In fact, at a recent conference in the capital, noted entomologists in the country argued that the current measures undertaken by the city corporations are unscientific and farcical, and are actually contributing to the surge in dengue cases.\nExperts have long warned that fogging, the most cited method of dengue control by the city corporations, is ineffective in curbing the dengue menace, as Aedes aegypti does not live inside sewerage lines or drains, and can kill at most 20 percent of the mosquitoes. Meanwhile, ad hoc measures, such as importing bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) for mosquito larvae control, will fail to provide a sustainable solution for dengue, and may, in fact, prove to be dangerous. The scientists pointed out that dengue control in neighbouring Kolkata was successful because they made use of their entomologists and other experts to come up with a scientific and comprehensive plan to eradicate mosquitoes from their communities. We join the experts in asking the critical question: why has Bangladesh not done the same?\nIt is obvious by now that the country and the institutions tasked with tackling dengue lack the necessary data and research to devise methodical solutions to the public health crisis. What is equally evident is the authorities' reluctance to listen to those with expertise to fill in their knowledge gaps. It is of urgent importance that the government bring doctors, public health professionals, entomologists, urban planners, city corporation officials and other stakeholders together to devise a coordinated action plan, not just for the immediate future, but for the long run, as by now, we know that dengue is here to stay. Investments need to be made in researching the virus, methods of transmission and serosurveillance, alongside evaluations of existing mosquito-control measures. We must study and learn from the best and worst practices of other countries also battling dengue and prioritise data-driven approaches and adaptive technologies over traditional methods. Science, not bureaucracy, must be the driving force behind our fight against dengue.\n",

Protracted cases of this huge amount in courts have a combined telling impact on both the banking system and the economy of the country. But this amount is not all of the classified loans. The amount of loans allowed to be rescheduled taking advantage of the lax legal provisions stood at about Tk2.3 trillion by the end of 2022. As things stand, the combined size of rescheduled and non-performing loan (NPL) is more than half of the country's total national budget of Tk7.61 trillion for the fiscal year 2023-24. The number of bank loan cases with the court has been going up all the time. Between January and March of this year alone, 14,650 cases were filed by 60 banks with the Artha Rin Adalat (money loan courts) pushing the total number to 214,282. By this time the number may have risen further. This explains the sorry plight of the banks right now. Sure enough, the banks are to blame to a large extent for extending loans to undeserving candidates. But political pressure or instructions from big bosses of private banks compel bankers to swallow the bitter pills at times. It is a fact that bankers are not always free to take decisions depending on their financial acumen. When boards of private banks are dominated by family members, there are ample opportunities to tinker with banking laws. Some of the notorious scams involving public banks' loans are a result of either exertion of political influence or a collusion between corrupt political elements and a section of bank staff. The Basic Bank scam is a clear example of such an unholy alliance. Sadly, the nation has to suffer the economic burden and shame of the vicious legacy. Bad loans worth Tk 653.21 billion had to be written off by the end of 2022. Who are the beneficiaries of non-performing loans (NPLs) and bad loans? Certainly not the poor farmers who are paraded with ropes tied around their waist for failing to pay a paltry loan of Tk 5,000-10,000. Remarkably, a High Court bench in its observation made such a comment recently and also chided high-profile lawyers who repeatedly seek deferment of cases involving default loans on behalf of their big but evasive clients. There is a chance of making losses in business and other entrepreneurships, which leaves loanees with hardly any option other than default on payment. But it is unbelievable that as many as 214,282 loan receivers have been rendered genuine defaulters. A good number of them have sought loans with an ulterior motive right from the beginning and some of them have the dubious distinction of laundering money abroad and purchasing homes in what is sarcastically called Begum Para in Canada and similar other second homes in Malaysia and other countries. Channelling money illegally to banks in tax havens is an open secret. This is exactly how the country is bled white and the intriguing elements skirt around the law of the land courtesy of political and other patronages.",

        "full_article": "Compared to the earlier years, this year's dengue outbreak in the country and its ferocity are strikingly different. Thanks to its fast spread, it is set to assume the proportions of a disease endemic to Bangladesh. In the year of 2000, the outbreak of the Aedes mosquito-borne disease chiefly remained confined to the capital Dhaka. The vector-borne disease had yet to emerge as one with dreadful features. In the early years, the outbreak was barely noticeable. Thanks to the ailment's isolated and scattered nature, the health authorities evidently didn't bother to keep a record of the incidenceof the scourge, either in Dhaka or elsewhere in the country. In the years around 2000, it was mostly the normal hospitalisations, accompanied by few fatalities, which defined the viral scourge.As years wore on, the dengue fever began assuming the character of an intermittently appearing health-related menace. It had been so until the year of 2019, the year witnessing a total of 179 deaths. In 2022, the number of deaths from dengue shot to 281. With casualties continuing, the dengue death toll this year stands at over 470. Besides, the number of dengue positive cases is feared to reach 100,000 all over the country. Coming to the difference in dengue prevalence in the country in 2023, a notable feature that warrants focus is the Aedes vector-borne disease's strong presence in other parts of the country. Its so-called perennial feature of being confined to the capital has proven a myth. Admissions are increasingly recorded at different hospitals across the country --- the highest, though, being in Dhaka. Earlier, the people in the rural areas would boast of being largely free of the dengue fever. This year comes as a striking exception. The unabatedly deteriorating dengue situation keeps worsening in many other cities and towns. Large numbers of patients, mostly children, now hospitalised in Dhaka, are from areas outside Dhaka. In the initial stage, it was the tiny tots and older children who comprised the largest segments of the dengue patients. Now the patients aged between 20 and 40 years constitute 70 per cent of those admitted to hospital. This unexpected jump in the patients' age provides a grim but real picture of the dengue situation. As disclosed by a director of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), there are a total of 2625 hospital beds exclusively meant for the two Dhaka City Corporation areas. Of the total beds, 1,890 have already been occupied. Even at larger hospitals young and older patients have been found lying on makeshift beds arranged on the floor, or even at unlikely places.A depressing scenario indeed! Many were deprived of even these rudimentaryfacilities. As a consequence, patients are seen being compelled to leave hospitals without completing their lengthy treatment.According to observers, a veritable anarchic situation is prevailing in the area of dengue treatment in the Bangladesh cities, especially in the capital. It begins with the inordinate delay in the delivery of different test reports. The shortages of skilled technicians and inadequate testing facilities have also aggravated the depressing situation. The season of monsoon is on the way out, with the sun shining in a nearly cloudless sky. According to dengue specialists, the time is the most ideal for the Aedes mosquito to lay eggs in the stagnant rain water accumulated in assorted types of containers. There, the eggs turn into larvae which take the form of pupa, from which the adult Aedes mosquitoes come out.The popular notion is that contrary to the common belief, the dengue fever is relatively new to Dhaka. But in reality the dreadful fever has been present in the city since the 1960s. Back then it was recorded as 'Dacca Fever'. The Bangladesh capital and the rest of the country had yet to be devastated by the dengue outbreak. However, dengue fever in some other Asian countries, the Southeast Asian belt in particular, was found raging in 2022. Three countries of the region --- Vietnam, having the highest 145,534 cases, followed by Philippines with 52,597 cases, and Indonesia with 68,903 cases comprise the vulnerable zone. Thanks to the repeated outbreaks of the dengue fever over the last twenty-three years, the scourge might emerge soon as a terribleone.The feature that had long distinguished the country was its remaining hostage to the practice of littering. Nowadays, alongside the capital Dhaka, many smaller cities also stand witness to the menace of indiscriminate littering. The most alarming aspect of this habit is the throwaway objects that include pots and containers which collect monsoon rain water. In the last couple of decades, almost all urban centres across the country have turned into ideal dengue breeding grounds. Given the dengue scenario's worsening turn, many have started bracing for a period more calamitous than at present. The dengue cases continue to rise every passing day, deaths show few signs of abating and the hospitals are chockablock with patients. Given the highly fraught scenario, many might feel like urging the government to declare a state ofdengue emergency. Despite the invention of vaccines and their reaching the trial stage in a couple of countries, it still remains confined to laboratories. The dengue vaccines are yet to be approved by the WHO for mass immunization campaigns. Many optimistic people, however, look to the days, not too far, when the vaccines will be widely available like the preventive invented for Covid-19.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The ever-evolving Covid-19 virus is learnt to have begotten yet another of its variants called BA.2.86. What makes it different from other existing strains is that it has gone through a large number of (some 36) mutations. And the most mutations have taken place in the virus's spike protein or S protein, which plays the critical role in infecting host cells through penetrating them. Meanwhile, the new variant of the coronavirus has been detected in three continents-Demark and the UK in Europe, the USA and Israel in Asia. The first three cases were detected in Denmark in late July this year followed by Israel, then in Michigan of the USA in August and lastly on Friday (August 18) in London, UK. With the London case, some six cases of infection by this new coronavirus variant have been detected. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA are keeping track of this new coronavirus strain. So far, information gathered about BA.2.86 is scanty. Detected through genetic sequencing, scientists are concerned because, the S protein of the virus, which vaccines target to neutralise has undergone so many mutations. So, the question remains-is this new variant a threat to the vaccinated or previously Covid-19-infected patients' body cells? Dr. Wesley Long, Associate professor of Pathology and Genomic Medicine of the Houston Methodist, Texas, USA, for instance, wants to see if it outcompetes the 'EG.5 \"Eris\" sub-variant', descending from the Omicron lineage, XBB, that first surfaced in November 2021.In Dr Wesley Long's view, since BA.2.86 comes from 'earlier branch' of the coronavirus, it differs from other variants targeted by the available vaccines. Dr. Eric Topol, a genetic expert at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, La Jolla, California, however, expressed concern because he thinks the trajectory of BA.2.86 does not look good at the moment. For this he blamed the apathy towards conducting tests on Covid patients nowadays and analysing the genomes of the viruses causing infections in the patients. It is the speed at which new cases from this variant are being detected that is concerning. In fact, due to the mutations, the structure of B.2.86 has changed radically from the previous variants. The fear is-- if the mutations have caused the virus to become highly transmissible. In the USA, for instance, according to report from doctors, conditions of the patients suffering from the Eris variant of the Covid-9 are not as acute as they used to be during the earlier waves of the pandemic. However, his opinion about this little understood B.2. 86 variant of the coronavirus is that it may prove to be problematic, even fatal, for vulnerable populations. Even so, experts believe, existing vaccines will prove effective against the new variant of the Covid-19. The producers of anti-Covid-19 vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer have developed updated versions of their booster vaccines. The updated vaccines have been designed to target the Omicron sub-variant XBB1.5. These vaccines are reported to be showing promise against the coronavirus variants like Eris and Formax now behind increasing number of infections in the USA and the UK. The symptoms of the new Covid variant include the usual ones-runny nose, headache, sore throat, sneezing and fatigue. CDC's advice on protection against the new virus runs like this: \"As we learn more about BA.2.86, CDC's advice on protecting yourself from Covid-19 remains the same\". All the previous waves of different coronavirus variants that populations across the globe have braved so far, it is believed, have developed a complex and robust immune system in them. And that is hopefully the best protection against any new variant of coronavirus.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's energy crisis has been affecting millions of people since July, 2022. The problem has existed for too long and requires immediate government action to offer some relief to the public. Frequent load shedding interferes with people's daily lives. Most people cannot afford generators or IPS. As a result, they struggle to complete their daily chores, students are unable to study, and the elderly and sick also experience difficulties due to extreme temperatures. Power outages also affect business and industrial activities ultimately harming the economy. Many factories have been forced to close down or function on reduced capacity. Businesses are also faced with increasing costs as they are often compelled to operate on fuel and diesel generators. They pass these additional costs on to the consumers. Even now in autumn, people are experiencing load-shedding regularly and the situation will not be relieved until winter arrives. Therefore, the government should resolve our energy crisis and invest in sustainable energy infrastructure and renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. In 2022, China has achieved the target of generating 45.3 per cent of its electricity generation from renewable sources. India met 33.7 per cent of its electricity demand last year from renewable sources. Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines and Germany have also succeeded in rooftop solar power generation. The provision of subsidies and incentives in the pricing of solar panels and batteries have been a key factor for success in these countries. Why Bangladesh's solar power production has not yet reached 1500 MW even in 2023? Those concerned should think about it with due seriousness. Generation of renewable power should be given top priority. Gaibandha has a solar power project on 600 acres of land, which generates 200 MW of electricity every day. More solar-cum-wind power plants should be set up across the country so that we can switch to renewable energy not only to produce electricity but also save our environment. \nAshikujaman Syed,Foreign Service Officer,Anhui Haikang Pharmaceutical Co.
