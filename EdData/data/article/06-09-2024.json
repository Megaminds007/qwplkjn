After suffering major casualties in ambushes in April 2021 and April 2023, paramilitary and police forces are coordinating better and firming up a no-holds-barred approach towards the militants. This has resulted in the Maoists experiencing blow after blow in what is perhaps their only remaining bastion \u2014 south Chhattisgarh \u2014 even though they retain a presence in other forested districts in Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra. The success in taking on the Maoists is also a consequence of the weakening base of support for the insurgents as intelligence is a vital component of the operations. This should not come as any surprise. Notwithstanding grievances against the Indian state among tribals in one of India\u2019s most forested and under-developed regions, there were always going to be fewer takers for the idea of a \u201cprotracted\u201d war as espoused by the Maoists. The insurgency and the counter-operations have taken a huge toll on the tribal population, bringing in more fatigue for them. That most of the dead among the Maoist cadres are tribal youth points to the tragedy that has befallen one of India\u2019s poorest States.The no-holds barred approach of what the Chhattisgarh government calls \u201cOperation Prahar\u201d might have succeeded in eliminating scores of Maoist cadres, effected surrenders and arrests, but it has also targeted peaceful activists fighting for tribal rights. Civil society organisations have complained that the attacks on the Maoists have coincided with repression against activists and tribals. Chhattisgarh and the Union Home Ministry must be mindful of these grievances as such actions could also increase disenchantment and play into the hands of the Maoists. That streams of the Maoist/Naxalite current have lasted for more than five decades shows that left extremism is still resilient in regions where governance by the Indian state is either absent or seen as detrimental to the marginalised sections. Yet, despite its resilience, the Maoist movement \u2014 as experiences of similar currents across the world show \u2014 remains an anachronistic one. Far from reaching any of its lofty goals, the Indian Maoist movement has only brought misery for those whom the insurgents claim to fight for. The earlier they realise the futility of their ideology and work towards using spaces in the Indian democratic system to articulate concerns, the better it would be for the tribals who are caught in this never-ending crossfire between security forces and the Maoists.

        "full_article": "The ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook study (September) has definitively linked declining trends in labour\u2019s income share of total income within nations to technological advances \u2014 mainly automation and artificial intelligence. In an analysis of the past two decades, it mentions a 1.6% drop in the global labour income share between 2004-24. More ominously, almost 40% of this decline was in the pandemic years of 2019-22 \u2014 a drop that has not been recouped in the past couple of years. Labour income share is a measure widely used to assess income inequalities within economies. The 1.6% drop might seem insignificant, but it amounts to $2.4 trillion in lost wages at constant purchasing power parity, in relation to what workers would have earned had the labour income share been stable since 2004. $2.4 trillion lost globally is more than half of India\u2019s nominal GDP forecast for FY2023-24. The study also highlights the gendered aspect of this inequality. In 2024, almost a third of the world\u2019s young women (28.2%) are not in employment, education or training, it estimates, which is double that of young men (13.1%). This is alarming for developing nations with growing working age populations, as it highlights challenges in job creation. In fact, another ILO report on the status of employment in India estimates that 83% of its unemployed are youth. This coupled with the government\u2019s recent prescriptions to the private sector to invest in labour intensive employment points to a crisis in jobs growth and rising inequality, even as output and labour productivity rise.Several countries have been mooting the idea of a universal basic income (UBI), or a floor to stand on, as economists have called it. A referendum in Switzerland on UBI was defeated in 2016, while Democratic candidate and American tech investor Andrew Yang, in his aborted 2020 bid to the White House, mainstreamed a \u2018Freedom Dividend\u2019 of $1,000 a month for every American adult. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too made a proposal of \u20b912,000 a month for every family, during his 2019 election campaign, calling it a \u201cfinal assault on poverty\u201d. Several industry reports point to high-paying job creation due to automation and AI, to counter the jobless growth theory. But again, this only highlights an acceleration in income-inequality trends. Indeed, with the apparent advantages of automation and AI being irreversible, perhaps a global goal towards a universal basic income could address Sustainable Development Goal 10, or reduced inequality within and among countries. It is perhaps time that developing nations such as India consider the reintroduction of an inheritance tax as a measure to redress wealth inequality.

But the RG Kar horror may just become another poster on India\u2019s wall of shame that captures the failure to provide proper investigation into such crime, and credible closure. After almost a month \u2013 the medic was attacked and killed on Aug 9 \u2013 the investigation that CBI took over has morphed into a corruption case, while the agency agrees the prime suspect arrested by Kolkata police has glaring inconsistencies in his claims of innocence.\nSlo-mo in a hurry | Meanwhile, Bengal instituted a new law that promises \u2018justice\u2019 within days for all such crime. The Aparajita Women and Child Bill, 2024 seeks investigation of rape cases be completed within 21 days of FIR filed. And 30 days to complete trial. Fast-track special courts to process crimes against women, as a central scheme, exist. The scheme was extended last Nov till 2026. The Centre\u2019s share of continuing the scheme will be drawn from Nirbhaya Fund \u2013 \u20b91,207cr of the total \u20b91,952cr cost. Around 851 such fast-track courts are operational India-wide. In last five years, they have resolved 2.1L cases. Over 2L cases are pending, per a response in Parliament this Feb. With pendency of almost 50%, they are as clogged as regular courts.\nTalk funds | Can faster disposal of cases be a deterrent in crimes against women? Does quicker closure mean reducing the period of trauma, better chances at rehabilitation and recovery for survivors of sexual crime? There\u2019s no arguing with that. But what India has today is a far cry from what\u2019s required. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended setting up 1,800 fast-track courts at a total cost of \u20b94,144 cr during 2015-2020.\nPlaying politics | After the RG Kar crime, Bengal said it had 88 fast-track courts functioning on state funds. GOI said Bengal didn\u2019t have any of the 17 such courts it was allocated under the Centre\u2019s scheme till last year. Such spats aren\u2019t unusual in strained Centre-state relations. But only burden victims. Given ground realities, mandating near-impossible deadlines for investigation is just a wink at insta-justice. Pendency in forensics, poor staffing and deep political interference in brutal sexual crimes together make quick meal of fast-track courts. Until funds follow the talk, the hurry to \u201cdo right\u201d offers little respite.\n\n",

        "full_article": "A traditional Goan dish sparks a controversy and imparts a history lesson\nOn a recent visit to Goa, Bunny found herself embroiled in a controversy about a recipe.\u00a0\nThe recipe in question was for Chicken Cafreal, a traditional Goan dish that traces its roots to Mozambique which was a Portuguese colony. African soldiers who served in the Portuguese army are said to have introduced the dish to Portugal. Cafreal translates as \u2018in the manner of Cafres, inhabitants of a region of Southern Africa\u2019.\nAs frequent visitors to Goa, which we fell in love with way back in 1978 when we first went there, we assiduously avoid establishments calling themselves \u2018Dilli Durbar\u2019 and \u2018Pure Veg Bombay Thali\u2019 in favour of Goan fare. We are familiar with\u00a0 Xacuti, and Rawa Fry, and Butter-Garlic, and have engaged in theological debates about the relative merits of the poi vis-\u00e0-vis the unde and the fermented-rice based subtly sweet sana.\u00a0\nHowever, we bypass Cafreal, after having tried it once in an eatery famed for it. It arrived at our table as an inviting dark-green coriander preparation, but the seductive green turned out to be a deadly camouflage for the fiery wrath of green chillies which assaulted our palates. Cafreal? Never again!\u00a0\nWe happened to mention this to Chef Peter, who runs one of our favourite restaurants in Goa. With a dismissive gesture he said that what we had eaten was an impostor, and he promised to prepare the genuine item for us.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s Cafreal came with a reddish-brown sauce, with no sign of green or of coriander. And \u2013 blessed relief! \u2013 no hint of taste-bud-annihilating chillies. Peter, who\u2019d learnt the recipe from Chef Gines Viegas, who introduced the dish to Goa, explained that the use of the green coriander-chilli paste to make Cafreal was a concession to the North Indian tourist.\nAs he recounted the story of Cafreal, he evoked an odyssey involving the ebb and flow of the tides of history, of Africa, and Portugal, and Goa, and the cross-cultural currents that make up that most complex recipe of all, involving many lands and many ages. The recipe that goes into the making of what we call us.\n\n",

But solution lies in innovation, not dialling back a liberal drone policy\nRecent reports of drones being used by suspected militants in Manipur to drop bombs and attack security forces are troubling. A high-level committee has been formed to look into the drone attacks and find ways to counter them. Manipur is a tinderbox with the 15-month-old ethnic conflict in the state showing little signs of abating. Drones add a dangerous new dimension to the conflict that must be sensibly countered.\u00a0\nNew conflict reality | Drones are becoming a common feature of conflict zones around the world. Yemen\u2019s Houthis have used drones to harass shipping in Red Sea. In 2020, the second Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia saw extensive use of drones by Azeri forces. Ukraine too has effectively used drones in its war against Russian invasion. Plus, Pakistani drones have been dropping weapons and drugs across LoC for some years now \u2013 a headache for Indian security agencies. All of this shows drones are here to stay.\u00a0\nFlexible & cheap | What makes drones versatile is that they can be cheaply produced and tailored for particular functions. This DIY quality means anyone with basic technical expertise can assemble drones. Add to this the availability of cheap drone parts, particularly from China \u2013 something that the defence establishment is trying to counter.\nCountering challenges | The main security challenge with drones is that hobbyist drones can be modified for sinister applications. In the Manipur case, it\u2019s suspected that the attack drones were fitted with ammunition looted from the state armoury. But this shouldn\u2019t force a reversal of GOI\u2019s liberal drone policy of 2021. Innovation is the bedrock of the drone industry. To stay ahead of the game and innovate appropriate anti-drone systems from a security point of view, it\u2019s imperative to further encourage private use and development of drones. Drones are the future \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n",

        "full_article": "The euphoria of August 5 was marred by incidents of violence including attacks on minorities and supporters of the former government, rampant looting and burning of houses and establishments associated with the Awami League regime. Mobs attacked police and some perished under their wrath; police stations were burnt to the ground. The result was a general feeling of insecurity as police became reluctant to perform their duties, fearing for their safety. In the wake of all the uncertainty and mutual mistrust, how can we come to a state of peace and normalcy?\u00a0\nJYOTIRMOY BARUA\n\nAdvocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh\nAfter the jubilation following the fall of Sheikh Hasina, we saw the horrors of the nights of August 5\u2014how houses were set on fire, vandalised and looted, and no one was prepared for that. For some unknown reasons, the army disappeared from the streets. Whose decision was that, and why was it done? From different individual sources, we heard that the army did not have enough human resources or they were not prepared for the ensuing chaos, but we have not received an explanation from any official sources yet.\nHad there been army vehicles in the streets, or if people knew that army platoons were patrolling the streets, then these incidents could have been avoided. The arson attack at the Bangabandhu Memorial on Road 32, and other state institutions, such as the Shishu Academy, could have been avoided. Also, individual attacks, neighbourhood robberies could have been addressed.\nAs a result, the general public suffered the most and are still suffering. We heard from different Hindu businesses how Jamaat or BNP activists carried out extortion, threatening arson attacks on warehouses with goods worth lakhs of taka. In some places, the business owners tried to manage the situation by giving money to the goons; in other areas, they could not and their houses and businesses were attacked and looted. Well-off Hindu households and even impoverished Hindu families in neighbourhoods were individually targeted only because of their religious identity. In many cases, these families did not even dare to go to the media to report these attacks.\nThe attacks on some police stations, as well as families of police personnel, have been so severe that many are too afraid to get involved in anything. Because of my personal contact with several police officers, I have tried to find out how they are feeling. A lot of people within the police are traumatised\u2014they need counselling. It is important to find a way to help them get back to work.\nBut let me be clear: we do not want to see anyone, who has been identified as a perpetrator in the mass killings, involved in any work of the state. It is not enough to merely suspend them for their crimes. It is very important to set an example by trying them and bringing them to book to create public confidence. The previous regimes always ignored these issues.\nNot every action performed in uniform, be it of the police or any other security agency, is legal. I want to reiterate that we need to come out of the culture of taking only administrative actions against someone who commits a crime while wearing a police uniform. We need to try such perpetrators under criminal offences just like a layperson is tried. This has to be brought under the purview of our existing laws. If restrictions exist in the current laws, those have to be removed and new provisions for trying law enforcers must be incorporated.\nRASHED NIZAM\n\nCrime reporter, Jamuna Television\nOur past experiences of covering a conflict or clash did not work this time during the uprising because we did not know where we could stand for safety. Reporting rules require journalists to stay somewhere above the ground or behind the most powerful party in a conflict zone to avoid attacks. This time, we had a totally new experience and had to stay in the middle. Consequently, five journalists were killed during the unrest and we still do not have data on the total number of injured journalists.\nAfter the events (in July and early August), it was the police who were attacked the most. We could not go to Jatrabari, Mohammadpur and Uttara police stations in relation to the incidents that took place on August 5 and after. Nobody knows yet the total number of police fatalities. From August 5 onwards, I received phone calls from many people, especially journalists or friends from minority communities, who asked for confirmation of certain attacks. As a crime reporter, my primary source of confirmation is the police whenever there is a murder or other criminal incident. With no police in sight anywhere for the first few days, who could we call for confirmation?\nWe could not go to the spot and collect the news ourselves because of fear of attacks. Media outlets, including The Daily Star, quoting two organisations, reported that 205 incidents of communal violence took place in 52 districts, but why could they not follow up on their own? The change in journalism that we had expected in the new country where we would have freedom of expression\u2014I have not seen it yet. For how long will we operate out of fear?\nMoving forward, another serious concern is politicisation of the police. There are two organisations for the police: Bangladesh Police Association, which includes personnel from inspectors to all the lower ranks; and Bangladesh Police Service Association which is for BCS cadre police. Suddenly, the latter announced that they were creating a new committee as they could not find members of the previous committee. The person who was named as the main adviser of the committee had been an active official during BNP regime. This is indicative of the same politicisation in police that we have been talking about. What kind of change is really taking place, then?\nThe police reform programme has not been implemented in Bangladesh for many years, though a lot of money has been spent on it. There was a critical point there about making the police independent. The interim government should start the reform process because a political government will never carry it out.\nMAISHA ISLAM MONAMEE\n\nStudent of Institute of Business Administration (IBA) at the University of Dhaka\nThe recent resurfacing of videos and images from the police crackdown during the anti-discrimination student movement has plunged us into a deep reckoning. These records, apparently captured during the internet shutdown, unveil the extent of the brutality unleashed upon innocent protesters\u2014students, civilians, and activists who dared to raise their voices. As we watch the horrific footage of police officers opening fire on unarmed citizens and dumping their dead bodies like sacks, it is impossible to not feel a profound sense of betrayal. The police force, funded by our money, was meant to protect us, not the interests of a ruling party. But in those moments, they became agents of oppression, leaving an entire generation traumatised.\nThe trauma inflicted by these events runs deep. For many of us, the police are no longer the first responders in times of crisis but are seen as a threat and an instrument of violence that could be turned against us at any moment. This fear is not unfounded\u2014it is born out of real experiences, documented in videos that are now indelibly etched into our collective memory, triggering a visceral response of fear, disgust, and disbelief. The images of bloodied students, the sound of gunfire, and the sight of lifeless bodies have left us questioning whether we can ever trust those who were supposed to protect us.\nTo understand the depth of this betrayal, we must remember the fundamental role of the police in a democracy. The police are not meant to serve the interests of any political party or government; they are meant to serve the people. Their salaries are paid by taxpayers\u2014by us. It is our money that funds their operations, and it is in our name that they are supposed to act. When the police turn their weapons on the very citizens they are sworn to protect, they are not only betraying their oath but also misusing the resources provided by the people. This breach of trust is egregious because it undermines the very foundation of our society. The rule of law is essential for the functioning of any democracy. When the enforcers of the law become violators of it, the entire system is called into question. How can we, as a society, have faith in the justice system when those responsible for upholding it are seen as perpetrators of violence?\nTo begin addressing this trauma, there must be a collective acknowledgment of what happened. The interim government must take steps to ensure that the truth is not buried, that the stories of the victims are heard, and that those responsible for the violence are held accountable. This is not just about punishing the perpetrators; it is about sending a message that such actions will not be tolerated, and that the state stands with the people, not against them.\nIt goes without saying that rebuilding trust in the police force will be a monumental task. The first step must be a complete overhaul of the police force\u2014one that addresses both the structural issues and the culture of impunity that has taken root. This means implementing rigorous accountability measures, ensuring that those who abuse their power are swiftly and publicly punished, and creating mechanisms for independent oversight of police actions. The police must be taught to see themselves not as enforcers of the state's will but as protectors of the people. This shift in mindset is crucial if we are to restore any semblance of trust in the institution.\nThe trauma, disgust, and fear that we feel today are valid responses to the horrors we have witnessed. But we must channel these emotions into action\u2014into demanding reform, into building a police force that we can trust, and into creating a society where such atrocities can never happen again. It is time to reclaim the police force for the people, to rebuild it into an institution that serves and protects us all.\nMOHAMMAD NURUL HUDA\n\nFormer Inspector General of Police\nLet's first ask: why does the police behave the way it does? Does it operate on its own? No, it does not; it is directed, as it is part of the executive. The question, then, is: can legal action be taken against members of the force who are directed by the executive?\nThere are some legal protections afforded to law enforcement, which were made during the colonial era. For instance, Section 76 of the Penal Code states: \"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.\" Whether to keep this provision is a big question. After the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, a constitution for the People's Republic was formed. But the politicians at the time did not change colonial rules and regulations because they wanted to exercise such power.\nThe relationship between the police and the public is that of chase and counter-chase. Why is the relationship like this? It all comes down to the mindset of the police who wants to ascend to power any cost\u2014and it's not just one person, it's everyone.\nOur constitution is republican but our rules are feudalistic. It is very difficult to defeudalise and decolonise yourself. Heavy words are easy to say but implementation on the ground is very difficult. Public servants must consider themselves as appointed servants of the republic. They need to understand the difference between serving a party and serving the people.\nASHFAQUE NIPUN\n\nFilmmaker\nIf we are to focus on the events of August 5, one must ask about the role of the army. On one hand, they withdrew the curfew, but then they disappeared from view. Was it really that they did not have enough manpower? We know the characteristics of the Bangladeshi people; they become rule followers as soon as they step into the cantonment. And there was a soft corner amongst the masses regarding the army during the uprising, so it is confusing why they simply allowed such vandalism and violence to take place.\nMeanwhile, the distrust that has been created between the people and law enforcement agencies\u2014the police, in particularly\u2014needs to be addressed urgently. Never before have we heard of such widespread attacks on police stations. Many stations in Dhaka were set on fire and police personnel were hanged. Violence begets violence. No matter how much we despise the police, we need them at the end of the day and we need to be afraid of them. The fact that a police station was set on fire means that now the fear is gone. If another incident untoward incident happens after a year, it means a group of 10 people can go and attack a police station because that tendency has been created among us. We need to come out of this.\nWe are all looking for immediate solutions. But the truth is that real reforms will take a long time. It might not be done even in five years, given the extent of corruption and injustice that was perpetuated over the past 15 years. A huge gap has been created between us and the police, the judges and every single segment of the administration. We do not believe in any investigation. We do not trust any judgements. We believe that all these are hollow words, that nothing will materialise at the end of the day. This trust has to be rebuilt.\n\u00a0\n",

One government estimate puts the total number of casualties during the protests at over 17,000, of which the number of fatalities could be as high as 1,000. This just shows how great the cost of this freedom was.\nAccording to Health Adviser Nurjahan Begum, more than 400 people alone lost their eyesight because of bullet wounds. Many who were shot in the head have little hope of surviving, as complicated and risky surgeries are often required to remove bullet residues. What's more heart-rending is the fact that many of the wounded are young people barely in their teens or twenties. The emotional and financial toll for the families of the injured defies description. Sadly, the inefficiencies of our health system are adding to the stress of these families. Although the interim government has waived treatment costs and hospital bills for the injured currently under treatment at public hospitals, the families still have to pay for medicine and tests unavailable in these hospitals. For the wounded patients in private hospitals, the medical cost is even higher.\nThe government's announcement on August 17 to bear all medical expenses of the injured came as a positive move. However, that assistance is yet to reach many as the government is still in the process of completing the list of fatalities and injuries from the July-August uprising. Under the circumstances, the government may consider disbursing financial assistance in phases, prioritising those whose information on injuries has been confirmed. That would provide some respite to the families who urgently need help. The government may also consider streamlining all donations for the injured by urging people to donate through the Chief Adviser's Relief and Welfare Fund. The most crucial measure would be to ensure that unnecessary medical and logistical delays do not exacerbate the sufferings of the wounded.\nFinally, the government should plan for the rehabilitation of people maimed for life so that they can return to normalcy. Ensuring that these victims of an autocratic government get all the help they need to recover and rebuild their lives is a moral duty for all of us, especially the interim government that emerged out of the foundation of their sacrifices.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "For me, it was after 12 years that I could get anywhere close to the highest seat of power, leave alone have an exchange of views. The former prime minister never allowed the largest circulated English daily of the country, its editor or any of its journalists access to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) or to cover any event where she would be present. The reason I mention it is to point out that, by law, any position\u2014except perhaps those devoted to national security\u2014that is run using public money cannot be kept out of the process of accountability, including and especially that of the media. She broke the law by denying us access to the highest seat of governance. When former US President Donald Trump threw out CNN's White House correspondent because he loathed the news network, a federal court reinstated him in less than two weeks, saying no office run by taxpayers' money can be denied access to the media. But here she was, the \"law\" and the courts were at her beck and call. For us to go to the court would\u2014as we thought, and our suspicion was justified by examples\u2014have led to a judgment that would give a legal veneer to an illegal act. We were denied access for 12 years until the chief adviser (CA) of the interim government called us on Tuesday. The same fate was meted out to the highest circulated Bangla daily in the country,\u00a0Prothom Alo. Our only crime was that we wanted to hold power to account.\nHopefully, that story has ended forever in Bangladesh, along with one-person rule, one-person bank loot, one-person-led loan default culture\u2014who changed his looks and garb to pretend piety while looting the stock market, bond market, etc, and at the same time destroying financial discipline. Hopefully, we also have seen the end of abuse of power, cronyism, corruption, extrajudicial killings, and forced disappearances\u2014an endless list of degeneration that 15 years of unaccounted for rule led us to.\nYesterday, we commemorated one month after the end of this repressive regime. It was a transformative moment when people from all walks of life spontaneously joined the students in a united struggle for freedom.\nThe two hours with the chief adviser, Prof Muhammad Yunus, began with a refreshing modesty. Instead of \"I know everything, listen to me, wonder, and applause,\" he began by unhesitatingly sharing how onerous the tasks he faces are, how little time he has to accomplish it, how limited his own and his team's expertise is, and how desperately he needs the support of all people, and especially of the media. What a breath of fresh air it was\u2014especially for those of us who tried our best to speak truth to power in the last 15 years\u2014when Prof Yunus urged the editors to say, as loudly as possible, whenever we saw something wrong being committed by his cabinet. From a culture of \"I cannot make any mistake because I love my people and Bangladesh always benefits when my party and I are in power,\" to an open and sincere invitation to criticise the government which\u2014the CA understood and the former PM did not\u2014would only help him achieve the goals that the people want him to. The modesty, the humility, the openness and, above all, the sincerity won our hearts and minds.\nThe most challenging task the CA sought our help in was to work towards unifying the nation. He felt, and we agreed, that today we stand dangerously divided, which must be ended as soon as possible. It is this division that gravely corroded all our previous attempts to take the country forward. He did not explain the issue in detail, and neither could we, but we all felt, intuitively and deeply, the centrality of that particular challenge.\nThere were talks about the reform of the constitution, especially devolving the unrestrained power that our constitution gave to the head of the government. There were talks of making the judiciary independent, empowering the Anti-Corruption Commission (which is described by one of its chairmen as a \"toothless tiger\"), human rights and all other statutory bodies powerful and independent enough to do their job. Special attention was focused on the Election Commission, whose repeated failure since 2014 crippled our representative government, debilitated our parliament, and made voters lose their faith in the \"once in five years\" prospect to have a say in choosing who should govern them. The fact that none of our chief election commissioners, since 2008, had the self-respect and dignity to resign when they discovered that the government of the day\u2014having abolished the caretaker system\u2014would not allow a free expression of the public will says it all about the moral bankruptcy of our select elite citizenry. To handle these legal but tricky questions, it was suggested that a special committee be formed\u2014like the one headed by Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya to publish a white paper on the economy\u2014to recommend a set of constitutional and other amendments of legal nature that would satisfy the need of time and give the CA a clearer notion about his programmes ahead.\nThe idea mooted by the information adviser of setting up an information commission received echoes in the discussion, with special mention of granting functional autonomy to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), Bangladesh Television (BTV), and Bangladesh Betar so that public money is no longer wasted on propaganda for the government.\nIn his introductory remarks, Prof Yunus raised the question of the length of the interim government's tenure. He added that the political parties he had spoken with so far had given two broad views: \"take as long as you need,\" and \"take a reasonable amount of time\" without defining what reasonable meant. Most of the editors responded by saying that the interim government should first set out its agenda and use that to determine the time it needed, and not go the other way of allowing the specificity of time to determine it agenda. The very few who gave any specific time frame, which varied between one and three years, added that the \"honeymoon period\" may not last for long, adding that much will depend on public perception of how effective, focused and pro-people programmes the interim government undertakes. The editors pointed out that a perception is gathering ground that all members of the interim government are not working effectively, actively, spiritedly, and creatively. They seem more desk-oriented than performance-driven. They don't give the impression that they are fully aware of the complexity of their tasks, and the enormity of public expectation on them. They are not visible.\nAs editors, we obviously focused a lot on the current harassment of journalists and strongly protested the recklessness with which media professionals were being charged with murder without a shred of evidence. This is giving a wrong signal to the media in the country and is damaging the image of the interim government to the world.\nAs for the relationship between the interim government and the media, it was a refreshing start after one and a half decades of abuse, harassment, baseless suspicion, and demonising. Regrettably, a section of our own community played an ignominious role, casting aside all ethics and norms of good journalism, thereby shaming all journalists.\nThere are two fundamental streams of work that the interim government needs to do: one is to run the everyday affairs of the government, and the other is to reform it. The first is itself a massive task that would occupy the full energy and resources of a full-fledged elected government in any country, made more so by the injustices, discrepancies, corruption and bad governance left behind by the ousted regime.\nThe second is the task to create for us a chance to build a better future. A one-minute pause by any of us would bring to our focus the tremendous challenge that the interim government faces.\nLet us help them and give them time, patience, understanding and, most importantly, trust.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The central bank's latest report on defaulted loans, though alarming, underscores the urgent need to devise ways for rescuing the struggling banking sector. Bangladesh Bank data reveal that by the end of June this year, non-performing loans (NPLs) had surged to Tk 2.11 trillion, representing 12.56 per cent of the total Tk 16.83 trillion in disbursed loans. This marks the highest ratio of non-performing loans to total disbursed loans in the past 16 years. Till June last year, default loans stood at Tk 1.56 trillion, BB data showed. These loans soared by over Tk 290 billion in three months from March 2024 when the volume of classified loans was Tk 1.82 trillion.No wonder, the major share of the NPL burden falls on state-owned commercial banks (SCBs). The volume of outstanding loans of the SCBs stood over Tk 3.13 trillion until June this year, of which Tk 1.02 trillion or 32.77 per cent got defaulted. The volume of such default loans surged by 5.77 percentage points in June from 27 per cent recorded over the March-end period. As regards the private commercial banks (PCBs), their share of NPL increased by 0.35 percentage points to 7.94 per cent or Tk 992 billion against their disbursed loans worth Tk 12.59 trillion. The share of NPL of foreign commercial banks (FCBs) dropped to 4.74 per cent (Tk 32.29 billion) from 5.20 per cent against their outstanding loans of Tk 681 billion until June. Bankers and economists, however, are of the opinion that the actual size of the stressed assets in banks would be much higher than the NPL amount if the volumes of loan rescheduling, under-trial disputed loans, and write-offs are taken into account. According to a former economist of the local World Bank office, non-performing loan figure represents the lower bound of distressed assets in the banking system. The reported amount is based on lax NPL-recognition criterion, where loans are considered overdue after 180 days or more. The amount would be significantly higher if the 90-day rule was applied. The fact that the NPL amount is so high even under this lenient criterion exposes the severity of the problem.For years discussion on mounting bad loans and scams were in the public domain with no proactive or reactive move to rein in the repeated and blatant violation of banking practices. It is now pretty well known that the system itself offered numerous opportunities for unscrupulous borrowers to exploit loopholes, aided by the notorious Bank Company Act, absence of provisioning, and the so called rescheduling of default loans. The role of the Financial Institutions Division (FID) of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is also largely responsible for causing a lot of malgovernance in exercising its authority over the central bank. Additionally, granting licences to new banks without assessing the country's needs and propping up failing banks have further weakened the banking sector. Clearly, it was the sheer lack of political will on the part of the ousted government to safeguard the banking industry that led to the dismal situation. The interim government has daunting challenges before it to put things on the right track.",

        "full_article": "The student movement responsible for the ouster of Hasina-led government has not only restored confidence in and respect for the community of learners but also raised high hopes for the country. Before history was made on August 5 last, courtesy of their courage and dedication, the entire generation Z or Gen Z had been dismissed as a spoiled generation wedded to the smart devices and virtual world with its total disconnect from harsh reality. At least students, particularly the leading members who spearheaded the movement, in this country showed enough courage and maturity against overwhelming odds to snatch victory. No doubt their undaunted spirit percolated down the aisles but because it began as a movement targeting a particular issue, the larger objective of social equality that came into focus at the final stage of the movement was missed by the majority of the participators, particularly the generation known as Alpha (born between 2010 &2025). Their solidarity with the generation Z was based on a common identity, in this case 'students'. But the common people, especially those of lower strata of society who have every reason to consider themselves deprived and neglected at a time of relentlessly high inflation joined the forces in the hope of a change in social order and their lot. Admittedly, in times of a major revolution, the transition period is most crucial because the repressive administration manned by stooges and lackeys have to flee the wrath of their colleagues, subordinates and the masses who were irrationally victimised. This is why law and order breaks down and the anti-social elements try to make the most of the situation. The backlash from many of the victors down the rank together with the activities unleashed by anti-social goons sets into motion anarchy giving the impression of a reign of terror. It is, however, to borrow from Charles Dickens, the best of times and the worst of times. With limitless potential, the revolution can inspire a nation for accomplishing the apparently impossible. The recent win scripted by Under-20 boys' football team in the South Asian championship and the whitewash of Pakistan on their own soil by Bangladesh men's cricket team may be the best example of the soaring spirit. However, it is also the most testing time that has to be navigated as much cautiously, patiently and wisely as possible in order to avoid negativity. Since students' number one mission is to pursue study, nothing should be allowed to vitiate the learning process and environment. Unfortunately, developments in those areas are far from ideal. The anarchy let loose on the education front has prompted the education and planning adviser to call for an end to humiliation of teachers and their forcible resignation. But this call has come after three weeks of the interim government's assumption of power. By this time the intimidation, harassment, forcible resignation and even physical assaults of teachers have taken an epidemic form in the country. The coordinators of the student movement and the education adviser also voiced their resentment at such incidents but it lacked the conviction and a sense of purpose. The day 200 or so higher secondary examinees stormed the secretariat, the administrative hub of the government, and literally arm-twisted the newly installed government to realise their inappropriate demand in favour of no examination for the remaining papers of the postponed public examinations, it created a bad precedence. Then calling in students to confront the agitating ansars made the matter still worse.The popular perception is that teenage students ---those belonging to the G Alpha ---are vitiating the educational institutions' environment. Yes, they received encouragement from their elders at the college and university levels. Not only vice chancellors, irrespective of their performances, but also deans and teachers had to resign under duress. The teenagers have only followed their elders when there was no strong protest against such humiliation and resignations. They are the most impressionable of the lot. Here dots of social equation await connection. The disproportionate rise of teenage gangs compared to the demographic age distribution has long been a problem of serious concern. There is nothing to be surprised if those gangs become hyperactive at this time of lawlessness to settle scores against teachers who were strict and may have taken disciplinary actions against them. Also, some aspiring teachers of the concerned educational institutions and guardians may have instigated the young ones to serve their dubious purposes. Chain of command in society has long disintegrated but if teachers are victimised or even made to look so, the nation will have to pay a heavy price. Accepted that teachers are not angels but so are the bureaucrats. Why not dispense with them? The fact is that teachers have no scope to be as corrupt and influential as to hasten a social rot. True, some of them may have gone overboard by exposing their political allegiance to the ousted ruling party. There are procedures to deal with such deviations but why victimise teachers randomly? The country's education, despite its many limitations and shortcomings, strove for reasonable excellence. It will never be the same with the wholesale resignation of teachers in key positions of educational institutions from secondary to the tertiary levels following the disconnect between them and students.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh is certainly one of the countries which have the dirtiest, torn or contaminated banknotes in circulation, showing the authorities' utmost apathy to the health hazards and the damage to the nation's symbols of culture those end up causing. Notes with stains, graffiti, phone numbers, love messages inscribed along with holes, parts missing from many of those are in use here every day. Then notes held together by Scotch tape and edges trimmed or burnt are also in circulation. The condition of bills of small denominations is worse still. Banknotes change hands innumerable times and it is obvious that they will get damaged and torn by overuse, but the way most people here use them is supposed to damage them earlier than their normal life span. Many of us do not keep them in wallets or handbags; we fold them, keep them in pockets or in lungi folds, and other places not at all meant for holding banknotes. Banknotes tucked into the most unlikely corners like such drugs as heroin, cocaine, etc; to avoid detection. Let alone Bangladeshi currency notes, we do not spare even the US bills. There are numerous Bangladesh currency traders who stamp them with small seals to verify their authenticity.Currency notes of same denomination have no different values--- a 100-taka note, no matter if it is new or old, will always be valued at taka 100 precisely. But we forget that they have other value too. Throughout history, banknotes have been used to convey messages of national pride and patriotism. They are one of the most visible symbols of a nation's identity and culture and a physical representation of its history, values and aspirations. So, they are used to promote national identity and culture.Currency notes are damaged not only at the user end but also at banks. In fact, the process of their being damaged begins at banks which staple them to hold them together in bundles. Banknotes are classified in several grades like 'poor', 'fair', 'about good', 'good', 'very good' and 'fine' based on their collectable value. Most Bangladeshi currency notes will certainly fall in the 'poor' grade.Banknotes are naturally prone to contamination by pathogens and when they are used carelessly the users get more vulnerable to those. The pathogens often detected on notes are responsible for skin diseases, stomach diseases, urinary tract infection, abdominal infection, pneumonia, etc.The authorities have lately decided to print new currency notes of small denominations to replace those in bad condition in circulation. Printing of new notes will give a respite from dirty, torn and contaminated ones, but the situation will not improve much unless people learn to use them properly. We should not fold or wet them, keep them in pockets or staple them under any circumstances. We also should not write on them or stamp them with seals to verify their authenticity.We need to raise awareness about the proper use of banknotes, and the government and the central bank have a critical role to play here. We should keep in mind that banknotes are not merely money, those are more than that. Those are one of the most visible symbols of our nation's identity and culture and a physical representation of our history, values and aspirations.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Poor people, in particular, have been writhing under the crushing weight of rising prices, and in July, the country saw 14 per cent food inflation for the first time in 13 years. Households reduce expenditure on food and non-food items and change their food consumption habits but still fail to accommodate inflationary pressures. Several factors contribute to the price surge, including insufficient household and national incomes to purchase food, supply and demand uncertainty, natural calamities, food wastage, substandard technology, fluctuations in global oil prices, the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and the dollar crisis. However, the biggest problem lies in the country's dysfunctional legal system, which benefits opportunistic individuals. For years, the media have reported that avaricious coteries known as syndicates have hoarded or collaborated with others to raise prices by inducing artificial scarcity.Regardless of the previous government's various initiatives, such as duty exemptions on imports of items, the syndicates maintained control of the market for essential commodities. There have been allegations that political figures were also involved in these syndicates. Despite the regime's fall, prices have continued to rise.Thus, critical steps must be taken to ensure food security in the country. Some ways to control syndicates and food prices include properly implementing relevant laws, enhancing drives by regulatory bodies, improving agricultural R&D, and raising consumer awareness. By implementing these measures, Bangladesh can achieve food security while advancing its broader development goals.\nRumaisha Nowshin FatemaDepartment of Accounting and Finance (DAF)North South University[email\u00a0protected]",
