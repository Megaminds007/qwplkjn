The survey may form the basis for enhancing the quantum of reservation for Backward Classes (BCs), going by the party\u2019s election manifesto. At present, 112 communities under five categories of BCs enjoy a 29% quota in education and employment, including 4% for socially and educationally Muslim BCs. The survey is being undertaken at a time when demand for such an exercise at the all-India level is growing louder. In Tamil Nadu, an early mover in the area of affirmative action for BCs, political parties have been raising the issue though divided on whether the State or the Centre should conduct the exercise. In poll-bound Maharashtra, the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi has promised a caste-based census. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had stated that a caste census undertaken for the welfare of the downtrodden was fine but the BJP is cold to the idea. The Union government had also said that it had no proposal to make caste data of the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 public. In fact, in Karnataka, where most of the work on a socio-economic and educational survey was done about 10 years ago, the survey report has yet to be made public despite the submission of the final report to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.The idea of a caste-based survey is being floated as a prelude to the automatic lifting of the Supreme Court\u2019s ceiling of 50% in reservation for OBCs, SCs and STs. In June, the Patna High Court struck down two Acts in Bihar, envisaging enhanced quantum in quota for BCs, Extremely BCs, SCs and STs in education and government jobs. The Nitish Kumar government had carried out a caste survey prior to enacting the laws. The High Court had emphasised the principle of adequate representation while striking down the laws. In the case on 10.5% internal quota for Vanniyars within the Most BCs of Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court had upheld the Madras High Court\u2019s conclusion that the reservation to the community under the 2021 Act was based on \u201cantiquated data\u201d. Compilation and presentation of data would not mechanically pave the way for any increase in the quantum, let alone breaching the 50% cap. Analysis of features such as poverty, caste, occupation and location of residence should justify any move to increase the quantum. Besides, as in Article 16(4), only those communities inadequately represented in the public services can be given job quota. No political party should create an impression that a caste census will lead to increased OBC reservation. The Centre should also limit the ceiling of annual parental income in determining the creamy layer among OBCs. Else, only the most advanced sections among BCs will continue to corner the benefits of reservation.

        "full_article": "The collapse of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition in Germany last week has plunged Europe\u2019s largest and a recession-affected economy deeper into crisis. The three-way coalition, involving Mr. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, Greens and pro-market Free Democratic Party, was struggling for the past year to put up a united face amid public differences. As the economic crisis worsened, differences on a recovery also deepened, leading to Chancellor Scholz sacking his Finance Minister, Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats. While the Social Democrats and the Greens supported more borrowing and public spending to modernise and support industry and a shift towards environmental energy, Mr. Lindner advocated lower taxes and austerity measures. After Mr. Lindner\u2019s firing, his party colleagues quit the government. Infighting and economic challenges had already turned the government unpopular. All three parties in the coalition lost support in recent months, while the Conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw a surge in opinion polls. Now that he has lost parliamentary majority, Mr. Scholz will have to depend on opposition parties to pass key policy measures, including the budget for 2025, through the Bundestag.Mr. Scholz has so far resisted calls to face a vote of confidence quickly. Reports are that his plan is to run a minority government for a few more months. The Social Democrats say a collapse of the government at a time of multiple challenges would leave the country rudderless. But Mr. Scholz clinging on to power, heading an unpopular, minority government, is unlikely to resolve any of Germany\u2019s critical problems. The continuing war in Ukraine has hurt the German economy, which is set to contract for a second consecutive year. The country has also seen a large influx of migrants in recent years \u2014 over six million in a decade \u2014 which the far-right AfD has used to trigger panic in society and drum up support for itself. And the return of Donald Trump, who is sceptical of American support for Ukraine and NATO\u2019s role in general, is also a concern for Berlin. What Germany has to do is to bring in a decisive shift in its Ukraine policy, focusing on bringing the war to an end at the earliest through talks. And it should also take measures to pump-prime the economy and have policies to address the immigration challenge in a humanitarian fashion. Mr. Scholz, as a lame-duck Chancellor, is unlikely to take any decisive measure. What he can do is to face a vote of confidence immediately and prepare the country for snap elections.\r Published - November 12, 2024 12:15 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Germany\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        recession/slowdown\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        political parties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        taxes and duties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Russia-Ukraine Crisis\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economy (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        migration\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        NATO\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        unrest, conflicts and  war\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        budgets and budgeting",

        "full_article": "A UP body telling women their safety only lies in segregated spaces is absurd & counterproductive\nWomen\u2019s commissions across India should have their hands full. From crimes against women to other injustices, there is so much work to be done on their mandate to enhance women\u2019s status. And yet, what do these commissions mostly make headlines for? Partisan actions. This dysfunction speaks to how appointees are serving causes other than gender justice. But even by this underwhelming yardstick, the UP state women\u2019s commission\u2019s proposed guidelines for improving women\u2019s safety in public and commercial spaces are disgraceful.\nThe core idea is to segregate women from men \u2013 to get her hair cut a woman should only depend on a woman, to go to a gym only on a woman trainer, to get clothes stitched only on a woman tailor. This is a complete mockery of equality. Down this path, male doctors will not treat female patients, male teachers will only educate male students, all male and female workers will only work with colleagues of their own sex. This is straight out of Taliban\u2019s playbook. And look how that\u2019s going for Afghanistan.\nCommonsense should suffice to say this is not safety but the opposite. Instead of policing the exception who is guilty of \u201cbad touch\u201d, it\u2019s telling women to feel fearful of all male tailors, trainers, hairdressers. That it will improve women\u2019s employment is further farrago. Harassing businesses with such wild guidelines is actually an economic self-goal by any state, hurting opportunities as much as freedoms. Across societies, when diversity is straightjacketed by segregation, it lowers growth alongside social trust. Even sex-ed classes deliver better if they can educate girls and boys side by side. We owe our children a world where they thrive in \u2018mixed company\u2019 instead of dreading it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In India, there are special groups called women\u2019s commissions whose job is to help improve women\u2019s lives, making sure they are safe and treated fairly. But sometimes, they come up with ideas that aren\u2019t very helpful. One such idea is from the UP (Uttar Pradesh) women\u2019s commission, which suggested that women would be safer if they stayed separate from men in many places. Let\u2019s look at why this might not be a great idea.\nThe Plan to Separate Men and Women\nThe UP commission suggested that women should only rely on other women for many daily things\u2014like getting a haircut, going to the gym, or having clothes made. In their plan, women would only have female hairdressers, female trainers, and female tailors. This idea might sound like it\u2019s for women\u2019s safety, but it actually creates a lot of new problems.\nWhy Separation Isn\u2019t the Answer\nImagine if we take this idea to the extreme: male doctors wouldn\u2019t treat female patients, male teachers wouldn\u2019t teach female students, and men and women would work separately. This kind of thinking actually limits women\u2019s freedom and choices. In places like Afghanistan, there are strict rules that keep men and women apart, and it has made life very hard, especially for women.\nInstead of solving the problem of a few people behaving badly, this approach makes all men seem unsafe, which is unfair and unnecessary. It would mean treating all men as if they could cause harm, even if most men aren\u2019t a threat at all.\nThe Impact on Society\nIf businesses have to follow these strict rules, they will find it harder to grow and hire freely. Diversity\u2014meaning a mix of people working and learning together\u2014makes societies stronger and helps people understand and trust each other. When we keep groups apart, it often leads to more mistrust and fewer opportunities for everyone.\nEven for important topics like health and relationships, we learn better when boys and girls are taught together, so they can respect and understand each other.\nLet\u2019s Create a Better World\nWhat we need is not separation but better understanding, respect, and real protections for women. We should work on creating a world where men and women can be safe and comfortable in shared spaces, with fair laws and systems that protect everyone. Women shouldn\u2019t have to stay apart to feel safe; they should be able to live, work, and learn alongside men confidently.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Managing waste is tricky, and some solutions actually cause more problems. Let\u2019s dive into one of these solutions: waste-to-energy plants, also known as incinerators.\nWhat Are Incinerators?\nIncinerators burn waste to produce energy. Sounds cool, right? You get rid of trash and create power at the same time! But things aren\u2019t that simple. In India, these plants haven\u2019t worked out as planned. A waste-to-energy plant in Delhi, called Timarpur-Okhla, was supposed to be helpful, but it has led to pollution problems that worry people.\nWhy India\u2019s Waste Is Different\nIncinerators work best with dry, non-organic waste. In India, a lot of waste is organic\u2014things like food scraps that are wet and need a lot of energy to burn. This makes incinerators a poor fit for our waste, but many cities are still setting them up. Even in places like Europe and the U.S., people are beginning to turn away from incinerators because they can pollute the air.\nWhat\u2019s a Better Way to Handle Waste?\nOne answer is to *reduce and manage waste where it\u2019s made*. If we separate waste properly\u2014organic stuff like food scraps, and recyclable materials like plastics and metals\u2014more of it can be composted or recycled right away. Towns like Alappuzha in Kerala are doing great with this approach! They separate waste at the source and compost it, helping reduce the amount of garbage sent to landfills.\nWhy Do We Have So Much Trash?\nAfter World War II, people started using more and more things that get thrown away, like plastic bottles and packaging. Did you know that 20,000 plastic bottles are sold every second? And richer countries often send their waste to poorer countries, which causes problems for their soil, water, and communities.\nWhat\u2019s the Big Challenge for India?\nIndia has some extra challenges. We have a huge population, and our waste collection system can be messy. There\u2019s also the issue of caste, which affects who ends up handling garbage. But we\u2019re not alone! Other places, like Europe, the U.S., and Japan, have also struggled with waste in their history.\nWhat Can Be Done?\nWaste is complicated. It\u2019s not just about individuals recycling more; big companies also create a lot of waste, especially industrial waste. The government should make sure these companies clean up after themselves. That way, the burden doesn\u2019t just fall on regular people or our cities.\nIf we can work together and make better choices for our waste, we can keep our cities cleaner and healthier for everyone.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Managing waste is complex. Incinerators are a solution as bad as the problem \nTurning waste into energy, and therefore, greening it, is an excellent plan. But plans in India have a way of subverting the very purpose behind them. Media reports in Delhi have highlighted problems with Jindal Group\u2019s Timarpur-Okhla waste to energy plant. There\u2019s also a New York Times report on this. Indian cities have a huge problem with landfills \u2013 rotting mountains oozing methane and leachate. Waste to energy plants, or incinerators, appeal to policymakers seeking instant, high-tech solutions \u2013 they promise to cut trash volume, generate electricity and produce ash that can be used for construction. But they\u2019re unsuited to India, with our large proportion of organic and wet waste, which takes more energy to dry and reach scorching temperatures. Even Europe and US are witnessing a backlash against incinerators. But they are being set up everywhere in India.\nA much better way for India is decentralised waste management \u2013 segregation at source, in-situ composting, and minimising waste creation to be sent to landfills is the sustainable way. It is this ecosystem, this task flow, at the source \u2013 refuse collector to recycling managers (read kabadis) \u2013 that needs to be professionalised, replacing the raggedy motley of workers with trained waste management professionals, in private and govt sectors.\nOur solid waste management rules\u00a0 are clear on each category of waste. Towns like Alapuzha have achieved substantial progress. But waste is a complex and wicked problem, with no easy answers. It is simply the underside of consumption. After the mid-20th century, humans began generating enormous, everlasting heaps of trash: 20,000 plastic bottles are sold every second. Western nations offshored waste to poorer countries, blighting soil and water and lives.Nobody wants to look closely at waste.\nIndia has special challenges, including the magnitude of our garbage, and the blind spots of a caste society. But it is not entirely unique \u2013 urbanising countries from Europe to US and Japan have grappled with garbage and sewage issues. Sometimes transformation takes a crisis, to trigger a shared panic among rich and poor and across social groups, as when the great stink of the Thames in 1958 appalled Westminster, or when the bubonic plague hit Surat in the 1990s. Dealing with our waste crisis requires deeper understanding \u2013 it is not just a matter of citizens recycling or better municipal arrangements: most of the waste is produced by industry. So, govts must make companies take responsibility for industrial waste, not let them get away with causing public harm, as the Okhla plant does.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The fact that a climate debt has been accumulating in Bangladesh's name is both alarming and unjust, especially considering the country's minimal contributions to global climate crisis. According to a report citing data from the Dhaka-based research organisation Change Initiative, the country's per capita climate debt climbed to nearly $80 (about Tk 9,500) in 2022 from just over $2 in 2009. This places an unfair burden on our citizens that they should not have to bear.\nThis debt has reportedly accumulated because Bangladesh has funded projects to address the impacts of climate change. In 2009, the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) was created to support adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Currently, around six to seven percent of the national budget is allocated for climate adaptation each year, with 75 percent of this funding coming from domestic sources. Still, Bangladesh had to take $12.78 billion in climate debt to finance multiple projects between 2009 and 2022.\nThis might not have been an issue if Bangladesh had received the international financial support pledged for climate-vulnerable nations. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries committed to providing $100 billion annually by 2020 to help vulnerable nations adopt adaptation and mitigation measures. But the developed countries\u2014primary contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u2014have failed to fulfil this commitment. In fact, in many cases, the pledges have turned into loans when those should have been grants (finance without any conditions).\nBangladesh, contributing just 0.56 percent of global GHG emissions, is ranked seventh in the long-term climate crisis index. Yet, between 2009 and 2022, the country received only $268 million in grants from the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and LDC Fund. Meanwhile, as climate change worsens, the situation grows more severe: in coastal regions, around 3.6 crore people are now at heightened risk due to rising sea levels, river erosion, severe cyclones, and saltwater intrusion. Annual losses due to climate-related disasters are estimated at $3 billion, and climate-induced displacement is on the rise. Reversing these impacts in the country would require $230 billion, according to the National Action Plan (2023-2050). Why should we bear this cost when we have done so little to cause the crisis?\nThe refusal of developed countries to take full responsibility, leaving vulnerable nations saddled with debt, is unacceptable. Bangladesh must use COP29, which is being touted as the \"Finance COP,\" to emphasise the need for substantial increases in climate finance as grants, not loans. This is non-negotiable, and Bangladesh and other climate-vulnerable nations must stand firm. We hope the chief adviser attending COP29 will succeed in conveying the urgency of this situation and pressing for genuine climate justice.\n",

        "full_article": "To the horror of many in the world, a seemingly racist, misogynist, Islamophobic would-be dictator has beaten his highly qualified and intelligent opponent, to become \"leader of the free world.\" Many are lamenting that America will no longer be a beacon of democracy.\nBut let's get real. The US has never been a shining star of justice and human rights. America has consistently supported totalitarian regimes in other countries. It decimated Vietnam because of a fear of communism, casually dropping leftover bombs on Cambodia and Laos. It invaded Iraq after Saudis, not Iraqis, attacked the World Trade Center. It continues to provide arms to Israel despite all the atrocities Netanyahu has committed.\nDomestically, the country has not been much better. There is the extremely undemocratic and unique system of life terms for Supreme Court justices. There is the electoral college, which means that the president is not chosen by the popular vote, so each person's vote does not count the same. There is a long and ugly, continuing trend of voter suppression, and the fact that a third to a half of voters fail to vote in major elections.\nShall I continue? President Clinton started the period of mass incarceration which continues to devastate Black communities to this day. Ronald Reagan ushered in a new generation of millionaires and increased poverty. America incarcerated Japanese people during World War II and turned away boatloads of Holocaust survivors seeking shelter on American soil. Earlier in its history was the extermination of most indigenous people and the forced migration, with mass deaths, of the remaining natives.\nAmerica's founding fathers (and much of the population at the time) did not consider Black people as human. The declaration that \"All men are created equal\" extended neither to women nor to non-white men.\nToo often in its history, the American people have accepted horrific injustices. Too often they have turned away in apathy and distaste from politics and the need to reform it.\nThe tag line of\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0is: \"Democracy dies in darkness\". The paper's owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, refused to allow an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris for president due to fear of economic reprisal from Trump if he won. Democracy dies in many ways. It dies when we allow people to accumulate such vast wealth that they can almost singlehandedly determine the direction of our politics. Democracy dies when people passively accept atrocities committed against other groups. It dies when people refuse to be engaged citizens. It dies when we allow ourselves to be distracted by social media, entranced by conspiracy theories, and amused by buffoonish but exceedingly dangerous politicians.\nAs to why Trump won, it was probably a mixture of causes. The biggest reason may have been inflation, which has caused incumbent politicians around the world to be voted out of office. Then there is the untoward influence of billionaires, the dummifying of the nation through social media, and a mass media that profits from Trump. Then there's the ongoing misogyny and racism that prevented a highly qualified and decent woman of colour from winning.\nWhat can we learn from the American disaster? First, that democracy isn't easy. It doesn't thrive without constant work and care. I've always been impressed by the level of activism in Bangladesh, of people demonstrating, speaking up, and even putting their lives on the line for what they care about. We could use some more of that commitment in the US. Second, that ugliness, hatred, and vitriol are appealing to many. Trump knows how to play a crowd, and just as people loved Ronald Reagan because he allowed them to feel good about being selfish, so people adore Trump, even worship him, because he encourages them to be, not their best, but rather their worst self.\nGiven the second point, and the sway that conspiracy theories have over the uninformed, it is of vital importance that we raise the level of political discourse and find ways to make important issues interesting to the masses. The joyful, hope-filled campaign of Kamala Harris is an example of making politics enjoyable and celebratory. We need to understand that her loss likely had nothing to do with her campaign\u2014that it is generally a minority who appreciate nastiness, and that it is never acceptable to copy the methods of successful autocrats. We can and must do better.\nAmerica has let the world down. The devastating consequences to peace, the environment, the climate, and the global economy will be felt worldwide. The correct response is not despair, but rather a stronger commitment than ever to fight for democracy and decency wherever we are. America was never a model democracy, but perhaps now another country can more justly assume that role.\nDebra Efroymson\u00a0is executive director of the Institute of Wellbeing, Bangladesh.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "The South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Women's Championship recently took place from October 17 to 30 at Dasharath Rangasala Stadium in Kathmandu, Nepal, featuring teams from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The teams showcased the growing talent and commitment of women footballers across the region. Constrained by limited opportunities and societal roles imposed by patriarchal structures, the Bangladesh team's success in clinching the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship is an immense motivation for all women and girls in the country, and it embodies the spirit of courage and zest. More than just a sporting victory, this is a liberation from the societal expectations and decades-long obstacles that have restricted women's participation in sports.\nFootball has been a male-dominated sport in South Asia for decades, leaving few opportunities for women to play this wonderful sport professionally. However, the outlook is somewhat improving. Football in the women's circuit has received a welcome boost from some inspiring examples from the international football stage, as many players, having come from difficult backgrounds, have shown special skills in overcoming the hurdles. Against this background, the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship has piqued audience interest, with seasoned players aligned with emerging talents: India's Ashalata Devi, Bangladesh's Sabina Khatun, and Nepal's Renuka Nagarkoti. As women's football seems to be finally hitting the mark in the region, these sportswomen are role models for the upcoming generations of girls who want to take up football.\nThe SAFF tournament with its 12 matches was an exceptional fixture. In the finals, held on October 30, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by a score of 2\u20131, thereby conferring its 2nd SAFF title. The teams commenced the tournament in a round-robin format before going on to the knockout rounds, leading to the grand finals. While four of the semifinals sprinted for one-time title-bound glory, Bangladesh's women's football team's achievement was entwined with the hope and resilience of Bangladeshis during the 2024 SAFF Women's Championship.\nHowever, even as the celebrations erupted, a gloomy shadow was on the horizon. The coach of the Bangladesh team, Peter Butler, announced his resignation immediately after their victory. With this, the entire football fraternity grimaced in shock. Butler emphasised the issues of delayed payment and some other problems during his term, saying that he had not been paid his salary for three months. The news caused ripples in the women's sports fraternity, with debates on the need for transformation. While winning the SAFF championship symbolises a monumental win, it marks a wake-up call. Studies mention that women's sports receive only four percent of the total media coverage, which thankfully has been increasing in recent times. Similarly, sponsorship for women's sports is less than one percent in most countries.\nLack of financial support directly affects team performance. If the coach or players feel unappreciated, this will show in their performance and results. To realise the full potential for women within sports, there is a need to deal with opportunities and gaps; support includes timely salaries for coaches and funds for training and development for young female athletes. The transitions from amateur to professional opportunities can be enhanced by paying scholarships, creating mentoring programmes, and providing support for women in coaching. Community participation and consciousness-raising campaigns are taking centre stage in the quest to change stereotypical representations of women within sports.\nThere is a call upon sports associations, governments, and corporate sponsors to put women's football at the top of their priority lists and invest in it most preferentially. The gap in funding compared to men's sports is glaring. Investing in women's sports could yield considerable economic returns and social benefits such as increased community engagement and improved health outcomes for women.\nSupporting women's football doesn't simply break down into just fair salaries for coaches and pay for players, it's about building an arena wherein women can flourish, free of financial insecurity. If barriers to the success of women in football can be removed, women can do everything they want. In the course of dismantling the stereotype, and opening up opportunities by allowing women into football, society will empower these women to fulfil their passions and realise their fullest potential.\nThe learnings from this championship transcend the boundaries of the football field and point toward the various supporting systems needed to empower women across all disciplines. It starts with early education. The message is clear: give women opportunities, and they will deliver greatness.\nWith each roar of encouragement from the gallery, with each goal, with each moment of camaraderie, the barriers that once confined women begin to crumble and the domain becomes open to young girls who have started to come out onto the fields, inspired by the victory of the Bangladesh team.\nZareen Tasneem is student at North South University.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
