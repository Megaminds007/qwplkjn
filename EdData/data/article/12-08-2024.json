It is also a reminder that the fundamentals of bail law are quite simple. Where a case turns mainly on documentary evidence, bail is the norm, and it is to be denied only if the suspect is a flight risk and is unlikely to appear before the court for trial, or is in a position to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. The possibility of the trial not beginning anytime soon or that it may be a protracted one is also a circumstance warranting grant of bail. In times when Opposition political leaders are targeted and investigative agencies have no compunction about being seen as branches of the ruling party, the mere act of releasing a person on conditional bail after giving enough time for the completion of the investigation is seen as something extraordinary. In the Delhi liquor policy case, Mr. Sisodia was arrested by the CBI and then the Enforcement Directorate in early 2023. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s turn came this year, but he managed to get interim bail in the ED\u2019s case concerning money-laundering charges, while he is still in custody in connection with the CBI\u2019s corruption case.The order of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan has done more than pave the way for Mr. Sisodia\u2019s release after nearly a year-and-a-half in prison. It has foregrounded the principle that the rigours of a bail-denying law, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in this case, need not stand in the way of a person\u2019s conditional release if there is a prolonged delay in the trial proceedings. It has also brought under focus the tendency among some judges to \u201cplay safe\u201d. The Bench has rightly highlighted the tendency among some judges to ignore the principle that bail is the rule, and not the exception. In Mr. Sisodia\u2019s case, based on the ED\u2019s assurance that the trial would be complete within six to eight months, the Court had allowed him to apply for bail again if the trial progresses too slowly or is protracted. This was on October 30, 2023. However, both the trial court and the Delhi High Court paid no heed to the Supreme Court\u2019s pointed reference to the need for speedy trial, but dismissed his application on merits and claimed that any delay in the commencement of the trial was attributable to the various petitions he has filed. Judges should guard against a likely loss of public trust in the judiciary\u2019s ability to protect the liberty of citizens and ensure fair trial without prolonged and needless pre-trial imprisonment.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nministers (government)\n\n/\n\nDelhi\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nprison\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nmoney laundering\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party",

The rejig is in doing away with the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards, once awarded to scientists under 45 by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). It comprised a certificate, a cash prize and some additional monetary benefits. The RVP replaces it with a medal and a certificate and, renaming it the Vigyan Yuva-SSB. There are also other RVP awards \u2014 the Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Ratna and Vigyan Team awards. The latter will be for scientists over 45 who have made distinguished contributions in science and technology over their entire career as well, as for teams of scientists and technologists with exceptional contributions.In theory the total number of awards, under all categories, is capped at 56, though those selected for this year are fewer than the ceiling. The team award has been conferred on the Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s \u2018Chandrayaan-3 team\u2019, which certainly has over three members. These may well be technicalities and, being the first edition of the prizes, could be transitional. The list of awardees spans a wide range of fields from astrophysics to agriculture, and this is not unique to the RVP, the awardees are overwhelmingly from centrally funded and the most elite of India\u2019s scientific and research institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, CSIR and atomic energy institutions. The RVP awards were instituted after the Ministry of Home Affairs and heads of science departments concluded in 2022 that there were too many awards being given out by individual scientific departments and that it was necessary to trim them and raise their \u2018stature\u2019 to national awards. While distinguished scientists have always received the Padma awards, just as those in other fields, the original schema for scientist-specific awards was to encourage them to stick to research, whose outcomes are not always immediately tangible and whose impact is not immediately assessed. Much like Olympic medals, Nobel Prizes continue to elude Indian scientists and this has been a touchy topic for many governments. The national awards are not a substitute or catalyst for the Nobels. The government should not assume that scientists only crave honour and recognition. Too many scientists in India labour with minimal funds, substandard equipment and a discouraging milieu, forcing them to compete at the cutting edge of research with their hands tied. Raising the budgetary allocation and making scientific research more rewarding in India will do greater service to science than tokenism. \nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nscience (general)\n\n/\n\naward and prize\n\n/\n\nISRO\n\n/\n\ngovernment departments\n\n/\n\nbudgets and budgeting\n\n/\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "Amid a backdrop of icy grey acacia trees, four elephants stood in a trance. A female recognisable by the geometric planes of her head and three bull elephants. Perched on the bouncing seats of a khaki jeep, I had stumbled upon a primeval mating ritual. The elephants moved slowly. Approaches. Rejections. Swiping right and left with their trunks.\nThe mating was short-lived and clumsy. Like a section of Indian men, bull elephants also seem to believe that if two minutes are good enough for Maggi noodles, then it\u2019s good enough for them. Our safari guide, who could be mistaken for Shikari Shambu, informed us that the elephants would mate several times over the next few days and then go their own way. The resulting calf would be raised by a herd of predominantly female elephants.\nThis was a common phenomenon among the mammals I spotted in Tanzania: lionesses protecting their cubs and tiny wildebeests running alongside their moms and aunts. Communities of females raising their young, with males either absent, or wandering in and out without doing much of the heavy lifting. I found it intriguing how we humans evolved from these collective structures into units of two and decided that our mating rituals had to include both monogamy and matrimony. Why did we confine ourselves in a 2BHK, hum-do-hamare-do cage? And if marriage is about everlasting love, why does it seem to run out faster than an Eveready battery?\nA little digging into history brought up a startling fact. The concept of marriage had initially nothing to do with love but was due to the advent of agriculture. When we were nomads, it didn\u2019t matter if the child you were carrying was Sharma ji\u2019s from the neighbouring cave or that foolish Desai\u2019s who was scared of the rain. Then came farming, and land became an ownable commodity. Men needed to ensure that only their biological children would inherit their assets. Enter wedlock, a mechanism to tie down a woman by making the prosperity of her children dependent on her monogamy. Only around the 18th century did luv, shuv and all the bheja fry that entailed enter the fray.\nWhile a marriage does have its chafing issues, it has some surprising medical advantages. A recent paper published in the Annals of Behavioural Medicine found that people who never married were twice as likely to die early as those in solid marriages. It\u2019s men, though, who seem to wither away without partners, while women tend to put on their lipstick and just get on with it. There is also enough research that shows raising a family with a reliable partner has definite advantages over being a single parent. But how do you sleep next to a partner when, at least twice a week, you are overcome with the urge to strangle them \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting the times when their snoring is louder than the baboons chattering outside your tent. While philosophers and self-help gurus dissect human nature, I chose to focus on nature itself, observing the techniques animals use as their survival often hinges on a delicate balance of cooperative hunting strategies and symbiotic relationships.\n\nHyena\u2019s Hustle: Hyenas don\u2019t battle with lions for a share of the kill. They approach stealthily and run away with a juicy bit. Instead of constant confrontations, perhaps sometimes we should just resort to trickery. When your partner starts singing Punjabi songs at ear-shattering decibels, asking him to stop may become a battle of freedom like he is Gandhi ji fighting for swaraj. Instead distract him with questions like, \u2018What was that movie we saw that day with that guy? It was on Netflix, remember?\u2019 While his mind does multiple cartwheels, enjoy the blissful silence.\nBonhomie of Baboons: I watched baboons grooming each other and playing together. These creatures tend to live in large groups where females make lifelong bonds. After entering a relationship, women especially tend to concentrate primarily on their partners. Focus is a dangerous thing if directed only in one direction. It\u2019s how a magnifying glass sets paper on fire. Perhaps we are better off strengthening our social network like baboons. Basically, keep your man close but your girlfriends even closer.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\nGiraffe\u2019s Gaze: Giraffes seem to be eternally scanning the landscape. In relationships as well, it\u2019s better to look through a wide angle instead of a zoom lens. Your partner\u2019s poor jokes and preference for mummy\u2019s rajma can feel like significant grievances in the moment but fade away a week later.\nHint from Hippos: Hippos communicate through grunts, roars, and sprays of water. Our guide told us that these signals convey their moods and avoid conflicts within their group. Communication in a marriage is often not about what you are saying but how you present it. I have a friend who, whether she is asking her husband to empty the bin or share her biryani, always begins by calling him \u2018baby\u2019. I used to laugh at her in our twenties but looking at them still going strong three decades later, I have to say that effective communication is the true Fevicol ka Jod.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\nCheetah\u2019s Composure: Cheetahs are gifted with speed, but they wait and go for the kill only when the time is right. Instead of getting into heated discussions over whose turn it was to take your kid shopping for sneakers and why dirty clothes are on the floor, wait till you both have downed a glass of wine or whatever beverage helps you see the world through rose-tinted glasses. Then, when your partner, like the grazing impala, has his guard down, launch your attack.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\n\nOn our last game drive, we saw another herd, with a solitary bull elephant walking far ahead of the females with calves. The bull elephant had my husband\u2019s sympathies. \u2018Poor guy, he is all alone.\u2019 I was more focused on how the male could wander off as he pleased, while the females had to take care of the young. That, I suppose, is marriage in a nutshell \u2014 two people looking at the same scenario with different interpretations and then bickering over what is right, and often these days, why right is wrong and left is right.\nDriving back to camp that evening, the guide pointed out a pair of birds called tik-tik who are so devoted to each other that when one dies, the other sometimes kills itself by eating poisonous grass. I told my husband, \u2018Acha, if I die first, you better eat poisonous grass too. If I see your second wife walking around with my handbags, I promise I will come and haunt you both.\u2019\nHe shook his head and replied, \u2018I want to eat that poisonous grass right now, at least then I won\u2019t have to listen to all this nonsense.\u2019 Then he swatted a mosquito on my arm, the human equivalent of baboons delousing each other. We continued engaging in the complex choreography of cooperation, affection and mutual tolerance as our jeep raced against the setting sun.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s tough. Male domination is built into idea of romance.\nThe personal is the political. And nothing is more personal than a romantic relationship. Reinventing Love: How the Patriarchy Sabotages Heterosexual Relationsby French feminist Mona Chollet explores the dynamics of romantic love in the context of gender inequality.\nMen and women are methodically socialised not to understand each other. The whole drama of our novels and pop culture and romcoms involves conventions of domination and submission. In our romantic representations, the woman is inferior in some way. Even minor things like a woman being taller, or earning more than a man, would be a buzzkill \u2013 Carla Bruni routinely posed on a step below her shorter husband Nicolas Sarkozy, pictures of Prince Charles were contrived to make him look taller than his then wife Diana. Women smile, practise being pleasant, are careful not to be \u2018too much\u2019, too loud or powerful. Athletes like Serena Williams have been disciplined through derision. To be desirable, women must diminish themselves.\nLove is cast as a woman\u2019s main business. We condition girls to seek love through a man, rather than a healthy consideration for themselves. Female selflessness and masculine detachment are part of our relationship schema. And yet, the most elementary emotional needs of women are stigmatised, cast as needy and desperate. Meanwhile, boys are also taught to amputate their relational needs.\nThe book analyses the many manifestations of this inequality, drawing on literature, pop culture and the media discourse. It looks at conjugal violence, why women make excuses for men who hurt them, because they are trained to be empathetic to an extreme, rather than to have self-compassion. It explores why some white men objectify Asian women, for instance, or seek living dolls who cannot talk back. It details the effects of objectification, as women are always aware of being looked at by others. This prevents them from accessing their own sensations, sentiments and desires.\nBut the heart has its reasons, some will argue. Love cannot be reformed; we want what we want. Why do forceful lovers seem to loom large in women\u2019s fiction and fantasy? Why do so many women like the idea of submission, why does feminist porn often seem unconvincing? Because masculine domination is the condition we live in, says the book. To resolve the tension created by the experience of domination, women turn it into sexual or romantic fantasy. Our challenge is to eroticise equality, as Gloria Steinem famously said.\nTrapped in our fantasies, we obliterate the needs of the person we love. And often we don\u2019t know what portion of our attachment is real desire, and what is a need for validation from them. Love is not a simple sentiment, but an ensemble of actions, it is what we do for the person we love. For women, this calls for internal emancipation, to not be afraid to be alone and to change terms one does not like.\nIt is possible to have a more equal love story. Heterosexual love is not just a patriarchal con: men are not only oppressors, women are more than merely oppressed. But their tie is poisoned by domination, and we must see this dysfunction clearly. The edifice of conventional love must be dismantled to reconstruct another one. To peel off our masks, to question our own learned reflexes, that is the adventure and heroism of real love.\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "By James Anderson\nThere is a flower deep inside each of us which yearns to bloom. This is what Sri Aurobindo calls the psychic being, a term unique to his yoga. The psychic is the evolving soul, which is the key to all individual growth and evolution. Over innumerable lifetimes, if the being keeps moving upwards, the psychic edges forward, becoming more perceptible and eventually forming a \u2018conscious sheath\u2019 around the soul. And thus, \u2018identified with the Divine, it becomes the perfect instrument in the world.\u2019 Realising the psychic being is a supreme objective of Integral Yoga. Words cannot convey the knowledge of the psychic. This knowledge can only be encapsulated by experience.\nThe psychic being is the inimitable godhead that resides inside us all. Its influence is unmistakable. It carries the certitude of Truth and the fragrance of Love. It is the true home of unconditional love, the adoring child of the Divine Mother. This \u2018Rose of God\u2019 is a portion of the Divine. It is like touching a spring we discover to be limitless. Whenever we call the Mother, we entreat this entity to step forward. Whenever we consciously surrender to Her, we yield more and more to its presence.\nThe psychic being is the Soul Personality who maps out our destiny and expresses our unique Truth. Everything must be centred on this Truth. From the beginning, it secretly charts the \u2018main lines\u2019 and circumstances of our lives. It is our inner teacher; its growth and emergence mark the level of spiritual evolution that each one of us has reached.\nThe psychic being is fully awake; it never hides. It is only we who need to awaken to it. Presently, it is buried beneath the folds of our nature. It is veiled by the surface ego consciousness. It can only be accessed by re-orienting our consciousness and aligning within. It resides inside the heart centre but exists in a different dimension, far beyond the clutch of our three-dimensional senses.\nInitially, of course, we must deploy them and only aspiration can take us there. We have to work assiduously on ourselves to identify with the psychic being. We only need to open and allow it to radiate through us. But resistance is present. With conscious practice, the personal effort succumbs gradually to a loving surrender. We give ourselves and pray to the Mother to lead us to this sublime presence.\nThe work on this path of purification helps bring the psychic forward. We identify and invoke its help. The psychic being alone has the capacity for true integration; it works dynamically, aligning and harmonising everything in the being around itself. It is our truest instrument for self-mastery and change.It manifests Oneness in all the multiplicity of our nature, a prerequisite for transformation. Only by collaborating with the psychic can we realise it. It is not a static process. When we engage, it becomes a Supreme Force for progress and transformation.\nOne does not climb to get there: it is a horizontal process. It dwells in the depths not the heights. Any portal of our nature can be chosen: mind, life or body. We choose whatever way resonates with us. The important thing is, we set our means and stick to it. Nothing should stand in the way of the psychic presence. Set your sights on this goal and find it.\nThe writer is the coordinating editor of NAMAH, the Journal of Integral Health.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The inspiration for decolonization, as a philosophical term, writes Achille Mbembe, was the 'active will to community' which can be translated as something like 'to stand up on one's own and create a heritage'.\u00a0 The impetus for decolonization in theatre, as it moved from re-instituting indigenous traditions in place of colonial modernity, to retrieving indigenous systems through 'provincializing Europe' as Dipesh Chakrabarty aptly defines, came from different quarters. The Cold War context provided a range of influences, from western European and north American theatre experiments to socialist realisms and socialist internationalism, as well as the inter-cultural practices emerging from Asian-African alliances. The modern Indian theatre drew on these multiple modernities. The outcome was a significant shift away not only from traditional forms of folk theatre and classical Sanskrit drama, but also from the modern colonial theatre in terms of canon formation, actor training, circulation of texts and performances, reception, patronage, and criticism. Institutionally, as part of the 'will to community', a new cultural bureaucracy, often functioning closely with the administrative one, sustained this shift from the local to the national level.\n\nUtpal Dutt differentiated between fact and truth by focusing on their connection with social conflict and argued that fact remains mere bourgeois truth when abstracted from the context of continuous social conflict between the haves and the have-nots and conversely that fact can become a revolutionary truth when it intertwines the realities of conflict, and sides unerringly with the have-nots.\nUtpal Dutt (1929-1993) embodied this shift. With the exception of direct involvement in cultural bureaucracy, he straddled the process of decolonization, forging a political theatre of the postcolonial contemporary for modern India. When he emerged as a promising theatre-maker and performer in the city of Calcutta in late 1940s, the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA henceforth), as part of the communist movement in India, had already established itself as a formidable force in cultural politics and the idea of progressive political theatre had started to gain ground. Before his inevitable shift towards IPTA in 1950-51, Dutt was a member of British thespian Geoffrey Kendal's touring Shakespeareana International which, performed Shakespeare's plays in metropolises and mofussil towns across India. Theatre critic Samik Bandyopadhyay notes that the democratic nature of this travelling theatre troupe was crucial in shaping Dutt as an artist. After touring with Kendal, Dutt started his own English theatre group in Calcutta, The Amateur Shakespeareans, and won critical acclaim for modernised productions of Romeo and Juliet (1948) and Julius Caesar (1949).\nDutt's acute sense of the need to engage with the process of decolonization was the reason behind his abandonment of English theatre even after such bravura productions. English theatre in Calcutta was a decidedly elite practice and he turned away from it to begin his stint with IPTA,\u00a0 joining the central Calcutta squad of IPTA as a director and actor and performing in different productions like Tagore's Bisarjan (performed in 1952) and\u00a0 Ritwik Ghatak's Dalil (1951) as well as in various street-corner plays like Bhoter Bhet (1951).\nThe experience of making theatre with IPTA while engaging with communist politics and Marxist philosophy, though short-lived, became foundational in Dutt's subsequent journey as a political theatre artist. He created his 'Little Theatre Group' (LTG) and, in 1953 leased the Minerva theatre in Calcutta as its permanent home. LTG began with classic Tagore plays, translations of Shakespeare and Russian theatre, and social farces by the nineteenth-century playwright Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Their production of Macbeth (1954) became particularly successful and received invitations for performances even in remote villages, smaller towns and working-class areas. LTG finally found its feet on the Bengali stage with Dutt's Angaar (1959), a play about the lives of coal miners that culminates in a mining disaster and references a recent catastrophe in the Baradhemo coal mine. Angaar became hugely popular not only for its intensely political theme but also because of the sophisticated scenography, sound and lighting design employed. The climax of Angaar, an exemplary feat of stagecraft depicting the despair of seven miners trapped underground waiting to be drowned, is described by Bharucha as an 'epiphany of grief' in which the spectacle of a calamity becomes a source of entertainment and is applauded. Dutt, in his later assessment of his own work, was critical of Angaar because it could not represent the truth of miners' resistance, but was limited to displaying the facts of their huge exploitation.\nThis tension between truth and fact shaped Dutt's vision of political theatre, which he called revolutionary theatre. He differentiated between fact and truth by focusing on their connection with social conflict and argued that fact remains mere bourgeois truth when abstracted from the context of continuous social conflict between the haves and the have-nots and conversely that fact can become a revolutionary truth when it intertwines the realities of conflict, and sides unerringly with the have-nots. His aim was to represent revolutionary truth because, in his view, presenting only impartial facts risked reifying bourgeois power, and he wanted his theatre to be an agent of change, and thus a factor in the revolution. This meant recounting as many instances of such change as possible, especially historical moments when exploitative regimes are challenged by the poor, the colonized and the 'native'. He aspired to portray the full complexity of power relations at intersecting points in the context of social conflict. This is the reason Dutt so often revisits histories of anti-colonial revolts against the British in India, revolts against other imperial powers in other geo-political contexts, and rebellions against experiences of domination. His stint in the Bengali folk theatre form Jatra, from 1971 to 1988, bears the same marks of revolutionary intent in highlighting historical moments of resistance against colonial/authoritarian regimes.\n'One of the ironies of political theatre', observes Rustom Bharucha, 'is that it thrives during the worst periods of repression'. Discussions of political theatre, consequently, need to be continually informed by understanding of the nature of repression and period-specific details of each socio-political situation. In order to make sense of the cultural critique offered by political theatre, the critic has to engage with the defining characteristics of the postcolonial contemporary. This need becomes even more acute in the case of an artist like Dutt because he explicitly identified\u00a0 his project as a revolutionary theatre, that 'addresses these working masses and must adjust its pitch, tone and volume accordingly' in order to agitate for revolutionary social transformation. That his revolutionary theatre was dismissed by a large number of critics as communist propaganda did not dishearten Dutt, but rather he wore the term 'propagandist' as a badge of honour and declared 'to hell with the so-called critics who find our plays naive, melodramatic and loud'.\nThe recent revivals of his plays from 2018 to 2023 by various theatre groups, including People's Little Theatre that Dutt had created in 1971 after LTG dissolved, invite us to revisit the phase of interconnected histories from a different angle because the impetus to return to Dutt's plays adds another thread to the interconnected histories. This new thread intertwines twenty-first century experiences of the rise of the right-wing, the global south gig-economy, and the coming of a new generation of postcolonial intellectuals. Taken together these threads compel contemporary theatre-makers to bring Dutt's work back to the stage.\nLet me list some of these revivals, with the caveat that this list is not exhaustive. I have already mentioned the revival of Titu Mir. Along with Titu Mir came Ghum Nei (1959), a play on the significance of the workers' union, which is now regularly performed by the theatre group Iccheymoto to warm receptions and has received awards for its sets, sound and performance. Sourav Palodhi, the director of the 2023 revival, has argued that this play has contemporary resonance because it underlines the importance of the workers' collective voice in sustaining the secular ethos of Indian democracy (Palodhi 2023). Similarly, Barricade (1972), which comments on the rise of authoritarianism against the backdrop of the rise of Nazism in Germany, was revived by the theatre group Chakdaha Natyajan in January 2022 to comment on the contemporary crises of religious fundamentalism and political violence in India. Another Dutt play Ekla Chalo Re (1989) which re-tells the history of Partition and the subsequent religious riots through the historical moment of Gandhi's assassination in 1948, was successfully revived by the group Swapna Sandhani in 2019.\nFinally, Utpal Dutt's legacy remains dependent on and is shaped by these new interpretations of his theatre. His work created a reservoir of memory and his plays and his approach to theatre-making, provide a constant reminder of the importance of history in fashioning the present. The future, however, is being shaped here and now by a new generation of directors, actors and dramaturgs who are making Dutt relevant again, and interpreting his work in ways that facilitate better understanding of the conceptual and material spaces the new postcolonial generation occupies. The process of decolonization in the political theatre of Utpal Dutt, thus remains a vital part of an ongoing movement where every act of thinking and performing is revising, recreating, reinterpreting history. Instead of romanticizing the past, this movement is taking shape as a critical multi-dimensional re-looking at the past, as a working method for making sense of collective political and artistic struggles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMallarika Sinha Roy\u00a0is an Assistant Professor\u00a0at the Centre for Women's Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.\n\n",

        "full_article": "After the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last week, Bangladesh was thrown into a critical state of instability and uncertainty. There was no government till Dr Muhammad Yunus took oath as the chief adviser of the interim government on August 8. During this period, the country saw an outburst of violence and crime, which was the outcome of both pent-up political frustration against the ruling party of 15 years and the result of some bigotry, and the machinations of bad actors trying to take advantage of the lawlessness for personal gains. One of the most dangerous situations that can happen in a country is the chaos, crime, and destruction that take place after an authoritarian force is forced to abdicate. Unfortunately, Bangladesh is in such a situation.\nHowever, this issue is not just a domestic phenomenon. Several influential groups inside Bangladesh's largest neighbour have taken the initiative to create a narrative that this momentary lawlessness caused by the thoughtless abdication of the former prime minister is the prelude of a Bangladesh where bigotry and religious fundamentalism are going to flare up.\nThe main platform where such notions are being sensationalised at the moment is X, formerly known as Twitter. Many verified accounts on X are reporting rumours as actual news and sometimes just outright propagating fake news. What's worse is that this propagation of fake news has also been noted in Indian mainstream media, as well as among popular Indian social media personalities.\nIt is true that there have been concerning reports of violence against minority communities. Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad reported 205 incidents of persecution of members of minority communities across 52 districts. Gobinda Pramanik, general secretary of Bangladesh National Hindu Mahajot, recently made a video statement about the matter, in which he said that, after Sheikh Hasina's resignation on August 5, the Hindu community in Bangladesh thought they would be attacked in a massive way and there would be incidents of arson. According to the general secretary, houses of some Hindu leaders of the Awami League who were very active, as well as those of some Muslim leaders, were attacked. He also stated that some opportunistic people attacked a few local temples. Coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement called for protection of the minority communities, which was answered by many. Leaders of BNP, Jamaat and other parties, too, instructed their functionaries to ensure that Hindu homes were not attacked and temples were protected.\nBut against this backdrop, we saw Republic TV from India spreading rumours and making strange claims.\nThe West Bengal Police, in a statement posted from its official Facebook page, stated that the way some local TV channels are reporting on the current situation in Bangladesh is clearly communally inflammatory and against the norms of the Press Council of India. The West Bengal Police urged viewers to exercise their own judgement when viewing this type of coverage and keep in mind that the authenticity of the footage shown by the channel is not verified by any neutral third party. They requested people not to fall into the trap of one-sided, hateful and misleading propaganda.\nThe sudden upsurge in misinformation and disinformation on Indian social media coincidentally aligns with a seemingly coordinated rise in criminal activities and vandalism all over Bangladesh. Inside the country, some people are also taking to social media and calling this another attempt by pro-AL forces in India, as well as RAW, to fabricate a narrative of communalism in order to plunge Bangladesh into further unrest and instability. Needless to say, there is no evidence for any of this. Rumours beget rumours. This kind of misinformation treadmill needs to be stopped immediately lest it leads to further instances of violence, and makes the people-to-people divide between Bangladesh and India even worse.\nAlthough it seems the Indian authorities have overtly asked for people to stop propagating fake news regarding what is happening in Bangladesh, there are many in India who firmly believe that Bangladesh is about to fall under a fundamentalist rule the moment the next general elections are held. It almost feels like, with the fall of Sheikh Hasina, some elements in India are behaving as though India has suffered a great loss. It is my humble opinion that, instead of immediately choosing to take the easily monetisable culture-war talking points, the enlightened Indian cultural leaders should first push for a democratic Bangladesh where actual political discourse can take place without fear of getting killed or disappeared by security forces. The people of Bangladesh don't need to be kept \"in check\" by a convenient autocrat. That is the narrative of a now-disgraced political party that has proven to lie repeatedly to the people and the world to keep power. The people of India must not fall for this narrative ever again.\nIndia must realise the shortcomings of its foreign policy regarding Bangladesh. These should be fundamental lessons from history. Never trust a dictator to keep power. A robust and mature democracy is the only reliable international partner. Right now, India needs to revamp its approach towards Bangladesh entirely. Now is the time for genuine track 2 diplomacy. It is time for genuine people-to-people relations to ensure long-term, sustainable friendship with its most significant geostrategic partner. And this kind of change must start at home.\nZillur Rahman\u00a0is the executive director of the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) and a television talk show host.

        "full_article": "In recent weeks, the streets of Dhaka have witnessed a remarkable sight: students, in the absence of police personnel, have taken it upon themselves to manage traffic, safeguard religious institutions, patrol residential areas, organise clean-up projects, and repaint city walls. These actions, born out of necessity and civic responsibility, underscore a profound truth: the youth of Bangladesh are leading the way in shaping a new, more engaged, and responsible society.\nThe involvement of students in these community service activities is not just a temporary intervention; it represents a potential turning point in how we understand and value youth participation in civic life. In many countries, community service is a compulsory component of high school education, and it is time for Bangladesh to consider a similar approach. Formalising these efforts as extracurricular activities (ECA) could offer students a structured way to contribute to society while gaining valuable skills and credentials.\nFor example, in Singapore, the Ministry of Education mandates the Community Involvement Programme, which requires students to engage in community service activities throughout their schooling years. Students participate in a variety of initiatives, such as helping the elderly, supporting underprivileged communities, and environmental conservation projects. In South Korea, high school students are encouraged to participate in volunteer work through the \"Service Learning\" programme, which integrates community service with academic learning. This approach ensures that students not only contribute to society but also reflect on their experiences and apply the skills they learn in the classroom to real-world situations. Japan also promotes community service through its educational system. Many schools have integrated volunteer activities into their curricula, encouraging students to participate in local community projects, such as organising festivals, supporting disaster relief efforts, or assisting in elderly care homes. These activities are tied to students' academic assessments, reinforcing the importance of civic engagement as an essential part of personal and academic growth.\nImplementing a similar mechanism in Bangladesh could yield numerous benefits. Students would gain additional ECA opportunities, enhancing their academic portfolios and job prospects while contributing meaningfully to society. Formalising these efforts would ensure that their contributions are recognised and valued. However, to ensure the success of such a program, it must be well-structured and closely monitored. Students should receive formal training for the tasks they undertake, whether it's traffic management, neighbourhood patrols, or environmental clean-ups. This training could be coordinated by government agencies, NGOs, or educational institutions, ensuring that students are well-prepared and informed. Once trained, students could continue participating part-time in these activities, or do a government service-based internship. This way, they would earn community service hour points, tracked and recorded by their schools and a central body, contributing to their ECA portfolios. This structured approach would provide students with a meaningful way to spend their time and create a sense of responsibility.\nIn our country, access to ECA and networks that provide valuable experience is not distributed equally. Students in urban areas have greater access to internships, volunteer opportunities, and extracurricular programmes that enhance their college applications, mostly to foreign universities, and job prospects. Meanwhile, students in rural areas or from less privileged backgrounds might struggle to find similar opportunities, despite being equally or even more motivated. This is where formalising community service can make a real difference. By establishing a system where all students can earn ECA points through structured volunteer work, overseen by government agencies, we level the playing field. Whether a student is organising a traffic management initiative in Dhaka or leading a tree-planting drive in a remote village, their efforts would be centrally recognised and rewarded.\nPerhaps the most significant impact of formalising student community service is the cultural shift it could inspire. By embedding community service into the education system, we are not just providing students with another box to tick\u2014we are fostering a culture of civic responsibility that will shape the future of Bangladesh. As more students engage in structured community service, the ripple effects will be felt throughout society. These young volunteers will carry the lessons they learn into adulthood, becoming leaders who prioritise social good. In the long run, this could lead to a more active, responsible, and compassionate citizenry.\nIt is a win-win situation: students gain valuable experience and credentials that can open doors to higher education and employment, while society benefits from their contributions. As more students take to the streets, we are seeing a clear signal: the youth of Bangladesh are ready and willing to serve. Now, it is time to give them the framework they need to turn this service into something that benefits them as much as it benefits the community. By providing them with the tools and opportunities to make a difference, we can empower the next generation to build a better, safer, and more inclusive Bangladesh.\nMaisha Islam Monamee is student of Institute of Business Administration at the University of Dhaka and a contributor at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Since early July, unrest and uncertainty have taken a heavy toll on the economy, causing severe disruptions to regular life and various sectors. Businesses have been struggling to maintain regular operations, with stakeholders across the economy, including traders, entrepreneurs, producers, and exporters incurring heavy losses. Many expected normalcy to return immediately following the massive student protest that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina regime on August 5 last. The overall situation, however, remains far from normal and insecurity is lingering in the air. Law and order has largely broken down, miscreants have resorted to vandalism, looting, intimidation, and violence in some places. Now that an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge and is working in co-operation with the Bangladesh Army to reopen police stations across the country, people are hopeful law and order will quickly improve.The economic repercussions of the prolonged unrest are profound. As in the case of most sectors, tourism sector is seriously affected. For over a month, the once-vibrant and booming tourism industry of Bangladesh has been paralysed in a state of fear and uncertainty. Reports of vandalism, attacks on innocent bystanders, and killings have driven away domestic and international tourists and dealt a severe blow to businesses that depend on the steady influx of visitors. According to the Tour Operators Association of Bangladesh (TOAB), the domestic tourism sector, which generates an annual turnover of approximately Tk 200 billion, is facing a severe downturn. The popular tourist destinations of Sunamganj Haor, Cox's Bazar, and Sylhet, which usually teem with visitors during the monsoon season, now stand eerily empty. The ripple effects are felt far and wide, from hotel operators to small businesses that rely on tourism for their livelihoods. Reportedly, many of the entrepreneurs in the tourism sector are struggling to stay afloat. Some have been forced to lay off staff, and in some cases, close their operations entirely.The tourism sector could take months, if not years, to fully recover from the impact of this unrest. Many nations have branded Bangladesh a risky destination and advised their citizens not to come here, or to be careful if they do. This could have long-term consequences that extend well beyond the immediate crisis. The authorities need to take immediate measures to repair the damaged done to the tourism sector, rebuild the image of Bangladesh as a safe, secular-friendly, welcoming destination as it once was, and invest in infrastructure to ensure the safety and comfort of travellers.The collapse of tourism is not just an isolated issue; it is a stark indicator of the broader economic instability gripping the country. When law and order break down, the first casualty is often the economy. Investors lose confidence, businesses retreat and the public's ability to engage in daily economic activities is severely compromised. The longer the state of uncertainty persists, the deeper get the economic wounds. So, the interim government must restore law and order and provide the security that citizens and businesses desperately crave for. Economic stability depends on a solid foundation of safety and trust and until that is regained, the country's economy will continue to bleed.",

        "full_article": "Students of Bangladesh during their 36-day movement launched between July 1 and August 5 last demonstrated a new kind of power. It was a veritable tsunami of political nature, though not driven by any politics, that brought down the government of Sheikh Hasina who ruled the country with an iron fist for over one and a half decades. Why and how an apparently innocuous demand for the reform of quota system in government jobs precipitated into one for the ouster of a government is history. This earth-shaking event has left many in a state of disbelief, while others would want to liken it to the Arab Spring of 2010s. But who were the drivers of this month-long succession of events that shook the world? Or was it the work of what Neil Howe and William Strauss in their 1991 book called 'Generations', referred to as Gen Z or zoomers who were born between 1995 an 2010? But many before July 2024 looked upon these children belonging to the Gen Z as worthless because they were seen hooked on the social media platforms most of the time of the day on their digital devices, particularly, smartphones. It was thought that they had no clue to what was happening around them. The older people in their 60s 70s and 80s, on the other hand, were very proud of their generations as they fought against dictatorial regimes during the Language Movement of 1952, the movement against Education Commission in 1962, the mass upsurge against the military dictator Ayub Khan in 1969 and, finally, in the Liberation War of 1971. The older generations believe that they were more in touch with the people of their time and courageous than the present 'lost generation'.But the five-week of shock and awe on the streets of capital and elsewhere in Bangladesh has shown who the real heroes are. These boys and girls fought and laid their lives without being motivated by any politics or ideology. They did not have any leader in the traditional sense of the term either. Even so, the movement they waged was not without direction, strategy or goal. In fact, the breakneck speed with which the movement evolved from an economic demand into one of a revolutionary political kind, calling for the resignation of an authoritarian government is unprecedented in history. There were mass protests led by opposition political parties before, many of those being bloody ones. But those were crushed by brute force. The difference between the purely student-led movement of the past weeks and the political party-led ones that preceded it was that the common people, though sympathetic to the latter's (party-led agitations') cause, did not join en masse their street struggles. But in the former's (student-led one) case, mass people considered the movement as their own and did not hesitate to fight beside the students who they thought were their own children. So, the common people thought noting of giving their lives for their children's cause. Here lay the source of the power that propelled the students' movement in question. And it added a new chapter to the history of student movement in this part of the world. So, what might be the implications of this watershed moment for the nation's future course of history? If anything, it has to be acknowledged that the Gen Z , i.e. zoomers or those in the making such as the Gen Alpha, who are still in their early and mid-teens, or those yet to come are people who we hardly know about, far less understand. They are indeed aliens, if only because of their understanding of the world emerging before them. The older generation has practically no inkling of it. The zoomers know that their parents and the generations they represent are quite clueless about them. But this apparent disconnect between the two generations have only gone to making their bonds stronger, not weaker. In fact, these zoomers are too pampered and sentimental to be treated dismissively by their elders in authority. Being called razakars (the anti-liberation collaborators of the occupation army of 1971) by the powers that be was the last straw that caused their normal 'quota reform movement' take an explosive turn. The suggestion might sound too simplistic to many who would like to look deeper into the social and economic factors as the motive force of the student-led upsurge. Of course, the movement had its dynamics rooted in disparities, discrimination and exploitation in society and economy. They are always there and political parties left no stone unturned to use those issues to mobilise the masses against the government. The government succeeded in striking fear in the minds of the political agitators that the regime's forces would open fire on the protesters without a second thought. The use of that psychology of fear did not simply work against these sentimental and pampered post-internet generation of boys and girls. They could not be frightened away by bullet and blood. Perhaps, only the warmth of love and the readiness to lend an ear of understanding to them would have melted their heart. Instead of doing that there was only show of force. But the protesters refused to be cowed into submission. So, the higher the death toll of their movement compatriots, the greater was their resolve to fight to the last. The power of the state had finally to bow down to the power of the street led by the zoomers.In sum, what the long-drawn anti-establishment movement needed was a spark. The derogatory word calling them razakar was the spark that started the prairie fire of the movement finally unseating the government.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The kitchen market has eased up a little to the relief of the consumers. Vegetables that were selling at Tk 80 -100 per kilogram a week ago ---in fact, for months ---are now priced Tk 10-40 less. However, the prices of rice, pulse, cooking oil, coarse flour and items that are imported have remained stable. The only exception is onion, the price of which has increased. There are two versions of what lies behind the current price fall of vegetables. One is the increased supply from farm level in different vegetable-growing areas. The other is monitoring of market by students. That the supply chain was severely disrupted due to the turmoil the country found itself in over the students' quota reform protest which later on turned into a non-cooperation movement. There was supply shortage and also a drastic squeeze in demand from the consumers. Thus the supply crunch did not lead to an abnormal price hike even during those heady days. Although the supply chain is yet to be fully restored because transport workers are apprehensive of dacoity on way to urban centres from the field level, vegetables have abundant supply in the market. Yet this does not wholly explain the current decrease in price of vegetables. Of the several duties students have volunteered to undertake, market monitoring is one. They visit markets in groups to assure traders of their full support in ending the extortion culture. Transport workers and traders are happy that they are no longer required to pay extortion money en route the commodities' destinations. Even a hawker selling fruits rejoiced over his non-payment of the Tk 500 he had to pay routinely to a lineman appointed by the law enforcement agency and local political lord. He explains why he can sell his wares a bit cheaper.This is a development for all to relish. The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP) has also appreciated the merit of students' positive intervention in the market. Quite rightly, it has expressed its willingness to work with students to establish an extortion-free market regime in the country. Both increased supply and monitoring by students have contributed to ease the market volatility to some extent. But it has brought to the fore a plain truth that the country's trade was vitiated by a nexus of law enforcement agency and social parasites. They used to collect illegal toll money at different points right from the source of the supply chain up to the destination.Thus by the time commodities reached retail shops, the price for procurement of the stuffs went up beyond the rational level. It was the consumers who had to bear the brunt. Now that students have shown the way, the good work must not be allowed to slip away. Building on it to give it an institutional shape is the task of the time. Reportedly, a new set-up of extortionists is trying to take over the empty field. Happily, students are quite aware of such ill manoeuvring and they have requested retailers to inform them who the new extortionists are. Students have started the process. Let it be carried to its logical culmination in order to bring sanity to the domestic market. It is quite possible to clean the Augean stables if there is collective vigilance against such illegal activities. No coteries of businesses or the parasites who have pocketed unearned money in the process will be given to enjoy a field day. The DNCRP should seize the initiative and extend the monitoring of the letters of credit and compare costing, taking into account the transportation expenditure, relative to the prices of imported commodities in the international market. This will leave no leeway to manipulate market and hike prices at will. Inflation can thus be contained to a large extent. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
