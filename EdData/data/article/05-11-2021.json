Every tournament should be a contest of the exceptional and the best sports person should win, and we would all celebrate their excellence. It is primarily meant for the players who, through a lifetime of passion and commitment, training and sacrifice at a personal level, would endeavour to fulfil his or her dream of being the best in their favourite sport. In the process, we see some awe-striking quality sporting events.\nBut as nationalism crept in, sport became weaponised to bring \"pride\" for the nation and the players themselves got swayed into it, as they enjoyed the national adulation that resulted from it. It reached its tragic peak during the superpower rivalry, which was a contest not only between two countries\u2014which is bad enough for sports as it is\u2014but was also one between two ideologies. At the height of the Cold War, in addition to Soviet Union's sporting victories, successes of Eastern European communist countries were all proclaimed as the success of the socialist system, along with its ideological and related regimentation.\nIdeological thrust may have gone, but sports as a part of nationalistic image building is alive and well and more powerful and, at the same time, harmful as it is fed by life-threatening doses of \"hate-steroid\" through the ever-expanding presence of social media. The \"public\" treatment of Indian bowler Mohammed\u00a0 Shami and Bangladeshi batsman Liton Das and the abuses they had to suffer for their performance is far beyond nationalism and ideology. Racism has been sport's old malaise. Now a new and a more insidious one has been added\u2014misinterpreted religion, whose hateful misuse, from which the Indian subcontinent has been suffering for decades if not centuries, has returned with all its perniciousness. It's so very sad for sports, for the fans, for the spectators, and devastating for the players.\nHowever, the malaise in sports and religion-based attack on our players\u2014very important topics on their own\u2014are not the focus of my column today. Bangladesh in T20 World Cup as a metaphor of our present-day politics is.\nInstead of strengthening our players' ability to win matches under any conditions, we tamper with the pitch. Instead of winning the voters' support through public service, we tamper with the election. Instead of telling the truth about the actual level(s) where our players really are, we create a false narrative by \"winning\" against Australia and New Zealand, and thus give a false sense of confidence to them which gets shattered the moment we face the rigours of the international standard. Instead of preparing our own parties to face the reality of public opinion, we stop the expression of public opinion itself, with intimidation, violence and unjust laws.\nEverybody knew\u2014at least the journalists did and they wrote about it ceaselessly\u2014about the folly of making our players go through the preparatory matches on low bouncing, spin supporting and generally slow pitches. This was in direct contrast to the hard-hitting fast pitches of the host countries where the World Cup is being played. Yet we opted for such a pitch only to be able to say that we defeated Australia and New Zealand. These results, the leaders of our cricket board thought, would give such a boost to the confidence of our players and would so strengthen their morale that we would have a sterling performance ahead of us.\nThe only problem was that it was based on falsehood. The results were contrived. The so-called well-planned preparation was actually a well-planned disaster. It brought us shame instead of pride, it destroyed whatever confidence the sports-mad and team-adulating Bangladeshi fans had in our team. Worst of all, it broke the very backbone of self-assuredness that a player needs to face his very first ball in front of a huge crowd and a far bigger TV audience.\nOur team's performance in the latest T20 World Cup makes for such a striking metaphor of our politics that no one but sycophants will miss it. For the last 30 years\u2014save two, though a large part of those two years were spent in preparation for the election of 2008, which brought the present ruling party in power with a thumping majority of its own\u2014we have been practising democracy. But what have we to show for it?\nOver the years our elections have gotten more and more contrived. They have shifted from the hand of the voters to those of election officials, the police, the intelligence bodies, the bureaucracy and local musclemen.\nThe Election Commission, such a prestigious body in most democracies\u2014Trump would triumph many times over under one like ours\u2014has made a laughing stock of itself. No amount of public disillusionment has had the slightest impact on our election authorities to prod them to inquire into the quality of the elections that they hold. Is election just some massive logistical undertaking? What about public faith in them? Shouldn't they have done some survey as to what voters think about their performance? If they have done any, we would be happy to know the outcome. The fact that election disputes take years to be resolved and sometimes even overshoots the tenure of disputed election never prompted them to reform.\nThere is nothing in our system called voters' education. This is something that the Election Commission should undertake throughout the year, teaching people about their rights and, not to forget, obligations in a democracy.\nRight now, local government elections are going on and what we see is the violence and the corruption. Have we heard anything about empowering the local government bodies, decentralising power from Dhaka, relaxing somewhat the strangulating bureaucratic hold over the local bodies? There has been virtually no devolution of power in the real sense. All the local bodies\u2014union parishad, upazila parishad, zilla parishad\u2014consist of elected people's representatives. But they all work under the supervision of the Local Government Division of the relevant ministry who have the power to fire them. A case of bureaucrats having the last say over elected people's representatives.\nA fundamental institution of democracy is the parliament. Ours have the dubious honour of not having debated any significant issue facing the country. If the Covid pandemic and climate disaster couldn't have been considered by our parliament as worthy of special sessions or even just debates, then what would move their hearts and minds is a question far beyond my ability to answer.\nSimilarly, in our T20 World Cup preparation we fix our pitch so that outside teams cannot play, train our bowlers to suit the pitch and win matches and declare we are ready for the world, and lose the very first match against a team whom we should have beaten. Did the team play badly? Yes, but they were a disabled team to start with\u2014disabled by those who forced them into wrong preparation, false hope and a make-believe journey that was never there.\nSo also in our democratic journey, we hold elections in which the deeper truth than what the results reveal is known to all. Because the truth is also known to those who wear the garlands of \"victory\", they lack the confidence to speak the truth, and because they don't speak the truth,\u00a0 a make-believe world of victory and self-righteousness is created which leads to more make-belief and greater self-righteousness, and so the cycle of mischief continues to spin in its downward spiral.\nI am told that all teams tamper a bit with the home pitches. So, what if we over did it? Well, we know what happens when we do so. Will the lessons from cricket have any good influence on our politics? In cricket there are international matches that tell us that we are on the wrong path. In politics, the only self-correcting mechanism is the elections. If we have done away with it in everything but name, then that correction prospect is non-existent for us.\n\u00a0\nMahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In case you have not noticed, climate is not the only manifestation that has changed drastically over the last decade. People have too.\nThere is flood in Scotland, but there is hope in Sudan\nBBC reported on October 29, \"Days of heavy downpours have brought significant flooding problems across the south and west of Scotland. Travel has been disrupted, bridges washed away and people evacuated from their homes.\" Unthinkable even a few years ago.\nFollowing a military coup on October 25, thousands of Sudanese began spontaneous demonstrations against the armed forces, and in support of the ousted civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet. Protesters carried Sudanese flags and chanted, \"Military rule can't be praised\", and \"This country is ours, and our government is civilian\", as they marched across Khartoum (Reuters). Unthinkable a couple of decades ago. Sadly, there have been high civilian casualties, the regular price for democracy that we too had to pay for 24 years.\nThere is wildfire across Greece, but there is guarded optimism in Afghanistan\nHeatwaves of unprecedented longevity, and wildfires across the summer have destroyed more than 1,000 km2 of ancient pine forests in Greece. They have blackened swathes of Attica near Athens, scorched parts of ancient Olympia and obliterated north Evia's magnificent forests (The Guardian, August 29). Human suffering includes loss of livelihoods. Inconceivable, say 15 years ago.\nIt all happened so quickly in Afghanistan. Donald Trump signed the Doha accord with the Taliban in February 2020, ensuring complete withdrawal of US troops by May 2021, but the fall of Kabul happened under Joe Biden's call on August 15, 2021. Considering their hard-line Sharia administration during 1996-2001, the 2021 Afghan protests against the Taliban started almost immediately. Led by Islamic democrats and feminists, people feared misogynistic attitude of the Taliban, more perhaps than the Taliban's fearsome paramilitary power. The dare was evident on the streets across Afghanistan. Inconceivable 20 ago.\nTyphoons are lashing the US coast, but there is Spring in Myanmar\nRepeated Atlantic hurricanes have been unrelenting, causing havoc on the east and southern coasts of the United States. Atlantic waters have become warmer in the last few years, bringing to land about 50 named storms, unusual in the region. Ominously it is predicted that the situation is very much likely to worsen with hurricanes becoming a common and regular phenomenon. Unimaginable in times gone by.\nMeanwhile, in neighbouring Myanmar, protests, locally known as the Spring Revolution, began in early 2021 in opposition to the February coup, staged by the commander-in-chief of the country's powerful armed forces. Although leaderless, the spontaneous demonstrations, strikes, and civil disobedience, powered by online activism have brought the country to a standstill. More than 700 civilians have been killed since the military takeover (National Public Radio, USA, May 5). However, unlike many times before, people are not taking it lying down. Unimaginable with the army in control.\nClimate is raising havoc Down Under, but there are loud voices in Hong Kong\nContinuous warming, increasing number of bushfires, prolonged droughts, frequent cyclones, heatwaves and floods, rising sea levels, impaired biodiversity, ravaged coral reefs, unprecedented damage to properties and infrastructure, and threatened public health among disadvantaged communities are among the greater climate concerns of Australia (Energy Matters, October 3). This was beyond imagination only a few years back.\nIt is more or less common knowledge that China has a \"one-country, two systems\" policy regarding its Special Administrative Regions. And yet, the proposed extradition legislation stirred up massive Hong Kong protests in 2019-2020. Steered mainly by students, also on the agenda of the protesters were demands for democratic reform, and the fear of losing their extraordinary autonomy. Marches and rallies turned violent, leading to three deaths, and three thousand injuries. There were over 10,000 arrests and 2,500 prosecutions, which go to show the extent of public rile, sprit and involvement. This was beyond imagination only the other day.\nIn this millennium, democratisation of information technology, extensive use of social networks, swapping of knowledge, broad civil awareness, and intrinsic yearning for freedom have given voice to oppressed people in the most unlikely areas. People have in recent movements snatched courage from thin air to vent their anger in search or in defence of democracy. Despite unusual intimidation, brutal oppression and point-blank target practice, there is an innate longing to showcase human dignity and mettle, a thirst for liberty and the rule of law.\nPeople are on the streets again, metaphorically with flowers, in the spirit of the 1960s. Sixty years ago, \"flower power\" represented non-violence and harmony, blooming from \"the passive, peaceful resistance movement of the time, which was rooted in the opposition against the Vietnam War\".\nAll of a sudden there is collective realisation, sporadically all over the world, that many voices are not easily shut downable; perhaps never in the long run. That a few lives can be sacrificed for a larger gain. Whose? It does not matter, for they are all for one, and one for all.\n\u00a0\nNizamuddin Ahmed is professor of Architecture, a practising architect at BashaBari Ltd., a Commonwealth Scholar and Fellow, a Baden-Powell Fellow and a Woodbadger Scout Leader, and a Major Donor Rotarian.\n",

        "full_article": "We are the biggest applauders of our own successes. Sometimes, regional and international arenas, too, portray our positive growth through development indicators. When many countries found themselves in dire straits because of Covid-19, Bangladesh's economic indicators remained somewhat consistent. Bangladesh is a \"role model\" for development\u2014this is a common phrase now.\nOn some indexes, Bangladesh is ahead of even India\u2014and this is often highlighted in many discussions nowadays. There is no doubt that Bangladesh has some big, notable achievements under its belt. For instance, no matter how debatable the per capita income index may be, there is no denying the fact that Bangladesh is in a better position than India. India is a huge country, where certain areas are home to extreme poverty. So the question remains whether it is justified to draw comparisons between the two neighbouring countries. But that is not what I want to discuss here\u2014I firmly believe what the indexes indicate.\nBangladesh's success in exporting RMG products and human resources, its contribution to peacekeeping in several countries, and success in food production are, indeed, a matter of pride. So it is expected that those in power would claim credit for these feats. And they deserve it.\nKeeping all this in mind, I would like to share my two cents on the \"role model of development.\"\nThere are many examples in world history where a poor nation has changed its fate through development. We don't have to look very far: some of these examples exist nearby.\nThe development process through which Lee Kuan Yew turned the fishermen's village of Singapore of 1965 to the highly-developed country it is today, or how Mahathir Mohamad changed the Malaysia of 1980s to what it is now, hardly needs any elaboration. Japan's development after World War II, since 1945, and South Korea's rise after the Korean War of 1950 are success stories that have taken the world by surprise. Thailand is no different either.\nIn order to rebuild and develop, all these countries focused on one thing: developing their human resources. They established strong state institutions, using which they reached the height of success they enjoy today. And to achieve all of this, the first initiative that they took was educating all their citizens. At first, they brought in foreign experts with high salaries for a certain period of time to help with nation-building. In the meantime, they sent their young students to Europe and North America for higher education. Once those students returned home, equipped with modern knowledge, these countries no longer needed to hire foreign experts.\u00a0\nAfter World War II, Europe and the US put more focus on air links. Japan, one of the Axis powers, was barred from making aircraft. But Japan did not sit idle, and instead focused their research on making fast trains. Only 10 years after the great war, Japan managed to invent high-speed trains in 1955, solely through their home-grown experts. They took USD 80 million as a loan from the World Bank to facilitate this project.\nDuring the Summer Olympics in 1964, which was held in Tokyo, Japan stunned the entire world by inaugurating their bullet train service.\nFor Japan, as well as all developed countries, education was the prerequisite to development. They put the highest possible priority to education and research in their development policies.\nNow the most critical question arises: How much importance has Bangladesh, which is hailed as the role model for development, put in its education sector? Let's not look into what Europe and North America, or Asian nations like Japan and Korea do. Compared to its South Asian neighbours, Bangladesh has the lowest allocation for its education sector. It is generally said that countries with less than four percent of budget allocation for education cannot succeed. Bangladesh's budgetary allocation for education is about two percent.\nWe don't follow the policy of sending our brilliant students abroad and have them gain expertise through higher education. Those who do that using their own means, seldom think of coming back. But then, the government has no attention to spare to create an environment where those who want to return home are given the due respect, good work environment, and the opportunities to implement their knowledge and expertise. Nepal is ahead of Bangladesh in terms of the number of students going to the US for higher education. No Bangladeshi university has managed to take a respectable spot in any of the international rankings, but we can find the names of Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepali universities on those lists.\nThe CEOWORLD magazine published a list of best educational systems in 2020, where India was ranked 33rd, Sri Lanka 77th, and Pakistan 83rd. Even Myanmar ranked in the 92nd place. Bangladesh was not even on the list.\nA recently published news story, published by The Daily Star, revealed that graduates of Dhaka University, who achieved first class in Sanskrit, could not speak or read Sanskrit. And they had applied to teach at the Department of Sanskrit in their alma mater. Speaking to this daily, Dr Madhabi Rani Chanda, a professor at the Department of Sanskrit, said: \"There is no scope for denying the fact that the educational standards in this university are declining day by day. Most of the students score good marks by memorising the answers.\"\nIt's not just the Department of Sanskrit; this situation is alarmingly prevalent everywhere in Bangladesh.\nThe pathetic condition of Bangladesh's education sector has been repeatedly exposed in many relevant international researches over the last few years.\nBangladesh is ranked 116th among 132 countries in the Global Innovation Index. The Global Talent Competitiveness Index sees Bangladesh in 123rd position among 134 countries. In the Global Knowledge Index, Bangladesh is ranked 112th among 138 countries.\nIn all three of these indexes, Bangladesh trails behind India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.\nWe claim to have become \"Digital Bangladesh,\" but our internet and mobile data speed is the slowest among all South Asian nations.\nUsing this ultra-slow internet, I tried to find if there are other countries where two rival student organisations, or two factions of a single organisation, frequently engage in violent clashes using an arsenal of weapons, often leading to bloody and sometimes fatal outcomes. From Uganda to Nepal, I couldn't find a single example of such a phenomenon. Uganda has a history of student uprisings against dictatorship. Similar accounts of movements can be found in the histories of Nepal and India as well. But I have yet to find an example that even vaguely resembles the incident of two rival wings of the same organisation beating each other up, which resulted in one student ending up on life support, his doctors forced to remove a part of his skull to help his healing process. On the bandage around his head, these words were written: Haar nei, chap diben na (No bone here, do not apply pressure).\nIn our \"role model\" development philosophy, education and research have zero importance. What is important is building roads, bridges, flyovers, and buildings. There is no denying the fact that infrastructural development is a staple for overall progress. But we have forgotten that infrastructure provides support for achieving development goals\u2014they are not the markers of development themselves. For sustainable development, we need skilled, tech-savvy human resources, and to achieve that, there is no alternative to proper education and research. Importing expertise from abroad can be a temporary measure, but it can't be a permanent solution. We have built bridges and satellites using foreign expertise. The technology remains unknown to us. The knowledge that we need to train skilled manpower is still beyond our grasp.\n\u00a0\nGolam Mortoza is a journalist at The Daily Star. The article has been translated from Bangla.\n",

        "full_article": "Town planning is both a science and an art of designing and developing urban areas. The job of town planners is to make a city both aesthetically attractive and optimally functional. A planned city can attract private investment and ensure a higher rate of employment and growth. However, a well-thought-out plan requires a multi-disciplinary approach and contributions from a variety of experts, including urban and regional planners, architects, civil engineers, environmentalists, geographers, transport engineers, hydrologists, surveyors, economists, water and sanitation engineers, and even agriculturists. Again, an effective plan needs thorough research to understand the trends of city growth, surrounding environment, transportation network, urban management system, and financing mechanism. The planning has to be a participatory process, so it should take inputs from the landowners, businessmen, public officials, local government representatives, working people, politicians, and professionals.\nJust like planning an urban area is vital, its proper implementation is also critical in achieving the desired space for its residents to enjoy living there. However, both the planning and implementation processes could go wrong\u2014and that's what is happening in Bangladesh. There has been plenty of criticism for our failure in formulating good town plans and ending up with poor physical environments. If we look back, we can see that our master planning methods and processes have not been appropriate, and as a result failed to produce the desired outcomes.\nIt is important to note that out of several hundred cities and towns of various sizes in the country, only the four largest ones have undergone full-scale master planning exercises followed by their implementations: Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, and Khulna. The master plans of many other cities have been prepared in recent years, but their use is still very limited. A master plan lays out the uses of the land\u2014such as housing, offices, businesses, industries, administrative areas, schools, hospitals, roads and streets, open spaces, etc\u2014keeping the future projected development pattern of a city in mind.\nPlanning is an essential prerequisite for the orderly development of a city. A set of planning standards are followed in formulating a master plan. In Bangladesh, the town planning processes have been unnecessarily long. The physical feature surveys and preparation for detailed land-use plans take an inordinate amount of time to complete and get approved by the government. After the first master plans of Dhaka and Chattogram cities were prepared in 1959, followed by the Khulna city master plan in 1961, the decision to develop the second set of plans came after a long time\u2014in the early 1990s. The Rajshahi city master plan, which was prepared in 1968 and then updated in 1984 and again 20 years later, in 2004, were somewhat better implemented due to the cooperation between the Rajshahi City Corporation and the Rajshahi Development Authority.\nThe first master plan of Dhaka city (1958-1978) was implemented to some extent, establishing several housings, businesses and industrial zones like Tejgaon industrial estate, but the successive plans failed to keep pace with the fast population growth, and the demand for serviced land far exceeded the supply. Higher population density in the core areas of the city produced conditions unfavourable to rebuilding and renovation, and unfortunately, failure to come up with a good plan since 1978 caused a great setback for the city's proper growth. Even the current Dhaka Structure Plan (2016-2035) has not considered the issues of water-logging and traffic congestion properly.\nInterestingly, the town plans have a long-term span of 20 years without having medium-term plans corresponding to the national five-year plans. During this long period of time, the urban scenario changes, and the plans become obsolete. The plans are static and, although Section 74 (2) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 allows to amend the plans when required, there is no mechanism to constantly review and update them based on the realities on the ground.\nWhile the problems of urban living are dynamic in nature, the urban planning concept adopted by the city development authorities has been static, which is not appropriate to tackle the everyday challenges of our cities. The most critical challenge posed by the master plans is related to the forecasted population of the cities and their infrastructural needs. The actual population growth far outpaced the projected growth of the cities and upset the development proposals in the master plans. Although this was discussed among the planning professionals and policymakers during the 1980s, the subsequent plans did not become dynamic in approach and failed to address the ever-widening challenges posed by rapid urbanisation.\nAgain, not many consultations were held with the key stakeholders during the planning process, so the master plans turned out to be a top-down exercise. The master plans were also not followed up with development and investment plans. Adequate public control over future development has not been built into the plans, and thus private interests ultimately dictated the horizontal and vertical growth of the cities. This ultimately caused a significant deviation from the plans, but most of it went undetected because of the lack of an effective monitoring mechanism. One major reason for this is also the non-involvement of the private sector in the planning process and securing their buy-in for development of an aesthetically attractive city when the state's control in managing the urban space declines.\nThe town plans also don't accommodate the needs of people of all social strata, particularly the poor. Consequently, a large number of poor families live in slums in terrible conditions. These people and many lower middle-income families mainly live in the outskirts of the cities. Due to linear development of the cities, rather than a multi-modal mixed pattern of development, they require long-distance travels on a daily basis to the inner city for the purpose of work, causing tremendous traffic congestions.\nThere is also the issue of ignorance regarding the master plan on the people's part. The city residents don't have much idea about the designated residential areas, reserved open spaces, and land proposed for acquisition for creation of industrial zones, parks, schools, hospitals, offices, etc. Until recently, there was no online and standard building plan application system to make the process easy and quick. Now that it has been introduced, we need to wait and see if the online system works.\nThe resources estimated in the plans are found to be unrealistic\u2014the actual outlays far exceed the suggested cost of infrastructure and services. One of the fallouts of this weakness in the plan is delay in implementation of major roads and infrastructure, and even housing projects, such as Purbachal and Uttara residential areas in Dhaka.\nThe town plans need to be formulated on time, be realistic, take care of critical urban issues, and be updated as per requirement. The plans must be adhered to and funded adequately.\n\u00a0\nDr Nawshad Ahmed is an economist and urban planner, and a former UN official.\n",

        "full_article": "A study recently conducted by the Anti-Terrorism Unit (ATU) of police has revealed some eye-opening findings related to militancy, including the fact that economic hardships are pushing people down the path of radicalism. By analysing the data collected from 1,217 militants, arrested in connection with militancy and terrorism between 2001 and 2020 in three metropolitan cities and eight divisions, the ATU has found that poor socioeconomic status and religious bigotry have dragged these people\u2014mostly aged between 31 and 40 years\u2014into militancy.\nAccording to the study, eight out of every 10 militants arrested in the last two decades came from poor socioeconomic backgrounds and from the country's northern districts. The ATU has also looked into the militant outfits' recruitment strategy and found that the extremist groups recruit a significant number of their operatives by \"misinterpreting religion\" and using online platforms.\nThat people from low-income backgrounds would be easy targets of militant outfits should not come as a shock. That is why the study found a large population from our northern region to be involved in militancy, as they are lagging behind economically compared to the rest of the country. While the study has identified the presence of many madrasas in some areas of the northern region to be a reason for the growth of extremism, it has also found that 80 percent of militants are from mainstream education backgrounds. That means that we need to broaden our perspective while talking about fighting terrorism and militancy, rather than identifying and focusing on any specific group. Blind faith or religious bigotry is, no doubt, closely related to education\u2014or lack thereof. And that needs to be dealt with through special attention to what is being taught at our education institutions and at home. We also need to understand the fact that many people are joining these outfits to earn a living after being influenced by people who are misinterpreting religion, as stated in the report.\nThe research by the ATU is certainly helpful in understanding and tackling militancy in the country. So, to root out this menace, more comprehensive research should be carried out on a continuing basis. While the ATU has made some recommendations to tackle militancy, such as keeping a constant watch on the activities of militants hiding abroad and those who have gone into hiding after securing bail from courts, enhancing cyber intelligence, etc\u2014all of which are important\u2014the government should also focus on reducing poverty and making education accessible to everyone to effectively fight militancy. Meanwhile, strengthening counter-radicalisation and de-radicalisation activities, ensuring assistance and security of militants trying to get back to normal life, and rehabilitation programmes are all equally important as well.\n",

        "full_article": "At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has pointed out that effective action plans to address climate change are not possible without adequate, sustained, and flexible climate finance, and we fully agree with her. This is what experts\u2014along with leaders of vulnerable and developing countries\u2014have been saying for nearly a decade. The rich countries agreed to begin providing USD 100 billion per year from 2020 to address the needs of developing countries, at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit. While, according to experts, even that amount is insufficient compared to the finance needed to adequately address climate change, many saw that as a good start. Unfortunately, the rich countries have so far failed to make good on that promise.\nAccording to the UN's \"Emissions Gap Report 2019,\" USD 1.6-3.8 trillion is needed annually between 2020-2050 to avoid global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. That the rich countries have been unwilling to provide the miniscule amount they promised in comparison to that, does not instil much confidence in their willingness to act upon their promises in regards to addressing climate change. Yet, the reality is that these rich countries are the biggest carbon emitters in the world\u2014and have been for decades. Developing and climate vulnerable countries have mostly been the sufferers of that, as their carbon footprint is much smaller in comparison. Therefore, it is only fair\u2014as even the rich countries have admitted\u2014for them to provide the developing and vulnerable countries with some of the funds that they require to take action to both address climate change, as well as mitigate for the resulting losses. Why, then, have the rich countries failed to do what they agreed to do, for over a decade? The answer can only be a lack of sincerity to the suffering of developing countries and/or a lack of concern for the urgency with which this issue must be addressed.\nAt this year's climate summit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is not only representing Bangladesh, but 48 most vulnerable developing countries, who are members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF). As such, her blunt statement urging the rich countries to keep their promise is surely commendable. The CVF has already demanded for the rich countries to provide USD 500 billion between 2020 and 2024, and we hope that this fund can be secured\u2014as grants, not through other ambiguous channels as we have seen climate funds being delivered before\u2014during negotiations at the summit.\nWithout the necessary finance, plans to address climate change cannot be put in motion. In the absence of effective action, we fear that the entire planet will be in great danger, as experts have warned. Therefore, we hope that the world leaders\u2014particularly those representing developed countries\u2014will take cognisance of this reality, and instead of repeating empty rhetoric, they will take meaningful actions, including in the form of providing the finance required for developing countries and the world to address climate change.\u00a0\n",
