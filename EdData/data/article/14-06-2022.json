Forty-one seats had single candidates who were elected unopposed from 11 States, while contests for 16 in four States \u2014 Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan \u2014 were eventful, and accompanied by charges of horse-trading, sabotage, and misuse of power by incumbents at the Centre and State. The BJP\u2019s continued emphasis on backward classes and weaker sections was evident in its selection of candidates \u2014 reflected in at least half of the 22 new members the party brings into the Rajya Sabha. Three Muslim BJP MPs who have their terms ending in July were not renominated, and the ruling party will not have a single Parliament member from the community now. The Congress, on the other hand, continued to be tone deaf to the clamour for increased representation by weaker sections \u2014 eight of its 10 candidates were from dominant communities. The party pointedly lost the first opportunity to demonstrate that its Udaipur declaration that promised reforms in the party such as the \u2018one family, one person\u2019 principle in allotting tickets was indeed a serious effort.The BJP\u2019s manoeuvring capacity yielded good results in Maharashtra and Haryana but in Rajasthan, it had to eat humble pie, losing an MLA to the Congress camp. In Karnataka, the elections saw the Congress distancing itself from the JD(S), trying to emerge as the singular opposition to the ruling BJP ahead of the Assembly election next year. The new situation makes the possibility of an alliance distant, if not impossible. The BJP\u2019s show of strength in Maharashtra has upset the calculations of the ruling tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), and threatens its government. In 2019, the strength of the MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress along with a few independents and smaller parties, stood at 169, comfortably above the halfway mark of 145. Two-and-half-years later, the BJP secured 123 votes in the Rajya Sabha elections, while the MVA\u2019s tally came down to 161 votes. Two NCP MLAs were in jail and could not vote, one Sena vote was declared invalid; one Sena MLA had died a month ago. Though the MVA government faces no immediate danger, the shift of at least 10 votes to the BJP has brought it closer to the majority mark amid murmurs of discontent within the three parties. Fresh talk of welcoming \u2018disgruntled\u2019 and \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 MLAs could well be possible in the coming days. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel have reinforced their positions within the Congress amid demands for their exit. In Haryana, the loss of one winnable seat due to internal feuding shows the inability of the Congress high command to enforce discipline.",

        "full_article": "By speaking out last week on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), two top American officials have sent a clear message that Washington views the on-going India-China border tensions as part of the broader geopolitical contest underway in the region. On a visit to New Delhi, General Charles A. Flynn, Commander of the U.S. Army Pacific, described the level of Chinese activity in Eastern Ladakh as \u201ceye-opening\u201d and questioned its intentions. Then, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, the region\u2019s most high-profile security event, U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd J. Austin said Beijing was continuing to \u201charden its position\u201d along the border. He drew a connection between China\u2019s fishing activities in the East China Sea, the placing of advanced weaponry on man-made islands in the South China Sea, and its LAC actions as part of a \u201ccoercive and aggressive approach\u201d to territorial claims. He underlined that the Biden administration saw the Indo-Pacific as its \u201cpriority theatre of operations\u201d and at the \u201cheart of American grand strategy\u201d. The LAC comment predictably led to China\u2019s Foreign Ministry accusing the U.S. of \u201cadding fuel to the fire\u201d.June 15, 2022, will mark the second anniversary of the violent Galwan Valley clash, which also marked the lowest point in bilateral relations in many decades. Leaving aside the curious detail that American officials have recently had more to say publicly than their Indian counterparts about the as-yet-unresolved crisis, there appears to be little prospect of an imminent resolution after two years and 15 rounds of talks. At the Shangri-La Dialogue, to which New Delhi puzzlingly did not send high-level political representation, the Chinese Defence Minister, Gen. Wei Fenghe, alleged it was India that \u201csent people to the Chinese side of the territory\u201d. He did add that both sides were working on maintaining good relations, but with India and China continuing to fortify forward areas, a full de-escalation remains increasingly unlikely. By highlighting the border, the U.S. appears to be making its case to the region that its allies and partners need to band together to restrain China\u2019s behaviour. New Delhi, for its part, will likely face ever greater expectations to take a stand on China\u2019s actions, beyond the bilateral domain. India, so far, is the only one among the four Quad countries to refrain from taking public positions on issues such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. Beijing, meanwhile, is pointing to the U.S. and the Quad as destabilising forces, viewing the Quad as a nascent \u201cAsian NATO\u201d, a label that its members reject. New Delhi might like to say it has already chosen its side in this geopolitical tussle \u2014 that is, its own. But the reality is that countries are likely to face increasingly hard choices as they navigate an intensifying rivalry between the world\u2019s two biggest powers.",

        "full_article": "The Election Commission of Bangladesh has been mired in controversies over the last decade. Bar a few rare instances, the elections held at the national and local levels since the 2009 general election have been questionable at best. From allegations of rigging and voter fraud to instances of violence and murder in the vicinity of polling centres \u2013 every election has been marred by one or multiple such incidents. Consequently, the people of the country have lost their trust in the electoral system, which is an ominous sign for a democratic process. And for this situation, the last two election commissions, led by Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad and KM Nurul Huda, are largely to blame.\nSo when the process of appointing the new election commission started at the end of last year, many political parties did not show any interest. BNP and some other political parties did not even join the dialogues leading to the formation of the new election commission. Although the new commission was formed through a new law in February, it is yet to gain the trust and confidence of a good number of opposition parties, including the BNP.\nThere was a time when only the major political parties used to publicly express their distrust of the electoral system and the election commission. But at the time the present Election Commission was formed, it became clear how far the crisis of confidence had reached, because the response from the general public was lacklustre and rather unenthusiastic.\nIt is in this context that the new commission adopted a submissive tone since its formation. Soon after the formal announcement, I spoke to the newly appointed chief election commissioner (CEC), Kazi Habibul Awal, over the phone. He said, \"If I can hold acceptable [to all] elections, maybe I will have the joy of success, or else I will have regret.\"\nStill, we remain optimistic as the CEC has said they will try their best to hold a participatory election. He also said it was not possible for the commission alone to ensure a good election. In this case, all political parties and law enforcement agencies would also have to do their part \u2013 so would the civil society and the media.\nThere are several challenges before the Habibul Awal-led commission. First, the opposition parties need to be reassured enough so that they participate in the elections. Second, the commission should present a roadmap for overcoming the shortcomings of the last elections to the nation. Third, it should make it clear to everyone that they would not be susceptible to external interference while performing their duties \u2013 and be prepared to resign en masse if they are unable to do so. Overcoming these challenges are key to making the upcoming general election beyond reproach.\nThis is also where our disappointment lies. So far, the Election Commission seems to have hardly done anything to address these challenges. Although they have not yet confirmed whether the next general election will be held with electronic voting machines (EVMs), it appears that the commission is favouring the idea, despite the fact that most political parties in the country are against using EVMs in elections. Such a stance is only contributing to further distancing the Election Commission from the political opposition.\nIn May, at a function in Madaripur, Election Commissioner Anisur Rahman said the political parties were welcome to use their own IT experts to examine how EVMs work. He also said the CEC would give a USD 10 million reward to anyone who could find faults with the EVMs. The CEC quickly refuted his fellow commissioner's claim, pointing out that he could not make such bizarre comments.\nWhile the debate over using EVMs in elections continues, former CEC KM Nurul Huda, who is dubbed by detractors as the \"organiser of vote by night,\" said recently that elections under the ruling party were sensitive and challenging. He said it was not possible for the Election Commission alone to hold a free and fair election without the cooperation of all the political parties, the administration and other stakeholders. Asked if the election would be acceptable if BNP did not take part in it, the former CEC said BNP was a big political party, so it would not be acceptable if the next parliamentary election was held without it.\nThe irony of that statement could not be more obvious. Here was the election chief who had overseen the most questionable election in the country's recent history that left little doubt about irregularities among almost everyone who followed it. It could well be said that it was his failure to hold free and fair elections that led the BNP to become sceptical about joining the electoral process, lest they lose face again.\nNurul Huda's former colleague, former election commissioner Mahbub Talukdar, later brought some of the incidents from that time to light. But the former election chief remained undeterred.\nFree and fair elections are part and parcel of a democracy. Failure of the previous two election commissions to ensure it has deeply hurt our democratic process, with the general people turning apathetic towards the electoral process and major political players losing faith in it. In order to bounce back from this situation, the Election Commission needs to build trust among both the people of the country and the political parties. And then they must work towards delivering a free, fair and participatory election that is above question and acceptable to everyone. But the new Election Commission seems to be walking the old path of its predecessors, and needs to change course if it wants to be credible.\n\u00a0\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is deputy chief reporter at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "It has been quite clear in various segments of society in Bangladesh that the solution to the Rohingya crisis is becoming a distant dream. The attitude of the West and donors is gradually gravitating towards blame instead of appreciation as Bangladesh is criticised for shifting the Rohingyas to Bhasan Char as well as for not allowing proper education, skill development, lack of human rights and employment opportunities. The donors are pressuring Bangladesh to have long-term planning and budget for the Rohingyas. There are loose comments about the option of integrating Rohingyas into Bangladeshi society. Apart from this, a recent China-mediated repatriation initiative of situating 700-800 Rohingyas (few members from a family) at different places in Myanmar is an uncomfortable proposition.\nThis initiative includes about 300 Hindu Rohingyas (possibly the last of the community in the camp, and as a whole family package). Meanwhile 40,000-60,000 Rohingyas who fled to India during the genocide are also slowly entering Bangladesh \u2013 perhaps they are being pushed back, meaning India, the regional heavyweight, is also getting rid of the Rohingyas. So, finally, it all boils down to Bangladesh. The other regional power that is trying to mediate the recent repatriation initiative would favour Myanmar's interest. As a student of social studies, I understand Myanmar's interest would get preference over Bangladesh, because Myanmar is a strategic partner of China, whereas Bangladesh is a development partner. Meanwhile, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, the impending food shortage and fuel politics, the budget for Rohingyas will shrink, and there are indications of this already on the horizon. All these factors are making Bangladesh anxious from a feeling of \"being left alone,\" despite its generous humanitarian approach towards the Rohingyas during their most difficult days.\nMy understanding is that Rohingyas are not returning to Myanmar anytime soon \u2013 not at least the way Bangladesh wants. Interestingly, negotiation from a position of weakness seldom brings the desired result. Both Bangladesh and the Rohingyas are bargaining from a position of disadvantage compared to Myanmar. So what are the alternatives?\nLet me share a story. In 2018, at the UN General Assembly session in New York, I was nominated to attend a sideline event organised by the International Labour Organization (ILO). It was on indigenous peoples' rights. There were seven speakers, of whom six were officials of the ILO and other agencies of the United Nations. The only speaker who was not from the UN, but representing the indigenous people of the world, was a Chakma gentleman from Bangladesh. The point I am trying to make here is that the scope for education, exposure and empowerment allows vulnerable communities to have their voices heard in international forums.\nThe Rohingya issue is becoming a struggle for Bangladesh, and the Rohingyas' plight must not lose its sensitivity, tempo, impetus or strength. Rohingyas should be intellectually, politically and economically empowered to speak for themselves and they should be assisted to create a position of advantage in international political, intellectual and human rights spaces. This approach is likely to create more anxiety regarding their repatriation among some strategic communities in the country. In spite of that, Bangladesh may consider the reality and allow international-level education, skill and leadership development for the Rohingyas to develop their own narrative and tell their own stories to the world. A developed human resource is better for everyone. On the contrary, a traumatised young population without proper education, hopes and dreams is a ticking \"insecurity time bomb.\"\nAs the US has recognised the crackdown on the Rohingyas as genocide, this situation may be pursued to help marginal Rohingya families to migrate abroad, and settle there and pursue education. This diaspora, in two decades, will turn into a major advocacy tool. However, Bangladesh has to keep this issue alive and on the table, bringing the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), regional organisations, the egalitarian world community and the UN on board.\nIt would be too much of an expectation on Myanmar's part that Bangladesh would let \"Myanmar's battle\" take place on Bangladesh's soil. They should find political solutions for the political issues they have created themselves, instead of securitising them and unnecessarily blaming its neighbours (It is on record that Bangladesh offered joint and coordinated patrolling along the border. This is a gesture that is one of a kind in this neighbourhood. Myanmar has not been very enthusiastic about this). It should, moreover, not be forgotten that even \"strategic patience\" has a shelf life.\n\u00a0\nLt Gen Mohammad Mahfuzur Rahman, PhD, is a retired officer of\u00a0Bangladesh Army.\n",

        "full_article": "In 2022, the rising cost of consumer items is an existential threat in every country. However, each country will have to be creative and find a combination of instruments that best suits its own needs. Prof Jason Furman of Harvard University, the former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers in 2013-17, wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal, \"Leo Tolstoy's observation that 'all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way' applies to the multidecade-high inflation being experienced by countries around the world. The headline inflation numbers are increasingly similar\u2026 but the causes, consequences and treatment remain quite different.\" (June 8, 2022)\nIn my last op-ed in this column, I posed a rhetorical question: How do you control inflation in a market economy? If anyone knew the answer to this challenge, they would receive the Nobel Prize in economics and/or peace. If there were a prophet who could identify the source of each inflation and offer a practical solution, many countries would embrace this person's gospel leading to peace on this Earth. Starting from Joe Biden of the US to Gotabaya Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka, many of today's world leaders would see the end of domestic unrest and the restoration of peace and tranquillity in their respective countries.\nBesides price control, the measures that have attracted a lot of attention are moral suasion and jawboning. Moral suasion is an alternative to price ceilings imposed by the government. Central banks have influenced the rate of interest charged by banks through moral suasion for ages.\u00a0Jawboning in economics and politics is the use of authority to persuade various entities to act in certain ways, which is sometimes underpinned by the implicit threat of future\u00a0government action. Our ministers are known to frequently brandish stricter legal action against anyone involved in manipulating and inflating rice prices.\nHow does jawboning work in practice? Let us take the case of high gasoline prices. If the government seeks to hold the lid on prices at the pump, or the price of rice in the kitchen market, it needs to have good data on the monthly supply and demand situation in addition to the cost structure of these products. If you set the price of rice below the equilibrium, there will be an artificial shortage in the market created by wholesalers who might have paid the syndicates more than the maximum price allowed by the government. The black market price will skyrocket and lead to hunger and suffering for the masses.\nLet us take the case of petroleum. In Bangladesh, the price at the pump depends heavily on the cost of crude oil in the international market. I do not have the statistics for Bangladesh, but numbers by the US Energy Information Administration indicate that the share of crude oil, refining costs, distribution and marketing, and taxes make up 58.7, 17.5, 12.1, and 11.7 percent, respectively, of the price of a gallon. If the goal is to lower the price of gasoline at the petrol pump, we need accurate information on the cost of import, refining and distribution, as well as tax. In many countries, tax on petrol is 20 percent. If the government can release any fuel in reserve or lower the tax rate, there will be a temporary relief. However, petrol pumps must be jawboned to pass on the lower costs to the consumers.\nIn the current round of global inflation, official figures show\u00a0that nearly 80 percent inflation occur in three sectors: transport (mostly oil, plus second-hand vehicles); food (especially wheat and cooking oil); and housing (rising construction costs and rents). An average Bangladeshi family's food budget is reliant on the following consumer items: rice (coarse), wheat, masoor dal, moong dal, potato, sugar, mustard oil, soybean oil, onion, ginger, garlic, and some meat.\nFor the next few months, Bangladesh can use a mix of timely imports, supply management; temporary tax relief, cuts in tariffs and taxes, increase in the allocation for subsidies, widening the scope and coverage of the social safety net programmes, public procurement, and distribution programmes to offer the middle- and lower-middle-income groups a temporary respite. In addition, it can take steps to discourage import of some luxury goods and lessen demand for demerit goods, make some goods cheaper (e.g. to make sure housing is affordable), and stabilise prices (e.g. prevent rapid fluctuations in the prices of food).\nVarious market monitoring teams that have been formed under the food ministry need to gather price updates from major wholesale rice markets in Dhaka every day, along with comparing these prices. For some time, there has been considerable focus on the role of syndicates. However, there is inadequate data to indicate at which level of the supply chain these oligopolies exert the control that creates temporary shortages and price spikes. There are a few dozen trading houses in Bangladesh who have the capability to import in bulk (edible oil, sugar, wheat, pulses) and the financial capacity to hold on to the stocks in order to influence prices.\nSo, what is the moral of the story? In a letter to a political ally in 1900, Theodore Roosevelt coined the phrase, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.\" The corollary was that, without a big stick and preparedness to use it, one would go nowhere, insofar as price control is concerned.\n\u00a0\nDr Abdullah Shibli is\u00a0an economist and\u00a0works for Change Healthcare, Inc, an information technology company.

We have destroyed most of our natural forests, followed by the deliberate pollution of vital resources like water and air. With the vanishing forests, many beautiful species of birds and animals have also vanished, and many surviving species of sweet-water fish may soon be gone too as water pollution continues across the country. As for air pollution, we've managed to hit all the wrong indicators to become a country with arguably the worst air quality.\nBrick kilns \u2013 there are still many of them \u2013 are a major reason why we have a huge presence of micro-pollutants in the air. This daily has been regularly publishing reports on the assault of brick kilns on nature, highlighting the fact that most of them still burn wood as fuel which contributes to the release of lethal carbon-monoxide in the air.\nIn this respect, another dismal story was published on Monday. It shows how toxic smoke from brick kilns is damaging Boro paddy on nearly 100 acres of land in Mirzapur upazila, Tangail. The fume is damaging vegetables and other forms of vegetation growing adjacent to the paddy fields. It is disconcerting to learn that the brick kilns start their operation before the onset of the Boro paddy cultivation season in most areas. We have often come across graphic reports in print and electronic media of half-ripe paddy turning black and lifeless on the fields, causing huge financial losses to the farmers.\nThough some brick kiln owners reportedly complied with the government directive to keep the height of the chimney at 130 feet, in reality, many owners hardly follow the rules. As a result, toxic emissions continue to damage the Boro paddy before the harvest time. The local administration and political representatives seldom admit responsibility for this situation or do what's necessary to make these unruly elements conduct their business in a responsible manner.\nThe story from Tangail is but a reflection of what's happening all over the country with brick kilns spewing toxic smoke in the air. Besides damaging important cash crops and vegetation, it also causes health problems by entering the respiratory system of humans. If there is any record of the number of people who die each year from air pollution, it would be frightening. The government, therefore, must take urgent steps to undo this damage and save our environment by punishing non-compliant brick field owners.\n",

If anything, its initial days in office have been more reflective of the old, bureaucratic ways of doing things than a genuine intent to build public trust with courage, determination and foresight. This is also evident from how it is approaching problems in the run-up to the June 15 Cumilla City Cooperation (CCC) election \u2013 its first major hurdle to overcome. The fact that the CEC has refused to exert his authority after a lawmaker reportedly flouted an official directive shows that the EC has a lot to do to effect change, nowhere more so than within itself.\nSuch helpless surrender, saying \"we cannot do anything\", is a throwback to the tendency of his predecessor who notoriously refused to take responsibility for any electoral irregularity at all. And this, we must say, is unbecoming of a commission tasked with damage control. It came with the promise of restoring confidence in the electoral system after two highly controversial general elections. No one expects it to deliver miracles. But executing the right policies and standing firm in the face of opposition, particularly from the ruling quarters, is part of the job. It means finding ways around non-compliant parties as well as legal and institutional bottlenecks to prepare the ground for fair and participatory elections.\nThe EC's ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders involved should give it pause for thought. There are ideas galore, but ideas alone don't work without a strong motivation. During its sixth round of talks held on Sunday, former election commissioners shared some observations that are worth consideration, such as the importance of inclusive elections and the decisive role that the ruling party can play in creating a conducive environment. They talked about the importance of a neutral election-time government. One stressed the need for completing counting of votes in daytime to avoid the influence of \"jinns and ghosts\" after sunset. There was even a suggestion for placing the public administration and home ministries under the authority of the EC during polls to ensure the neutrality of these vital institutions.\nThe CEC also weighed in by reminding everyone that the EC alone cannot hold credible elections \u2013 that \"voters and political parties are vital stakeholders\" too. True, but where is the initiative to gain the trust of voters and opposition parties? What message do they get when the CEC refuses to take action to ensure that the rules apply to everyone during election campaigns? We urge the EC to own up to its part of the responsibility to hold fair elections. We also urge the government to ensure that it has full, unconditional support in fulfilling that responsibility.\n",

        "full_article": "Bulldozers are posing a challenge to constitutional rights. But our higher courts are not responding. It\u2019s as if they are in a daze. Or, perhaps we should say, in a \u2018bull-daze\u2019 \u2013 a state of systemic passivity when confronted with governments\u2019 unconstitutional use of force. With more house demolitions, in UP and MP, and Gujarat, Assam, Tripura and Delhi civic authorities already in the bulldozer club, violations of basic rights are widespread. But the wheels of justice are moving far slower than the tracks of bulldozers. MP high court issued notices in April following demolitions after Khargone riots \u2013 so far, nothing has happened. The Supreme Court\u2019s next hearing after staying the April 20 demolitions in Delhi\u2019s Jahangirpuri is listed for August. Courts must show much more urgency. HCs and SC can even take suo motu notice because courts\u2019 core duty of determining guilt and punishment, premised on due process, is at stake.\nA chance to correct this comes via the petition filed in Allahabad HC on Monday against the Prayagraj house demolition. The petition noted that the house was owned by the wife of the person accused of organising \u2018violent demonstrations\u2019. This brings into stark focus one of the worst aspects of bulldozer action. Not only is guilt being determined outside courts, punishment is being meted out to the family of the accused. The concept of collective punishment was popular in Middle Ages, and even codified in law. To state the obvious, it has no place in constitutional democracies. Yet, over the last couple of years, and particularly over the last few weeks, bulldozers ordered by state officials are posing a dangerous question to the rule of law.\nIt falls to higher courts to create a judicial barrier to bulldozer \u2018justice\u2019. It\u2019s unlikely that any CM or municipal authority would defy judges. When courts make strong interventions, even recalcitrant systems correct themselves. A fine recent example is SC\u2019s directions on the Lakhimpur Kheri probe. The justice system, for all its limitations, still works as a protector of citizens\u2019 rights. It cannot remain \u2018bull-dazed\u2019.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.  \n\n\n\n\nEND OF ARTICLE\n\n\n\nOpinions \nNupur, Naveen & us \u2013 Please note: Aggressive right-wing politics can also cost those who benefit from it most\n  \nHindu-Muslim: Facts vs fear: Logic, data belie scaremongering on minorities.

        "full_article": "June marks an inflection point in the current trajectory of Covid infections. Daily new infections began to trend upwards and recorded 8,084 on Sunday. A month ago it was about 25% of this number. The upward trajectory in infection needs to be put in perspective. When adjusted by population level, India\u2019s situation is relatively better. Current confirmed cases are about 5 per million people. In contrast, it\u2019s around 1,031 and 532 per million in Australia and Germany, respectively. However, there are other reasons why it\u2019s important for India to be on its guard.\nAbout 65% of India\u2019s population has finished double dose vaccination. Australia and Germany, among others, have a higher vaccination coverage ratio. While vaccination limits the severity of disease, it does not prevent infection. Therefore, it\u2019s important for GoI and state governments to double down on public messaging about Covid protocols. Concurrently, there\u2019s a need for a renewed push on vaccination. The booster offtake is just 39 million doses, far lower than what could have been achieved. States appear to have relegated vaccination in their list of priorities.\nAround 138 million vaccines with states are lying unutilised. The challenge now is not supply but a general slackening. It\u2019s unwise because India has used a rapid rollout of vaccination as an effective strategy to normalise, as compared to China\u2019s self-defeating \u2018zero Covid\u2019 approach. We are at a critical economic juncture. The next step is to ensure there\u2019s no Covid-related disruption again.\nTrials overseas and a study by CMC, Vellore, have shown that using a different vaccine for the booster, a heterologous dose, results in enhanced protection. Corbevax, a protein subunit vaccine, is halfway through the regulatory process of getting used as a booster. There should be no bureaucratic delay here. Covid may appear to have receded to an endemic stage but there\u2019s no case to ease up. We need another national sero survey to gauge the situation and also provide data for public health responses. Also, keep in mind that \u201clong Covid\u201d can be debilitating.

This follows on the FY23 Budget speech highlighting the challenges of scaling up battery-charging infrastructure in urban areas and flagging the urgent imperative to define battery swapping and interoperability standards to improve the efficiency of India\u2019s EV ecosystem.\nHave clean mobility solutions reached centre stage?\nNow open for public comments, the policy could not have come at a more opportune moment. First, because major auto manufacturers now converge on the view that electric vehicles shall be the mainstay of future mobility in India. A report by the India Energy Storage Alliance projects that the Indian EV and EV battery markets shall grow at a CAGR of 36% and 30%, respectively, in the next four years. Niti Aayog pegs EV sales penetration in India at 80% for two-wheelers (2W) and three-wheelers (3W), 70% for commercial cars, 40% for buses, and 30% for private cars, by 2030.\nRead full opinion on TOI+\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.  \n\n\n\n\nEND OF ARTICLE\n\n\n\nOpinions \nNupur, Naveen & us \u2013 Please note: Aggressive right-wing politics can also cost those who benefit from it most\n  \nHindu-Muslim: Facts vs fear: Logic, data belie scaremongering on minorities.
