What makes it noteworthy is the dizzying speed of ascent. It\u2019s taken less than four months to jump from the 70,000 mark it crossed in mid-Dec. Go farther back to April 2020 when we were in the middle of the first nationwide lockdown because of the Covid outbreak. Sensex had then dropped to about 27,591.

        "full_article": "It\u2019s not the first time a CJI has attempted to fix a major reason that contributes to case pendency. The practice of reserving judgments for months beyond stipulated periods, where judges put off announcing their decisions, long after hearings are over. This delay is entirely on the judge.\nPassing the buck | Yet, Chandrachud\u2019s initiative, of seeking details from all HCs of cases awaiting verdicts for over 3 months, had an unforeseen fallout. CJI said several judges had hurriedly released cases for \u2018fresh hearings\u2019. This meant the entire process must start from scratch \u2013 a massive setback, and not just financially \u2013for those who move court. Judges are burdening litigants, to simply avoid their inefficiency getting marked. CJI called it a \u201cwaste of judicial time, damaging for principles of judicial efficacy and speedy justice\u201d. As if the egregious practice of inordinate delays wasn\u2019t bad enough, judges, trying to dodge CJI\u2019s initiative, were being deceitful at the workplace. Not for nothing are questions raised on judicial probity.\n\nTimeframes encoded | CrPC says judgments must be given either \u201cimmediately after termination of trial\u201d or \u201cat some subsequent time\u201d for criminal cases. SC, in 2001, interpreted CrPC\u2019s \u201cat some subsequent time\u201d as a maximum of six weeks and no more, no matter the case.\nDetailed guidelines were issued, including maintaining a register of dates of when a judgment was reserved, and when a verdict was finally pronounced. SC sought HC chief justices should review monthly lists of such cases, and nudge benches involved. Rules also exist to send cases to a fresh bench in the event of inordinate delay \u2013 a rule judges exploit. India\u2019s new criminal code BNSS that replaces CrPC later this year, provides a timeline for judges to pronounce verdicts \u2013 \u201c\u2026shall give its verdict within a period of thirty days (extendable up to 45 days)\u2026\u201d\nAre HCs listening? | Arriving at a judgment is an intense exercise. Far too many are so shoddily written that they are but a garble of words. CJI repeatedly urges judges to write simply. Too often even the reasoning for decisions is missing from verdicts. At the very least litigants should understand weightage a judge gave arguments, how and why he/she arrived at decisions. But when verdicts are so delayed, as Chandrachud said, \u201cquality of judgments is sacrificed\u2026 oralarguments no longer remain fresh in the judicial mind.\u201d Yes, CJIs earlier too have called out delays, but rarely has one pointed out how judges were bending the rules. Will it have any impact?\n\n",

        "full_article": "The horror genre is about our fear of the unknown. But many times, a switch gets flipped, and we see in it a profound mirror to reality. Stephen King\u2019s Carrie belongs very much in this latter category. This debut novel of the \u2018king of horror\u2019 has just turned 50. Within two years of publication, its iconic status was sealed by Brian De Palma\u2019s fantastic filmic adaptation. Sissy Spacek played its scary telekinetic monster. But a switch has indeed been flipped. It is not young Carrie or her climactic, explosive rage that today\u2019s literary tributes are finding truly monstrous.\nInstead, the ultimate horror is the continual cruelty that drives Carrie to explode. In particular, it is the bloody sadism of her high school peers that makes the novel feel more relevant than ever today. Because from east to west, poshest schools to poor ones, bullying has become an increasingly serious issue. Of course, it existed back when Carrie was written. King himself went to school with someone who was relentlessly mocked as Dodo or Doodoo. He remembers seeing her smile fade, the light in her eyes first dim and then go out. Even the gentle worlds of RK Narayan and Ruskin Bond are not without their bullies. But as the educational ecosystem has grown more stressful, vicious bullying has grown more common. Plus in a cyber-psyched world, the bullies follow the child home from the school hallways.\n\nIn the novel, Carrie\u2019s explosion builds \u201cwith all the steadiness of a chain reaction approaching critical mass\u201d. In the psychological exploration of the novel, this is the one practical takeaway. Schools have to properly intervene when children bully each other. Not look the other way. Not just pay lip service. Not be \u2018neutral\u2019. But step in deep, and help.\n\n",
