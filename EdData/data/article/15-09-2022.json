With the latest withdrawal of troops from Patrolling Point (PP) 15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, buffer zones have now been established by the two sides in five locations, including in Galwan Valley, north and south of Pangong Lake, and at PP17A in Gogra. The arrangements in the four earlier established buffer zones have so far helped keep the peace over the past two years. No patrolling is to be undertaken by either side in the buffer zones, which have been established on territory claimed by both India and China. The latest disengagement came just three days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Uzbekistan.Reflecting the current state of relations, the two leaders have not directly spoken in more than two-and-a-half-years, an extraordinary situation for the world\u2019s two most populous countries. Whether they meet at the SCO Summit \u2014 as of September 14, neither side had confirmed or ruled out a meeting \u2014 or at the G20 in Indonesia later this year, India will need to proceed with caution as it inevitably resumes high-level engagement with China. While the buffer zones may serve as a temporary measure to prevent a recurrence of clashes, the reality is that this is an arrangement that has been forced on India. The Indian military, by holding the line and showing its capacity to match China\u2019s deployments, has been able to reverse China\u2019s multiple territorial ingresses of April 2020 in the five areas. That has, however, come at the cost of India\u2019s ability to access patrolling points that it was reaching previously, which, in the view of some military observers, might have been China\u2019s game-plan all along, given the favourable logistics and terrain on the Chinese side that enable faster deployments. Moreover, China has neither agreed to resolve stand-offs in Demchok and Depsang, suggesting they pre-dated the current tensions, nor shown any intent to de-escalate, instead continuing to build forward infrastructure aimed at permanently housing a large number of troops closer to the LAC. Indeed, signs are that both sides are in for a prolonged period of uncertainty on the borders thanks to China\u2019s decision to mobilise tens of thousands of troops in April 2020, in contravention of past border agreements. Unless Beijing reverses its recent, and still unexplained, moves to militarise the LAC and in the process undo the carefully constructed arrangements that helped keep the peace for 40 years, India will have little incentive to consider a return to relations as they were prior to 2020. The latest disengagement, while certainly a welcome step, by no means implies an end to the crisis on the border.",

        "full_article": "The latest retail inflation data from the National Statistical Office is a sobering reminder that accelerating price gains still remain the single biggest challenge to policymakers as they try to steer Asia\u2019s third-largest economy to a more durable recovery from the pandemic-induced slump. Inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) quickened in August to a provisional 7%, from 6.7% in July, as the pace of gains in food prices as measured by the Consumer Food Price Index accelerated by a sizeable 93 basis points to 7.62%, from July\u2019s 6.69%. And rural consumers bore a disproportionately higher burden: with month-on-month changes in both food prices and overall inflation appreciably greater at 0.88% and 0.57% respectively, compared with the 0.50% and 0.46% rates of urban inflation. Of particular concern is that inflation in the prices of cereals \u2014 staple grains in every household \u2014 surged to 9.57% from the preceding month\u2019s 6.9% rate. Month-on-month the pace was a disconcerting 2.4%. With kharif sowing of rice this year undershooting last year\u2019s acreage and uneven distribution of rainfall further roiling the crop\u2019s production picture, the outlook for inflation in this \u2018heavyweight\u2019 food category remains far from reassuring, the Centre\u2019s recent imposition of tariff and other curbs on export of non-Basmati rice notwithstanding. In fact, eight of the 12 food items that combine to constitute the food and beverages category of the CPI saw sequential price upticks, with vegetables (13.2% year-on-year and 2.5% month-on-month) and dairy (6.39% and 0.9%, respectively) being two other vital foods that contributed to the faster inflation.The Finance Ministry was quick to assert that the increase in headline inflation was \u201cmoderate\u201d, even as it sought to downplay the significance of food price pressures by terming food and fuel prices as \u201ctransient components\u201d. It also pointed to the steps by the Government to cool prices, that could help tame inflation in the \u2018coming weeks\u2019. And it cited oils and fats and pulses as two items where prices had begun to ease in response to the Centre\u2019s steps. However, the prices of pulses and products quickened by 1.7% month-on-month, with the pace trailing only that of sequential inflation in spices, cereals and vegetables. Services categories including housing, health, education, recreation and personal care too witnessed sequential increases in price gains as these services saw demand gradually revive. The challenge going forward would be for providers to tread carefully so as not to yet again depress consumption by raising prices too quickly. Policymakers would do well to heed the dictum of a former RBI Governor, who never tired of reiterating that \u2018containing the build up of price pressures is the best anti-poverty programme\u2019 as the poor \u2018have no hedge against inflation\u2019.",

        "full_article": "After Maharashtra lost the Rs 1.54 lakh crore Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor project to Gujarat, Mumbai has seen high-decibel political fights between the opposition and the government. But this is good politics. It\u2019s the kind of politics that puts pressure on state governments to court private investment aggressively. Even better politics will be jobs, investment and standards of living becoming regular top-of-the-list issues that parties debate and voters pay attention to. Politics around competing promises of freebies, on which the PM\u2019s comments started a national debate, is the worst kind because if freebies dominate policy thinking in the present, the future will inevitably be bleak.\nThe good news is that despite freebie politics, some states are vying for big-ticket foreign investment, and doing so by hard-selling their human capital resources, road and digital connectivity and multimodal infrastructure. Even economically backward UP has joined the battle, betting on improved road connectivity. And the point to note is that Maharashtra didn\u2019t lose the Vedanta-Foxconn project because it didn\u2019t offer incentives. It lost because Gujarat did better. Most states have electronics and manufacturing policies offering standard incentives like power and water tariff concessions, exemption from stamp duty and property tax, capital subsidies etc. So, and this is a good thing, states have to constantly up their game to attract projects. Indeed, the narrowing of the gap between Maharashtra and states like Gujarat and Karnataka tells the story of how competition works.\nHowever, a bigger problem for India as a whole is diversification. Services, computer software/hardware and telecom have dominated new projects. New investment is needed in manufacturing, especially light manufacturing. FM Sitharaman has asked industry to be more positive about manufacturing investment. But states have to play their part, too. UP, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Bengal and MP have the potential to attract manufacturing investment but are yet to crack the industrialisation puzzle. Andhra consistently tops ease of doing business rankings but this isn\u2019t reflected in investments. There\u2019s a massive skew in investment destinations. Nearly 87% of FDI inflows go to just five states. One lesson comes from Tamil Nadu, where the industrial policy is stable irrespective of who\u2019s in office. The other lesson is that land acquisition must be sorted out by some states \u2013 that\u2019s, for example, the difference between Gujarat and Bengal.

The world today is being increasingly divided by the strategic security competition between US-led G7 and the China-Russia compact. Caught in the middle are a large number of developing nations who are being forced to choose sides despite this not being in their best interests. It is against this backdrop that G20 aims to serve as a vital platform to voice concerns of the Global South.\nTrue, challenges before the forum are many. From climate change and reforming global finance to tackling the current energy and food crises, the G20 agenda under India\u2019s presidency is expected to be full. This will give New Delhi the perfect opportunity to showcase its leadership skills. That Bangladesh is on the guest list along with UAE and Oman for the leaders\u2019 summit highlights India\u2019s regional prioritisation. But a dispute is already brewing over Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s expected attendance at the Bali leaders\u2019 summit this November. Some Western leaders want to exclude Russia from G20 until the war in Ukraine abates. The Indian presidency will inherit this problem. Remember, though, that kicking Russia out of G8 not only failed to deter Moscow vis-\u00e0-vis Ukraine but also pushed it closer to China. Therefore, India must make it clear that isolating Russia is not the answer.\nMeanwhile, on substantive matters, the Indian presidency should ensure that the G20-OECD pact on a 15% minimum global tax rate for large corporations should stick to the 2023 delivery schedule. MNCs\u2019 tax avoidance via using multiple geographies can only be tackled by multilateral, coordinated action. Getting this tax going will be a test of G20\u2019s efficacy.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is needless to mention that Covid-19 has made a significant dent in the labour market of Bangladesh, with loss of income and employment for many. With the recovery from the pandemic being more or less satisfactory, the pace of recovery has not been even, as relatively small-scale industries and informal services are said to be still in the process of recovery.\nGiven that as much as 85 percent of our labour force are engaged in informal employment, the task of recovery requires specific policy incentives from the government to stimulate the economy and revive the labour market. However, in order to contain the recent soaring inflation and to stabilise the macroeconomy, the government is adopting different measures to cut down aggregate demand. While confronted with the dual challenge of economic recovery and containment of inflation, for obvious reasons, stabilising price to a reasonable level becomes a priority for policymakers. Monetary and fiscal measures taken by the authorities in this context can turn out to be contractionary in reality and therefore might not assist in labour augmenting.\nWhile the economy is in the process of recovery, the recent Russia-Ukraine war has posed further challenges to the local labour market. Besides, with the appreciation of the dollar and a large balance of payments deficit, there are concerns regarding the macro stability of the economy as well. One of the negative consequences of global unrest and post-Covid recovery is increased energy prices worldwide. Although it has declined globally in recent months, the Bangladesh government recently announced higher prices of different types of fuels to compensate for the losses resulting from energy subsidies due to previous heightened prices. This has been argued to have further aggravated the soaring inflation of essential commodities in recent months and has raised the cost of production for industries.\nAll of these can have negative implications for labour expansion. With a static private investment-GDP ratio, slow pace of industrialisation can delay the recovery process of the labour market. Besides, we must keep in mind that it is not just about large-scale industrialisation. Higher prices of different products and services can lead to contraction in demand, which can eventually have negative consequences on the demand for labour.\nWhile dealing with local level challenges, we must also keep in mind that there is valid concern of a global recession. For countries like Bangladesh, which is strongly linked with the global economy through remittance earnings and export of RMG, this can have negative implications for the demand structure of export-oriented industries and eventually can lead to a fall in demand for the labourers engaged in those industries. In order to safeguard workers with limited earnings, employers can also arrange to provide essential food items at subsidised prices to their employees. The government needs to incentivise the private sector to support their workers. Even small initiatives like providing special ration cards for employees, supplying free mid-day meals, arranging transportation for the workers, etc might be helpful in the short term to accommodate the stress of inflation at the micro level.\nGiven the multi-faced challenges of post-Covid recovery, macro stability and global economic unrest, policy focus should not be diverted away from the core policy goal of employment generation and labour market recovery. Though the global economic environment or the local policy directives are not indicative of an optimistic scenario for large scale industrialisation and employment generation, in the medium term, the government can consider carefully re-designing fiscal incentives for large industries while making them conditional on protecting the rights of the workers.\nIn addition, there can be policy directions against labour retrenchment and even for short-term unemployment benefits. As for the latter, a joint contribution from the government and employers can be considered as part of social safety net programmes.\nGiven the soaring inflation, it is also crucial to adjust the minimum wages at a regular interval. At the same time, it is essential to expand the coverage of the sectors for which minimum wage is applicable. Though this task of bringing the workers within the purview of minimum wage is quite challenging, it can be initiated by constructing a digital database of workers.\nWhile dealing with these recent concerns, we must not forget about the inherent long-term challenges of the Bangladeshi labour market. On the supply side, as much as 44 percent of the labour force are engaged in low-skilled occupations (elementary occupation and skilled agriculture/forestry/fishery) and 48 percent have medium-skilled jobs (clerical support work, services and sales work, craft and related trade, plant and machine operators/assemblers). But only around nine percent can be considered to be engaged in high-skilled occupations (managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals). One root cause of such unemployment is the inability of the workforce to translate their skills to the labour market, which is caused by a discrepancy in the demand and supply side of said skills.\nWe must also keep in mind that, though Bangladesh is growing through a demographic transition, this window of demographic opportunity will come to an end by around 2038. So, it is worth noting that, in terms of the \"quality'' of our youth population, around 8.79 percent of youths within the age range of 15 to 29 years possess no formal education and only 5.9 percent have obtained tertiary education, as per the Labour Force Survey 2016-17.\nIn order to deal with increased automation of industries and 4IR related technologies, policy focus must be directed towards upskilling and re-scaling of the existing labour force and introducing the new entrants in the labour market with advanced skills training suitable for the growing demand at both local and global levels.\nTo absorb our youths into the labour market, greater emphasis needs to be put on modernising and effectively functionalising TVET programmes. Another challenging area in the case of the labour market is low female labour force participation (at 36.3 percent), which demands greater focus on education and training, and to deal with gender-centric norms that prevent women from engaging in the labour market. In this regard, the policy focus must be directed towards removing gender discrimination at every sphere and in ensuring gender-sensitive strategies in the workplace.\nDr Sayema Haque Bidisha\u00a0is a professor at the Department of Economics of Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Disney, a brand built on happiness and light fare, makes films that are loved by parents, children, and everyone in between. However, the polished happy endings of many of their classic films are a long way off from the original fairy tales that inspired them.\nDanish author Hans Christian Andersen originally conceived The Little Mermaid in 1837, in which the mermaid is described as having \"skin as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf, and eyes as blue as the deepest sea\".\nIn Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), the protagonist, Ariel, is introduced as a beautiful, adventurous, smart, and kind teen with an amazing gift\u2014her voice. Not only is she perfectly slender, naturally curious and socially superlative among the creatures of the sea, she is the king's daughter\u2014a princess with social stature. Although the film is beloved, I have always felt uncomfortable with its central message.\u00a0\nAs we find out, Ariel desires to become a human being. She consistently questions her environment, her body, and her happiness, envying folks on the land, until she gets what she wants: a man.\u00a0\nTo achieve her dreams, she makes a deal with the sea witch Ursula, giving up her special voice to be part of a society that would not normally accept her in her true form.\nThe handsome and confident Prince Eric falls in love with Ariel, who has never spoken a word in his presence. The moral of the story lies here: change who you are\u2014not simply to be loved, but also to be accepted by others. Additionally, it portrays men as physically judgmental, only caring about the way women look, and not considering their thoughts or feelings.\u00a0\nI am in favour of Ariel evolving from a girl to a woman and discovering her identity, but I don't feel comfortable when influential characters suddenly cast away their unique and admirable qualities for acceptance.\u00a0\nThe bargain between the nameless mermaid and sea witch in Andersen's\u00a0version is more costly: the mermaid has her tongue cut off, and every human step she takes is as painful as standing on knives. She also never gets the prince because he marries someone else.\nShe strikes another deal with the sea witch to kill the prince, but she can't carry it out\u2014so she commits suicide instead. Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds for mankind for 300 years, and will one day rise up into heaven.\u00a0\nIn the Disney film, Ariel has to go through no great lengths to gain the love and acceptance of the prince, unlike Andersen's mermaid.\nThe author presents the more realistic message: despite how great of a sacrifice or outward change is made, we can never fundamentally change the essence of who we are, and can never find true acceptance and happiness in the altered form.\u00a0\nIn contrast, the movie portrays a more censored moral: we are able to achieve true happiness and acceptance by undergoing extreme change for the ones we love. Through minor sacrifice and patience, eventually, we will gain the love and respect of those we changed for.\nWhile Andersen's moral seems more negative and darker than the film's, the truth and realism behind it make it a much more thoughtful message.\u00a0\nIn 2023, Disney will have another go at The Little Mermaid, with a live-action remake starring African-American actress and singer Halle Bailey as Ariel and British actor Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric.\u00a0\nDisney's sanitised animated version, with its focus on a beautiful princess and a happy ending, removes much of the complexity and most of the unsettling elements of Andersen's\u00a0tale. There are gory details from the original story that young children are too vulnerable to be exposed to, but the notion that we should shield children from dark fairytales is hypocritical. The honest way would be to tell them violence does occur. The world is filled with struggle and conflict. We have yet to see if 2023's The Little Mermaid will explore the dark origins of the story, but if it does, it is sure to set itself apart in the growing list of Disney's self-adaptations.\nFurthermore, Disney has made us comfortable with fairytales being about how things \"look\", rather than respecting their nuances.\u00a0\nWhen Ariel first splashed into movie theatres over 30 years ago, she had a distinctive look. Enormous blue eyes dominated a porcelain-skinned face framed by bright red hair. Her only article of clothing was a purple bikini top made of seashells, and instead of legs, she sported a light green fish tail.\nFor decades, Disney only considered white characters as worthy of inclusion in their stories. It was not until the 90s that they began to introduce non-white protagonists, including Pocahontas, Mulan, Jasmine in Aladdin (1992), and Esmeralda in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). And it was not until 2009 that Disney introduced a Black princess to the canon, with Tiana in The Princess and the Frog.\u00a0\nOn September 10, 2022, we got our first teaser of Halle Bailey's Ariel, adorned with her mermaid's tail, purple bikini top, and ginger dreadlocks. We also heard her sing some of the character's signature song, Part of Your World, and got a glimpse of the underwater kingdom that Ariel so longs to escape. For most, it was a joy. Bailey\u2014one half of the singing sister duo Chloe x Halle\u2014looked radiant as the wistful mermaid, while her sweet vocals introduced a fresh take on the character. But unfortunately, the teaser also resulted in a revival of the racist remarks that cropped up when Bailey was first cast.\u00a0\nTied to the idea that the live-action version of Ariel should reflect her original appearance, naysayers declared that Bailey was #NotMyAriel. Many claimed that her casting was an example of \"woke\" culture gone amok.\u00a0\nThe outrage is profoundly unreasonable. I cannot stress this emphatically enough, mermaids don't actually exist. They are the product of Andersen's\u00a0dark imagination, and we need to open up to creativity in reinterpretations of stories about mythical characters.\u00a0\nThroughout history, white people have been overwhelmingly represented in every pillar of popular culture. From television to film to broadcasting, no racial demographic has ever been more catered to than white people. Thanks to 2023's The Little Mermaid, Black and brown girls can finally see themselves as princesses in a film where the protagonist's skin colour is not as instrumental to the story as the princesses' heritage was in Aladdin, Mulan, and The Princess and the Frog, making that choice all the more relevant and potentially influential. As a genre, fantasy can offer more diversity because of its particularly imaginative nature, but the recurring and vocal oppositions to it indicate racist viewpoints, rather than a presumed attachment to a faithful adaptation.\nShababa Iqbal is a Journalism graduate from Independent University, Bangladesh, who likes Jane Austen's novels and Disney movies.

        "full_article": "The contrast between what the government promised opposition political parties and its actions on the ground couldn't be starker, as a rundown on the 22 days of BNP's ongoing countrywide protest programme shows. What the government promised them was \u2013 peaceful assembly and freedom of speech. What they are actually having is \u2013 violent assembly and fear of speech/reprisals. While this turnabout is politics 101 in Bangladesh, it also begs the question: was the promise of fair play, and the congeniality expressed in the PM's \"Will offer BNP leaders tea if they come to besiege my office\" comment, at all meant to be taken seriously?\nA report by Prothom Alo shows that between August 22 and September 13, violent attacks and clashes were reported in 48 events of BNP organised as part of a countrywide protest programme against the price hikes of fuel and daily essentials and also the deaths of two of its activists in police shooting in Bhola. Multiple people were injured so far, with BNP claiming to have lost three of its activists as of September 4. In 25 places, houses, vehicles and business establishments of its leaders and activists were vandalised, many of them having since left their neighbourhoods in fear of further reprisals. And in 17 places, section 144 was issued because of Awami League events overlapping with BNP's. Finally, 46 cases were filed in 18 districts.\n\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections.\nBizarrely, though, the official line puts the blame for violence on BNP itself, as if the party brought this all on itself in some sick display of self-loathing or to discredit itself. The truth is, it is the police that stands discredited, firstly because of its partisan role in handling the protests, and secondly, because of its heavy-handed and rather collusive legal response. As a breakdown of the 46 clash-related cases illustrates, 29 were filed by the police and 17 by the leaders of Awami League and affiliated organisations, mostly against their rivals in BNP and affiliated organisations. The total number of accused are 21,709. Of them, 2,777 were named and the rest unnamed \u2013 a classic formula to allow for more names to be added later. More damningly, however, the abovementioned report says that a number of accused were sick, old or overseas, meaning they were nowhere near the protest sites.\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political\u00a0space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections. This, it goes without saying, is not amenable to creating the level playing field so essential for a fair, safe, and participatory election.

        "full_article": "The contrast between what the government promised opposition political parties and its actions on the ground couldn't be starker, as a rundown on the 22 days of BNP's ongoing countrywide protest programme shows. What the government promised them was \u2013 peaceful assembly and freedom of speech. What they are actually having is \u2013 violent assembly and fear of speech/reprisals. While this turnabout is politics 101 in Bangladesh, it also begs the question: was the promise of fair play, and the congeniality expressed in the PM's \"Will offer BNP leaders tea if they come to besiege my office\" comment, at all meant to be taken seriously?\nA report by Prothom Alo shows that between August 22 and September 13, violent attacks and clashes were reported in 48 events of BNP organised as part of a countrywide protest programme against the price hikes of fuel and daily essentials and also the deaths of two of its activists in police shooting in Bhola. Multiple people were injured so far, with BNP claiming to have lost three of its activists as of September 4. In 25 places, houses, vehicles and business establishments of its leaders and activists were vandalised, many of them having since left their neighbourhoods in fear of further reprisals. And in 17 places, section 144 was issued because of Awami League events overlapping with BNP's. Finally, 46 cases were filed in 18 districts.\n\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections.\nBizarrely, though, the official line puts the blame for violence on BNP itself, as if the party brought this all on itself in some sick display of self-loathing or to discredit itself. The truth is, it is the police that stands discredited, firstly because of its partisan role in handling the protests, and secondly, because of its heavy-handed and rather collusive legal response. As a breakdown of the 46 clash-related cases illustrates, 29 were filed by the police and 17 by the leaders of Awami League and affiliated organisations, mostly against their rivals in BNP and affiliated organisations. The total number of accused are 21,709. Of them, 2,777 were named and the rest unnamed \u2013 a classic formula to allow for more names to be added later. More damningly, however, the abovementioned report says that a number of accused were sick, old or overseas, meaning they were nowhere near the protest sites.\nWhat we're witnessing is downright denial of political\u00a0space to the opposition camp. It reminds us of the acrimonious circumstances leading up to the controversial 2014 and 2018 elections. This, it goes without saying, is not amenable to creating the level playing field so essential for a fair, safe, and participatory election. As things stand, the ruling camp, despite what it said officially and despite demands by independent parties to protect people's right\u00a0to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, appears totally unwilling to allow the opposition to reach the ears of the masses.\nThis is totally unacceptable.

        "full_article": "So, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's observation, \"Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains\", has not lost its relevance at all 300 years later but, it appears, has even, to the bewilderment of many, gained fresh grounds. The International Labour Organisation's (ILO's) latest disclosure is particularly alarming because instead of the modern forms of slavery falling, they have got 10 million more people worldwide into their spreading tentacles to take the total to 50 million by the end of 2021. The increase by one-fifth in the number of people caught up in forced labour, forced marriage and other such inhuman conditions between 2016-2020 is in effect a journey backward when the UN has set 2030 for abolition of such slavery from the face of the earth. Now how this retrogressive human rights developments will affect the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) is indeed a cause for serious concern. What is particularly intriguing is that modern slavery is abysmally more prevalent, contrary to popular assumption, in upper-middle-income or high-income countries than in low-income ones. Cutting across ethnic, cultural and religious lines, as high as 52 per cent of forced labour and a quarter of all forced marriages take place in these countries economically better placed than many others. The indication is highly disconcerting. Here is a malady of free market economy that prospers on exploitation of the disadvantaged classes. Under the system, wealth gets created but not rationally distributed to pull the underprivileged out of their wretched conditions. Instead, the system of exploitation is perpetuated in order to maintain the status quo in favour of the exploitative classes. Even the pandemic that initially appeared as a great leveller with its indiscriminate sweep ultimately failed to offer a lesson of humanitarian and welfare society based on fair share of wealth. True, the pandemic and wars have exacerbated conditions of the low-income people and refugees but these have not stopped the privileged classes and the rich from amassing more wealth than before. This means that these classes from their advantageous positions have taken even more undue advantages in order to maximise their profits. The soaring inflation worldwide is the result of such a work of collective mindless commerce now perfected by exploitative theories of the worst kinds. Baser politics has also joined hands in the rapacious trade practices to rip off the souls of humanity and charity. No wonder, it is the private businesses all across the world that have been thriving at the cost of fair wages and salaries for workers. The joint study done by the UN agencies for labour and migration along with the Walk Free Foundation could not come at a better time to expose the charlatanism of world leaders who in league with the business sharks have triggered the galloping market volatility. It is more like releasing the monster out of the bottle. It was a bad ploy to drive Russia and Ukraine into an armed conflict. The Slavic neighbours are fighting a war but most part of the world is singeing by the heat generated there. An emergency like this shifts the priority for action to protect labour and human rights which are inseparable from each other. The UN has to be highly diplomatic and tactical in carrying out its labour rights programmes in such an uncertain time.",

        "full_article": "The move by the University Grants Commission on ensuring that teachers of public universities, once they have completed their higher studies abroad, return to their institutions is welcome. The expectation is that the UGC and through it the public universities will be able to stand by the decision and so restore confidence in our teaching community, in its ability to educate our future generations.In brief, the UGC has decided that henceforth teachers who plan to proceed abroad, financed for their studies with public money, will be required to hand in resignation letters in advance to their institutions as a guarantee that they will come back home once their assignments are over. But if they do not return by the dates they are expected to be back in their classrooms in Bangladesh, those resignation letters will be deemed to have taken effect when they fail to turn up. It is a good decision for the good reason that many have been the public university teachers who have conveniently failed to come back home after finishing their academic programmes at universities abroad. The figures related to the teachers who have not come back home in the last many years is disturbing. In the first place, they reveal a mindset which is indicative of narrow selfishness. In the second, they speak of fugitive teachers treating their students with disdain by not imparting the necessary education to them. In the third place, when teachers go silent or missing once they have done their doctoral and post-doctoral work abroad, it is crass insolence they demonstrate toward their mother institutions back home. Finally, when such teachers fall prey to temptations of staying abroad rather than take flights back home, it is their patriotism that comes into question.There have been some comparatively clever ones among such teachers in the not-so-distant past. They have gone back home, briefly rejoined their workplaces, collected their accumulated salaries and then taken the earliest flights back overseas. That was and is outrageous behavior. Little or no action could be taken against them by their universities because they simply went beyond the reach of the universities. These teachers, through tricky methods of work, have felt absolutely little shame in indulging in such deplorable acts.It is in light of such atrocious behavior by academics in the past that the UGC move of including advance resignation letters in the Teaching Load Calculation Policy in Public Universities-2022 offers a way out for public universities to ensure that absconding teachers suffer the consequences of their acts. Observe the facts. As we speak, six teachers of Comilla University, despite finishing their courses abroad, have not come back to the university. Of the 1,685 teachers at 36 public universities who went on leave in 2021, as many as 272 did not return. Altogether 125 of these absentee academics have been removed from their jobs. In 2020, 3,511 teachers from public universities took leave and went overseas. Of this number, 2,088 left the country on educational leave. The number of those continuing to stay abroad, despite the end of their academic programmes, stands at 43.While one commends the UGC on the step it has taken against recalcitrant teachers, there are a few other issues it will be required to take into consideration. A major source of worry for public universities in the country has been the tendency on the part of many teachers to obtain leave from these universities and take up assignments, which of course entail better financial facilities, at private universities. The casualty of such lateral moves by such academics has predictably been their students at the public universities. It has been observed that once their assignments, stretching over quite a few years, are over, these teachers return to their natural habitats. But by then the damage has been done. Their pupils at the private universities may have gained from their wisdom, but the young people they were supposed to teach at the public universities were left abandoned by them.The UGC will be fulfilling a serious educational need by formulating rules preventing a poaching of academics from public universities by private universities. If any teacher at a public university is desirous of teaching the young at a private university, he should be required to submit his resignation at his university before moving on. Such a move will create the scope for a new teacher to be appointed at the public university and for students to be reassured that continuity will be part of the curriculum they follow.The UGC needs to be assertive in formulating its policies and seeing to their implementation. At the same time, the UGC should see to it that private universities appoint and expand their own teaching structure in accordance with rules guaranteeing a full measure of classroom satisfaction for students at the private university level. Such measures need to be made mandatory. There will be little point in complaining of declining standards at the nation's universities when these basic issues are not handled to the satisfaction of the country.An improvement in standards depends, among other factors, on research by teachers at the universities; on the journals departments are able to produce, quality and quantity-wise, throughout the academic year; on the grave need to be on the lookout for plagiarism by academics in their research papers or dissertations. In these last few years, revelations relating to information theft by academics at public universities have left us red in the face. A foolproof mechanism must be in place to inform people that plagiarism --- and not just among teachers but students as well --- is on the radar, that those guilty of it will be swiftly exposed.At the end of the day, it is the reputation of the country which matters. When universities abroad do not seriously take the qualifications obtained by students at our public universities into account, we know how high and steep the mountain that we must climb happens to be.Our objective must be one and unwavering: at our universities we must enable our young men and women, through the wisdom and foresight and diligence of their teachers, to come by the means of drawing level with the rest of the world in academic excellence. It is a calling dependent on academics promoting scholarship in their classroom teaching, on teachers who go abroad but do not turn their backs on their students and who come back home to impart their new-found wisdom to the young and to the larger nation out there. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "According to a report of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2020, the literacy rate in the country was 75.6 per cent among people aged 15 years and above. This is a big jump in the rate from mere 16.8 per cent in 1971. But still we need to educate the remaining 24.4 per cent of the population by 2030 as targeted under the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.6.If this is the state of literacy in Bangladesh, it remains a big task for us to turn the entire population into a skilled labour force before we capitalise on the human capital after the country's graduation from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status in 2026. The United Nations has set the threshold of public expenditure on education at 6.0 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product). But in Bangladesh the actual expenditure is reportedly less than two per cent. So, the question arises as to how much importance we attach to education. We should remember that education will remain a big challenge in the post-LDC era.Three economic miracles have happened in Asia. They are: Japan, South Korea and Singapore. These three countries were nowhere near where they stand today. When Japan decided to change the lot of the people, the country resolved to spend heavily on education, industrialisation and farming. Education led to skill development that benefited industrialisation while it was made sure that farmers could gain most from their produce financially. Within a very short time the country made its mark on the world stage as we see today. South Korea also treaded almost a similar path. The country banked on industrialisation as well as human resource development through education. The country also incentivised farming. Thus the country has crafted its miraculous economic rise. The story of Singapore is most interesting. It is a city state. It has no other resource except its population, which is also very small in size. Still it could pull off a miraculous performance on the economic front because of its thrust on education. It could turn its small population into highly productive human capital because of education. That attests to what wonders education can work.The population of Bangladesh is far higher than that of Singapore. So a big opportunity lies there in reaping the untapped potential of this large population. Education is the foremost tool to turn Bangladesh's huge population into a highly potential human resource. We should remember that many trade benefits will cease to exist after Bangladesh graduates from the LDC club in 2026. Negotiations are going on to retain some of the benefits for a few more years in the post-LDC era. But it is certain that at one stage those remaining benefits also will no longer exist. So we need to get ready for that and education remains a big challenge in achieving that end. A lot of time has elapsed since the country was liberated in 1971. We do not afford to lose time anymore to educate our people as per requirements in the present-day world. If we fail to do so, we should remember that the graduation of a country from the LDC club does not guarantee that it will not slip back into that category in future.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

For the ordinary people, these charges are unaffordable while the number of government-run hospitals is quite inadequate. One such public hospital is Mugda Medical College Hospital in Dhaka city. The hospital has a modern pathological laboratory, where various kinds of diagnostic tests are carried out every day. However, it is unfortunate that this hospital does not conduct medical tests unless they are prescribed by its in-house physicians. Recently I went to the Mugda hospital for performing some diagnostic tests advised by a doctor who does not work in this hospital. I was told that it was not possible. One of the hospital officials said that they conduct diagnostic tests only when they are advised by their own physicians. For me, this incident is not just surprising but also shocking because public hospitals are set up to serve patients from all walks of life. As pathological tests performed in government hospitals are reliable and cost less, people prefer the tests to be done in these hospitals. So, every public hospital should perform diagnostic tests without considering which doctor has advised them. And Mugda Medical College Hospital should not be an exception. \nMd Ashraf Hossain,120, Middle Bashabo, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
