Ravi. The Governor had chosen to return to the House for reconsideration the Bill that was passed in September 2021, questioning the tenability of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee Report that had given its findings in favour of the the passage of such a law. The DMK regime has thrown down the gauntlet as the Constitution is clear as far as the Governor\u2019s course of action is concerned. If the Bill is presented to him again, Mr. Ravi is constitutionally bound to grant assent. It is a matter of speculation whether the Bill will obtain presidential nod, but the episode raises a question whether the Governor could not have avoided the current situation by reserving the Bill for the President instead of returning it. After all, this is clearly a Bill that requires the President\u2019s acceptance \u2014 the exemption from NEET is in conflict with the central law that makes it mandatory and, therefore, can only be saved by the President\u2019s assent. Regardless of the Bill\u2019s merits, the Governor should delay the matter no further. The original intent of the Constitution makers was that the Governor, under Article 200, ought to have no discretion, save in the case of a law that undermines the position of the High Court, which he is bound to reserve for the President\u2019s consideration. However, the Governor\u2019s rare use of discretion to question the desirability or validity of a Bill, and ask for reconsideration is now a matter of constitutional practice.Some parts of the Governor\u2019s communication to the Legislative Assembly Speaker seem to suggest that Mr. Ravi disagrees with the basis for the Bill, even though he is not wrong in highlighting a Supreme Court decision in favour of NEET. It is not generally desirable for the Governor to seek to match wits with the legislature\u2019s wisdom on social inputs that inform policy. It will be useful to recall that the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State relations observed that the Governor should not act contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers merely because he did not like the policy embodied in the Bill. The attention will now be on whether the NEET Exemption Bill will pass muster. For one thing, the exemption may not be a solution to the problem of government school students not making it to MBBS courses in sufficient numbers. The situation prior to the introduction of NEET was no better. However, the issue of NEET being a barrier to access is genuine. There is no doubt that the mandatory nature of NEET on a pan-India basis undermines the role of State governments in medical education. As the main deliverers of public health, the States cannot be denied a say in who joins medical courses in government colleges.",

Egypt, led by the Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah, came into the final with big-match pedigree, having won the title a record seven times. The North African heavyweight had also won its last six shoot-outs and had seen off fancied sides such as Ivory Coast, Morocco and the host Cameroon earlier in the competition. Senegal, on the other hand, had lost twice in the final, but found a hero in Sadio Mane, another of Liverpool\u2019s effervescent stars, who scored the decisive penalty. It was a redemption of sorts for the 29-year-old, for he had fluffed a spot-kick as early as the sixth minute. But the night ended in glory, capped by a celebratory lap of honour with his nation\u2019s flag draped around his shoulders. So it did for coach Aliou Cisse, who had missed the all-important penalty when Senegal first reached the final in 2002 and was the coach during the 2019 final defeat to Algeria. The quality of football in the final was largely dire and was marked by incessant fouling. But the lasting impression will be that of delirious Senegalese fans celebrating the moment their nation\u2019s name was etched in the history book.But the tournament will forever be punctuated by unsavoury happenings off the field. The most tragic of these was the trampling to death of at least eight Cameroonians on January 24 at the Stade d\u2019Olembe. COVID-19, which had already led to the postponement of the event by a year, played spoilsport again, scuppering many a side\u2019s best-laid plans and preparation time. It also did not help that certain European clubs and coaches were reluctant to release their players in the middle of their club seasons, with Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp even terming AFCON a \u201clittle tournament\u201d. It is true that European football currently occupies an exalted position, with its crown jewel, the quadrennial tournament Euros, next only to the FIFA World Cup. But to deny other continental competitions their due would be a severe disservice. One just needs to look at what last year\u2019s Copa America win meant to Lionel Messi. Despite having won every trophy and every award at club level, the Argentine legend coveted success with the national team the most. It was a similar quest for Mane and Senegal, of overcoming doubts and barriers, to experience the purest form of sporting joy there is. Mane called it the best day of his life and it is impossible to disagree.",

        "full_article": "When Shakespeare wrote, \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,\" he meant that the essence of something is not determined by its label. Calling a plum a pear does not make it taste any different.\nNames do have some meaning, of course. The names of Civil War generals, ex-presidents, the Sacklers (of opioid fame), and the Washington, DC, football team\u00a0 have been removed, refused, challenged, or changed. No reasonable person today would take on the name Hitler, or even Adolf for that matter.\nRenaming controversies are everywhere nowadays. Battles over the names of teams and schools are especially intense. There have been many renamings of college and professional sports teams in the United States, in addition to disputes over the names attached to public buildings, streets, and other spaces. In many cases, people were attached to (or simply accustomed to) an old name\u2014usually a Native American reference\u2014that younger generations found upsetting.\nIn 2017, Yale University renamed Calhoun College because Senator John C. Calhoun's support of states' rights, slavery, and the nullification of federal law in the 1800s was found to be too offensive to be attached to such an important place. The college now carries the name of a pathbreaking computer scientist: Grace Murray Hopper.\nSimilarly, in 2020, Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School became the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.\nBy contrast, the name of the US capital seems secure, even though George Washington was a slave owner. Indeed, many street and city names continue to memorialise people who can be associated with slavery.\nThe long-term question is whether any name is truly safe in the face of evolving norms and later objections. Virtually every name could eventually be associated with behaviour or beliefs that have become objectionable or deeply offensive, even if they were apparently admired or rewarded in an earlier era. None of us can be certain that every position held now will stand the test of time.\nThree solutions to renaming conundrums are worth considering. The first idea is associated with statutes of limitation in law. Names could be subject by convention to objection for a limited period, such as 50 years.\nUnder this approach, the State of Washington's name is safe, even though Washington the man owned slaves. The country's name is also safe, even though it is possible that a future generation will recognise that America is a derivative of Amerigo (Vespucci), a fifteenth-century explorer who refused to hire women as sailors.\nFor better or worse, it often takes a long time for social values to change. The renamed Washington Commanders football team had its previous name, the Redskins, for more than 80 years. But for this proposed solution to be effective, the social convention needs to be so strong that, after the agreed interval has passed, it will seem wrong to object to a name, however offensive it becomes.\nA second idea is to borrow from the concept of term limits. Names would have a shelf life, with an understanding that the controlling organisation could choose to extend the name for another period.\nConsider a name that had been assigned because of a donation, as in the case of the Sackler Institute at New York University. Here, the understanding, perhaps embodied in new laws, would be that the university is free to sell the name to a bidder. Again, nothing stops a for-profit company, like a football team, from hanging on to its name. It is market pressure that brings about changes.\nFinally, there is the idea of buyouts. If the original name was not \"purchased,\" a renaming in honor of a donor or public figure is easily accomplished. Nothing stopped Princeton from accepting a gift\u2014from an individual or group\u2014that was conditioned on removing Wilson's name. This idea is not entirely novel. Theater venues and sports stadiums are often renamed for advertising purposes, and the corporate names attached to them usually come with term limits of a kind, by dint of the name being for sale.\nAs for sports teams, they presumably gain something from the long histories attached to their names. But if an old name is found to be offensive, a team and its critics can benefit by auctioning off a name change.\nThe virtue of these three approaches (which could be combined) is that each requires us to recognise that times change, that names can also change, and that some prescribed limits to renaming are possible.\n\u00a0\nSaul Levmore\u00a0is a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago Law School.\u00a0Carolyn Baker Ringel\u00a0is an attorney with The Second Step, a domestic violence organisation.\n",

        "full_article": "The new normal is now normal! Four years back, seeing us sitting at the coffee table with our masks, disposable gloves and sanitiser bottles, people would have chuckled and called us abnormal. But today they won't. How the world has gone topsy-turvy with millions of deaths\u2014and our sense of normalcy has taken a 360-degree turn!\nImagine being forced to fight a \"not so normal\" adversary, and after failing to win the war, forced to accept the enemy's terms of surrender\u2014discard beautiful old habits like going out to dance and dinner or cooing and cuddling in the park, and so on. Instead, stay indoors, watch stale programmes on TV and die of mediocrity. If we are still alive, we have to wear masks, sanitise our hands, and order food online. Losers have no choice!\nLife has been a continued process of adjustment. Since taking the first gasp after birth, humans have been engaged in the constant struggle to adjust to a new environment. From the safety of the mother's womb, the baby comes to live in the bacteria-infested world. The infant has to survive, so instinctively, it turns towards its mother for sustenance. It learns to cry out loud when hurt or when hungry.\nIn the prehistoric era, cave dwellers survived the attack of predators and escaped the crushing jaws of crocodiles by learning some survival tactics. Elders told them to stay close together and carry a sharp weapon. Here again, adjustment is the key word.\nThroughout life's journey\u2014from childhood to adulthood and to old age\u2014a person must learn to adjust and adapt to a new normal every day and every hour, or else life will not wait for them.\nAs history tells us, humans have had to adjust to the changed social and political circumstances after every war. Those who conquered wrote the history; the defeated had to read them. Great wars changed great kingdoms. A new pharaoh came after Ramses II perished in the Red Sea. From the Sumerian clay tablets, Gilgamesh appeared on the Amazon paperbacks.\nAs always, new rulers imposed new rules and conditions. Defiance would result in your insolent head not staying where it should be. Mary Antoinette had to pay with her head and Napoleon Bonaparte had to rot at St Helena. So, if you want to live, better accept the new normal.\nTerrible epidemics throughout human history took the lives of millions of men, women and children. Since the pre-Justinian era, people across Europe and the Middle East have been facing the dreaded disease called plague. Since there was no knowledge of germ or bacteria, the disease was defined as the wrath of God. The Bubonic Plague was named the Black Death in the mediaeval period in Europe, and after the pitiable deaths of millions, people eventually learned how to protect themselves: they killed the fleas, pests and rodents, and kept their premises clean. Plague became a thing of the past by the 19th century. This infamous scourge inspired poets and writers to write strange poems and stories spiced with the supernatural. One such epic story is \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin.\"\nSince plague, the world has seen, in the last 200 years, the sporadic outbreak of killer diseases like smallpox, cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, measles, pneumonia, diarrhoea, bird flu, and so on. Every incidence of such an outbreak taught people new lessons, so they could adjust to the changed circumstances and adapt to the new normal.\nWe are facing at the moment the terrifying scourge caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to health experts, the virus that causes Covid-19 is mutating faster than expected, and healthcare systems across the world find themselves under-equipped in their fight against this invisible enemy.\nIt is during the present pandemic that we have come across the phrase \"new normal,\" and Google tells us that new normal has been the most searched phrase in the last two years. We know by now what it means and how to adapt to the new lifestyle, food habits, social isolation, health and hygiene practices, online education, interpersonal relations, and so on.\nMany of us are trying to cope with loneliness over isolation, anxiety over our future, anger over the loss of a job, and deterioration in interpersonal relations. Mental health experts tell us to accept the reality and learn to adjust to the new circumstances to lower the stress level.\nIt is, however, true that adjusting to a new normal or a new lifestyle for an adult person is not as easy as it may sound. One cannot simply forget or forego old habits overnight, and accept new ones with wide open arms. It is also not possible to forget the memory of many of our near and dear ones who did not get a second chance at life. Those who have witnessed the suffering and deaths from close proximity shudder to think about them even today.\nThe potency and magnitude of the infection appeared like a Biblical curse to many, and they prayed to the Divinity for help. In our lifetime, it is the worst health cataclysm we have witnessed so far. Yes, in our frantic bid for survival, we are learning to adjust every day and accept the new normal.\n\u00a0\nShahnoor Wahid\u00a0is a senior journalist.\n",

        "full_article": "One of the positive outcomes of the COP26 held in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021 was a universal acknowledgement of the failure of developed countries to deliver climate finance to developing countries, and even of developing countries themselves to actually deliver to the most vulnerable communities within their own territories.\nWhile it is good that countries acknowledged their failure and promised to do better going forward, the devil is in the details. I will take this opportunity to provide proposals on what needs to be done and who needs to do it to make sure that promises made at COP26 are actually delivered by COP27 this November in Sharm Al Shaikh, Egypt.\nThe first and biggest failure was the abysmal inability of the developed countries to deliver the USD 100 billion a\u00a0 year they had promised at the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015. One common misconception is in thinking that the environment ministers who attend the COP are responsible, when they are not the ones with the money. In fact, it is the finance ministers of the G7 countries who have to keep their promise. Back in June 2021, they met in Cornwall in the UK and decided to renege on their commitment. They then sent their environment ministers to the COP in November to apologise on their countries' behalf.\nNow, we need to see what the G7 Finance Ministers meeting in June 2022 in Germany will decide, rather than wait for November. The question is: Will they keep their promise this year, or renege as they did last year?\nThe second associated failure that developed countries' finance ministers must overcome is agreeing on which country should contribute how much to reach the iconic USD 100 billion amount each year. At the moment, it is left to each country to decide what their share should be and, not surprisingly, they could only agree on less than USD 80 billion so far. The finance ministers of developed countries have to agree on what the contribution of each country will be towards meeting the agreed goal of USD 500 billion over the next five years. They also need to agree on a neutral body, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat or the UN Statistics Bureau, to collect and collate the data, rather than self-certifying their own contributions, as has happened so far.\nA third, more forgivable failure was that the proportion of global funds that were provided counted 80 percent towards loans to support mitigation measures while only 20 percent counted for grants to support adaptation in the most vulnerable developing countries, when the expectation was for a 50-50 split between support for mitigation and adaptation. To the credit of the developed countries, they acknowledged this failure and promised to double their grant funding to support adaptation in the most vulnerable developing countries, and several countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and the US actually announced more funds for adaptation while they were in Glasgow. However, it is not just the amount allocated that is the problem but also how it is delivered and who receives it.\nThis has also been a major collective failure of the contributing developed countries and agencies such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), UNDP, World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), who acted as conduits to channel the funds to the developing countries to support adaptation. The two big failures were in making the funds far too difficult to access for the most vulnerable developing countries, so much so that it took years to get the first penny out of the funds. Only 10 percent of the adaptation funds actually reached the intended most vulnerable communities.\nThe fund-providing developed countries, the fund management agencies and the recipient developing countries' national governments all have to raise their game to make sure that the funds are allocated at scale and disbursed speedily so that the ultimate beneficiaries, who are the front line adapters, actually get the help they so desperately need. This will require much better coordination, better accessibility to funds and monitoring of the actual delivery\u2014all of which are sorely lacking at present. The good news is that this collective failure has been recognised and accepted, and reforms such as the eight principles of locally-led adaptation have been adopted. But making it happen at the requisite speed is now the challenge for all concerned.\nThe second annual Gobeshona Global Conference at the end of March 2022 on Locally-Led Adaptation and Resilience will be an opportunity for all the relevant players to take stock and report on their progress while correcting their failures of the past.\nAcknowledging failure is a positive development only if it leads to reforms to avoid making the same mistakes again.\n\u00a0\nSaleemul Huq is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "If I am asked to pick one song from a Hindi film that best encapsulates how the posterity would look back at the singing legends Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi, it would be \"Pagla Kahin Ka\" (1970), where they sing: \"tum mujhe yun bhula na paoge / jab kabhi bhi geet sunoge mere / sang sang tum bhi gungunaoge\". Translated loosely, it means, \"you will never be able to forget me, whenever you hear my songs, you will hum with me\". Interestingly, both Rafi and Lata sing the number separately in the movie.\nLata Mangeshkar, who died on February 6, 2022, epitomises the voice of all of us in the full gamut of our emotions. She is one of those few singers whose music mirrors the myriad of feelings under the sun\u2014filling our hearts with love and longing, welling up tears of joy and sadness, making our body often sway in happiness, or pushing us to introspection. Such was the depth and range of her voice that it never failed to thrall the listeners, cutting through the shifting sands of time and tastes of every generation. There is something for everyone, for every special moment in life, be it for children (\"bachche man ke sachche\"), one's first fling in life (\"solah ki baras ki baali umar\"), for nostalgia for an old flame (\"beeti na beeti raina and tere bina zindagi mein koi shikwa nahin\").\nIt's really a Herculean task to choose the best from the rich oeuvre of Lata Mangeshkar\u2014from the tribute to the Indian soldier (\"Aye mere watan ke logon\") she sang in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan that brought the latter to tears, the classical \"Mohe panghat pe\" in \"Mughal-e-Azam\" (1960), to the intensely romantic \"Ajeeb dastaan hai ye\" in \"Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai\" (1960), the lilting \"Baahon me chale aao\" in \"Anamika\" (1973) or \"Allah tero naam/Ishwar tero naam\" in \"Hum Dono\" (1961) which reflects the secular ethos of India.\nLata Mangeshkar sang not just in Hindi but in many other languages too, driving home the adage that music knows no physical or linguistic boundaries. Being a national cultural icon of India did not come in the way of her being the flag-bearer of her Marathi identity, as reflected by the song \"Jyoti kalash chalke\".\nSince her first recorded song in 1942 for a Marathi-language movie, when she just 13 years old, the Indore-born singer has earned many sobriquets along the way\u2014like the \"melody queen\", \"India's nightingale\" and \"the voice of the millennium\"\u2014with the common thread being her mesmerising voice. In a career spanning nearly 80 years, she sang an estimated 25,000 songs in 36 Indian languages, including Hindi, Bangla, Marathi, Tamil and Kannada, and across classical and other genres. The body of her work is overwhelming and impossible to fathom in one go. She was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in the field of cinema, and a host of other honours.\nLata's much-talked-about competition with her sister, Asha Bhosle, was the stuff of headlines and rumours. But the Mangeshkar sisters never allowed themselves to be distracted by such talks, nor did they bother to respond to claims about how they completely overshadowed other singers in the film and non-film playback industry. As is quite common in a cut-throat competitive industry like Bollywood, controversies could not entirely elude Lata Mangeshkar. There was her tiff with Mohammed Rafi over royalties and her brief fall-out with Raj Kapoor, but those were just blips in a long, prodigious career.\u00a0\nNot many know that Lata Mangeshkar's singing talent was an accidental discovery by Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi musician, when she was just five years old. But then, the untimely death of her father brought the family's financial burden on a 13-year-old Lata's shoulders. A family friend came to their aid and she started singing and acting in his father's theatre company.\nAs in the silver screen, life in the Bollywood music industry has strange twists and turns too. When Lata Mangeshkar went to Mumbai, she was rejected by film producer Sashadhar Mukherjee because he found her voice too thin. But destiny had a different plan for her. As Lata Mangeshkar recalls in Nasreen Munni Kabeer's documentary \"Lata Mangeshkar: In Her Own Words\", her song \"Aayega aanewala\" in \"Mahal\" (1949) became such a rage that people would enquire about the identity of the singer, forcing a radio station to contact the gramophone company HMV to ask who had sung the song. As the first line of the song predicted, a crooning star appeared in the Indian music firmament. A star that shone brighter and brighter until she passed.\nLata Mangeshkar's voice has helped Bollywood heroines rise to superstardom down the ages\u2014from Madhubala, Meena Kumari to Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta and scores of others in between. Such was the power of her voice emoting for actors across almost all eight decades. It was a sure guarantee of success and leading heroines down the generations would insist on giving their lips to her songs, often making it part of their contracts.\nThe 1950s belonged completely to Lata Mangeshkar who went on to work with eminent music directors like Shankar-Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, SD Burman, Hemant Kumar, Madan Mohan and Salil Chowdhury. These were also busy years for her. She would at times record six to eight songs in a day, go home, sleep for a few hours and then catch Mumbai's local train again to a recording studio.\nIn 1960s, Madhubala was once again the face for Lata's voice in the evergreen \"Mughal-E-Azam\" film, with the defiant \"Jab pyaar kiya to darna kya\" becoming the byword for many a never-say-die lovers. The decade also marked the beginning of her work with another Bollywood composer duo, Laxmikant-Pyarelal, with whom she would go on to sing over 700 songs over a period of 35 years, most of which became super hits. This was also the time when Lata recorded duets with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, and Kishore Kumar.\nThis was followed by the 70s which will be remembered for Meena Kumari's last film \"Pakeezah\" (recall the song \"Chalte chalte\") and \"Abhimaan\" in which Lata Mangeshkar sang some memorable songs. The 1980s saw her lending her voice in the films \"Silsila\", \"Chandni\", \"Maine Pyar Kiya\", \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", \"Prem Rog\", \"Ram Teri Ganga Maili\" and \"Masoom\". Fast forward to 1990s and 2000s, and there were Lata's songs in the Gulzar-directed \"Lekin\" and Yash Chopra's films \"Lamhe\", \"Darr\", \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" and \"Dil To Pagal Hai\". Lata's last full film album was \"Veer-Zaara\" in 2004.\nAmong her other unforgettable songs are \"Lag jaa gale\", \"Satyam shivam sundaram\", \"Ajeeb daastaan hai\", \"Hothon mein aisi baat\", and \"Pani pani re\".\nWith such a vast repertoire of songs for all emotions of all people, one cannot miss Lata Mangeshkar even for a day because our hearts hum with her voice. It is part of who we are.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPallab Bhattacharya\u00a0is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India.\n",

        "full_article": "It's disquieting to learn that a transnational syndicate is involved in stealing money from the ATMs of local banks. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit recently arrested some members of this syndicate, including its alleged mastermind Hakan Zanburkan, a Turkish citizen. Reportedly, he along with some Indian and Bangladeshi nationals have long been carrying out their fraudulent activities in the country. Hakan visited Bangladesh at least six times over the last five years. Last month, he went to several ATM booths of Eastern Bank Limited and tried to withdraw money about 84 times using cloned cards of at least 40 countries. However, his attempts were foiled by the anti-skimming technology installed by the bank.\nIn a confessional statement given by Hakan, the detailed procedure of how the gang operated was revealed. It was known that the gang had members in India, Pakistan, Mexico, Bulgaria, Bangladesh and Turkey. The CTTC investigation also found that Hakan, along with another Turkish national and two Bangladeshis, were arrested in India's Assam in 2019 for stealing around\u00a010 lakh rupees through such fraudulence.\nSince the first incident of ATM card fraud was reported in the country in 2016, several such incidents have come to light. In all the cases, the involvement of foreign nationals was found. They used not only cloned cards but also other advanced technologies to steal people's money without leaving any trace. Reportedly, some Bangladeshi nationals also took training on cloning credit cards in foreign countries such as Russia.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the CTTC unit so far and hope that all other members of the gang will soon be apprehended. Since Hakan is one of the masterminds of this international ATM card skimming gang, police should immediately request other countries as well as the Interpol to provide them necessary information on their operations, which will help prevent such incidents in the future.\nMeanwhile, all our banks must have the modern technologies needed to foil any such attempts of ATM fraud. The latest attempt to steal money from the ATMs of Eastern Bank Limited failed only because it had a robust security system in place. All our banks should learn from this incident and protect themselves by installing anti-malware and anti-skimming systems and by addressing any existing system vulnerabilities.\n",

There is now a real image to be attached to this revising spree. According to a report by The Daily Star, if we put together all the additional allocations approved for revised projects in this fiscal year so far, it would be enough to fund the construction of two Padma Bridges (the bridge cost Tk 30,192 crore). That's until February 8, when the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved four project revisions, in addition to the 28 approved before, bringing the combined total of additional costs to Tk 59,919 crore. That's how much money being thrown down the drain simply because the government couldn't ensure timely and smooth implementation of its development projects. Let that sink in.\nWe have repeatedly expressed concerns about this habitual revision of projects, particularly the implementation procedures of the ministries involved that lead to frequent time and cost overruns. Even Ecnec Chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself expressed her dissatisfaction on several occasions, and gave clear directives to check this vicious cycle\u2014including one that a project cannot be revised more than three times. But all warnings seem to be falling on deaf ears.\u00a0\nWhile the reasons for revisions may vary from one project to another, there are some common factors like absence of proper feasibility studies, complexities in land acquisition, and lengthy procurement process, according to experts and officials. The presence of these bottlenecks and others causes problems at every stage of the implementation, sometimes even before a project gets underway. For example, as an expert said, it takes at least two years to pass the development project proposals (DPPs). Add to that delays in the bidding process. Due to the time taken to get the projects approved and started, the estimates based on which the proposals are prepared often become dated, necessitating additional funds. There can be unforeseeable challenges (like the outbreak of the pandemic) too, but most of the barriers faced are procedural. Throw corruption into the mix, and you have a problem that is not a problem for those profiting off it.\u00a0\nWe think without fixing how the public authorities go about planning and implementing their projects, and without ensuring greater accountability every step of the way, we cannot get rid of this revision culture. As well as the extra money that citizens have to pay for this every year, there is another cost that is often ignored\u2014prolonged public suffering. Considering all this, the government must take this problem with\u00a0the seriousness it deserves and take prudent measures to enhance the implementation capabilities of the ministries involved and punish those responsible for the costly delays.\n",
