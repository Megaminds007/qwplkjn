      "full_article":"A statement made by UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay on July 9 last for reopening schools has come as no surprise. The heads of the two UN sister organisations working for children's rights and education are insistent that opening 'schools for in-person learning cannot wait'. They elaborate, \"It cannot wait for cases to go to zero. There's clear evidence that primary and secondary schools are not among the main drivers of transmission\". The two leaders then add that Covid-19 transmission in schools can be managed with 'appropriate mitigation strategies in most settings'. They emphasise \"schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen\". The urgency as expressed by their statement is clear and they have particularly pleaded with the governments of 19 nations where schools have remained closed for 15 months, adversely affecting 156 million students. Bangladesh is obviously one of the countries where schools are shuttered till now and no one can tell when they will reopen. Currently, though, the closure remains effective till July 31. In response to the UNICEF and UNESCO chiefs' call, Bangladesh has expressed its desire to open schools and colleges after inoculating teachers and students within the shortest possible time. Health Minister Zahid Maleque claims that the national technical committee on Covid-19 and the vaccination committee are working on it. Although it is claimed that 65 per cent of teachers have received the jab, no deadline has been set for bringing the rest under vaccination cover. Nor is there any clear outline for vaccinating school and college students. Residential students of public universities have only been prioritised for vaccine registration. Surely, it will take time to cover all students of public varsities. Then there are private universities to cover. If vaccine coverage of university students is not guaranteed soon, how can one assure that school and college students who comprise more than two-thirds of the 40 million students will be vaccinated within a short time? The proposition is untenable. After all, availability of vaccine is a crucial factor in this regard. Already the possibility of promotion without in-person examination for school and college students looms large. Some private schools in the capital have been conducting examinations along with classes and assignments online. They can do so because in an urban setting such as the capital's, facilities are present. Although the process is a poor substitute, it somehow retains students in the learning process. It is exactly against this background the comment made by Henrietta Fore and Audrey Azouley reinforces the view that the authorities including those in Bangladesh have failed to prioritise education. They remark, \"governments have too often shut down schools and kept them closed for long periods, even when the epidemiological situation didn't warrant it\". Like other countries, Bangladesh also took such actions as a first recourse rather than a last measure. They question the sagacity of closing schools while allowing shopping malls, restaurants etc. to operate. In Bangladesh, even public transports were in operation without maintaining health protocols although the authorities warned against such violation but taking no action whatsoever. Right now, the relaxation of the lockdown before the Eid-ul Azha against the advice of the national technical committee on Covid-19 may lead to several events of super spreader of the Delta variant of the pathogen. Bangladesh is now first and fourth in the world in terms of the rate of infection. If the situation worsens further in the weeks following the mass movement of people during the festival, the possibility of reopening not only schools but also universities may look bleak. However there was a time when villages were almost completely free from coronavirus attack. Suggestions made earlier for opening schools in areas where the virus was absent went unheeded. The argument that there is no point in getting adamant to open school at the same time was dismissed. Why? Village students are long discriminated against because of lack of facilities and poor quality teaching staff. If schools were open there, at least these neglected students would not have regressed and in some cases could have narrowed the gap with their counterparts in cities and towns. The UNICEF and UNESCO could argue with governments such as the likes of Bangladesh for opening schools much earlier when for months the greater parts of Bangladesh were free from the disease. Even today, when villagers are the majority casualty both in terms of death and infection, there are areas that do not report infection, least of death. Schools can be opened there with no threat of spread of the virus if health precautions are in place. Waiting for inoculation of all the teachers and students may delay reopening schools in the country by not only months but by years. This is unacceptable. More than 75 per cent village students are deprived of online facilities, electronic devices and even their teachers are not accustomed to the technology involved and methods used for remote teaching. In-person teaching and learning in virus-free rural areas is not a big challenge. If their learning process is not taken care of urgently, these laggards will not only regress but also drop out in great numbers. Arrangement of in-person classes in the open and under trees or even scheduled for alternate days can overcome some limitations. Moreover, bachelor and master degree holders looking for jobs may be recruited under a crash programme for educating such school students. nilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\n",

      "full_article":"The lifting of restrictions on export of wet blue leather has produced mixed reactions. In view of the drastic slump in prices of raw leather in the last couple of years causing colossal wastage, it seems the government found a convenient justification for lifting the ban on wet blue leather --- a primary stage of leather processing when the leather is tanned, but not dried, dyed or finished. It is well known what happened in the past years at the time of Eid-ul-Adha--- the big occasion when 50 per cent of the country's raw hides and skins got collected from all over the country. Although the government in consultation with the tanners and leather associations had set the prices ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha, small and seasonal traders who collected raw hides of sacrificial animals found it extremely difficult to sell their stocks to the wholesale buyers (aratdars) who eventually supply these to the tanneries for onward processing. The situation was unprecedented and looked like an ominous sign for the country's leather sector. It could be gathered that lower prices of leather and leather goods in international markets had been the reason for lack of interest among wholesalers to buy raw hides. Obviously, the government this time wants to avoid a similar situation, and thus allowing export of wet blue leather seems to be a solution. Such thinking is too simplistic and goes against the very purpose of restricting export of this stuff as a means of adding substantial value through further processing and production of finished leather and leather goods. It is for this reason that wet blue leather remained banned for export since 1990. After 31 years, this shift, a major departure from the policy of industrialisation, aims at ensuring unhindered collection of raw leather as well as fair price for the traders. News reports say that the government, so far, allowed six firms to export wet blue leather subject to certain conditions which among others include the validity period of export till June 30, 2022. Each of the firms will be allowed to export 0.2 million sq ft of wet blue to eight specific destinations. Now the pertinent question here is: can this move fetch good price to traders and make collection of raw hides and skins smooth? There are other worries too. Will the number of firms be increased and the time of shipment extended? The worry is not for nothing, as it has been seen that initially five firms were allowed permission for export and soon the number rose to six. According to a FE report, Bangladesh Tanners Association president expressed his dissatisfaction over the government decision saying that extension of the time beyond this financial year (FY22) might create serious problem for the domestic leather and leather goods sector. The government tends to view the decision as a temporary recourse. Observers think that if the decision does not provide scope for any flexibility, the move though not very welcome, may be considered-one taken under unusual circumstances and not to serve vested interest.\n",
