Anchored on the equality clause in the Constitution, as well as on the right to dignity, privacy and bodily autonomy of women, the Court has ruled that there is no rationale for excluding single or unmarried women from the categories of women who could seek abortion care after the completion of 20 weeks of pregnancy, but before 24 weeks. The Delhi High Court had declined to allow the termination of the pregnancy of a 25-year-old woman who was in a consensual relationship, but did not want to carry the pregnancy to term after her partner declined to marry her. The reason cited was that being unmarried, and the pregnancy having occurred consensually, she was not eligible for the benefit of the amendment under the rules. The High Court took a technical view, as Rule 3B, which listed the women eligible for termination of pregnancy \u2014 such as rape survivors, minors, those with physical disabilities and mental illness \u2014 did not explicitly include single women who had become pregnant in a consensual relationship.However, the Court has given a purposive meaning to the rules. \u201cChange in marital status\u201d as one of the reasons for which abortion during the extended upper limit of 24 weeks is permissible. As the rationale here is a possible change in the woman\u2019s material circumstances, the Court has ruled that even abandonment by the partner could constitute a change in circumstances that could impact an earlier decision to carry on with the pregnancy. The legislature has allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy, if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that continuing the pregnancy would involve a risk to the woman\u2019s life or cause grave injury to her health. Here too, the Court has taken a purposive view, laying down that an unwanted pregnancy affects a woman\u2019s physical and mental health, rendering it quite important that she alone should decide on whether to undergo an abortion. On a question that did not directly arise in this case, the Court has said rape survivors who may legally seek an abortion in the extended period will also include survivors of marital rape. This judicial view may prevent questions being raised as to whether pregnancy caused by marital rape, which is not a crime, could also be terminated under this rule. At a time when unsafe abortions remain a major cause of maternal mortality, it is a significant verdict that advances the cause of safe abortion services.To read this editorial in Tamil, click here.\u00a0To read this editorial in Hindi, click here.",

The fact that other States took years to prepare and the Goa edition was cancelled after several postponements revealed the enormous challenge that Gujarat had to deal with in organising this large-scale event. Odisha had set a new benchmark by organising the 2017 Asian Athletics Championships in three months and Gujarat equalled the feat by staging a multi-sport event in a similar time frame. With the same party \u2014 the Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 ruling in the State and the Centre, the cooperation was smooth in the run-up to the event, which was last held in Kerala seven years ago. The Narendra Modi Stadium \u2014 the biggest cricket venue seating over a lakh \u2014 staged the Games\u2019 spectacular opening ceremony at Ahmedabad. A show of light and sound, it showcased Gujarat\u2019s rich cultural heritage and blended with it the country\u2019s technological advancement. It was reflected in the use of eye-catching augmented reality technology by Doordarshan during the live coverage of the inaugural extravaganza.For the Games, involving 8,000-plus athletes from 36 teams in 35 sporting categories, Gujarat used its existing infrastructure instead of building new venues that often turn out to be white elephants. It converted some international standard expo centres into indoor sports facilities. Instead of building a Games Village, it used hotels to provide accommodation to the athletes and ensured business to the State\u2019s hotel industry. The Games, which began as the Indian Olympic Games in Lahore in 1924 before being rechristened as the National Games after Independence, stays relevant in its 98th year by providing young athletes an opportunity to get a feel of a multi-discipline Games and compete with world-class athletes such as Mirabai Chanu, Shiva Thapa and Avinash Sable before they step on to the international platform. For Gujarat, organising the Games was in sync with the State\u2019s ambition to host the Olympics in future. The efforts to set up the Swarnim Gujarat Sports University in Vadodara, encouraging the use of technology in sports and promoting skill development through sports are steps in this direction. Inaugurating the 2022 Gujarat edition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared his Government\u2019s intention to use the soft power of sports for the country\u2019s overall development while for the athletes, the National Games offers a stepping stone to greater progress.To read this editorial in Hindi, click here.\u00a0To read this editorial in Tamil, click here.",

However, Congress G ( for Gehlot) and Congress P (for Pilot) are available.\nI\u2019ve also suggested Congress can move on to double alphabet should they exhaust all 26 singles. For example, Congress SP (Sachin Pilot) will sow havoc in the Samajwadi Party ranks and Congress AGP (Ashok Gehlot Party) will cause confusion in Assam. Congress ST (Shashi Tharoor) and Congress MK (Mallikarjuna Kharge) will further stir the pot.\nAmong the more dismal prospect in the coming days are Congress CD, to celebrate the penchant of politicians to have their capers recorded, and on a more lurid note, Congress (X), for x-rated Congressmen or those who have starred in X-rated videos (I can think of a few; for more extreme videos they can use XX and XXX).\u00a0Congress XX can also be used for stags and male siblings; and Congress (XY) for husband-wife, or brother-sister combos.\n\nThere\u2019s also Congress (Z) for those in the habit of nodding off and Congress Y, (whose symbol can be a question mark) for those who are wondering what they are still doing in the party.\nSince there was already a Congress YSR, they might as well allow other triple letter combos.\u00a0 Although the overseas Congress party is moribund, they can still split for the heck of it and form Congress (NRI), Congress (PIO), Congress (ABCD) etc. Hyphenated combos are also possible \u2014 for instance Congress FED-UP, for those who are, well, fed up.\nWhile on Congress Party and splits, I\u2019m reminded of a popular snack in Karnataka called \u201cCongress Kadalekai\u201d \u2014 Kadalekai in Kannada language is peanuts \u2014 and how it got its name. Apparently, the etymology can be traced to the Congress Party split during the 1969 AICC session that took place in Lalbagh, a lovely 240 acre botanical garden that was commissioned by Tipu Sultan\u2019s father Haider Ali.\u00a0 \u201cCongress\u201d kadalekai are basically split peanuts spiced heavily with red chilly pepper powder and hing (asafetida). There is also the delicious irony in the fact that the Congress Party split \u2014 or broke \u2014 in Lalbagh\u2019s Glass House.\nWhat I did not know previously is there is also a \u201ccommunist\u201d kadalekai. These are whole peanuts coated with red masala paste. During a visit to my hometown couple of years ago, I discovered the peanut gallery has expanded. I was moseying around my old digs in Malleswaram and ran into a peanut seller on the sidewalk. After I picked up some Congress and Communist kadelekai, he asked me \u201cHow about some BJP and JDS kadalekai?\u201d I\u2019ll leave it to your sharp eye to identify the newcomers/latest addition to the peanut gallery.\nIndian politics is wondrous but Indian sidewalk salesmanship is something else.\n\n",

The analysis underpinning the monetary tightening threw up interesting information. The depreciation in the rupee against the dollar and the dip in the forex reserves are not alarming. Since April 1, the rupee dropped 6.8% against the dollar, while a basket of major currencies depreciated 16%. Also, about 60% of the dip in foreign exchange reserves is because of changes in their valuation following rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.\nBut the trajectory of inflation is clouded by global uncertainty. RBI acknowledged it but retained the current financial year\u2019s inflation projection at 6.7%. Economic growth, however, was marked down to 7% from the earlier 7.2%. The main aim of the current cycle of rate hikes is to head off second round effects of inflation. This time monetary tightening is taking hold fast as retail and MSME lending of banks is mostly benchmarked to the repo. Simultaneously, GoI and states have embarked on fiscal consolidation, which complements monetary policy. It\u2019s prudent to hold back in an uncertain situation.\nIn the April-June quarter, GDP grew in double digits. But RBI has forecast that in the subsequent quarters till the end of the financial year growth will keep slowing down. Separately, RBI\u2019s analysis of inflation drivers showed that the April-September increase was mainly on account of supply shocks. It was the cut in fuel taxes in May that knocked off 0.4 percentage points from core inflation. In near future, global recession will dampen demand. Therefore, it may be time for a slower pace of rate hikes even as RBI\u2019s ongoing drive to drain liquidity will carry on monetary tightening.\n\n",

Those damaging public and private property must be effectively deterred. Some states have enacted laws. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2009 guidelines prescribed a fair procedure. HCs were empowered to initiate suo motu proceedings and appoint a judicial officer as Claims Commissioner.\nKerala enacted a law in 2019 to recover damages for private property destruction but left out public property despite parties in the agitation-prone state frequently venting their ire on public property. In contrast, UP\u2019s 2020 law enables recovery of damages for both public and private property. But SC found great divergence from due process in the recovery of damages from anti-CAA protesters and directed UP to follow this law properly. The Centre\u2019s law, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, is woefully outdated and narrowly focussed on criminal prosecution.\nAfter two SC committees suggested measures giving teeth to this Act, a 2015 amendment bill suggested placing burden of proof on the accused, fixing responsibility on organisations and officebearers, and pegging the fine as the market value of public property damaged. Fixing culpability of police officers and governments remiss in preventing violence is important too. The Agniveer protesters who caused huge damages escaped lightly, so do cadres and netas of established political parties. A uniform central legislation that ensures timebound inquiry into damages, recovery of assets, and criminal prosecution of rioters is needed. Act without fear or favour against vandals.\n\n",

According to media reports, President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed documents to formally begin the process of incorporating Russian-controlled Luhansk and parts of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia into the Russian Federation after a series of disputed referendums. It effectively provides Moscow a land bridge to Crimea, the peninsula that it annexed in 2014. While Crimea represented the first annexation in Europe since World War II, the latest move represents the biggest such annexation. Together, all five regions make up around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.\n\nWhile Crimea represented the first annexation in Europe since World War II, the latest move represents the biggest such annexation. Together, all five regions make up around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.\nWe condemn the latest annexation and slow Russification of a sovereign country in the strongest terms. Altering borders with brute force is not just a clear violation of international law. It represents the height of absurdity of a war \u2013 now in its eighth month \u2013 that has proven to be detrimental to even faraway countries like Bangladesh. The disruptions caused by the war and the West's response to it \u2013 in the form of heavy banking, trade and commercial sanctions \u2013 led to unprecedented crises in the global supply chain. On the ground, countless people have been killed, injured and displaced. With the Ukrainian forces clawing back wins in recent weeks, and the mass mobilising of Russian forces as a result, along with the threat of using nuclear weapons, things are quickly becoming totally unmanageable.\nThe irony of the latest development is that Putin, at the annexation ceremony in Kremlin, slammed the colonial past of a \"satanist\" West. He said western colonies had carried out genocide, opium wars and plundered states. There is no disputing that. But does it justify his own \"colonisation\" project? He signalled his willingness to continue the battle for a \"greater historical Russia\", using whatever tools he had at his disposal. Ukraine as a sovereign nation must not be a victim of that battle. And the West, on its part, must ensure it does not contribute to it by escalating tensions to a point where such drastic actions find justification.\nThe West, so far, has been an active if unreliable third party in this war, its actions nearly having as much of an effect on the world as the two warring parties. Instead of trying to assuage tensions, it has been a provocateur at times. Its sanctions, aimed at the Russians and Russian interests, have instead caused suffering globally. Clearly, this strategy of aiding Ukraine militarily and punishing Russia economically is not having the desired effect, which only shows the importance of using more judicious means and solutions.\nWe urge the Russian authorities to refrain from their destructive pursuit in Ukraine, and the international community to prepare the ground for de-escalation of tensions. Nothing justifies continuing this war or any illegal takeover of occupied territories. We urge everyone to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions to end this war.\n",

        "full_article": "We are appalled by the latest data on child marriage revealed by the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum. Reportedly, from January to August this year, as many as 2,301 girls fell victim to child marriage in 28 districts of the country. This means an average of 288 child marriages took place per month in those districts alone. During this time, 574 girls were also raped there. Of them, 84 were gang-raped, and 43 had different types of disability. We wonder how the situation has come to this point despite there being government institutions, law enforcement agencies, and various private organisations working to prevent these crimes.\nThe advocacy forum, in its \"Girl Child Situation Monitoring Report-2022\", has also revealed that in the first eight months of the year, 76 girl children were sexually harassed and tortured, 136 fell victim to kidnapping and trafficking, 186 were murdered, and 181 died by suicide. And not only girls, boys are also increasingly becoming victims of sexual abuse around the country. According to another estimate by Ain o Salish Kendra, at least 44 boys were raped during the first nine months of this year.\n\nWhile these findings by different organisations suggest a bleak scenario in terms of women and children's safety, they do not reveal the full picture, however, as they have been collected mostly from national and local dailies. And such crimes are often underreported. \nWhile these findings by different organisations suggest a very bleak situation in terms of safety, they do not reveal the full picture, however, as they have been collected mostly from national and local dailies. And such crimes are often underreported. Unfortunately, we still do not have any comprehensively prepared and updated national-level database on child marriage and violence against women and children. So, how will the government assess the actual reality of problems facing vulnerable sections of society? We urgently need such comprehensive data leading to comprehensive response. What we know from various newspaper reports is that the rate of child marriage has increased manifold during the pandemic, as did school dropout rates of girl children.\nThat being said, we think the government can still do a lot to stop child marriage and violence against children, including boys, based on available data. A number of rights organisations regularly prepare reports on these crimes and violations of human rights. But what is the point of preparing\u00a0reports if appropriate measures are not taken to address these issues?\nThe government must ensure that those involved with the crime of child marriage do not get any patronage from the administrations and local political/social leaders. It must also ensure speedy prosecution of child abuse and rape cases. The National Girl Child Advocacy Forum has called for establishing a separate directorate for children, raising awareness on the issue and proper enforcement of relevant laws to stop child marriage and abuse \u2013 demands that experts made frequently in the past as well. We need strong action now. We urge the government to take these recommendations seriously to improve the safety of women and children.\n",

The winning team \u2013 comprising Fahmida Azim as artist, Josh Adams on art direction, and Anthony Del Cole as the writer \u2013 won the award for 'How I escaped a Chinese internment camp'. It is a visual story of Zumrat Dawut, a woman from China's Xinjiang region who survived the abduction and internment of Muslims in Chinese camps. Daily Star Books editor Sarah Anjum Bari speaks with Fahmida Azim about her work with The Insider and about the responsibilities of visual storytelling.\nHow did you begin working on your story for The Insider? Why is this story important to you?\nThe Insider reached out to me about this interview that they did with Uyghurs. They already had the script written. I looked at the script and we hashed out how the story was going to look between me, Josh Adams and Antony Del Cole. I suggested images, edited the script along the way.\nWe talked to an interpreter who talked to Zumrat for us. We had long emails back and forth. Anthony and Josh had already done the interview with them. I as the artist talked to them about their experience and the visual parts of it to get the accuracy right \u2013 the uniforms, the backgrounds, the kind of people around them.\nThis particular story needed illustration because we don't really have images of the [Uyghurs'] experiences, we can't go into the facilities. We only have aerial shots of the camp that were being built. My job as an illustrator is to take someone's experience \u2013 their words, the feeling of the story \u2013 and make it visible, make it something you can feel and see and understand.\nThe power of this story is part of the reason the people over at the Pulitzer Prize thought that it would be symbolic of why this medium is important. It's a recognition that comics and the visual medium are just as valid for telling a story as the written word.\nWhat goes into trying to give shape \u2013 structure, chronology, clarity \u2013 to memories that are so traumatic and chaotic?\n\nYou have to put yourself in the place of the audience and in the emotions that are being felt, and you have to know your medium. Because you're scrolling down, the longer you make the image, the longer you let it linger, the more the gravity of the situation sinks in. When you let the gravity fill the screen, the more the audience feels as overwhelmed as the person going through it.\nI would go and do my own research, I'm not just going off of what she's saying. I'm also going off of other eye witness accounts, the uniforms that were worn, the weapons and vehicles that were used. How Zumrat might have looked while she was there versus how the hypernational propaganda machine might have looked like. To ground her story, her chaotic memory, we make all the details look very specific.\nI looked into interviews with other Uyghurs, documentaries about different Chinese policies and surveillance technologies, how many cameras there are, how the cameras track you, the social currency system. There were also specific torture devices \u2013 she would describe being strapped to a chair in a basement and I would go out and find that specific device and how it's used on other people, and recreate the schematics of it.\nIt's evident from your comics that they invaded her space in every way possible \u2013 in terms of her body, her reproductive rights, what she could say.\nThere was a lot of propaganda that she mentioned. Having to go to these counselling sessions. She was tied up when she was at the police station. In her everyday life it was reinforced that she couldn't believe in Allah because she was being surveilled. Even if she inadvertently said or whispered that she believed in Islam, the guards would come and beat her. It was beaten into her that she could not speak of her religion.\nThe controlling of not just her body but her future and her past and her organs \u2013 they sterilised her without her consent. The attempt to control her will, the amount of resources and time, the whole world pouring down on her like that, it just makes the fact that they weren't able to break her extraordinary.\nIf we take away anything, it's that human will or free will is strong and we can come out of these attempts to control us. I see it happening everywhere \u2013 these laws that try to control the most innocent arts of ourselves. France banning the hijab. The abortion laws being passed in America. It's disheartening and scary. I feel like Zumrat lived the logical conclusion of when they try to control every aspect of us. She lived the logical conclusion of fascism. That makes it even more necessary to fight for what we have and where we have it.\nTalking to her, I had a lot of nightmares for weeks.\nHow did you cope with that?\nI'm not a stranger to depicting traumatic experiences. I've done stories about femicide, Rohingya refugees, Iranian journalists getting lashed\u2026 it's part of the journalism beat that I do. I think the way I do it is by also doing lighthearted things that show women and girls living with full bodily autonomy.\nI specifically gravitate towards stories that deal with our autonomy. I don't think we give the ordinariness of humans a good shot. All of the things we love \u2013 sc-fi, fantasy, even animals \u2013 we love the humanness of it, because we are humans, and it's something we should explore and celebrate.\nHow does one break stereotypes? And is the media language used to represent minorities doing them justice?\nI think the way you break stereotypes is by not pandering to the people stereotyping you. Instead, turning to your fellow Muslim women or fellow minority, helping each other live the life they want to live. Then people looking in from the outside get that we are self-sufficient and it is complex and desirable and joyful to be us.\nI don't want to talk about the media as if it is one broad brush, especially in these times when we're scattered in our use of media. The times when the media is nuanced is usually when we include the people we're talking about into the conversation. So, when we're talking about people from the Middle East, if we bring in experts and people living in that area, surviving that disaster or event that we're talking about, that's when we can have more balanced reporting.\nSo often we fall for the trap of talking about someone instead of talking with them and letting them talk for themselves. You need multiple lenses of their point of view. As journalists and artists, we shouldn't be dictating what's happening out there, we should be exploring.\nIt seemed like Zumrat was keen on talking about her experiences. But what about when the subject doesn't want to speak? How do you respect their privacy while telling a story that needs to be told?\n\nIt always has to be consensual. It's up to us to find the person who wants to hold the megaphone.\nI wasn't actually the first person they had in mind for the story. They went to the first artist and she said her day job is with a firm that has to work with Chinese companies and she didn't want to lose her job. The second artist they went to lives in a country where the Chinese have a lot of influence. Their life could be in danger if they worked on this story. Eventually they found me.\nThey could've stopped trying to get a Muslim woman or a person of colour who would understand Zumrat's point of view. They kept trying. You will find a person who's going to tell their story if you just look. If you can't find them, perhaps you need to find a different angle.\n",

According to media reports, President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed documents to formally begin the process of incorporating Russian-controlled Luhansk and parts of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia into the Russian Federation after a series of disputed referendums. It effectively provides Moscow a land bridge to Crimea, the peninsula that it annexed in 2014. While Crimea represented the first annexation in Europe since World War II, the latest move represents the biggest such annexation. Together, all five regions make up around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.\n\nWhile Crimea represented the first annexation in Europe since World War II, the latest move represents the biggest such annexation. Together, all five regions make up around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.\nWe condemn the latest annexation and slow Russification of a sovereign country in the strongest terms. Altering borders with brute force is not just a clear violation of international law. It represents the height of absurdity of a war \u2013 now in its eighth month \u2013 that has proven to be detrimental to even faraway countries like Bangladesh. The disruptions caused by the war and the West's response to it \u2013 in the form of heavy banking, trade and commercial sanctions \u2013 led to unprecedented crises in the global supply chain. On the ground, countless people have been killed, injured and displaced. With the Ukrainian forces clawing back wins in recent weeks, and the mass mobilising of Russian forces as a result, along with the threat of using nuclear weapons, things are quickly becoming totally unmanageable.\nThe irony of the latest development is that Putin, at the annexation ceremony in Kremlin, slammed the colonial past of a \"satanist\" West. He said western colonies had carried out genocide, opium wars and plundered states. There is no disputing that. But does it justify his own \"colonisation\" project? He signalled his willingness to continue the battle for a \"greater historical Russia\", using whatever tools he had at his disposal. Ukraine as a sovereign nation must not be a victim of that battle. And the West, on its part, must ensure it does not contribute to it by escalating tensions to a point where such drastic actions find justification.\nThe West, so far, has been an active if unreliable third party in this war, its actions nearly having as much of an effect on the world as the two warring parties. Instead of trying to assuage tensions, it has been a provocateur at times. Its sanctions, aimed at the Russians and Russian interests, have instead caused suffering globally. Clearly, this strategy of aiding Ukraine militarily and punishing Russia economically is not having the desired effect, which only shows the importance of using more judicious means and solutions.\nWe urge the Russian authorities to refrain from their destructive pursuit in Ukraine, and the international community to prepare the ground for de-escalation of tensions. Nothing justifies continuing this war or any illegal takeover of occupied territories. We urge everyone to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions to end this war.\n",

        "full_article": "We are appalled by the latest data on child marriage revealed by the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum. Reportedly, from January to August this year, as many as 2,301 girls fell victim to child marriage in 28 districts of the country. This means an average of 288 child marriages took place per month in those districts alone. During this time, 574 girls were also raped there. Of them, 84 were gang-raped, and 43 had different types of disability. We wonder how the situation has come to this point despite there being government institutions, law enforcement agencies, and various private organisations working to prevent these crimes.\nThe advocacy forum, in its \"Girl Child Situation Monitoring Report-2022\", has also revealed that in the first eight months of the year, 76 girl children were sexually harassed and tortured, 136 fell victim to kidnapping and trafficking, 186 were murdered, and 181 died by suicide. And not only girls, boys are also increasingly becoming victims of sexual abuse around the country. According to another estimate by Ain o Salish Kendra, at least 44 boys were raped during the first nine months of this year.\n\nWhile these findings by different organisations suggest a bleak scenario in terms of women and children's safety, they do not reveal the full picture, however, as they have been collected mostly from national and local dailies. And such crimes are often underreported. \nWhile these findings by different organisations suggest a very bleak situation in terms of safety, they do not reveal the full picture, however, as they have been collected mostly from national and local dailies. And such crimes are often underreported. Unfortunately, we still do not have any comprehensively prepared and updated national-level database on child marriage and violence against women and children. So, how will the government assess the actual reality of problems facing vulnerable sections of society? We urgently need such comprehensive data leading to comprehensive response. What we know from various newspaper reports is that the rate of child marriage has increased manifold during the pandemic, as did school dropout rates of girl children.\nThat being said, we think the government can still do a lot to stop child marriage and violence against children, including boys, based on available data. A number of rights organisations regularly prepare reports on these crimes and violations of human rights. But what is the point of preparing\u00a0reports if appropriate measures are not taken to address these issues?\nThe government must ensure that those involved with the crime of child marriage do not get any patronage from the administrations and local political/social leaders. It must also ensure speedy prosecution of child abuse and rape cases. The National Girl Child Advocacy Forum has called for establishing a separate directorate for children, raising awareness on the issue and proper enforcement of relevant laws to stop child marriage and abuse \u2013 demands that experts made frequently in the past as well. We need strong action now. We urge the government to take these recommendations seriously to improve the safety of women and children.\n",

        "full_article": "The need for taming high inflation in any economy is indisputable. For, it causes pain to general consumers and retards growth. The central banks usually employ measures to reduce/reverse such undesirable effects. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) is also trying to control inflation that has been rising unabatedly since the early part of the current calendar year. As part of that initiative, the BB first raised the policy rate (REPO) by 25 basis points to 5.0 per cent in May and 50 basis points to 5.50 per cent in June. The latest hike of another 25 basis points came into effect on Thursday last. Bangladesh is not the lone country to experience inflationary pressure. It is now more of a global phenomenon. Central banks in Europe and the US Federal Reserve have been hiking interest rates to put a check on inflation. The Fed's move that is designed to tame the inflationary pressure at home has emerged as a serious problem for others, as the greenback has become costlier. The upward revision of the Repo rate is aimed at making the bank credit expensive and, thereby, keeping the money supply in check. But, how far the latest BB measure would be able to meet that objective is difficult to predict. Questions are being raised about the effectiveness of the hike in the Repo rate with the lending rate cap at 9.0 per cent remaining in place. The private sector credit growth trend recorded in recent months only substantiates such scepticism. The volume of credit to private sector increased from 13 per cent to 14.1 per cent between May and August of this year despite the hike in policy rate on a couple of occasions. This has happened because bank credit is cheaper amidst soaring inflation. If banks keep the lending rate unchanged while pursuing a soft approach to loan classification, the policy rate hike is unlikely to deliver results.Monetary policy instruments alone may not work that much in reducing the inflation that is cost-push in nature. The hike in the prices of petroleum products and imported food items have exacerbated the inflationary pressure. So, a few fiscal measures should come in sync with the monetary policy instruments. The volume of imports has gone down in recent months following the increase in LC (letters of credit) margin for not-so-essential goods. The government might consider further tightening of imports. One particular measure --- a sizeable cut in fuel oil prices at home --- might help cut inflation by a big margin. Undeniably, a nearly 50 per cent hike in fuel oil prices has created an unsettling effect on all areas of the economy and put the consumers in serious difficulties. But a downward adjustment will not be that difficult to make since international prices of fuel oils have fallen notably during the past few weeks. The central bank and the government might have to introduce many more fiscal and monetary measures in the coming days if the prediction of a global recession turns out to be true.",

        "full_article": "For financing climate-and environment-friendly sustainable-development projects, green bond is a popular tool across the world. Introduced by the European Investment Bank in 2007 and followed by the Word Bank in 2008, the green bond now boasts a market size of US$1.60 trillion. Green bond is similar to regular bonds of fixed-income debt instruments with a critical difference.It is that the fund raised by issuing a green bond has to be used to finance projects that have a positive impact on the environment. Thus, a green bond is designed to support specific climate-related or environmental projects and may come with tax incentives to attract investors. Though the term 'green bond' is often used interchangeably with 'climate bond' or 'sustainable bond,' there are some differences in these three categories of bonds. Green bond is a broader concept whereas climate bond is 'specifically finance projects that reduce carbon emissions or alleviate the effects of climate change.'Data compiled by Climate Bonds Initiatives, an international organisation working to mobilise global capital for climate action, show that 80 countries have issued 9886 green bonds up till the end of 2021. It means half of the countries in the world have yet to float any green bond.Bangladesh is a late-comer in this arena of finance. So far, two green bonds have been issued by one non-government entity and one government body. The first one was issued in 2021 by Sajid Foundation, an NGO, for fundraising through the Green Zero-Coupon Bond worth Tk 1.0 billion. The goal is to enhance the outreach of its microcredit programme and ensure environmental development. Second one is Beximco Green-Sukuk Al Istisna worth Tk 30.0 billion, also issued last year. The funds generated from the bond will be spent on installing two solar power plants and also expansion of a textile unit.To make the green-bond issuance and management efficient, Bangladesh Bank finally published a 'Policy on Green Bond Financing for Banks and FIs' in the past month. By publishing the policy, the central bank has completed another critical step to make the green financing effective. More than a decade ago, in 2011 to be exact, the central bank issued the Green Banking Policy Guidelines. It was the first significant measure encouraging banks and financial institutions to invest in environment-friendly projects along with adopting green measures.The policy on green-bond financing is important for various reasons. First, it will guide the banks and financial institutions to select and invest in right projects. Banks will not invest in any project that has some elements of environment or climate in name only, but is not really a green or climate-friendly one. Second, it will help the entrepreneurs and state entities to design their green projects carefully. They will avoid packaging any project by adding some components of environment or sustainability to generate fund for other purpose. Third, it will support the government in dealing with climate-change problems.The policy defines green bond as 'a long-term fixed-income securities/instrument to finance or refinance projects or activities which are recognized as green under the Green Bond Taxonomy stipulated in this policy.' The central bank's policy document outlined eight broad sectors under the green-bond taxonomy. These are (i) low-carbon electricity, heating and cooling (ii) green establishments and built environment (iii) energy and resource efficiency in industry (iv) low-carbon transportation (v) circular economy, wastewater, and water management (vi) agriculture and land use (vii) activities to enhance climate resilience not elsewhere classified and (vii) services to support the low-carbon, climate-resilient and green economy. The classification is exhaustive, though overlapping in some cases.Notably, the green- bond taxonomy is 'a classification of economic activities based on some environment-related standardised thresholds that are consistent with the goal of creating a low-carbon, climate- resilient and green economy that might be financed through issuing green bonds.The policy document also outlined procedure of green- bond issuance as well as financing by banks and FIs. In this connection, it has also set a number of eligibility criteria and stressed assessment, verification and certification as well as monitoring, reporting, disclosure and rating.Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), another key regulator of the country's financial sector, has a critical role to make the green bond effective. In fact, banks and financial institutions have to get approval from the BSEC, fulfilling the requirements set by the regulator. BSEC has already defined green bond as debt securities or Islamic Shariah- based Securities (IBS) or Asset Backed Securities (ABS) provided that the money or proceeds of this bond is for investing in a project or company or organisation to make a quantifiable and beneficial impact on climate or environmental.The policy document also provides a matrix of taxonomy of green activities in eight sectors in the form of activity, definition and criteria for green bond. The details will help clarify many questions regarding the selection of eligible sector or area for green bond. For instance, under the low-carbon transport sector, green bond for passenger rail transport can be issued if the trains and passenger coaches have exhaust emissions of less than [50g] CO2e per passenger km; or the passenger transport services are intended to allow a reduction in emissions of [30 per cent] on a passenger-km basis compared to a baseline (i.e. relevant alternative mode of transport in Bangladesh).As Bangladesh is vulnerable to global warming and climate change, the country needs rigorous measures to address the issues. Green financing through green bond will be a handy instrument in this regard. As the policy is now in place, it needs proper implementation to overcome the challenges of climate change successfully.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The tendency to defy restrictive laws in Dhaka city's public places has nearly become chronic to its residents. The scenes of normal road-crossing through the designated places marked on roads and by using foot over-bridges are conspicuous by their absence. Few care to abide by the traffic authorities' impassioned entreaties to follow law. With patience reaching its end, the authorities on occasions resort to on-the-spot fines. This extreme and humiliating measure has also fallen flat. At such a pass of the situation, the residents of the capital may be destined to be known by an apt moniker --- unruly and rustic.A grim aspect of Dhaka's road anarchy is the trend's creeping into the other large cities of the country. Until the recent days, the flouting of traffic rules has been limited to the mega city of Dhaka. Due to its sheer size and choked roads, many incidents of jaywalking used to go undetected. The media people normally focus their lens on a fraction of lawbreaking incidents. It is the weird efforts by pedestrians, especially the grown-up, well-dressed women jaywalking which would catch the lens of the probing cameras. Conventional jaywalking by raising one's arm before a speeding vehicle has become a normal spectacle. But latent derring-do has lately witnessed people scaling concrete or steel-made fences on the medians --- with utter nonchalance. Media photo frames do not fail to show the safe over-bridges just yards away, lying deserted, a handful of people walking by. Lately, the atrocious and unimaginable styles of road-crossings have moved to the overhead flyovers. It's true, reckless bus drivers and conductors drop passengers at critical points, from where they have to take risk-filled attempts to go to the flyover's opposite side. But a normal scene comprises views of terrible attempts at crossing the overhead highways. Flyover authorities have no provisions for allowing people to even walk along any side of them.That the custom of crossing the busy roads in deviant ways would eventually move to the bigger cities outside Dhaka was a foregone conclusion. Jaywalking is purely an urban blight. The waterways do not have to deal with swimmers moving in wrong directions. Boats, private or rented, follow their designated routes. Like seen in Dhaka, the cities fast emerging out of the district or divisional towns have already started witnessing the practice of jaywalking. It's the new metropolitan centres in the country, with the number of vehicles and pedestrians rising fast, which have picked the habit of flouting traffic laws applied to road-crossing. It took Dhaka several decades to turn into a centre of habitual jaywalkers. It's in the early part of the new century that Dhaka first enjoyed the 'benefits' of jaywalking. In the 1960s-70s, the round road-signs in the capital's important parts are still fresh in the memories of many Dhaka dwellers. Those signs asked people not to run while crossing roads. Instead they should walk slowly while crossing a road upon checking vehicles weren't speeding towards their crossing-point. In those days, the two-way traffic movement had yet to be in place in Dhaka.The feature that instantly singles the newly emerged big cities out is their adopting the dreadful jaywalking so soon. It's not that these cities are highly populated. Most of their high-rises are district or sub-divisional offices, the rest being apartments and condominiums. The roads are also free of Dhaka's terribletraffic jams. In such a situation, the style of climbing over a pointed steel-fenced barrier in the mid-road median can be defined as a spillover from Dhaka's jaywalking. This kind of copying Dhaka's ills doesn't bode well for the new city people.Such practices are still rarely encountered in the fast-growing Chattogram metropolitan area.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Online-based freelancing has become a popular career choice for many young people in Bangladesh. The country now earns around 500 million US dollars through this information technology-based sector. But women are noticeably underrepresented in this sector. According to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Division, there are 650,000 freelancers in Bangladesh. Among them, only 9 per cent are female. This is unfortunate because, for many reasons, freelancing can be more feasible for women than any other job. It allows them to perform their household responsibilities alongside their professional work. A woman in our country, compared to men, reportedly spends around two and a half hours more on unpaid care and household work. This hampers women's role as freelancers because freelancing requires prompt communication with clients and replying to their queries, routinely maintaining online profiles and portfolios, and requiring them to be online for a significant amount of time of the day. Burdened with responsibilities, a freelancer mother finds it difficult to maintain both her professional and personal lives simultaneously. Freelancing offers excellent potential for women's employment. But it needs a helpful environment within the family for the women who want to freelance. Besides, arranging training programmes for women can encourage them to take freelancing as their career. Afroza Sheikh, Dania, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
