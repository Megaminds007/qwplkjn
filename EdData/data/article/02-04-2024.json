        "full_article": "Rise in educational cost, according to a study by the Education Watch---a civil society research organisation, by an average of 25 per cent and 51 per cent for primary and secondary students respectively in the first half of 2023 compared to 2022 is a disquieting development. Although it is a sample study, it projects a picture closer to the reality. In 2022, parents had to spend Tk13,828 per head but in the first six months of 2023, the expenditure was Tk8,647. For a class IX student the average annual cost was Tk27,340 in 2022 but in the first six months of 2023, the expenditure shot up to Tk20,712. The expenditures on both primary and secondary students are likely to go up because more students are expected to seek help from private tutors or coaching centres in the second half of the year. Also, under the new education curricula students who are required to sit for examinations will have to submit projects involving some costs. Sure enough, the Covid-19 has thrown education everywhere into turmoil, only more so in this country. But primary education here is largely free. So, why should parents be compelled to spend extra money on tutor and private coaching? The study indicates that the extra expenditure is incurred not only on tuition and coaching but also on guide books and notes. Strangely enough, some teachers including headmasters, like doctors who prescribe medicines of certain pharmaceutical companies for commissions, are also involved in the task of promotion of guides and notes for commissions. It is exactly at this point the lofty objective of education at the primary and secondary levels as envisaged by the new education curriculum runs the risk of falling flat. If the architects themselves misguide their students instead of inspiring them to bring out the best in them, education will never achieve the goal. While such challenges concern the quality of education at the foundational levels, the immediate implications of higher costs of education have proved quite damaging to the overall learning for young learners. Lapses in foundational learning during the pandemic required extra care but that was lacking in the post-Covid time when schools opened. This explains the greater reliance of primary students on tutors and coaching centres. For a few decades lessons at the secondary level have failed to live up to the expectation forcing such reliance on tutors, coaching centres and guide and note books. In the post-pandemic period, primary education also joined the fray. Students of parents unable to bear such extra expenses had to drop out. The study finds that 4.5 per cent and 6.0 per cent of second and sixth graders respectively of 2020 academic year dropped out in 2023. If the total drop-outs are taken into consideration, the number will be staggering.The upshot of all this is that the country is going to lose its educational gains with a large number of children growing up as illiterate or barely literate citizens. About three-fourths of dropped out girls of the secondary level were married off and 41 per cent of primary and 49 per cent secondary level drop-out boys are engaged in child labour. Strangely, 57 per cent primary and 79 per cent of the drop-outs are not interested to return to schools. The policymakers must come out with a comprehensive plan for bringing the dropouts back to education. At the same time education budget has to be raised significantly in order to bring down both direct and indirect educational expenses.",

        "full_article": "The financial sector regulators led by the Bangladesh Bank (BB) must come to terms with their limited capacity for competence and performance relating to the non-banking financial institutions (NBFs). It's not a rant but the NBFI mess is so deep and murky that people have far less confidence in the financial sectors in general as a result. An inevitable perception that financial institutions whether banks or otherwise are not secure and will steal the depositors' money at the first chance is high and trust is gone. And for that the primary regulator, the central bank, has to bear significant responsibility. Is the management of NBFIs by BB adequate is the question.The legacy of the NBFI management has been poor and perhaps the most symbolic mess has been the P.K. Haldar one. Though the authorities have not acted against any of the BB officials, the fact remains that this one single instance is enough to severely damage the confidence in such a regulatory institution. The media has reported several times that the Haldar scam has been a \"joint venture\" between regulator officials and the fraudster. It also goes beyond the financial sector and even law enforcement and politicians have been named. But the inaction by the relevant authorities has deepened the distrust. Today, Haldar is happily in jail in India which, sources say, has ensured the safety of his high level cronies involved in the scam in Bangladesh. Nobody can of course say if it's true or not but given the BB's regulatory record and public perception, most believe this sordid conjecture.  The recent guidelines issued by the BB recently mentioning a variety of issues are worth mentioning. These include default loan recovery targets, criteria over the appointment, reappointment and responsibilities of managing directors and chief executive officers (CEOs) of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) etc. This is not the first set of guidelines published by the central bank. A review of media archives shows that such guidelines have been regularly circulated by it but there is no co-relative evidence to show that it has led to the improvement of performance of NBFIs. Without going too far back, even a little over a month ago, it had issued similar guidelines for managing directors (MDs) and CEOs of banks to ensure good governance and reduce bad debts. This was followed by large loans to certain banks supposed to be in the better books of the authorities. One understands that network conveniences could be at work but then, that doesn't spare the BB either. According to a media report, a total of 12 NBFIs in Bangladesh are running without an MD or CEO and a majority of them have had their top post vacant for more than three months in a clear breach of laws. Apart from the absence of top executives, the sector is reeling from scams, irregularities, a liquidity crunch and the presence of a huge amount of non-performing loans. Soured loans at the 35 NBFIs of the country stood at Tk 21,658 crore (21.658 billion) at the end of September last year, rising by 9 per cent from June in the same year and 25 per cent from that a year ago. The latest amount of bad loans accounted for 29.75 percent of the total outstanding loans of NBFIs at the end of September 2023. No analyst worth their name would call the scenario optimistic. The problem is the regulator is without institutional or public accountability and not held responsible for outcomes. It is said that the BB doesn't have full autonomy as far as decision making is concerned. But it's equally true that they have a weak performance record with the authority they have. The views of the NBFI sector on the BB are also very important. NBFIs, both performing and dysfunctional have set up an outfit to present their common view and position on financial matters called , \"Bangladesh Association of Financial Companies \" with over thirty such outfits are members. Its Vice Chairman, Jowher Rizvi, who chairs the Alliance Finance PLC, one of the few NBFIs with a positive record, said that he welcomes the decision of the BB on the guidelines for appointing CEOs. \"This is a right decision and will significantly ensure better performance at these institutions. It's true that some of them are facing problems regarding appointments of CEOs but we can't ignore the fact that many of the Boards are appointed either by the Bangladesh Bank or the High Court.\" The guidelines state that potential candidates must not have any business interest in the bank and cannot be involved with any association or institution of any director of the NBFI. If the candidate has citizenship of any country other than that of Bangladesh or is in the process of applying for permanent or long-term residency in another country, their detailed information has to be submitted with the central bank.While all these regulations are fine, people's interest are in the safety and security of the deposit they make and those that have suffered as a result of fraud. Mr Rizvi didn't deny that several NBFIs have been very negative performers, but he insisted that the BB must play its proper role as the lender of resort to banks and financial institutions. \" When an NBFIs gets into trouble, BB must step in. They have done so with several banks including massive loans to several shariah based banks. It can't discriminate between banks and NBFIs when it comes to its institutional role.\" The malady in the entire financial sector runs deeper than one can think and BB has become a symbol of that. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "A UN report titled, 'Global Humanitarian Overview 2024,' says hunger is not inevitable, but it is almost always manmade. And the manmade reasons for hunger according that report include armed conflict, economic shocks, climate extremes, poverty and inequality. These are factors that are glaringly obvious to be missed as the causes of global hunger. Armed conflicts alone forced some 117 million people to go hungry in 2022, adds that report. In recent years, extreme weather conditions triggered by climate change have destroyed ecosystems in different parts of the world resulting in lost sources of livelihood for millions. The year 2022, for example, saw 258 million people facing acute food insecurity in 58 countries/territories. Notably, in 2021, 193 million people in 53 countries/territories were food-insecure. That means just within the span of a year, 65 million more (people) lost their livelihoods to join the ranks of the food-insecure. And considering the trend, the outlook for 2023-24 does not seem to be any better. Going by World Food Programme data, 333 million people in 78 countries were acutely food-insecure in 2023. By April 2024, as projected by the report, 18 out of 22 countries/territories are at risk of becoming, what it said, Hunger Hotspots. That is another way of saying that the populations of those places are already facing or going to face severe food insecurity. And such places include the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) with special mention to Gaza, Burkina Faso, Mali, Sudan and South Sudan. Notably, the OPT, especially, Gaza, is a glaring example of how extreme famine condition can be deliberately forced upon a population by another country showing utter disregard to, even contempt of, international law and humanity. And it is also an unprecedented case of the entire world watching, as though, in a state of paralysis as an occupying power uses extreme hunger as a weapon of war against a powerless, unarmed people including children, just-born babies, pregnant women, not to mention millions of others, young or old, just out of hatred. So, how does the world community address this kind of manmade hunger? The past wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia and the ongoing ones in the OPT, Syria and Sudan are deliberately created and are of political in nature. So, solving such instances of food insecurity and famines should be given the highest priority. Now, seeing the helplessness of the UN and its relief agencies before the wrath of an occupying power, question arises as to how in the future the world community is going to address politically-induced food insecurity and hunger.So, addressing the issue of hunger is not as simple as distributing food to the places where hungry people live. International bodies involved in the task would also be required to enhance their political capacity to deliver foods to some hotspots of hunger. Basically, the issue of hunger boils down to people's access to food. True, natural as well as artificially created conditions have been disrupting production of food reducing the amount of food available for humanity. Even so, not a single human being would go hungry, if only people everywhere had due access to the food available in the world. And, as always, it is the distribution system that creates numerous barriers to accessibility of food to the hungry. There is also the issue of food wastage. A UN Environment Programme (UNEP)'s Food Waste Index Report 2024, for example, referring to latest data from 2022 reveals that in that year 1.05 billion tonnes of food went to waste. And 19 per cent of the food available to consumers was lost at the levels of retailers, eateries and households. And even in a low-income country like Bangladesh, a person, on average, wasted 82 kg of food in that year. And, globally, 60 per cent of that food wastage took place at the households. Bangladesh was no exception. Hunger fighters need also to take this wasted food into account. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh has been experiencing relatively steady economic growth, averaging 6 per cent annually over the past decades. This growth has been overly reliant on the country's demographic dividend, which is defined as the temporary boost to productivity and savings potential that occurs when a large share of the population is of working age compared to dependents. With Bangladesh boasting a burgeoning young workforce, the increase in the working-age population has propelled domestic consumption and labour supply for the export sector. Private consumption expenditures have been growing at a rate of 7-8 per cent annually (Bangladesh Bank), driven by this rise in the working-age population.However, Bangladesh is already witnessing a decline as the birth rate has dropped from 6.3 to 2.0 children per woman between 1975 and 2021 (World Bank). Meanwhile, other sources of economic growth remain hindered by systemic inefficiencies in policies, governance, and industries. Job creation has failed to keep pace with population growth, and health and education outcomes are subpar. Furthermore, over-dependence on low-skilled garment exports leaves the economy vulnerable.Without urgent reforms to bolster diversification, enhance skills, promote female participation, and improve the business environment, Bangladesh risks losing its growth advantage within the next decade as demographic transition accelerates. Progress could grind to a halt unless holistic development is taken to nurture demographic factors.\nAbdullah Al FarabiStudent,Department of Accounting and FinanceNorth South University[email\u00a0protected]",
