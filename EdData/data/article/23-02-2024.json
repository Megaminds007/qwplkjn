Space technologies and space flight are expensive, risky endeavours that only national agencies were suited to engage in for decades. This is no longer true as private sector players are increasingly expected to complement, augment, and/or lead the way by identifying market opportunities and innovating rapidly. India started on this path in 2020 with state-led reforms that opened its space sector to private companies, then releasing the \u2018Geospatial Guidelines\u2019 and later the \u2018Indian Space Policy\u2019, creating the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), and passing the Telecommunications Act 2023 that, among other departures from the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, provided for satellite broadband services. On February 21, the government opened the door to 100% foreign direct investments (FDI) in the \u201cmanufacturing of components and systems/sub-systems for satellites, ground segment and user segment\u201d \u2014 up to 74% in satellite-manufacturing, operations, and data products; and up to 49% in launch vehicles, space ports, and their corresponding systems. As such, by stepping out of the way and allowing substantial FDI via the automatic route, the government has taken the logical next step in spurring the contributions of private space flight operators, technology-developers, and application designers to the national space economy, in line with ambitions outlined in the Space Policy.The decision gives India the ability to take advantage of its less vitiated foreign ties to catch up with China\u2019s more advanced position as a space power. While the Chinese programme benefits from not-inconsiderable private sector participation, its ability to attract foreign investments is hamstrung by its belligerent foreign policies and the Xi Jinping administration\u2019s plan to modernise the military by, among other things, adapting civilian technologies for military use, though other countries, including the U.S., have similar policies. According to IN-SPACe chairman Pawan K. Goenka, a \u201csignificant\u201d slice of the $37.1 billion that the space sector raised worldwide in 2021-23 went to space start-ups. Against this extended backdrop, new investments can add to India\u2019s space economy by improving start-ups\u2019 access to talent and capital; effecting a better balance between upstream and downstream opportunities, versus the current skew in favour of the former; boosting local manufacturing; and improving investor confidence. Finally, to sustain these winds of change, the government must keep the regulatory environment clear, reduce red tape, increase public support, and ease Indian companies\u2019 ability to access foreign markets. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nspace programme\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nISRO\n\n/\n\nsatellite technology\n\n/\n\nforeign investment\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\ngovernment",

For years, Navalny was the Kremlin\u2019s most prominent critic. He survived a poisoning attack in 2020 and was taken to Germany for treatment. He later returned to Russia to \u201cfight for freedom\u201d, only to be imprisoned again. The reason for his death is still unknown. After the poison attack, he did have several health problems. His lawyers had complained about his not getting proper treatment in jail and he had staged hunger strikes. His wife Yulia Navalnaya said Mr. Putin \u201ckilled my husband\u201d and vowed to continue his fight. Whatever the reason for his death, the Russian state cannot absolve itself of this tragedy. Russian authorities were hell bent on destroying the political opposition that Navalny had built. In Russia\u2019s managed system, there are opposition parties that the Kremlin tolerates and there are dissidents who are treated as enemies of the state. Navalny, who started his political activism as a far-right ethno-nationalist, fell into the second category. Boris Nemtsov, another opposition politician who also fell into the second category, was shot dead in 2015 in Moscow.President Putin, who effectively has run Russia for 24 years, and has plans to extend it by six more years through this year\u2019s election, did not face any major political threat from Navalny. Mr. Putin\u2019s approval ratings remain high, according to independent polls such as those by the Levada Center. The election fray is tightly managed \u2014 two of the candidates who were critical of the Ukraine war were barred from contesting, while Mr. Putin\u2019s rivals are actually praising his leadership. Navalny was sentenced for decades and there was no scope for organised protests. Still, the fact that he had to die like this in a prison suggests the extent of the state\u2019s fear of voices of dissent. Three of Navalny\u2019s lawyers are in jail, while two others are in exile. By keeping Navalny in jail, the state wanted to send a message to its critics \u2014 fall in line or face the consequences. And Navalny, who chose to go back to Russia even after the poison attack, paid the supreme price for his activism. The Kremlin is centralising more and more powers in its hands, while the country is fighting a prolonged war abroad. The state does not want any voices of criticism or organised protests. It may have established order through fear as of now, but Russia\u2019s own history suggests that this is not a sustainable model of governance. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ndeath\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nmedical conditions\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis",

This year, however, chocolates may have left many romantics with a lighter wallet as cocoa prices hit record highs. But it didn\u2019t deter anyone. This resilient demand signals many business opportunities, including for India\u2019s nascent artisanal chocolate industry.\nAncient stimulant\u00a0| Cacao plants that provide beans that go into making contemporary chocolates have a long history. Olmec, a Mexican civilisation, first domesticated this plant a few thousand years ago. Human love for some form of cocoa is an old story.\n20 degree limit | Global chocolate industry is dominated by the \u201cBig Five\u201d \u2013 Hershey, Mondelez, Mars, Nestle and Ferrero \u2013 with West Africa providing most of the cocoa. Cacao plants grow only 20 degrees north and south of the Equator. Geography has made south Indian states home to unique varieties of cacao. Flavour profiles in India are distinct and the basis of domestic premium chocolates.\n\nSuperfood story\u00a0| Cacao beans are rich in flavanol, which can lower blood pressure. This property has triggered controversial claims about dark chocolate\u2019s medicinal properties. It hasn\u2019t helped that some of the research supporting these claims has been sponsored by the Big Five. But what\u2019s not in dispute is that cacao is rich in nutrients. It makes its downstream products a potential superfood. But the catch is that end products such as chocolates contain other ingredients. Sugar or lowquality oil, for example. Therefore, it\u2019s the combination of ingredients and the manner of processing cacao that holds the key.\nIndia\u2019s opportunity\u00a0| The last decade, an adventurous breed of Indian chocolatiers have transformed locally sourced cacao into artisanal chocolates. Getting the most out of cacao\u2019s nutrients and limiting unhealthy ingredients such as refined sugar have been integral to this journey. They aren\u2019t inexpensive. But that comes with the territory. Vegetable oil, and not cocoa butter, is often used to lower costs in mass market chocolates. But that\u2019s not an ingredient super premium chocolates will use.\nGetting the label right\u00a0| Preserving the nutritional value of cacao depends on the process used to transform it into chocolate. That\u2019s really the key to earning the superfood label. India\u2019s artisanal chocolatiers can get this label without resorting to measures used by the Big Five.\nIndia has a growing consumer base that is discerning and health conscious. These consumers buy brands that promise quality with a certain kind of experience. To attract this consumer base, Indian brands need to zero in on an effective communication strategy. Chocolates sourced and made at home, with unique flavours that appeal to Indian and global taste buds, can do even better. If India\u2019s chocolatiers play their cards well, Indian chocolate brands can become super premium, exportable brands.\n\n",

Once again there is copious addaabout what jobs are threatened, what opportunities opened. But its pitch is less mad, more meditative.\nFearing fear\u00a0| When the first televised presidential debate took place between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960, it was thought a \u201cdangerous\u201d trend. Today politics is so fully video-visual. And surely you wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.

A casual conversational pioneer, Sayani took communication to small talk and good cheer, melodious and seamless. The road to good music was neither bumpy nor ad-jammed. When he first came to us circa Radio Ceylon1952 with \u2018Namaskar, behno aur bhaiyon\u2019, he had us at \u2018namaskar\u2019.\nAn entire generation was hooked to his reverse numeration of hits, all the way back to the number one hit. Just like among the Spotify-iers of today, there was the slow onset of delirium tremens before full-blown St Vitus dance \u2013 the unfortunate after-effects of chartbusters on the listener \u2013 during Sayani\u2019s reign. He came in swaying and toe-tapping via Binaca Geetmala with 30 minutes straight blockbuster songs.

By the time he moved to All India Radio\u2019s Vividh Bharati Service in 1989 his total control over everyone\u2019s eardrums was a scientific fact.\nOn Monday nights after 1998 you could switch on Vividh Bhartiand there he\u2019d be \u2013 and there he stayed till 2000.

All this while looking after toilet soaps Hamam and Jai as brand executive for two years (1960-62), and acting, mostly as an announcer, in films now and then.\nUnlike the current crop of DJs, Sayani could entertain smooth as butter without the slightest hi-tech help or self-important banter. And while he will always be family to a particular generation that idolises Mukesh, Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, RD Burman etc, he also came jauntily at us in the very recent Badrinath ki Dulhaniya, making the younger lot put on their disco shoes and the older lot sniff nostalgically.

        "full_article": "Contract farming that made some tiny ripples around a decade back has resurfaced with renewed interest in it. A FE report says that with the offer of sizable land from an African country, the government is giving a fresh look at farming in foreign soil on contractual arrangements. It was way back in 2010 when for the first time a fact-finding mission visited few countries in West Africa to explore prospects of contract farming. Later, in 2016, there was reportedly another move but despite some progress made, that did not materialise. It has transpired from the FE story, as it quotes foreign ministry sources, that Uganda has agreed to provide Bangladeshi entrepreneurs twenty thousand hectares of land for cultivation purposes. This, according to experts and interested quarters, may lead to further exploration in the field in some other neighbouring countries.Contract farming refers to the practice where agricultural production is carried out on the basis of agreements between farmers and agribusiness firms, typically located in different countries. This arrangement involves farmers producing crops or livestock according to predetermined terms set by the contracting companies. These terms often include specifications on the type of crops to be grown, production techniques, quality standards, pricing, and sometimes even supply of inputs such as seeds and fertilisers. Contract farming abroad can provide numerous benefits, such as access to markets, technology transfer, assured incomes for farmers. However, it also raises concerns about equity in the distribution of benefits. Additionally, contract farming often involves navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions, including issues related to land ownership, money transfer, environmental regulations etc. Cultural and socio-economic factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of contract farming arrangements, with considerations such as land tenure systems, labour practices, and community relationships impacting the success and sustainability of such ventures. Despite these challenges, when implemented transparently and responsibly, contract farming abroad has the potential to contribute to food security, agricultural development, and global economic integration, fostering partnerships that span continents and drive innovation in the agricultural sector. Therefore, careful regulation and monitoring are essential to ensure that contract farming arrangements abroad are fair, equitable, and mutually beneficial for all parties involved.Some South Asian countries, notably India and Pakistan, have begun investing in agricultural ventures in East and West African countries. The allure of guaranteed income, increased employment opportunities for farm labourers, and the abundance of untapped arable land across the African continent serve as primary incentives driving these investments. However, for Bangladesh, the primary challenge lies in navigating win-win negotiations, particularly concerning issues such as securing hassle-free money transfers and ensuring fair employment opportunities for its migrant farm labourers. Bangladesh must address these concerns effectively to capitalise on the potential benefits of agricultural investments. If suitably worked out, these can be a prospective growth driver for the economy.",

        "full_article": "The impression is that the entire area is buzzing with all-round development works. Excavators are digging deep right in the middle of roads to give the sewerage channels depth and breadth under a Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) scheme and the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) has undertaken a task of retrofitting the water lines to households in the area. Piles of excavated concrete and earth dumped on roadsides leave no room for the residents to negotiate and only a makeshift bamboo platform ---thankfully provided by the contractor and his workers---serves as a miniature bridge for them to tiptoe over the gaping holes. The area in question is Mohammadpur where right at the moment as many as 15 roads have been subjected to simultaneous excavation of small to large order. When it is difficult to step out of residential buildings on foot, the question of getting cars on the road is out of question. Development of the sewerage lines and fresh connection of water pipes to residents certainly make sense but undertaking the digging of trench-like channels and holes with the excavated earth and concrete left blocking walking space does not. The street that connects the road from Shia Masjid to Residential Model School on the opposite side to the Mohammad Kendrya College gate stretching from Humayun Road in front of Krishi Market was subjected to such extensive excavation. For more than two months the spree of development works made a hell of life for residents living in the area. Their movement was severely restricted. It was challenging to bring home a sac of rice or bags full of kitchen-market goods.More troubling was the night-time work schedule. Both noise and dust and burnt-out fossil fuel pollution reached intolerable at night. The stinging smell emitting from excavators known locally as vecu machine did make its presence felt in rooms far above the ground. At times the digging impact at dead of night felt like an earthquake. House owners had to wake up all night in order to ensure that the back hoe which is the real name of the excavator did not damage or cause fire by hitting the gas line. Even such caution could not avoid a fire that caused extensive damage to a grocery when the excavator inadvertently uprooted the Titas gas line. Part of the Tajmahal Road, it was carpeted the night before the election day after layers of brick chips and sand were allowed to get set for weeks. Nothing to complain against this but the carpeting certainly leaves much to be desired. There is every chance that with the onset of monsoon when there would be heavy rains, the half-hearted makeshift carpeting will give in, exposing potholes. There is no reason to think that the 15 roads and streets including Iqbal Road, Sher-E-Bangla Road and Sadeq Khan Road that are right now subjected to massive development surgery will meet a fate different from the Tajmahal Road. Notably all these roads had concrete cover done only six to seven years back. They had a life span of 40 to 50 years. What is particularly galling is that the footpaths were in the best of condition with quality patterned ceramic tiles and yet those were demolished only to be replaced by substandard types. In both cases of road carpeting and footpath cover, the work has been below quality. In the process, money has gone down the drain. First, by way of excavation of solid concrete cover and then application of below standard carpeting. The footpaths have suffered the same ignominy. This is, however, not the only example of 'eyewash development' or engineering faux pas. A few months back, the felling of trees for redesigning the median of the road leading from Mohammadpur Bus Stand up to Border Guard Bangladesh headquarters at Jhikatola has exposed what really goes in the name of development at times. There are instances of construction of bridges right in the middle of paddy fields with no road on either side. Then the engineering mismatch with the construction of bridges of lower heights--- including the one at Gabtoli and the railway bridge at Tongi --- on rivers and water bodies around the capital exposes either motivated flaws or naivety. The waterways could not be used for even smaller vessels because of lower heights of those bridges. Without constructing bridges of proper height, the channels cannot be made operational.This is exactly how infrastructure built has to be demolished, reconstructed, redesigned and replaced. All in the name of development! This process involves overlapping at some place whereas crying needs elsewhere for far less costly but highly important ones for public convenience go unheeded. Another customary habit is rescheduling of time for completion of projects, allowing escalation of costs to a staggering amount. If feasibility of a project is determined on the basis of all aspects---open or hidden, it has to be completed on time. There are instances where a few projects the army got the work order for were completed before schedule. The culture of sham development and wastage of money must come to an end.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Thousands of European Union (EU) farmers have been agitating for weeks to press home their varying demands including the availability of fuels and fertilisers at affordable costs, removal of regulatory burden concerning climate change and stopping cheaper import from non-EU countries.  In Poland, angry farmers pelted the EU building with eggs. In Belgium, France, Italy and Germany, farmers in their thousands blocked roads leading to their capitals and busy ports with tractors demonstrating their strong unity to uphold their common cause. They are awfully upset about rising costs of production and falling profits. Thousands of miles away from Europe, farmers in India are on the streets for more than a week to demand guaranteed fair prices. They are now on a march towards Delhi after four rounds of failed talks with the government. But the police, it seems, are determined not to allow the protesting farmers to enter the city. Delhi borders have been reportedly fortified with several layers of barricades and barbed wires to prevent entry. The farmers have threatened that they would push through with heavy machinery such as bulldozers and earthmovers. The police have already fired teargas on farmers at a border crossing between Punjab and Haryana, two major agricultural states of India. Two years back, thousands of Indian farmers organised a sit-in on the edges of New Delhi for over a year against agricultural laws. The government had to repeal the laws concerned in the end. This time at the heart of protests remains the demand for legislation that would guarantee minimum support prices for all farm produce. What the farmers' protests either in the EU or India deliver in the end is difficult to predict now. For the Modi government, the event remains a major headache, because the ruling BJP faces general elections in the coming months. Looking at what the farmers are doing in the EU and neighbouring India to guarantee fair prices for their produce, one has reasons to lament the helplessness of their counterparts in Bangladesh which is until now a predominantly agricultural economy. Despite a constant decline in its share in the country's gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture has kept the economy afloat by a large measure. Except for one or two years, agriculture has been growing at a reasonable rate and employing the largest chunk of the labour force. The stories about the deprivation of the country's farming community have come to the fore again and again. Many more have, perhaps, remained untold, for the farmers do not have a voice in this country. The basic reason is that Bangladesh farmers are not organised. Thus, they are open to exploitation of all sorts. The vast majority of farmers are sharecroppers or owners of small pieces of arable land. Some of the problems they face are identical to those of their Indian counterparts. Then again a few problems are unique and complex. The sad part of the entire episode is that their stories that deserve to be heard by the policymakers go untold. Given the problems they have been facing for ages, Bangladesh farmers were supposed to come to the streets protesting even more frequently than their counterparts in other countries. Instead, they bear with problems such as a hike in prices of diesel and fertilizers now and then, selling their goods at lower prices in the absence of an efficient marketing system for farm produce. Major political parties here have their farmers' wings, but they hardly serve the cause of the peasantry. These wings are manned by urban people and do not maintain any link with farmers at the grassroots. A few left-oriented parties highlight the problems of the peasantry. That far and nothing more. In recent years, some educated youths have taken up farming as a profession. They are the people who possess the knowledge and ability to organise farmers across the country and help press home the just demands of the latter. Will they ever think of taking up that responsibility of giving voice to the country's millions of deprived and exploited farmers?\n[email\u00a0protected]",

While mosquito menace remains low during the winter months, the warming weather creates optimal conditions for their proliferation. As responsible members of our community, it is imperative that we take both direct and indirect measures to mitigate this issue. This entails discarding any stagnant water sources created by discarded items such as flower tubs, tires, and cans, which serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Furthermore, clogged drainage systems and stagnant reservoirs also contribute to the breeding of mosquitoes.Every year, countless lives are lost to mosquito-borne illnesses such as Dengue and Malaria. Shockingly, recent surveys indicate a staggering death toll of 1,697 individuals due to Dengue alone, marking an all-time high in the country. It is essential to implement preventative measures to minimise mortality rates. Ensuring the elimination of standing water around our surroundings is paramount, along with regular maintenance of drainage systems to prevent water stagnation. The key lies in preventing the development of mosquito larvae, requiring proactive efforts from both individuals and local authorities.The local administration must play a proactive role in this endeavour, extending assistance in the form of appropriate insecticides and mosquito control equipment to prevent larval production. As the adage goes, prevention is indeed better than cure. By taking preemptive measures and precautions from the outset, we can significantly reduce both infection and fatality rates of mosquito-borne diseases. The authorities concerned must not sit idle, while mosquitoes are on the prowl.\nAshikujaman SyedMarketing Research Associate,Hebei Huanji Metal Wire Mesh Co.
