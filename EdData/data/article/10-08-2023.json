The curbs were to kick in with immediate effect, rattling the entire supply chain (including shipments in transit) and igniting fears of shortages and price surges, especially ahead of the festive season. The government sought to suggest this was primarily driven by security concerns \u2014 imported devices could be used for surveillance, just as mobile phones could have spyware. It was also a rather blunt nudge for IT hardware producers to set up manufacturing bases in India by tapping a production-linked incentive scheme which has found few takers. But complex PC component value chains cannot crop up overnight, and concerns also flared up about how this may hit India\u2019s software and IT-enabled services export prowess. Sensing a backlash, the government went into damage control, deferring the curbs till November 1 and promising expeditious approvals to licence requests, while Ministers asserted this was not a return to the \u201cLicence Raj\u201d era.Even if import licences will be issued in minutes, as indicated, the entire spectacle is a hark back to the early days of India\u2019s IT industry that was gradually freed up through the 1970s and 1980s, and industry players are likely to remain on edge till the licensing criteria become clear. Would importers need to justify imports of cutting-edge devices, or a software firm need to submit proof of new hires or fresh export orders to secure licences? If PC and tablet imports, which fell almost 28% in 2022-23 to $5.3 billion, are causing security fears because many come from China, the government can mandate testing norms to verify shipments. If the intent is to spur investments, it is difficult to bully global majors into committing large outlays at virtual gunpoint when they have other \u201ceasier to do business\u201d alternatives around the world. Any increase in costs or limitations on device options would also imply collateral damage for India\u2019s consumers. For many households and small enterprises, this is not just about crossing the digital divide but also access to government services increasingly going online in a Digital India. Taken together with some recent policy ploys \u2014 such as the 28% GST on gaming bets, the freeze in prices of \u2018deregulated\u2019 petroleum products \u2014 this development makes for an ominous flashback for investors. Unpredictable policies, excessive taxation and a return to maximum government, can derail India\u2019s reform story.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntrade policy\n\n/\n\nelectronics\n\n/\n\nimports\n\n/\n\nlicensing agreement\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\ntaxes and duties",

This was not a typical peace conference. Russia was not invited, and the main goal of Ukraine and its western partners was to build consensus among major powers, especially in the Global South, on working towards a fair and durable peace. After the talks, diplomats said there was broad acceptance about respecting the central pillars of international law such as Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that there was agreement to meet again. China had stayed away from the Copenhagen conference in June, which was a precursor to the Jeddah talks. But with China\u2019s participation this time, along with India and South Africa \u2014 all countries that maintain good ties with Russia despite the war \u2014 global efforts towards peace have gained much more seriousness. China, in February, had issued a position paper on the war calling for a \u201cpolitical settlement\u201d, where it said the \u201csovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld\u201d, while also backing Russia\u2019s security concerns. Western countries had slammed China\u2019s position, saying it could never be a neutral backer. But today, concerned parties appear to be more pragmatic and want China and India to play a bigger, constructive role in convincing Russia to take the path of talks.Eighteen months after the war began, it is now evident that it has no military solution. Russia has made some advances since last year\u2019s humiliating retreat from Kherson and Kharkiv, but is still far from meeting its objectives, and is struggling to cope with the war\u2019s effects \u2014 from political and economic stability to security issues. Ukraine\u2019s much-awaited counteroffensive which started with advanced western weapons and training, has not achieved any major breakthrough. While Ukraine has shown its capability to strike deep inside Russia with drones, Moscow keeps bombing Ukrainian cities and ports. But the stalemate does not push either side towards talks. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s peace plan, Russia has to withdraw from all occupied territories for talks to begin. Moscow demands recognition of the annexed Ukrainian territories, including regions its military does not control. Amid these maximalist positions, there is hardly any room for direct talks. This is where the international community could make a difference. It should work with Russia and Ukraine to build an agenda for future talks. The coming together of Ukraine\u2019s western backers, neutral developing powers and Russia\u2019s close partners could be the first step in building this consensus. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\npeace negotiations\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nSouth Africa\n\n/\n\nwar\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nSaudi Arabia",

The Kauravs could not get along with their Pandav cousins over who should rule the kingdom of Hastinapur. The supporters of Abu Bakr clashed with the supporters of Ali on the issue of who would be the spiritual successor to the Prophet. More recently, Kukis and Meiteis in Manipur are engaged in a bitter tussle.\nIt is precisely to deal with this wellunderstood human frailty that laws and constitutions were devised. Laws are not written to force people to get along with each other. Rather, they usually provide a way out of the impasse that both sides can live with, even if they can scarcely live with each other. But even for this to work, laws assume a modicum of civility between the hostile parties, a good-faith understanding that the rules of the game would not be changed as the game is being played.

        "full_article": "The debate in Rajya Sabha on Monday over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill witnessed an unusual intervention. Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi while making a case for the bill questioned the basic structure doctrine that limits the legislature\u2019s power to change core features of the Constitution. It\u2019s been noted that this was at odds with his view on the subject when he was a Supreme Court judge. It\u2019s 50 years since the Kesavanada Bharati verdict introduced the basic structure. The pushback however continues.\n\nBasic structure is best understood as a non-negotiable aspect of the checks and balances in a parliamentary democracy. It\u2019s a balancing instrument that works by drawing boundaries. Invocation of basic structure is never abstract. For example, a constitutional bench used it in a verdict delivered in May on the division of powers between GOI and Delhi government. The verdict said that democracy and federalism are a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. How does it work in practice? According to the constitutional bench, a triple chain of accountability is the framework that gives effect to democracy. The chain comprises bureaucracy, a government and a legislature, which emerges after a popular mandate. Consequently, the case went in Delhi government\u2019s favour.\nPolitical parties have not always been accepting of limits on Parliament\u2019s powers to amend the Constitution. In the 1971 general election, two years before the Kesavananda Bharati case, quite a few parties in their manifestos wanted changes that ensured that Parliament\u2019s powers to alter the Constitution wasn\u2019t subject to judicial restraint. However, over time, all major political parties have been supportive of the basic structure doctrine. Over five decades, its essentiality has been accepted by all stakeholders.\nBut there are and will be sceptics. Some of it stems from judicial overreach and the fear that the basic structure can become a cover to enable it. However, notwithstanding odd judgments that may trigger such fears the concept has stood the test of time. The basic structure constraint can also catalyse more insightful parliamentary debates and attempts at bridge building because restraints on exercise of power push parties to create a consensus. Even though Parliament passed the Delhi services bill, the last word on it hasn\u2019t been said. In July, the apex court referred the ordinance, which preceded the Delhi services bill, to a constitutional bench. It remains to be seen if the bill clears the basic structure test.\n\n",

Because of a sustained government push, this has really become the go-to identity document over the past decade. But with Parliament passing the Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill 2023 this week, it has competition coming. This legislation\u2019s key update to the initial 1969 law is enabling the use of the birth certificate as a necessary document for entering educational institutions, voter lists, government jobs\u2026 the list is long, intimidating and open-ended. Getting the certificate will need the Aadhaar numbers of \u201cparents and informant\u201d, getting the Aadhaar number will need the certificate. For the poor who are also data poor, this will mean a vicious exclusionary circle. For richer citizens too, these hurdles will range from inconvenient to torturous.\n\nThe goal of creating a better database of registered births and deaths is unexceptional. But why put new burdens on citizens? Consider in the first place, why does the civil registration system perform differently in different states? Because of differences in governance machinery. Prosperity is also very influential and causes great intra-state variations. In Bihar for example, registrations have been found to be suboptimal even when birth and death occur in health facilities. Bribe demands are also common. Even elsewhere, CRS offices can be too thinly spread, too poorly staffed, and unhelpful. Clearly it is at the government\u2019s end that massive improvements in the registration infrastructure are needed.\nThe legislation will apply prospectively. But even so, lessons from the long Aadhaar experience are clear. The doctrine of proportionality that the Supreme Court used to read down the linking of Aadhaar for purposes other than government benefits and services, should be the touchstone once again.

        "full_article": "How do the monks on ice live magically and produce wonders through detachment from worldly angst?\nHow did \"The Iceman\" Wim Hof run a half marathon above the Arctic Circle, barefoot and in a pair of shorts? How did he also run a full marathon in the Namib desert without even a drop of water, swim underneath ice for 66 metres, and hang at an altitude of 2,000 metres with only one finger?\nThe answers have been pretty straightforward.\nAlexandra David-Neel, a French spiritualist, Buddhist, anarchist, opera singer, and writer from the 19th century, who inspired Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg and died at 101, wrote about the monks and their magic in her 1927 book,\u00a0My Journey to Lhasa. She wrote about the Tibetan monks wearing next to nothing, heating themselves in frigid stone monasteries by day and melting circles in the snow around their bare bodies by night, simply through Tummo, a Buddhist breathing technique and meditation.\nWim Hof, when asked how he ran without water, had only one word to say: \"Breath.\"\nJust how important is breath in our lives?\nDid you know that nasal breathing alone can boost nitric oxide sixfold and help us inhale 18 percent more oxygen? Did you know that one needs to breathe through one's nose only, as the breath inhaled through the mouth is adverse breath (\"Ni Chi\") and contributes to ADHD for it delivers a disturbance of oxygen to the prefrontal cortex, the area which is associated with that disorder? Over the years, Chinese doctors have prescribed 13,500 breaths per day, 9.5 breaths per minute, and Chinese Taoist text from the eighth century AD shared that the nose was the door to the heavens. In fact, the Japanese samurai tested a soldier's readiness by placing a feather under his nostrils while he inhaled and exhaled. If the feather moved, he would be dismissed.\nSimilarly, in philosophy, Jacques Derrida and Friedrich Nietzsche traced the etymology of the word \"breath\" to \"being.\" These two words have a lot in common. Nietzsche believed that being, as a notion, was nothing but vapour, and was only an ethereal result of the sublimation of real things (as explained in\u00a0Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks). Being, truly, was perceived as a nebulous and airy notion, and, therefore, to use the word \"being\" was to give out nothing but \"hot air.\" In the same tradition, these words (being and breath) are both evoked in many ways in Aristotle's\u00a0Metaphysics.\n\n\nWouldn't we all want to breathe forever and never run out of breath? Foreverness is an alluring fantasy that became a material reality with the pipe organ. The pipe organs, figuratively, had lungs and could go on forever. It was an instrument that gave artists and dreamers the chance to necessitate artificial wind supplies of fixed pressures, eventually to defeat the breath of the performer by varying the breath of the instrument. The organ, through its production of a vast mechanism, finally challenged man's ingenuity.\nWhen I was young, my\u00a0Ustadji\u00a0used to prescribe holding my breath on one note for as long as I could. So, every raga, every \"taan\" would test my strength to endure the pressure to impress him. I would eventually fail, leading me to remind him over and over again that, just because whales could hold their breath beyond human endurance and were not restricted by the limits of human lungs, I should not be expected to perform the same feat and that his cruelty ought to end. After all, whales could not cry and I could! To this, he had no ready comebacks, but persisted to pressurise me.\nBut in the true world of art, artists have attempted to attain endless breath to its maximum figurative possibility in music. Yet, no ordinary singer could ever keep the long lines of an unbroken fugue, going without a breath; no ordinary string player could ever articulate this fugue in one movement of the bow. However, amidst all this, a listener might still hear Bach's intrigued meditation on the capacity of the organ, even one blown by hand or by foot, and have a glimpse of transcendence beyond our frail lungs. But that's when we humans need to reconcile with the organs reaching towards realms where breath does not run out.\nIt was either Stravinsky or Berlioz who said that the organ's steady wind was the reason he never wrote music for it: \"the monster never breathes,\" one of them said. Yet, the simple act of switching on an artificially powered blowing system could, perhaps, take one's poetically inclined listeners halfway to heaven.\nIn literature, \"breath\" stands for both life and fragility. King Lear confirms his daughter's death as \"stilled breathing,\" while in Tennyson's poem, Tithonus \u2013 who wasn't entirely human as he was the son of King Laomedon and a water nymph \u2013 seeks mortality from the goddess of dawn, Aurora. In the myth, she kidnapped him and asked Zeus for Tithonus to receive immortality but forgot to stipulate eternal youth. Thus, Tithonus withers away but does not die. It is then that he begs for his breath to end:\n\"Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam\n\nFloats up from those dim fields about the homes\nOf happy men that have the power to die,\nAnd grassy barrows of the happier dead.\nRelease me, and restore me to the ground\u2026\"\nWho do we choose: Ulysses or Tithonus? While I hear many say that they would rather have a short and meaningful life, I openly admit that I want a long and healthy one. After all, wasn't it Jack Lalanne, the fitness guru, who said, \"I can't die. It would ruin my image\"?\nThus, I consciously breathe every morning and routinely become a serious object of wonder and curiosity for those who live in the house with me. When I hold my nostrils alternately and breathe in and breathe out, people around me are often at a loss. It has been reported back to me that they believe that, since I have reached the half peak in my life, I am now enslaved by idiosyncrasies.\nFrankly, I don't mind that perception anymore. I have chosen to go on practising the forgotten art of breathing, and often, also catching my breath in order to have a better perspective. And yes, I do it more these days lest I am pushed to that narrow space where I will be stifled just because I am out of practice. You see, even if our breaths are being modulated and being interrupted and resumed by timed, rhythmic articulation, even if language is nothing but breath, our \"being\" cannot just be a \"flatus vocis,\" a \"voice that is mere air,\" or a voice that is merely breath.\nWe cannot just merely breathe. We must breathe right, in freedom that is both rare and fragile. Failing to breathe in the right air would mean wailing in grief, unlike the whales that breathe longer but cannot cry.\nDr Rubana Huq\u00a0is the current vice-chancellor of Asian University for Women.\n",

Following six days of heavy rains and mountain runoff from upstream, the two roads connecting Bandarban to Chattogram and Rangamati have been completely flooded. As a result, the district has been totally cut off from the rest of the country. And due to its only power substation also getting flooded, people there have been without power since Sunday. On top of that, the mobile network in the district has gone down in most places, effectively cutting off all communications.\n\nRescuers are literally having to go from place to place in search of people stranded by the flood. It is unclear how many people are stuck and in danger. As of writing this editorial, 90 percent of Bandarban city is said to be under water. In most places, the water has not receded for days, while chances of further rain mean that the suffering of residents will continue unabated. One doesn't need a reminder of what catastrophe may unfold in the remote reaches of this border district in the prolonged absence of basic facilities like electricity, food, shelter or any security guarantee. Therefore, the government must launch an all-out effort to rescue and rehabilitate those in danger. All necessary resources and administrative personnel need to be deployed immediately to that end, and to prevent any loss of lives and mitigate the damage.\n\nOn the other hand, it needs to be understood why the district, which did not go under water during heavier rainfalls 15 or so years ago, has been so heavily affected this time around. And the main reason for that has been the environmental damage that has been done in the district. The continuous cutting of hills and removal of stones to pave the way for development have caused the soil to soften and break down. The removal of trees is another massive factor. These have created a situation where flooding has become inevitable. Meanwhile, the lack of dredging and elevation of riverbanks allow river water to easily overflow. And since influential quarters have occupied different canals that are part of the district's drainage system, the overflown water cannot easily escape.\n\nAll of these did not happen overnight. The authorities have, for years, overlooked these facts, which makes them culpable for what is presently happening. Therefore, after tackling this emergency, the authorities need to make substantial changes in Bandarban so that such a disastrous situation does not occur again.\n",

Despite repeated warnings from experts, the health ministry as well as the city corporations have utterly failed to take timely and adequate action, which has proved to be as deadly as the disease itself. The death toll this year has now exceeded 300, and nearly 66,732 people have been infected. Hospitals in the capital have been overwhelmed for weeks, and Shishu Hospital is now turning away children with dengue due to shortage of hospital beds to accommodate the high number of patients. Essential Drugs, the state-owned pharmaceutical company, is rationing supply to public hospitals, unable to meet the high demand for necessary saline due to the unyielding surge in dengue patients, according to a report by this daily.\nEarlier in May, experts had warned that Bangladesh will witness a worse dengue outbreak this year and advised city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads to take preventative measures. Almost a month back, when the death toll was 106, we had urged authorities to declare a health emergency over the dengue surge. Yet, even as late as July 22, the Health Minister undermined the necessity of a public health emergency, stating that, \"Such a situation has not happened yet that we are not able to give beds to the patients in the hospital, [that] we are not able to give medicines.\" How much worse does the situation have to get \u2013 and how many more children must die \u2013 for the authorities to treat the dengue situation with the urgency that it demands?\nIt is high time for the government to form an emergency response committee to combat further disastrous consequences. We urge the authorities concerned to create a centralised command chain with city corporations, the DGHS, and hospital authorities to coordinate their efforts, prioritising hospital management, curbing further spread of the disease through vector-borne disease prevention work, increasing the mobilisation of resources, and increasing the capacity of testing and treatment in all hospitals. We also back experts' recommendations to collaborate with the World Health Organization \u2013 which has been monitoring the situation worldwide \u2013 to learn from neighbouring nations which have successfully controlled the outbreak.\n",

        "full_article": "The country's garment factories have been neglecting their byproduct locally called jhut consisting of assorted rejects such as cut pieces, scraps and remnants. In fact, it has been treated as disposable waste for long. But with the combined negative impacts of global economic recession and a change in Western customers' taste influenced by environmental concerns, the garment waste has suddenly become a valuable byproduct ---one that can be turned into a money spinner through value addition. The fact is, apparel traders did not feel the compulsion of exploring the waste's gainful use when their readymade garment (RMG) products fetched them a hefty profit. Now they discover that the refuse they disposed of rather carelessly is a potential source of their raw materials that can be shaped into finished products with high demand in their export destinations.However, the garment owners and traders are late to respond to this new demand. By this time the allied sub-sector of jhut business has grown from strength to strength. This is only because its importers abroad have been recycling the waste into yarn and fabric for making apparel enjoying preference from foreign customers. The fact is that the cheap refuse or remnant from Bangladesh garment factories finds its way, courtesy of about 300 jhut exporters, to importing countries where it is turned into yarn and clothes which garment factories in this country also imports. This is quite an intriguing situation in which Bangladesh becomes a double loser and the importing countries make a profit taking advantage of the source country's negligence for not considering its own economic interests. Of late, though, local garment factories have become aware of what they are missing in the process and some of them have appealed for stopping jhut export. Of course, jhut exporters are likely to oppose such a move because 20,000-22,000 traders are involved with the business, mainly processing waste in an informal way. Its employment generation for 0.6 million workers and indirect provision for 1.0 million dependants now stands as a thorny issue in case export of jhut is banned. Yet in the interest of the country, it would be wiser to put the RMG waste to far more gainful use. In that case, alternative avenues of employment for the jhut exporters and workers can possibly be created particularly in the plants to be established for making yarn and fabric from RMG discards. When income from greater volumes of apparel exports to the European Union and USA has comparatively declined, here is a sure way of substantially complementing it by way of using the factories' byproducts in a gainful manner. At this business crunch time, innovation and value addition to cheap materials can help any industry stay competitive. Garment factories here produce 4.0-5.0 million tonnes of waste annually and if this volume is recycled for making apparel, as a report carried in the FE quoting entrepreneurs claims, the annual revenue income may be as high as US$6.0 billion. The advantage for the garment factories here is that a few of them have already started manufacturing yarn and fabric. The machines and technology are not particularly sophisticated and beyond procurement. A concerted effort is needed to strengthen this RMG sub-sector for boosting the overall income of the number one foreign exchange earner.",

        "full_article": "There is not much to be happy about the world we inhabit in these times. There are no good reasons to be optimistic about the future, for on that future hang heavy and increasingly thickening clouds of gloom. It is not just particular regions of the globe which cause this feeling of unhappiness to take hold of us. It is an entire planet which is in deep trouble, the very condition which assails all of us in every continent.In Australia, steps have just been taken by a provincial government to rescind rights granted to the aboriginal community not long ago. There will be a review and a revision of the provisions of the move that sought to ensure the place of the aboriginals, Australia's original inhabitants, in the modern scheme of things. And there you have a cause not to be happy about this world. Why must people who have been living in regions for aeons everywhere around the world be pushed into conditions where their sentiments do not matter?You sit back and reflect on the predatory instincts of man towards man. Suddenly you realise, even as you reflect on this Hobbesian condition, that it is our planet which you have put in jeopardy by your thoughtless actions over the past decades and centuries. The temperature of the world's oceans, we have been informed, has been rising. It is now 21 degrees Celsius, which is an ominous reflection of the damage being done to the natural shield which has always protected the earth. The ice shield is breaking down everywhere and no one in government anywhere knows how to prevent this slide into disaster.The warming of the oceans is cause for grave concern and we are already seeing signs of the troubles which lie ahead for us. The irony is that even as we have gone out beyond our world, with the James Webb Space Telescope and other such space vehicles, in our ambition to comprehend the nature of the universe, even as space flights are being promoted by the super-rich in the West, even as a good number of nations have set in place plans to launch spacecraft into outer space, it is space which is shrinking for us on earth. The ubiquity with which forest fires have burnt down nature in places like America's California and Canada as also other places speaks to us of the heat which spreads below the ground, enough to ruin lives and habitats everywhere. People have lost homes, indeed have died. And then imagine the millions, perhaps billions of animals which have perished in all this disaster caused by nations around us. Birds which were around only five years ago have gone missing. Animals which once roamed the earth are, most of them, rare species now. Every assessment will speak to you of the many forms of animal and bird life which have gone extinct.That is as it ought to be, for in these many decades we have done our utmost in ruining the world's forests. Brazil's President Lula understands the plight his country is trapped in. Significant portions of the Amazon forest were wiped clean of trees under the rule of his unenlightened predecessor; and it is now for Lula to recover or restore, if at all he can, what the Amazon has lost. That issue of forests disappearing is not Brazil's alone. It is that of others, including ours here in Bangladesh, where woodlands have been stripped clean of trees and plants and therefore of animal life.Climate change is the priority for governments everywhere these days. But how many of the world's powerful governments responsible for this dire situation are seriously engaged in making their contributions to reversing the bad situation we are all caught in? The less developed or poor nations, those with minimal responsibility for the climate disaster have been bending over backward to do their bit in arresting the decline. But obviously that is not enough. Those countries responsible for polluting the atmosphere look the other way when you ask them to do penance by doing more to correct a situation their actions have caused.We look everywhere for reasons that will light the lamp of hope in our souls about the future of our world. That lamp is yet out of reach. And there are the reasons. Observe the torrential rains which have battered historically dry landscapes like Balochistan's. A region which traditionally has had little rain and much snow and ice in winter must today grapple with rains that wash away the mud huts of the poverty-stricken men and women who live in them. And it is not just Balochistan which must tackle floods but cities and states in the world's prosperous regions. You could call it the new normal. But, frankly, how does one describe occurrences that leave lives ruined, that are an abnormality, as a new normal? When people from Africa, from the Middle East, from Asia take those huge risks of migrating or trying to go out in search of better lives in Europe, you know only too well it is not ambition they are speaking of. Desperation burns in their eyes. They take to rickety boats in the belief that they will happily reach the shores of Europe. Many of these boats capsize; thousands of these men and women, having promised their families back home they will soon be privy to happiness with the money they will send from Greece, Italy, Germany, France and Britain, drown in those raging waters of the sea. And we can do nothing more than grieve.These people in search of a good life are contemptuously called illegal migrants. That makes you think. In a world which belongs to every one of the eight billion-plus global population, space which under the laws of nature should be shared by everyone anywhere and everywhere, these men and women turning their backs on their home countries owing to reasons of poverty and hunger and unemployment are brusquely brushed aside, lodged in tents or ships, made to feel contemptible. European nations once seized the lands of these people, brutalised them into submission for centuries, exploited their resources for generations. And yet when these very people make a reverse journey to the lands of their old colonisers, they become non-people. They will not be allowed to mingle with people whose skins are fairer than theirs. In that rejection of these 'illegal migrants' you smell the odour of subtle racism.It's not a happy world when you arm Ukrainians to the teeth to beat back Putin's Russia. It is a gloomy world when millions of Afghans, abandoned to their fate, go hungry, when their children show the ravages of deprivation. It is tragedy limitless when the Rohingyas do not know if they will ever go back home.We inhabit a blighted, doomed star in the universe. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "It goes without saying that being a BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service) cadre is the most sought-after job in Bangladesh. But it does not come without paying the price. A jobseeker has to go through a lengthy examination process of three to four years to join the civil service. The Bangladesh Public Service Commission (BPSC) that conducts BCS exams has taken around four years to announce the final result of the 41st BCS. The circular of this BCS was published on November 27, 2019 but its final results were published last week. To wait for an exam result for four years is very torturous. Not just the 41st BCS, the story is more or less the same in case of most BCS exams. If job aspirants' health check-up, police verification, publication of gazette and joining their workplaces are taken into account, it takes around five years to complete the entire journey to BCS. The 35th BCS was, however, an exception because it took only one and a half years to complete the whole process of recruitment. Every year, thousands of candidates appear at BCS exam. As many as 346,000 jobseekers, a number that is around 150 times higher than the available posts of 2,390, have sat for the recently-held 45th BCS preliminary exam this year. So, there remains a hard competition among the candidates. With this, the path for BCS aspirants is full of uncertainties as they have to face prolonged delays at every stage of the exam, starting with publishing the circulars to appearing for tests and viva to getting their results. And the long recruitment process, right from the date of issue of notification to the date of declaration of the final results, wastes candidates' prime years besides taking a heavy toll on their physical and mental health. Oftentimes, it is found that university students are committing or attempting suicide out of frustration for not getting their desired job. Once universities in Bangladesh had awful session jams. These days, the problem is greatly reduced and students are graduating in five to six years. But then it takes away three to five years from their lives just to get a suitable job. It is nothing but a waste of youthful energy. The current BPSC chairman, at the start of his tenure, had promised to complete the entire BCS exam process in one year. However, it still takes at least three years to complete one BCS exam cycle. This is hampering the career prospects of the examinees In India, it takes only 14-15 months for an aspirant to get the civil service job. We in Bangladesh should follow the Indian example to conduct this exam and resolve the long recruitment process of BCS. The issue should be addressed seriously considering the ordeal of countless candidates. Also, the government should enhance the capacity of the BPSC so that the lengthy recruitment process of BCS could be avoided. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Most of them, however, can regain clear vision by undergoing treatment. If treated properly, many of them can even lead a normal life. One of the main reasons behind this is that we have a lack of eye specialists and eye care centres. As the number of ophthalmologists, also known as eye specialists, is insufficient in comparison to the number of patients throughout the country, most of the patients do not get proper treatment and suffer from many eye related diseases. There is a government-run institute in Dhaka city from where a handful of eye specialists are coming out every year. But their number must be increased. And for this, we need to set up more institutes across the country so that there are more eye specialists. The government has to take effective steps in this regard. The ministry of health can attract more students to study ophthalmology by introducing scholarships in this sector. To arrange treatment facilities for visually impaired patients, the authorities concerned should establish at least one eye care centre in every district. And these centres should be equipped with all modern amenities for eye care treatment.\nMd Ashraf Hossain,120 Central Bashabo, Dhaka-1214[email\u00a0protected]",
