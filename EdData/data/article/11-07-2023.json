Chandrayaan-3 is largely a replica of its predecessor, Chandrayaan-2, that was launched in July 2019 in the form of an orbiter and a lander (\u2018Vikram\u2019) bearing a rover (\u2018Pragyan\u2019). While the orbiter entered into orbit around the moon, the surface mission failed in September when the lander crashed instead of executing a slow descent. ISRO later identified a problem in the guidance software and unexpected dispersion in the propulsion system during certain phases of the descent. In Chandrayaan-3, the rocket will place the payload in an elliptical orbit around the earth, where a propulsion module will take over and pilot the lander to a circular orbit around the moon. Finally, the lander will detach and begin a series of manoeuvres culminating in a gradual landing (on August 23-24 this year) over the surface. To improve the chances of success at this stage, ISRO has strengthened the lander\u2019s legs, lowered its minimum thrust, enhanced the availability of power, and upgraded the landing sequence.This will be India\u2019s second attempt to soft-land a lander and rover on the lunar surface, and demonstrate end-to-end capability in the relevant technologies. Soft-landing on the moon is a complicated exercise and the possibility of failure exists, even if it may be lower \u2014 yet there is good reason to focus on the consequences of a complete success. The mission will play out with India\u2019s decision to join the Artemis Accords in the backdrop; in this group, if the mission succeeds, the country will be just the second to have soft-landed a rover on the moon. The importance of this feat cannot be overstated: a slew of public and private moon-landing missions is in the works worldwide as the establishment of permanent bases on the natural satellite has emerged as a major geopolitical goal. The Accords define the U.S.-led axis while China and Russia are working on an \u2018International Lunar Research Station\u2019. The success of Chandrayaan-3 will also make it the surface mission closest to the lunar south pole to date, a region of the moon that has been found to be geologically unique and host to spots in permanent shadow. To study these and other features, the mission has six scientific payloads. A seventh instrument, on the propulsion module, will profile the signs of life on earth to help scientists look for similar signs on planets beyond the solar system. Taken together, Chandrayaan-3 offers opportunities for India to lead the world\u2019s response to the moon\u2019s growing importance in the scientific and the political milieus.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nspace programme\n\n/\n\nISRO\n\n/\n\nUSA\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n /\n\nIndia",

        "full_article": "The extent of violence in the West Bengal panchayat elections, though numbing, was not totally unexpected. In all, 36 people lost their lives in the violence that spread across several districts of the State for almost a month in the run-up to the elections; 18 people died on the day of elections, on July 8. Opposition parties had expressed their apprehension that the elections would be marred by violence if proper steps were not taken. Despite several interventions by the Calcutta High Court, which directed the deployment of central forces at all polling booths, the West Bengal State Election Commission failed on several counts. What proved costly was the State Election Commission\u2019s decision to conduct the huge exercise of three-tier rural elections across 61,636 polling booths on a single day, its reluctance to seek central forces, and the subsequent delay in requisitioning forces when directed by the High Court. The central forces arrived late and were deployed in a haphazard manner.Infighting in the ruling Trinamool Congress has also been a major contributor to the violence. Besides this, in places where the Opposition could put up some resistance, there was bitter fighting between the Trinamool Congress on the one side, and the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party on the other. The Trinamool Congress\u2019s dominance on the ground, which remained unquestioned for a decade, is now facing resistance in several places. More than half of those killed in the violence during the elections were supporters of the ruling party. In the panchayat polls in 2018, the Trinamool Congress had won about 34% seats without any contest; this time round, it was about 12%. The control of panchayats helps in political dominance at the local level, and controlling the rural economy. Also, the cadres, who provide the muscle, have a direct stake in the outcome. Elections in West Bengal are rarely peaceful and with two lakh candidates in the fray, the local functionaries did not want to concede any ground. While the State Election Commission was found wanting, the political leadership will also have to take a lot of the blame for allowing the elections to local bodies turn into a matter of life and death. There are also some structural reasons that make grassroots politics so competitive and violent in West Bengal. With high unemployment and scarce activity in the formal sector resulting in extreme competition for political posts, in turn leading to extraction and corruption, the State is caught in a debilitating cycle. The violence and the chaos on Saturday should act as a wake-up call for the State\u2019s political class.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nlocal elections\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress\n\n/ \n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party",

Before 2014-15, the deficit in power supply was at 4. 5%.

        "full_article": "In the last four months, three members of the PM\u2019s economic advisory council have independently expressed concern about the quality of official statistics. The critique of the statistical system is now coming from within the establishment. It\u2019s pertinent because it provides a sense of the challenges of economic policymaking. In the absence of reliable data, policymaking is akin to flying blind.\nIndia has built an impressive structure to capture administrative data by governments that can then be fed into the statistical system.\nHowever, this mode of data collection needs to be complemented by the official statistical system generating primary data through surveys to fill the gaps. It\u2019s the survey data, where our statistical system was a pioneer in the 1950s, that has proved to be problematic. Unless this challenge is addressed urgently, we run the risk of opting for wrong policies not because the future is unknowable, but because past data is unreliable.\nThere are two main problems today with the statistical system.\nOne, timetables to generate primary data are not followed rigorously. The most serious of these is the indefinite delay in the Census. It\u2019s unprecedented and has left a big hole in the data system. There are also delays in the consumer expenditure survey and the economic census. Among critical measures affected by these delays are the monthly inflation readings and the GDP data. Two, there are complaints from the users about the quality of data. Put together, delays and doubts about quality have left India data poor. None of these problems is of recent origin. They have been building up over time.\nA National Statistical Commission was constituted in 2006 as an apex body for statistical activities and to set standards. It was meant to be empowered by legislation. Seventeen years later, the legislation hasn\u2019t been passed and the official statistical system at both Centre and states is in trouble. Among the in-house recommendations to empower NSC was one that wanted its members picked through a committee represented by a wide spectrum of parliamentarians. It\u2019s essential to insulate the statistical system from charges of political bias. A mechanism to ensure financial autonomy was also suggested. These suggestions remain valid. An upgrade to the statistical system has to be overseen by a technically equipped body that has statutory powers. Reliable data is an essential need.\n\n",

Presumably, the Delhi CM would advise all young Indians to do the same. He would be wrong, for multiple reasons. People, young or old, students or professionals or the wealthy, leave their country usually to take advantage of opportunities either not available or not sufficiently available in their own country. Migrating or studying abroad is not costless \u2013 that many undertake this journey obviously means in their perception the cost-benefit analysis works out. So, politicians, if they are worried about good students leaving India, should look to alter this cost-benefit analysis.\nThat involves many things, including improving the supply of quality education and a more enabling economic environment. That this can be done has been proved in part by Kejriwal\u2019s government itself, which substantially improved the quality of education in Delhi\u2019s government schools. And that an altered cost-benefit equation reduces the flow of students going out is evident from one of the best education institutes in the country \u2013 as a TOI story on Sunday showed, the number of IIT Bombay computer science graduates who leave for the US has dropped sharply, because many are now becoming tech entrepreneurs in India\u2019s vibrant startup ecosystem.\nSeparately, and Kejriwal must know this already, Indians abroad, whether students or professionals or entrepreneurs, are an asset for India. The diaspora improves the optics for India, it speaks for India, and it\u2019s a source of investment and ideas. If any of those Delhi government school students Kejriwal spoke to pursue further education abroad, they will be part of that beneficial collective. \u201cWork for the country,\u201d seems like a noble thought, a good advice, but it lacks any substantive meaning for young people making life decisions.

        "full_article": "Of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system, Mercury, Venus and Mars are dead balls of rock. That is, they are either too hot or too cold to support life in any form. Earth is the only planet in the Goldilocks zone, or habitable zone, with liquid water and a temperature range conducive to human life, along with a cornucopia of boisterous wildlife slithering, scampering, soaring, swimming, and galloping.\nUnfortunately, the planet is slowly but surely moving into an unfamiliar, nightmarish territory because of human activities. In the last few years, extreme heat has besieged both hemispheres of our planet even before the official start of summer. And this year, in early July, some regions in the northern hemisphere felt like a blast furnace. Courtesy of climate change, global average temperatures climbed to a record high of 17.23 degrees Celsius on July 4, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, surpassing the previous daily record by 0.31 degrees set on August 14, 2016. The 2016 high coincided with El Nino conditions, a cyclical weather pattern caused by the warming of the waters in the Pacific Ocean, oscillating back and forth every two to seven years.\nWhile an average temperature in the high teens may sound low, it should be noted that the estimate of daily global temperature encompasses the entire planet, including Antarctica where the average temperature in July (winter) varies between negative 56 degrees (daytime) and negative 63 degrees (nighttime).\nAlthough 17.23 degrees is an average, parts of the globe, particularly Northern Mexico, a large swath of Europe and the United States, and many more places felt the extra heat more severely, with heat index pushing temperatures well into the mid-40s zone. For example, residents of the city of Hermosillo in northwestern Mexico endured a scorching temperature of 49.5 degrees. Searing temperatures swept through the rest of the country, too. Northern Africa saw temperatures near 50 degrees, while China is trying to cope with temperatures over 40 degrees.\nIn the US, a long-lasting intense heatwave spawned by a heat dome is baking Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California, with highs between 41 and 46 degrees. Meanwhile, residents of South Florida are bracing for an oppressive heatwave that is expected to trigger life-threatening conditions.\nThe spike in temperatures is occurring after only 1.1 degrees of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. Forecasters are warning that, sooner than later, the Earth could be entering a multiyear period of extreme heatwaves, driven primarily by two factors: 1) continued emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases (GHG), mainly due to humans burning fossil fuels; and 2) return of the El Nino after a seven-year hiatus. As the global average temperature rises, heatwaves will become more severe, more frequent, and longer-lasting, propelling the Earth's climate into an uncharted domain.\nUnder the worst-case-scenario models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that by the year 2100, Earth's climate may look like the climate of the early Eocene Epoch 56-34 million years ago. It was one of the warmest intervals of the last 56 million years, with mean global surface temperatures being over 14 degrees warmer than present. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were greater than 1,000 parts per million (ppm). By comparison, the current level is roughly 424 ppm.\nWhat is our way out of the climate change conundrum? How do we stop climate change from rolling ahead in overdrive? We do not have many options on the table, because we cannot solve the problems arising from climate change using the same mindset we had when we created them. Consequently, we should stop adopting unenforceable resolutions at conferences, and instead act without any further delay to achieve net-zero emission of GHGs. This means going cold turkey, drastically reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and implementing geoengineering \u2013 human's planned measures \u2013 to reverse or forestall some of the adverse effects of climate change by manipulating Earth's climate system.\n\nEarth is slowly but surely moving into an unfamiliar, nightmarish territory because of human activities. In the last few years, extreme heat has besieged both hemispheres of our planet even before the official start of summer. And this year, in early July, some regions in the northern hemisphere felt like a blast furnace. Courtesy of climate change, global average temperatures climbed to a record high of 17.23 degrees Celsius on July 4.\nIn fact, the US and the EU are taking cautious steps towards geoengineering. On June 30 this year, the Biden administration released a report mandated by Congress in a 2022 appropriations bill, outlining a potential research programme primarily focused on solar radiation management (SRM). The report presents an overview of the possibility of an SRM research programme in the US. It indicates that even if the government does not choose to pursue the programme, the blueprint would prove instructive in case another country is interested in pursuing it.\nHowever, the report does not compare the risks of SRM with the benefits. Rather, it recognises that SRM has its downsides that outweigh the continued, worsening effects of climate change. An article, written by me, discussing the pros and cons of SRM was published in this newspaper on September 16, 2019.\nAlthough the prospect of cooling the Earth using SRM seems real and feasible, unease surrounds the questions pertaining to ethics, costs and benefits, limitations, and risks. More importantly, since there is currently no international governing structure to oversee such work, critics believe that within a political context, SRM has the risk of \"reckless pursuit of self-interest\" by rogue leaders on the world stage.\nNevertheless, the report addresses many of the governance issues, without prejudging any future decisions on whether or not SRM should be deployed. The European Commission is thus calling for high-level talks on how to govern research and the potential use of SRM.\nFinally, whether we adopt SRM or not, there is precedent for success in tackling some of the pressing issues facing us. In the 1980s and 1990s, when we learnt that human-produced chemicals known as CFCs were causing great damage to the ozone layer that protects us from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, nations around the world agreed on a series of treaties that ultimately phased those chemicals out of production. As a result, the ozone layer began to recover from earlier damage. This shows that we can indeed be moved to act in the face of threats to our survival, as well as threats to the planet that we call our home.\n\u00a0\nDr Quamrul Haider\u00a0is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.\n\n",

Ominously, we are yet to reach the peak \u2013 which might be in the August-September period \u2013 when things are expected to get worse. The miserable scenes of hundreds of dengue patients lying on hospital floors, waiting to be treated, give an idea of just how bad the situation already is. We must ask: why has a seasonal and totally manageable outbreak been allowed to go out of control? What steps, if any, have the health ministry and city corporations taken to pre-empt it?\nReportedly, Dhaka has around 60 percent of all dengue cases recorded in Bangladesh. It took several directives from the High Court to get the two city corporations to wake up and take preventive measures. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late by then. It is unfathomable that the city corporations did not start spraying insecticides months earlier to ensure that the larvae of Aedes mosquitoes were destroyed before they could spawn. Residents of many areas have reported not witnessing cleaning drives and regular spraying.\u00a0Ironically, we apparently have a mosquito control department that has played little to no role in the fight against dengue. Why hasn't it been made effective given the gravity of the present crisis?\nAnd what about the effectiveness of the insecticides used to kill Aedes mosquitoes? According to an icddr,b study released in May 2018, these mosquitoes have become resistant to regular insecticides. Have the city corporations brought new varieties of insecticides that would be effective against the dengue virus? There is still little confidence in the ability of the relevant authorities to tackle this severe public health threat.\nIt goes without saying that we must all work together for any success in controlling this epidemic. We hope that the government's guidelines for schools and colleges will be rigorously enforced. Care must be taken to regularly clean playgrounds and remove stagnant water from buildings. The authorities must make sure there is no stagnant water anywhere. Awareness programmes for students and residents in general are vital. The government also must conduct cleaning/spraying drives regularly, and expand the capacity of hospitals to accommodate the influx of dengue patients.\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's banking sector continues to be burdened with default loans, in the absence of any bold or robust counter measures by the government for several years. Instead, good policies have been replaced with bad ones to favour defaulters and empower bank directors. It seems there exists a nexus among the policymakers, bank directors, and defaulters which facilitates the process of swindling depositors' money.\nAs a condition to avail a $4.7 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the banking sector has to go through reforms to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) and improve the governance of the sector. The government agreed to comply with the IMF conditionalities in the face of deteriorating forex reserves. However, it seems the bank directors can influence the policymakers to ignore the IMF conditionalities, even though there is no visible improvement in the bleeding foreign currency reserves.\nOn June 22, 2023, the Bank Company Act (Amendment) 2023 was passed in the national parliament. The amended bill includes some measures against loan defaulters. For example, it says that habitual defaulters will not be allowed to run businesses and travel abroad. Banks have to periodically send the list of wilful defaulters to the Bangladesh Bank. The banks will also have to publish a list of wilful defaulters on their respective websites and in newspapers. While these are positive moves, the proper implementation of these measures could be challenging in the current context, where powerful individuals get away scot-free while the powerless pay the price and suffer.\nAs opposed to these positive declarations, some changes in the amended Bank Company Act make it more regressive than its existing form. One may recall that the Bank Company Act 1991 has gone through several amendments for the wrong motives and thus has been damaging for the governance of banks. In the Bank Company (Amendment) Bill 2018, the tenure of directors of private banks was increased from six to nine years, and the number of family members allowed to be appointed in private banks increased from two to four. In 2003, the tenure of directors was made open, removing the bar of six years. Later, in 2013, the amended Banking Company Act brought down the tenure of board directors to six years. Also, the number of appointed family members was limited to two, with a view to curtail the dominance of family members and maintain corporate discipline. However, the 2018 amendment expanded the scope of family ownership in banks, enabling up to four members to exercise increased control. This modification poses a risk to corporate governance. In the amended Bank Company Act 2023, the number of family members is reduced from four persons per family to three, which is still more than the original rule of two members per family.\nMoreover, this amended bill makes a very important change that will deteriorate the governance of the banking sector. The tenure of bank directors was raised from nine years to 12 years. Thus, directors can now stay on boards for another 12 years even if they have already served almost nine years,\u00a0since their tenure will be counted anew from the implementation year of the amended Banking Company Act 2023. Moreover, to be on the board, directors need to wait only three years after completion of a 12-year tenure.\nStrangely, this amendment to the tenure of bank directors was not in the original draft prepared by the Bangladesh Bank. Passing such an important change in the banking act without any proposal from the central bank, and without any discussion in the national parliament by the public representatives, is unprecedented. This simply reflects the power of bank directors, some of whom are also connected to banks and have an active interest in approving biased and weak policies.\nOften, large volumes of loans are given to certain groups, in violation of the rules. Hence, Bangladesh's banking sector has experienced incidences of loan fraud from many business groups and individuals. Irregularities in several banks, such as BASIC Bank, Sonali Bank, Janata Bank, and Farmers Bank led to the syphoning of huge volumes of depositors' money by borrowers, who were given leeway by the banks. A recent audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of Bangladesh unearthed several serious irregularities in the state-owned Janata Bank during 2015-2020.\nThe banking sector now finds itself in a precarious situation, saddled with a multitude of irregularities and scams which has led to a fragile state of affairs. Unfortunately, the authorities have shown a lack of proactivity in addressing these issues and establishing discipline within the financial sector. The persistence of loan defaulting and the ongoing misappropriation of bank funds is a concerning indication of the government's indifference towards tackling this problem. As a result, the number of NPLs continues to increase. Based on Bangladesh Bank's annual reports, NPLs in the banking sector amounted to Tk 22,480 crore in 2009. However, as of March 2023, the NPL amount significantly increased to Tk 1,31,621 crore.\nWhen considering various factors such as write-offs, funds involved in legal proceedings, and the rescheduling of special mention accounts, the actual magnitude of NPLs may be considerably greater.\nIn the past, some reforms were undertaken, particularly under the auspices of the World Bank and the IMF. However, once these programmes are over, the sector starts sliding back. Unless the urge to change comes from within the government, such measures (taken in a piecemeal fashion) will not be sustainable. The government only comes forward to rescue banks when they face serious capital shortage. But recapitalisation of state-owned banks by the government has not improved the capital adequacy situation of these banks. The government also tried to salvage the troubled private banks, but no discernible success has been achieved.\nTherefore, without meaningful reforms, the banking sector cannot play its role as a source of resources for private investors. Stronger internal control and skilled human resources within banks are crucial. Reform of the judicial process is needed. In order to expedite the recovery process for default loans, special tribunals can be set up for swift and efficient resolution. It is essential to increase the number of judges handling cases under the Money Loan Court Act 2003 and the Bankruptcy Act 1997. Most importantly, board members at banks should be independent and selected based on their professional excellence and experience, not their political allegiance.\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue and non-resident fellow of the Atlantic Council.

        "full_article": "It is alarming to know that dengue has spread to 57 districts of the country, with the highest numbers of deaths and hospitalisations recorded up until this time of the year. Ominously, we are yet to reach the peak \u2013 which might be in the August-September period \u2013 when things are expected to get worse. The miserable scenes of hundreds of dengue patients lying on hospital floors, waiting to be treated, give an idea of just how bad the situation already is. We must ask: why has a seasonal and totally manageable outbreak been allowed to go out of control? What steps, if any, have the health ministry and city corporations taken to pre-empt it?\nReportedly, Dhaka has around 60 percent of all dengue cases recorded in Bangladesh. It took several directives from the High Court to get the two city corporations to wake up and take preventive measures. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late by then. It is unfathomable that the city corporations did not start spraying insecticides months earlier to ensure that the larvae of Aedes mosquitoes were destroyed before they could spawn. Residents of many areas have reported not witnessing cleaning drives and regular spraying.\u00a0Ironically, we apparently have a mosquito control department that has played little to no role in the fight against dengue. Why hasn't it been made effective given the gravity of the present crisis?\nAnd what about the effectiveness of the insecticides used to kill Aedes mosquitoes? According to an icddr,b study released in May 2018, these mosquitoes have become resistant to regular insecticides. Have the city corporations brought new varieties of insecticides that would be effective against the dengue virus? There is still little confidence in the ability of the relevant authorities to tackle this severe public health threat.\nIt goes without saying that we must all work together for any success in controlling this epidemic. We hope that the government's guidelines for schools and colleges will be rigorously enforced. Care must be taken to regularly clean playgrounds and remove stagnant water from buildings. The authorities must make sure there is no stagnant water anywhere. Awareness programmes for students and residents in general are vital. The government also must conduct cleaning/spraying drives regularly, and expand the capacity of hospitals to accommodate the influx of dengue patients.\n",

        "full_article": "Hardly a week after the construction of a road in Faridpur's Sadar upazila, parts of it reportedly collapsed. This was the subject of a report published by this daily on Sunday. Such incidents, unfortunately, are getting too frequent for them to be considered \"isolated\", thus revealing a pattern of mismanagement and lax quality control in the development projects undertaken by the government. In the Faridpur case, cracks were seen in at least eight locations along the 800-metre portion of the road in question, which was completed on June 21. The total budget for the two-kilometre road project is over Tk 2.17 crore, which means that nearly 40 percent of the fund has been wasted on a shoddy construction work.\nIs it any surprise that the collapse is being linked to the use of low-quality construction materials and lax monitoring by the relevant authorities? As usual, when asked, they sought to shirk their responsibility by blaming heavy rainfall and sandy soil underneath the road for its damage. One cannot help but wonder why these very predictable factors were not taken into consideration before or during the construction.\nThe Faridpur incident reminds us of a bridge in Tangail, built at a cost of Tk 54 lakh, which had tilted even before it could be inaugurated and was then left in that state for five years. Or think about when, in March last year, a road in Kishoreganj was found damaged just a week after its construction. This trend of shoddy construction shines a bright light on our current development policy which is often marked by poor planning, rampant corruption, lack of monitoring and accountability. We have frequently raised our concerns in this regard in the past.\nWe urge the LGED authorities in Faridpur to immediately undertake repairs to make the road operational and ensure that the responsible contractor is brought to book. Such questionable practices undermine the purpose of development and rather increase public suffering. Quality control is a vital part of any construction project, and must be treated as such by all stakeholders.\n",

        "full_article": "The Office of Textile and Apparel (OTEXA), an affiliate of the US Department of Commerce has bad news for Bangladesh. The single largest destination---the United States of America that is---of the single largest foreign exchange earner for Bangladesh, readymade garments (RMG) has recorded a significant drop in apparel demand during the first five months of this year. Consequently, apparel export from Bangladesh witnessed a 19.16 per cent fall from US$4.09 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year to US$3.30 billion this year. In fact, a global slump in RMG business is on right now. European market, the second largest export destination of Bangladesh, is also witnessing a similar sluggish demand for RMG. Now the question is, if the slump will linger long or it is just a temporary phase that most businesses often go through. In the Western world, Christmas and the New Year is the time for apparel business bonanza. Buyers should place order for the two great festivals soon. If it does not happen, that surely will be a cause for serious concern.However, amid the gloomy business regime, Bangladesh has some reasons to cheer up. All its competitors including the main ones --- China and Vietnam ---have recorded negative growth in apparel export to the US at a far higher rate. For China the export slump is 30.44 per cent and for Vietnam it is 28.07 per cent. Similarly Cambodia's export fell by 34.42 per cent while India's by 20.80 per cent. Against the steep decline in export by the major exporters of apparel, Bangladesh's is the lowest. On this count, Bangladesh has enough reasons to be satisfied. But looked from a pragmatically analysed economic point of view, the satisfaction hardly takes time to turn into gloom. Why? China and India are not dependent solely on foreign exchange earned from apparel. Particularly, Chinese export is varied and myriad in nature. India comes next. Even Vietnam's top foreign exchange earner is not apparel. Its broadcasting equipment including telephones, cell phones, integrated circuits tops the list on this head. Its food and beverage processing is the largest industrial sector there. Contrary to such diversified export baskets, Bangladesh has few export earners. What is particularly galling is a lack of initiative and seriousness to develop the few industries with tremendous potential for fetching foreign exchange. These are leather and leather goods, pharmaceutical industries and food processing. With its increased production of fruits, processed pulp and beverage could earn a lot of foreign exchange. The information and technology sector is yet another potential candidate for exploitation of dividends.Unfortunately, notwithstanding the danger of overdependence on a single item of export, the policymakers are concentrating more on its development than the potentially higher earning sectors. Although RMG has its backward linkage sectors developed to a great extent, it still is mainly a service sector depending on cheap labour. It has miles to go before it can effectively compete with China in terms of production of the high-end products. Apparel is based on trends of fashion. It is unwise to depend on it for earning foreign exchange eternally. The export basket must be diversified as multifariously as possible.",

        "full_article": "Amid the countrywide campaigns for tree plantation and social forestry, few think of the reverse aspects of these advocacy-based drives. These trees generally grow in the form of invasive foreign plants, a branch of the invasive alien species (IAS). The broader group includes mostly plants, animals and pathogens. These organisms are foreign to an ecosystem and are potently harmful to the environment of a country. They also have the capability to leave adverse impacts on human health. Coming to the invasive alien plants, many feel tempted to recall the heated debates sparked by eucalyptus tree plantation in Bangladesh and elsewhere. Those occurred decades ago. Eucalyptus is now viewed as one of the highly invasive trees in the world. Thanks to a well-orchestrated campaign by environmentalists, the trend of growing eucalyptus eventually fizzled out.Another plant species called ipil-ipil made news in Bangladesh in the 1980s. Experts didn't waste time to declare that the tree renders its surrounding land unusable. They were of the opinion that ipil-ipil reduces species diversity, wiping out native species. As has been noted by a section of botanists, harmful exotic plant species have long been found lurking amid the centuries-old indigenous trees of the country. Few tree-lovers and cultivators have the special knowledge and capability to single out these alien trees. A study conducted by the environment and foreign ministry has recently located a total of 44 exotic plant species in the country's protected areas. It has also identified 17 plant species under the category of 'foreign invasive plants' in the nationally protected forests. Amid the ongoing enthusiasm over social forestry and similar other tree plantation programmes, the infiltration made by invasive plants emerges as a potential threat. The presence and fast expansion of these alien trees has been a well-known fact; but the distressing truth about them is the common people's inability to identify them. Meanwhile, the alien trees continued to wreak havoc on the trees grown in special zones like protected areas. Thanks to the vastness of the reserve forests and vigilance carried out by numerous specialists and volunteers, the country's forests couldn't be encroached on by the invasive foreign plants.Many of the IAS plants enter a country as part of an age-old natural process. The theory is contrary to the concept of deliberate human efforts to inflict damage on the flora and fauna of a targeted country. There has yet to be any concrete proof of applying biological weapons by any country against a hostile one. This strategy used as an act of sabotage, was first adopted by Germany during WW-I. However, biological wars are a staple for today's sci-fi movies. Yet few can assert that Bangladesh has the ability to rest assured over the fact that its reserve forests and the naturally grown woodlands are free from the machinations hatched by illegal loggers. They can smuggle into the country the saplings or seeds of IAS plants to grow them into logs. They cannot be expected to feel worried about the great harm to be done to the country's forest resources by the alien trees. In this regard, a biodiversity conservation researcher observes that alien species have the ability to compete with the indigenous species in the protected forests, change the ecosystem and disrupt the food chain. He recommends taking advanced measures, including early detection and screening of foreign plants. The expert came down hard on a section of quarters behind some government afforestation ventures. He holds them responsible for the increasing number of foreign invasive plant species. The expert singles out the Madhupur Saal Forest in Tangail as an example where some foreign invasive plants have been introduced. The forest has been largely damaged by the entry of those species. The mangrove forest of the Sundarbans has long emerged as one highly vulnerable to the insidious assaults of invasive foreign plant species. The workings of invasive alien plants are quite unique. These species are those that are introduced into new areas. Once there, those are able to adapt, become established, and reproduce and spread, colonising new areas, explains Encyclopedia Britannica. Elaborating on the process, it says invasive species, like any non-native plants, significantly modifies or disrupts the ecosystems they colonise. Many query about the way in which these species change places. The answer is they may arrive in a new area through natural migration. But they are often introduced by the activities of other species. Human activities, such as those involved in global commerce, are considered to be the most common ways in which invasive plants, microbes and other organisms are transported to new habitats. Some of these species may become invasive when they possess a built-in competitive advantage over native species in the invaded areas. The ecological disruption that tends to follow such invasions often reduces the ecosystem's biodiversity and causes economic harm to people who depend on the ecosystem's biological resources. Contrary to some common myths, the invasions of alien species have no deliberate human involvement. But many deny it. An ecology and biodiversity conservation researcher demands that the relevant authorities make probes into what is the origin of IAS plants identified in the protected areas and who are behind bringing those into a country. Experts are unanimous on the fact that local plants cannot grow properly beneath the alien ones as they prevent the native plants from absorbing nutrients from soil. Given a plethora of grim realities vis-\u00e0-vis the increasing encroachment on native flora reserves by alien plant species, there is strong logic in favour of stringent measures for saving the country's plant resources.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The incident of Zahid Pramanik, a peasant of the Pangsha upazila in Rajbari district, being bitten by a Russel's viper (the snake's Bengali name is Chadrabora) and then saved following treatment at a Kushtia hospital, was recently reported in the print media. However, such reports of snakebite, especially by this particular type of snake, have drawn the attention of many. This is despite the fact that snakebite is a common experience in Bangladesh and, according to recently released study findings, every year more than 400,000 people are bitten by snakes and, of them, over 75,000 cases are fatal. And the victims are mostly village people. However, most village people are familiar with the local varieties of snake. But this particular type of snake, the Russel's viper, had so far been extremely rare in Bangladesh. In the neighbouring India about half of all the snakebites are attributable to Russel's viper, whose zoological name is Daboia russelii, a very a deadly variety. Bangladesh National Guideline for Management of Snakebite says that there are about 100 species of snake in Bangladesh, of which 37 are venomous. They include sea snakes, cobras, kraits and six types of Pit viper and one Russel's viper.In fact, this particular kind of snake (Russel's viper or Chandrabora) has faded from public memory in this part of the world for over a century. Small wonder that the peasant, Pramanik, of Pangsha, could not recognise the snake. And thanks to his presence of mind that he brought with him the dead snake (which he killed after it bit him) to hospital. Otherwise, the doctors would not be able to apply the correct antivenom to treat his condition as our hospitals lack the facility to conduct serology test for snake venoms to identify their type and origin. So, the Kushtia hospital doctor could give proper treatment to save Pramanik's life. According to ophiologists, an adult Russel's viper is about five feet long. But the one that attacked Pramank was rather small. So, it might well be a viper hatchling. But then why is this sudden surge in the number of snakebites from Russel's viper? The victims are mostly people working in the fields. In Pramanik's case, he was working in a jute field. Experts believe, this particular variety of snake, which somehow migrated from neigbouring India during the monsoon floods, has been growing in number in Bangladesh. And with most natural snake habitats being destroyed through deforestation and agricultural lands, these snakes have now made the crop fields their breeding grounds. That is also convenient for them because their favourite prey, rats, feed on crops and prefer to live in the farmlands.So, unless urgent measures are taken to destroy the new breeding grounds of Russel's viper, the village people, the peasants, in particular, will be exposed to the danger of more frequent deadly snakebites. The problem has been further compounded by the absence of arrangements to treat snakebite victims at the upazila-level public hospitals. Pramanik's experience is a case in point as the Pangsha upazila hospital failed to come to his aid. And it is not the upazila-level hospitals alone, some district hospitals, too, lack such facilities. Another serious lacuna lies in the field of research on snake venom and domestic facilities to develop drugs (antivenoms) against snakebite. Thankfully, the government initiated a Venom Research Centre in collaboration with different local and international organisations in 2018. Hopefully, this Centre will be able to develop drugs against the bites from 37 types of venomous indigenous snakes, including, of course, the antivenom for Russel's viper.\n[email\u00a0protected]",
