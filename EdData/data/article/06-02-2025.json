Over the past few years, the U.S. government has intensified its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations to identify, detain, and deport individuals without proper documentation. For instance, between June and October 2024, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 1,60,000 individuals had been deported on 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries, including India. However, the manner and timing should be cause for concern for New Delhi. To begin with, these deportations coincide with a major crackdown by ICE, spurred by Donald Trump\u2019s swearing-in as the U.S. President in January. He has made illegal immigration his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. India, which has one of the largest populations of illegal immigrants in the U.S., estimated at 7,25,000 undocumented individuals, will need to prepare for a significant increase in the number of returning migrants. Second, for the first time, the use of military flights signals that the U.S. does not intend to be challenged. This move drew protests from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, particularly after reports emerged of deported migrants being shackled. The U.S. Embassy in Delhi has also made it clear that this deportation is part of a broader initiative to tighten immigration laws and enforcement, reinforcing the message that illegal migration is not worth the risk. Further, the timing, just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s U.S. visit, suggests that diplomatic efforts alone may not be enough to deter the Trump administration from pursuing such measures. This has the potential to become a bilateral flashpoint in India-U.S. relations.Accepting its citizens, provided they are verifiably Indian and have entered other countries illegally, is undoubtedly the Indian government\u2019s responsibility. However, stricter controls must be enforced to prevent Indians from embarking on perilous journeys to cross into the U.S. via Mexico and Canada. The government must ensure that young people in States with high deportation rates (Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana), understand that working illegally abroad is not a guaranteed path to success. Educational campaigns should highlight the dangers associated with illegal immigration. Importantly, the root causes must not be ignored. The central and State governments must address the underlying economic distress, deepening agricultural crises, social tensions, and employment shortages that push people to take such risks. Attention must be paid to those who deliberately travel to conflict zones in search of opportunities. While altering U.S. immigration policies may be difficult, the Indian government must address the reasons behind this large-scale migration with empathy and urgency.

        "full_article": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will conclude its first policy review of 2025 on Friday, in significantly different circumstances from its December meet. For one, the key personnel have changed. The RBI has a new Governor, with former Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra replacing Shaktikanta Das soon after the last review. Deputy Governor Michael Patra, an MPC member who was in charge of monetary policy, also retired last month. With the Centre yet to name his successor, navigating this review is going to be a tad tricky for the new central bank boss, with another deputy holding additional charge of monetary policy. Second, the rupee is in a free fall of sorts. After hitting 85 to the U.S. dollar on December 19, 2024, it slipped to 86 on January 13, 2025 and crossed 87 on February 3, partly due to the third factor at work. The strengthening dollar is driven by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s overdrive to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 with higher tariffs on major trade partners, and other disruptive economic plans such as exiting global tax accords, shutting aid flows, et al.One thing has not changed \u2014 the clamour for an interest rate cut from industry and government honchos. In December, this noise was heightened after a sharp growth blip in the July-September quarter when GDP grew just 5.4%. Now, with 2024-25 GDP growth downgraded to just 6.4%, and the no marked uptick in economic metrics in the December-ending quarter, growth worries remain entrenched. In the interim, there has been some back and forth between North Block and Mint Street on the factors responsible for stumbling economic activity. The Finance Ministry sought to lay some of the blame for an urban demand slump on tight monetary policy. RBI officials, in the central bank\u2019s January bulletin, said the \u201cone way\u201d to spark a growth rebound and a virtuous cycle of fresh private investments, is to boost consumption through higher disposable incomes, especially for the urban middle class that has been pining for relief from food inflation. With the Budget delivering on this front with income tax cuts, the ball is back in the RBI\u2019s court. Inflation has been over 5% in the last five months, but may have eased closer to the RBI\u2019s 4% target in January. But a rate cut could also hurt the rupee further, and spur higher imported inflation. It is an unenviable situation for the new RBI chief to be in; he might be tempted to take a cue from Mr. Das who had surprised markets with a rate cut in the first review under his watch in 2019, reversing his predecessor\u2019s stance.\r Published - February 06, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Reserve Bank of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        currency values\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economy (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        interest rate\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        investments\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        inflation and deflation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        food",

        "full_article": "Criminal defamation law injures free speech, as a Delhi court noted. SC should review the law\nPolitics in today\u2019s India is arguably more heated than anywhere else in the world, which makes it passing strange how thin-skinned its lead actors sometimes profess to be. They complain of criminal defamation with dainty regularity. In dismissing one such complaint, filed by BJP\u2019s Rajeev Chandrasekhar against Congress\u2019s Shashi Tharoor, a Delhi court has underlined the larger stakes in this political pastime. If every speech is viewed as defamation then \u201cfreedom of speech and expression would be reduced to nought.\u201d To be clear, this is not an apologia for harming the reputation of any person. Rather, it\u2019s about proportionality. About the fitness of civil, rather than criminal, remedy in such cases.\nCourts, however, are inconsistent. In 2023, the most high-profile such case saw a Surat court convict Rahul Gandhi for a remark made four years earlier, plus give him the maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, which set off his disqualification from Lok Sabha. The Supreme Court stayed the conviction within weeks, and Rahul returned to Parliament. He\u2019s perhaps unfazed. But when a common citizen stands similarly accused, after she\u2019s raised a sexual harassment grievance or he\u2019s made a sharply anti-govt cartoon, the effect is much more suffocating. Conviction or not, there\u2019s punishment enough in the process. Thus, criminal defamation has a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on freedom of expression by its very existence. It\u2019s a constant overhang on media freedoms as well. By putting dissent on notice, it puts democracy in danger.\nParliament, via BNS, has failed to reform this colonial-origin censor. The new criminal code has retained all the harsh intent of the original. From an \u201cimputation\u2026intended to be hurtful to the feelings\u2026or expressed ironically\u201d to one that \u201clowers the moral or intellectual character\u201d of a person, its definition of defamation remains dispiritingly expansive. The Supreme Court, on its part, has sadly failed to find criminal defamation as an excessive and arbitrary restriction on free speech. Politicians can use these cases to play politics, even if they are also the victims of harassment. But for the rest of us, there is no upside to this \u2013 only bullying and intimidation. A full SC bench should right this wrong.\n\n",

Also, a free pass to China/Russia\nFrederick Trump came to US from Germany in the age of New Imperialism, months after 14 western nations divvied up Africa without consulting Africans. That was 140 years ago. You\u2019d think that era ended after the horrors of two World Wars, but Trump\u2019s grandson does not. He wants to shape Gaza\u2019s destiny without consulting Palestinians. The idea would be ridiculous if it originated anywhere but White House. Coming from the US president, it\u2019s appalling. It\u2019s also illegal under international law, as many world leaders pointed out.\nWhen they met in Washington on Tuesday, Trump was never expected to read the riot act to Netanyahu. But he still managed to shock most by substituting policy with thinking aloud. He said Palestinians have no alternative but to move out of Gaza, suggested they should be thrilled to live in Egypt or Jordan \u2013 both countries oppose the idea \u2013 and finished by declaring US would take over Gaza for the long term, rebuild it into the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d, home to \u201cthe world\u2019s people\u201d, maybe also Palestinians.\nIt sounds like something Trump the corner-cutting realtor might have proposed. But the US president ought to know international law does not allow forcible relocation of people. Even though 70% of Gaza has been damaged or destroyed over 15 months of Israeli shelling, some 2mn people consider it home. It\u2019s where they grew up and buried their dead \u2013 around 47,000 of them killed in just this war. They won\u2019t leave it, and by proposing they do en masse, Trump has done what even the Israelis had not dared so far. Besides, Trump\u2019s idea runs counter to his own stated policy of keeping US out of West Asia\u2019s troubles. Does he expect Gazans to abandon their homeland without a fight? By dispossessing them, he will lay the seeds for generations of strife. And alienate his Arab friends. And embolden Russia and China to push on with their own imperial aims. Trump doesn\u2019t measure his words, but there are times when he should resist the urge \u2013 to use his own words \u2013 \u201cto weave\u201d.\n\n",

        "full_article": "What do we mean by political action which is different from all other actions? Why do we separate politics from our daily living? Why do we separate a political activity of the left, right, centre, or extreme left, extreme right? Why, if one may ask, why is political action so very different from our action of relationship, action with regard to fear in ourselves, and so on? Or is politics part of our life, not something separate? Politics according to the common usage, which is in the dictionary, is the art of govt, science of govt. Why do we give this art to politicians? They apparently are a separate breed, different from us. This is really a question that involves, why do we depend on a politician, a guru, a priest, on anybody to govern us? Why do specialists take charge of our life? Is it that we have no so-called confidence in ourselves? We are not sure of ourselves, and we attribute this clarity to the politicians and to the others. Is it in ourselves that we are insufficient and somebody out there is going to make us sufficient?\n\nSo, are we to treat life as separate factors: political, religious, economic, and so on? Or are we to treat life as a whole? Is it that we are so fragmented in ourselves \u2013 as a religious action, political action, family action, individual action, collective action? Or do we treat life as a total movement in which all these activities are included? But if we separate one from the other, we\u2019ll inevitably bring about contradiction. A religious life is incompatible, one will say with political life; a religious person will have no part with politics, because generally politics is such a crooked affair, controlled by big industrialists, by wanting great deal of money for the party, and they\u2019re depending on rich people and so on. There is increase of armaments; just now they are destroying each other, killing each other for \u2013 god knows for what\u2026\nAnd what is a political action? Would you like to start a new party, social democratic party? Or look for a new leader for the next election; condemn the present leader, and when the new leader comes into being next election, again there is doubt about him \u2013 you know the whole\u2026when the honeymoon is over then begins the whole problem. So, what is your answer?\u2026Do you want to ask if there is an activity, if there is action which is not divisible, an action that includes politics, religion, economics, everything \u2013 the whole bundle of life. And is that possible?\nOne sees corruption right through the world \u2013 black market, rich people getting tremendously richer, the privileged classes, and so on. Where do you begin to bring about an action that will include all actions? Where do you begin? To go very far, one must begin very near. Right? So, what is very near? Me. I am the nearest person, so I begin \u2013 not as a selfish activity, or self-centred movement \u2013 I am the nearest, or I am the centre from which I start; not out there.

        "full_article": "It is disheartening that many individuals injured in the July uprising\u2014and the families of those martyred\u2014are still waiting for their promised compensation that remains entangled in bureaucratic red tape. With Tk 5 lakh set for martyrs' families and Tk 1 lakh for the wounded, the one-time financial assistance should have been easier to access, yet the process of getting compensation continues to throw up challenges.\nIt begins with securing a seal from a BCS doctor or hospital director on the application form, which must be accompanied by hospital tickets or discharge certificates bearing an MBBS doctor's seal. Additionally, applicants must provide photographs of their injuries as well as a bKash number linked to their national ID for payment. These documents must then be entered into the Management Information System of a government hospital, upazila health complex, or the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Thereafter, the civil surgeon and deputy commissioner's office must verify the patient's permanent address before the documents can be submitted to the July Shaheed Smrity Foundation via post, email, WhatsApp, or in person.\nHowever, inefficiencies in government offices and hospitals\u2014coupled with bureaucratic hurdles\u2014have turned this process into an exhausting ordeal. Reportedly, families are often forced to make multiple trips across cities, spending large sums of money. For those living outside Dhaka, the situation gets even worse, with many reporting that they had to visit the July foundation seven or eight times due to missing documents or the unavailability of officials. Numerous additional complications have also been reported, making the compensation claim process not just difficult but also deeply humiliating.\nOfficials say that the strict procedures are necessary to prevent fraud and other irregularities. But the inefficiency of the system is undeniable, and they cannot shirk responsibility for it. It is unacceptable that after enduring immense suffering during the uprising, victims and their families must now face further hardship simply to receive the support they deserve.\nUnder these circumstances, we must reiterate our call for the authorities to simplify and expedite the compensation process. If the current workforce engaged in this process is inadequate, it must be expanded immediately. The authorities must also investigate why deserving recipients are facing such difficulties and take immediate corrective measures.\n",

        "full_article": "Since Donald Trump returned to the White House for a second term, global, regional and domestic changes have been accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Trump's inaugural speech and his deluge of executive orders exemplify a nationalist rhetoric, which includes barring student visas of those who participated in \"pro-Palestinian\" protests that shook the country last year. He heralded \"a golden age,\" in his inaugural address, and his policies have put Washington\u2014and the rest of the world\u2014on notice that Trump is determined to turn his campaign promises into reality. His promises come with a liking of openly self-serving agendas. Nowhere is this more evident than in his administration's approach towards the Middle East, which is defined by a complete bias for Israeli expansionism at the expense of Palestinians.\nThe policy not only disregards Palestinian rights but also strengthens Israeli hegemony, offering illusions through hardline figures such as Massad Boulos and Steve Witkoff. Under Trump's first administration, the US showed no interest in supporting the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, further exacerbating Palestinian suffering and pushing towards the dissolution of the cause. This time, evidently, will be no different. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit and upcoming discussions with Trump raises questions, and mostly concerns, about what lies ahead. The ceasefire is currently in a fragile state, held in the Gaza Strip with the next stage of negotiations expected to enter the second phase that includes a more permanent end to the conflict.\nNetanyahu, the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House, will undoubtedly try to preserve a dynamic between the nations where absolutely no threats for Netanyahu's position as the Prime Minister of Israel, and ensure there are no checks and balance for his government\u2014given those members are \"loyal\" to him. It is the same dynamic that resulted in the Abraham Accords. In this context, it is important to remember that Netanyahu's decision in Israel has not been in the interest of the Israeli public, majority of whom do not approve of him. He dragged the war on for political gains, and got rid of anyone who objected to his decisions, in order to serve his personal interests, starting with the opposition duo Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, then Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and finally the chief of staff who was replaced by Netanyahu's most loyal commander.\nHe closed the gaps that disturbed him and confused his absolute rule under the pretext of achieving absolute victory. When speaking to Trump, Netanyahu's logic that \"I am Israel\" will inarguably dominate. His expansionist aims will be presented, days after Trump has offered\u2014and been rejected\u2014to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan.\nNetanyahu's equation with Trump in his first term doubled Israel's dependency on US financial, armed and political wars, and will remain a constant threat to the Middle East, a region whose map both leaders want to change, and the region where they presume authority to throw around citizens and people across borders.\nMassad Boulos, a billionaire of Lebanese origin and the father-in-law of Tiffany Trump, played a role in crafting deceptive assurances to the Palestinians, suggesting there was a real opportunity for political relief under the Trump administration. These promises follow a long-standing US pattern of selling illusions to Palestinians, offering grand economic or political solutions without any substantive commitments.\nSimilarly, Steve Witkoff, US billionaire real estate investor and Trump's Middle East envoy, sought to position himself as a mediator, even reportedly visiting Gaza. However, these gestures will only remain as mere theatrics that fall in line with the administration's broader policies that actively reinforce Israeli occupation, settlement expansion, and annexation projects.\nThe US-Israel alliance is deeply rooted in strategic interests, making the idea of an independent Palestinian state fundamentally at odds with Washington's long-term vision of \"peace\" in the Middle East. Israel serves as the linchpin of US influence in the region, and as such, Trump's policies, including his support for Israeli settlements, the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem, and the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's unified capital confirm that Washington sees the continuation of Israeli hegemony as a long-term strategic goal.\nIn the same vein, the Trump administration brokered a truce between Hezbollah and Israel that pushed the deadline for the complete withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from Lebanon, further extending Israel's military presence in the country. Trump has completely sidelined Jordan from his strategic calculations, seeking to impose an economic blockade to pressure Amman into aligning with his regional agenda, most notably, by forcing Jordan to absorb Palestinians from Gaza. That is a revival of a proposal that Jordan rejected during Trump's first term, which is now being pushed again through economic coercion, including threats to cut aid.\nAt the same time, US officials such as Ambassador Mike Huckabee and the US ambassador to the UN have openly championed Israel's \"biblical right\" to the West Bank. Huckabee, a hardline Anglican, refuses to call the Israeli communities in the West Bank \"settlements.\" The US ambassador to the UN has echoed similar sentiments, reflecting the depth of the indoctrinated anti-Palestinian beliefs in US decision-making.\nTrump's support for Israel cannot be separated from his electoral base, which largely consists of Zionists and Evangelical Christians. These groups see support for Israel as a religious and ideological duty. For them, the \"Greater Land of Israel\" is part of their faith. The usage of religion to occupy land, unfairly, played a major role in pushing the Trump administration to adopt policies that serve the entire Israeli occupation project at the expense of Palestinian human rights.\nSince assuming office, Trump has lifted sanctions on Israeli settlers, removed bans on bomb shipments to Israel, and endorsed proposals advocating for the forced transfer of Palestinians under the guise of \"evacuating areas.\"\nIf we look at Trump's policies realistically, it is clear that his administration is interested in pushing for Israeli hegemony,\nTrump approaches international issues, including the Palestinian cause, through the lens of transactionalism. Rather than addressing the political roots of conflicts or seeking justice, he perceives the region as an opportunity for economic profit. His statements referring to Gaza as a \"fantastic place\" exemplify his reductionist perspective, trivialising the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza for the past year and a half. Similar to Netanyahu, Trump has also reduced the Palestinians' struggle to a mere commercial project and their land to a profit-making machine. These policies, coated in political hypocrisy, only deepen the suffering of the Palestinian people.\nGiven this stark reality, it is imperative that we Palestinians, and Palestinian supporters around the world, unite according to a clear strategic vision and work to realign internal political and diplomatic priorities to confront the growing challenges. As the ceasefire in Gaza hangs in the air, the Israeli military, for its part, has shifted its focus over the past two weeks to the West Bank, carrying out airstrikes and blowing up 23 buildings in Jenin on Sunday. If Trump and Netanyahu work to foster the problematic US-Israeli equation that has underlined the conflict with Palestine, the Middle East will only plunge into further unrest. The only hope lies in Trump's economic interests with the Arab states and gulf nations overriding his penchant for far-right nationalists like Netanyahu. The coming days will reveal the future of Gaza in the short-term at least, but that itself is the issue: the future of the besieged strip lies in the hands of two men who, above all, care mostly about themselves.\nYousef SY Ramadan\u00a0is the ambassador of Palestine to Bangladesh.\n\nViews expressed in this article are strictly the author's own.\u00a0\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.

        "full_article": "The deaths of several Asian elephants in the Chattogram region in recent times raise questions about our commitment to wildlife conservation. According to media reports, more than 30 elephants have been found dead in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas and Chattogram's Anwara, Karnaphuli, and Banshkhali upazilas over the past decade. Last year, seven elephant deaths were recorded in Ukhiya and Teknaf alone.\nMany of these elephants were electrocuted or shot dead, while others succumbed to hunger, malnutrition, and disease due to food shortages. Expanding human settlements, economic zones, and infrastructure built on elephant habitats and migratory routes are disrupting their natural movement, which typically spans 70-80 kilometres daily in search of food and water. In Ukhiya and Teknaf, the Rohingya refugee camps as well as the barbed-wire fence built by Myanmar government along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border have blocked five of the eight existing elephant corridors in Cox's Bazar, making at least 15 water bodies inaccessible to the area's 205 elephants.\nSimilarly, in Anwara and Karnaphuli, establishing the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) and the China Economic Zone by clearing forests\u2014and without undertaking proper environmental feasibility studies, one may add\u2014has further disrupted the life and habitat of the elephant population. Environmental conservation guidelines were also ignored during the construction of the Dohazari-Cox's Bazar railway line, creating additional barriers for these animals. Alarmingly, many of the elephant deaths have occurred in reserved forests and wildlife sanctuaries. What is the purpose of declaring an area a \"wildlife sanctuary\" if we cannot ensure the safety of the wildlife within it?\nThere is reason to expect stronger action from the current interim government which claims itself to be pro-environment. In October, the environment adviser helped establish a committee in the KEPZ area to ensure the protection of wild elephants. However, more action is needed across all regions where human-elephant conflicts have been intensifying. The consequences of habitat degradation and destruction extend to humans as well, with 136 people estimated to have been killed by elephants in the last six years.\nThe government, therefore, must take urgent, visible measures to prevent deforestation, restore forest lands, implement reforestation initiatives, and ensure that the natural routes for elephant movement are never violated under any circumstances. Anti-nature infrastructure development projects undertaken by the Awami League government should also be critically reviewed. We must find a way to coexist with other species without endangering their survival.\n",
