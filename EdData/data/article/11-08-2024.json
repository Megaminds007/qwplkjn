The octogenarian pioneer of microfinance is taking charge of the country at one of its most tumultuous phases. Days after former Prime Minister and Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina resigned and left amid violent mass protests, the nation of 170 million people remains on edge as violence refuses to recede. Law enforcement officials are missing and the state bureaucracy has become non-functional in the absence of a government. Extremist sections have used the chaos to target Hindus, Ahmedis, a minority sect in Islam, and Awami League functionaries. According to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, the houses and shops of minorities were looted in several districts. Offices of the Awami League were vandalised and dozens of party functionaries and supporters were killed. Mr. Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday (August 8, 2024), condemned the violence and appealed for calm. As the banker begins his role as an administrator, his challenge would be to bring Bangladesh back from the brink and restore the rule of law.By appointing Mr. Yunus, someone who is acceptable to the student protesters and the political opposition, the military and Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin have shown signs of reconciliation. At a time when there is much hostility among political parties, an interim government headed by a technocrat is a pragmatic first step. But Mr. Yunus does not have the political machinery to back him up and will have to be dependent on the mainstream parties or the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement. He also faces three critical medium-term challenges. First, he has to make sure that the military stays in the barracks. The military has an infamous past and it took years of mass movement, led by Ms. Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the BNP leader, to bring the dictatorship to an end in 1990. Second, Mr. Yunus has to build at least temporary peace in Bangladesh\u2019s polity. Ms. Hasina\u2019s fall has empowered the Jamaat and the BNP. Jamaat, a majoritarian Islamist group, has had a particularly bloodied past, while the years the BNP was in power were marked by political violence and vendetta. Lastly, Mr. Yunus\u2019s administration should facilitate free and fair elections at the earliest. Only an elected government with popular legitimacy can steer the country out of the troubles it is in today. The success of Bangladesh\u2019s uprising is dependent on the will and the ability of the country\u2019s new rulers to tackle these challenges.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nBangladesh\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\ncivil unrest\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nlaw enforcement\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nstudents\n\n/\n\narmed Forces\n\n/\n\nhistory\n\n/\n\nminority group",

        "full_article": "The RBI\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has for a ninth straight meeting chosen to keep benchmark interest rates unchanged as it continues to battle retail inflation that has stubbornly stayed above its medium-term target of 4% for 57 months and is beginning to undermine consumer confidence. Laying out the rationale, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das was emphatic that there was no room for complacency given the risks that persistently elevated food price pressures posed to households\u2019 inflation expectations and broader monetary policy credibility. Elevated food prices, he stressed, had not only slowed disinflation in the April-June quarter but had also extended their momentum into July with high frequency food price data pointing to sizeable month-on-month increases in key vegetable prices. Citing Department of Consumer Affairs data, he said tomato prices had surged 62% sequentially, while onion had become almost 23% costlier than in June and potato prices had increased 18%. Food prices, with a weight of about 46% in the overall Consumer Price Index, could not afford to be overlooked, not just for their impact on headline inflation but far more significantly because consumers related the most to the impact food prices had on monthly household budgets. He indicated, without explicitly referencing it, that a suggestion in the Economic Survey urging policymakers to consider delinking food prices from the inflation targeting framework made little sense in the circumstances.The MPC, which voted by a 4-2 majority to hold interest rates and keep the policy stance focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation aligns to the target, also raised its projection for headline retail inflation in the July-September quarter to 4.4%, 60 basis points higher than the 3.8% pace projected in June. The rate panel also posited slightly faster inflation in the third fiscal quarter than it had forecast previously, lifting the projection by 10 basis points to 4.7%, in a clear sign that the near-term inflation outlook appears less reassuring than it did just two months ago. And while Mr. Das noted that, in June, vegetable prices had contributed about 35% to headline inflation, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, in an analysis, forecast price pressures in vegetables to \u2018sustain well into the festive season through till early November\u2019, adding pressure on retail headline inflation. Core inflation may also have bottomed out according to the MPC, which flagged the risks of spillover from food prices, as well as the impact mobile tariff revisions may have on broader non-food inflation. Policymakers hearteningly reiterated the truism that without ensuring enduring price stability, growth may at best be tenuous.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\n/\n\ninterest rate\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation\n\n/\n\nfood\n\n/\n\nprices\n\n/\n\nfruit and vegetable\n\n/\n\nfestivals\n\n/\n\neconomy (general)",

        "full_article": "Amid a backdrop of icy grey acacia trees, four elephants stood in a trance. A female recognisable by the geometric planes of her head and three bull elephants. Perched on the bouncing seats of a khaki jeep, I had stumbled upon a primeval mating ritual. The elephants moved slowly. Approaches. Rejections. Swiping right and left with their trunks.\nThe mating was short-lived and clumsy. Like a section of Indian men, bull elephants also seem to believe that if two minutes are good enough for Maggi noodles, then it\u2019s good enough for them. Our safari guide, who could be mistaken for Shikari Shambu, informed us that the elephants would mate several times over the next few days and then go their own way. The resulting calf would be raised by a herd of predominantly female elephants.\nThis was a common phenomenon among the mammals I spotted in Tanzania: lionesses protecting their cubs and tiny wildebeests running alongside their moms and aunts. Communities of females raising their young, with males either absent, or wandering in and out without doing much of the heavy lifting. I found it intriguing how we humans evolved from these collective structures into units of two and decided that our mating rituals had to include both monogamy and matrimony. Why did we confine ourselves in a 2BHK, hum-do-hamare-do cage? And if marriage is about everlasting love, why does it seem to run out faster than an Eveready battery?\nA little digging into history brought up a startling fact. The concept of marriage had initially nothing to do with love but was due to the advent of agriculture. When we were nomads, it didn\u2019t matter if the child you were carrying was Sharma ji\u2019s from the neighbouring cave or that foolish Desai\u2019s who was scared of the rain. Then came farming, and land became an ownable commodity. Men needed to ensure that only their biological children would inherit their assets. Enter wedlock, a mechanism to tie down a woman by making the prosperity of her children dependent on her monogamy. Only around the 18th century did luv, shuv and all the bheja fry that entailed enter the fray.\nWhile a marriage does have its chafing issues, it has some surprising medical advantages. A recent paper published in the Annals of Behavioural Medicine found that people who never married were twice as likely to die early as those in solid marriages. It\u2019s men, though, who seem to wither away without partners, while women tend to put on their lipstick and just get on with it. There is also enough research that shows raising a family with a reliable partner has definite advantages over being a single parent. But how do you sleep next to a partner when, at least twice a week, you are overcome with the urge to strangle them \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting the times when their snoring is louder than the baboons chattering outside your tent. While philosophers and self-help gurus dissect human nature, I chose to focus on nature itself, observing the techniques animals use as their survival often hinges on a delicate balance of cooperative hunting strategies and symbiotic relationships.\n\nHyena\u2019s Hustle: Hyenas don\u2019t battle with lions for a share of the kill. They approach stealthily and run away with a juicy bit. Instead of constant confrontations, perhaps sometimes we should just resort to trickery. When your partner starts singing Punjabi songs at ear-shattering decibels, asking him to stop may become a battle of freedom like he is Gandhi ji fighting for swaraj. Instead distract him with questions like, \u2018What was that movie we saw that day with that guy? It was on Netflix, remember?\u2019 While his mind does multiple cartwheels, enjoy the blissful silence.\nBonhomie of Baboons: I watched baboons grooming each other and playing together. These creatures tend to live in large groups where females make lifelong bonds. After entering a relationship, women especially tend to concentrate primarily on their partners. Focus is a dangerous thing if directed only in one direction. It\u2019s how a magnifying glass sets paper on fire. Perhaps we are better off strengthening our social network like baboons. Basically, keep your man close but your girlfriends even closer.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\nGiraffe\u2019s Gaze: Giraffes seem to be eternally scanning the landscape. In relationships as well, it\u2019s better to look through a wide angle instead of a zoom lens. Your partner\u2019s poor jokes and preference for mummy\u2019s rajma can feel like significant grievances in the moment but fade away a week later.\nHint from Hippos: Hippos communicate through grunts, roars, and sprays of water. Our guide told us that these signals convey their moods and avoid conflicts within their group. Communication in a marriage is often not about what you are saying but how you present it. I have a friend who, whether she is asking her husband to empty the bin or share her biryani, always begins by calling him \u2018baby\u2019. I used to laugh at her in our twenties but looking at them still going strong three decades later, I have to say that effective communication is the true Fevicol ka Jod.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\nCheetah\u2019s Composure: Cheetahs are gifted with speed, but they wait and go for the kill only when the time is right. Instead of getting into heated discussions over whose turn it was to take your kid shopping for sneakers and why dirty clothes are on the floor, wait till you both have downed a glass of wine or whatever beverage helps you see the world through rose-tinted glasses. Then, when your partner, like the grazing impala, has his guard down, launch your attack.\nIllustration credit: Chad Crowe\n\nOn our last game drive, we saw another herd, with a solitary bull elephant walking far ahead of the females with calves. The bull elephant had my husband\u2019s sympathies. \u2018Poor guy, he is all alone.\u2019 I was more focused on how the male could wander off as he pleased, while the females had to take care of the young. That, I suppose, is marriage in a nutshell \u2014 two people looking at the same scenario with different interpretations and then bickering over what is right, and often these days, why right is wrong and left is right.\nDriving back to camp that evening, the guide pointed out a pair of birds called tik-tik who are so devoted to each other that when one dies, the other sometimes kills itself by eating poisonous grass. I told my husband, \u2018Acha, if I die first, you better eat poisonous grass too. If I see your second wife walking around with my handbags, I promise I will come and haunt you both.\u2019\nHe shook his head and replied, \u2018I want to eat that poisonous grass right now, at least then I won\u2019t have to listen to all this nonsense.\u2019 Then he swatted a mosquito on my arm, the human equivalent of baboons delousing each other. We continued engaging in the complex choreography of cooperation, affection and mutual tolerance as our jeep raced against the setting sun.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s tough. Male domination is built into idea of romance.\nThe personal is the political. And nothing is more personal than a romantic relationship. Reinventing Love: How the Patriarchy Sabotages Heterosexual Relationsby French feminist Mona Chollet explores the dynamics of romantic love in the context of gender inequality.\nMen and women are methodically socialised not to understand each other. The whole drama of our novels and pop culture and romcoms involves conventions of domination and submission. In our romantic representations, the woman is inferior in some way. Even minor things like a woman being taller, or earning more than a man, would be a buzzkill \u2013 Carla Bruni routinely posed on a step below her shorter husband Nicolas Sarkozy, pictures of Prince Charles were contrived to make him look taller than his then wife Diana. Women smile, practise being pleasant, are careful not to be \u2018too much\u2019, too loud or powerful. Athletes like Serena Williams have been disciplined through derision. To be desirable, women must diminish themselves.\nLove is cast as a woman\u2019s main business. We condition girls to seek love through a man, rather than a healthy consideration for themselves. Female selflessness and masculine detachment are part of our relationship schema. And yet, the most elementary emotional needs of women are stigmatised, cast as needy and desperate. Meanwhile, boys are also taught to amputate their relational needs.\nThe book analyses the many manifestations of this inequality, drawing on literature, pop culture and the media discourse. It looks at conjugal violence, why women make excuses for men who hurt them, because they are trained to be empathetic to an extreme, rather than to have self-compassion. It explores why some white men objectify Asian women, for instance, or seek living dolls who cannot talk back. It details the effects of objectification, as women are always aware of being looked at by others. This prevents them from accessing their own sensations, sentiments and desires.\nBut the heart has its reasons, some will argue. Love cannot be reformed; we want what we want. Why do forceful lovers seem to loom large in women\u2019s fiction and fantasy? Why do so many women like the idea of submission, why does feminist porn often seem unconvincing? Because masculine domination is the condition we live in, says the book. To resolve the tension created by the experience of domination, women turn it into sexual or romantic fantasy. Our challenge is to eroticise equality, as Gloria Steinem famously said.\nTrapped in our fantasies, we obliterate the needs of the person we love. And often we don\u2019t know what portion of our attachment is real desire, and what is a need for validation from them. Love is not a simple sentiment, but an ensemble of actions, it is what we do for the person we love. For women, this calls for internal emancipation, to not be afraid to be alone and to change terms one does not like.\nIt is possible to have a more equal love story. Heterosexual love is not just a patriarchal con: men are not only oppressors, women are more than merely oppressed. But their tie is poisoned by domination, and we must see this dysfunction clearly. The edifice of conventional love must be dismantled to reconstruct another one. To peel off our masks, to question our own learned reflexes, that is the adventure and heroism of real love.\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "By James Anderson\nThere is a flower deep inside each of us which yearns to bloom. This is what Sri Aurobindo calls the psychic being, a term unique to his yoga. The psychic is the evolving soul, which is the key to all individual growth and evolution. Over innumerable lifetimes, if the being keeps moving upwards, the psychic edges forward, becoming more perceptible and eventually forming a \u2018conscious sheath\u2019 around the soul. And thus, \u2018identified with the Divine, it becomes the perfect instrument in the world.\u2019 Realising the psychic being is a supreme objective of Integral Yoga. Words cannot convey the knowledge of the psychic. This knowledge can only be encapsulated by experience.\nThe psychic being is the inimitable godhead that resides inside us all. Its influence is unmistakable. It carries the certitude of Truth and the fragrance of Love. It is the true home of unconditional love, the adoring child of the Divine Mother. This \u2018Rose of God\u2019 is a portion of the Divine. It is like touching a spring we discover to be limitless. Whenever we call the Mother, we entreat this entity to step forward. Whenever we consciously surrender to Her, we yield more and more to its presence.\nThe psychic being is the Soul Personality who maps out our destiny and expresses our unique Truth. Everything must be centred on this Truth. From the beginning, it secretly charts the \u2018main lines\u2019 and circumstances of our lives. It is our inner teacher; its growth and emergence mark the level of spiritual evolution that each one of us has reached.\nThe psychic being is fully awake; it never hides. It is only we who need to awaken to it. Presently, it is buried beneath the folds of our nature. It is veiled by the surface ego consciousness. It can only be accessed by re-orienting our consciousness and aligning within. It resides inside the heart centre but exists in a different dimension, far beyond the clutch of our three-dimensional senses.\nInitially, of course, we must deploy them and only aspiration can take us there. We have to work assiduously on ourselves to identify with the psychic being. We only need to open and allow it to radiate through us. But resistance is present. With conscious practice, the personal effort succumbs gradually to a loving surrender. We give ourselves and pray to the Mother to lead us to this sublime presence.\nThe work on this path of purification helps bring the psychic forward. We identify and invoke its help. The psychic being alone has the capacity for true integration; it works dynamically, aligning and harmonising everything in the being around itself. It is our truest instrument for self-mastery and change.It manifests Oneness in all the multiplicity of our nature, a prerequisite for transformation. Only by collaborating with the psychic can we realise it. It is not a static process. When we engage, it becomes a Supreme Force for progress and transformation.\nOne does not climb to get there: it is a horizontal process. It dwells in the depths not the heights. Any portal of our nature can be chosen: mind, life or body. We choose whatever way resonates with us. The important thing is, we set our means and stick to it. Nothing should stand in the way of the psychic presence. Set your sights on this goal and find it.\nThe writer is the coordinating editor of NAMAH, the Journal of Integral Health.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are deeply concerned that, so far, only 361 out of 639 police stations have partially resumed operations since Friday, with the assistance of the armed forces and Border Guard Bangladesh. At the time when there is a severe lapse in security across all districts, with many incidents of violence, arson attacks, and even robberies being reported, law enforcement cannot be absent from the scene.\nWhile it is understandable that many police personnel are feeling insecure after the destruction of many police stations in the country and attacks on police personnel, they must remember their primary duty, which is to protect the public. The unprecedented number of civilians\u2014many of them students and even children\u2014who were shot and killed by law enforcers during the quota movement, triggered attacks on police and police stations. But now is the time for all official forces to work together to bring security to the nation. Official forces must collaborate to ensure safety, especially in minority communities that have faced violence and vandalism from different coteries trying to take advantage of the power vacuum created by the former government's departure. The same applies to other groups as well, including members of the former administration, Awami League members, and individuals seen as loyal to the former regime.\nWithout police presence on the streets, miscreants have seized the opportunity to commit crimes with total impunity. In the absence of police, communities are having to mobilise their members to stay on watch all night, with the student volunteers helping. While this is very admirable, it is hardly a sustainable solution. Only a strong law enforcement presence will deter these criminals.\nIt is worrisome to know that the chain of command within the police force has broken down after the attacks on police personnel. Police from lower ranks have staged demonstrations and made their 11-point demand. The police force, which has long played a partisan role and embittered the public with its actions, must do everything in its power to regain public trust. The interim government must prioritise security and take necessary steps to restore police presence at the stations. Senior officers, particularly the new IGP, must address this crisis through dialogue with their frustrated juniors and find immediate solutions.\nThis will also require quick logistical support to repair the destroyed stations and get them operational again, as well as address the legitimate grievances of lower-tier police officers. The process of reform within the police force must begin as soon as possible to depoliticise the force, eradicate corruption, and make it a protector of the public rather than a feared or hated entity.\n",

        "full_article": "The interim government comes with a mandate to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy, but its full scope is undefined, and a timetable is yet to be determined. Expectations are running high, and so are fears. As the Arab Spring has shown, failure could set back the struggle for democracy for decades to come.\nI see a window of opportunity to craft a platform for transformative governance, grounded in democratic values and human rights principles. But that window will not last long. Among the many issues that demand the urgent attention of the interim government, it must select and prioritise a few critical reforms that are truly vital for sustaining democracy in the long run, that can be achieved in a short time and can be embedded in such a way that they will outlive this government.\nThe selection, prioritisation and delivery of those reforms will determine whether this moment in our country's history is a new dawn or a false one.\nI believe early action in six key areas is essential.\nFirst is the early restoration of law and order. There continues to be reports of violence, arson and looting, targeting supporters of the previous regime and members of the Hindu community. The political nature of these attacks is evident. The interim government must make it clear that not only does it have zero tolerance for political vendettas or scapegoating of minorities, but that all political parties must proactively reign in their goons or face political and legal consequences.\nThe interim government should think outside the box when it comes to policing. The discredited and demoralised police have walked out. Within hours of the police going on \"strike\", well-organised groups of students and volunteers took to guarding neighbourhoods and managing the city traffic in Dhaka with remarkable skill, politeness and diligence. This could well be the beginning of a new community-based policing system that this country badly needs.\nSecond is accountability for human rights violations\u2014not to be done forty years down the road but here and now. The interim government should initiate a credible and transparent accountability process, in line with internationally recognised standards and with international assistance, into the massive human rights violations in recent weeks and past years. The government should take up the offer of assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsand ask for an international commission of inquiry.\nThe international nature of the inquiry will be vital for the credibility of the process at home and abroad. By taking the bold step of inviting an investigation, supported by the United Nations, into Bangladesh's human rights obligations which are underpinned by international treaties, this interim government will set an important precedent on accountability and respect for the rule of law which future governments cannot ignore easily.\nThird is to strengthen the right to freedom of expression and the role of independent news media. The government should immediately repeal the Cyber Security Act, the law on criminal libel and the Information and Communication Technology Act, which were used by the previous government to gag the media, prosecute and punish journalists and human rights defenders, and disrupt the internet.\nThe previous government weaponised the judicial system to throttle dissent and silence journalists. Multiple charges were brought against scores of editors and journalists and left hanging over their heads for years, inducing a culture of fear and self-censorship. Criminal charges against all journalists and editors must be dismissed immediately. Journalism is not a crime.\nFourth is judicial reform. Parliament has been disbanded, the executive has been replaced, now the judiciary has resigned under pressure from the student-led movement. Root and branch reform of the judiciary is long overdue, and essential to gain the trust and confidence of the public as well as investors. This government should undertake a process of fundamental reforms, especially at the highest echelons of the judiciary, to ensure the independence, impartiality and competence of the judiciary and commitment from its highest echelons to its rank and file to upholding fairness, human rights, and the rule of law.\nAt a minimum, the interim government must develop an effective judicial mechanism to resolve electoral disputes. As Director-General of the International Development Law Organization, I played a part in the reform of Kenya's Supreme Court, following the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 after the bloodiest post-electoral violence in the history of that country. The reform of the supreme court and the exemplary leadership of successive chief justices have created such public trust that there has been no large-scale political violence in Kenya since then. When the opposition challenged the re-election of then sitting President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017, the court ordered a re-run which the president accepted. When the court certified that he had won the re-run, the leader of the opposition accepted the court's decision without protest.\nFifth, democratic elections. The interim government will no doubt take many measures to create an enabling environment for free, fair, inclusive and credible elections. I strongly urge a reinstatement of the rule on the caretaker government arrangement for conducting future elections. Remember the Right to Information decree introduced by the caretaker administration in 2008 which the incoming government did not dare to reverse? This government should put the same kind of political capital to embed the caretaker arrangement.\nMy final point is about bringing a profound change in the political culture. The people of this country, especially the youth, are fed up with self-serving, corrupt and violent politics and politicians. They want a new type of politics that cares about ordinary people, that values equality, opportunity and justice.\nThe interim government, the student-led movement and all who support it must work to create a broad-based national movement with new ideas, leaders and innovative political structures that are representative of the gender, age, ethnic, religious and socio-economic diversity of our country and committed to create a rights-respecting, just and democratic society. We must have a truly alternative choice at the next elections.\nIrene Khan is the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression and former Secretary General of Amnesty International.

        "full_article": "No sooner had we seen the abrupt fall of the Awami League, the propaganda machines begun to work on cue on social media, particularly on X (formerly known as Twitter). The celebratory mood on August 5 was soon overshadowed by reports of vandalism, looting, and attacks on minority groups and establishments. The truth was co-opted by obviously partisan interest groups and their bots on the internet. In one sickening example, the looters who had broken into the Gonobhaban and shamelessly paraded around the lingerie they grabbed were soon transformed by suspicious accounts on X into \"militants\" and \"Islamists\" who had snatched away the undergarments of minority Hindu women after terrorising them\u2014how does one even begin to unravel such distortions?\nThere is, firstly, no defense for what these people did, turning celebratory zeal into an uncomfortable display of perversion. The ease with which people reacted to such images (without the need for a distortion of narrative) on social media makes one wonder how we are to mature as a nation when this is entertainment for us. Secondly, whatever the real circumstances were, the disinformation campaign that swiftly went to work, made sure to take full advantage to make it an issue of sectarian violence. The relentless posting and sharing of outright lies would put any sane person trying to counter them feel like they were being swept against an unsurmountable wave, and it was not that hard to see why that was so. A lot of the accounts that propagate these are obvious bots or fakes run by a motley of individuals with geopolitical agendas. When falsehoods such as the one mentioned above were being rained upon, many countered by sharing accounts of madrasa students guarding temples from rioters and other criminals, showing the international audience on X that minorities were not being targeted by everyone, but a small group of opportunists. But the grassroots, organic campaign online had to be on the defense by nature. It is impossible to argue with bots, grifters and cronies, let alone stay visible enough on people's screens before being washed away under their sheer size of lies. It is, one realises soon, a pointless endeavour.\nBut who are the perpetuators of these false narratives and who are their principle recipients? The latter is easy to answer, the former not so much. The purported markers of these accounts are staunchly right-wing and provide Indian identities, with a vast number of them regularly espousing Hindutva and pro-Modi sentiment. The purpose of establishing a narrative of chaos in Bangladesh right after the removal of the Awami League looks to bolster the narrative that has long been touted by pro-Modi media, that the geopolitical situations in South Asia leaves no alternative but Sheikh Hasina, that it is only she who can keep the separatists of the seven sister states out of operation in Bangladesh, keep the Islamists at ab arm's length of power and protect the Hindu minority at all costs. And now that she is gone, look what has happened within hours.\nThe reason why this is dangerous is because the emotional frame is so forceful that those spreading the lies need not dwell much on the nuances and logic of their tales. When a person sees the fellow members of the same faith being targeted solely due to their identity, it is bound to elicit sympathy and an eagerness to combat the hatred. When you go counter the claims, you have already lost their target audience as you are part of the enemy just by being on the other side of the line. The propaganda on X is geared not at Bangladeshis, but at an international audience. It is an attempt to discredit any reality that does not include the dominant narratives that we have seen in the last decade and a half.\nThe sadness of this is that it takes attention away from the actual cases of attacks on minorities. As the Daily Star reported on August 6, 2024, Hindu houses and businesses had been attacked in many districts all over the country. That very real fear that minorities had been going through these past few days cannot be brushed aside for the time being while there is a rebuilding of the nation. Safeguarding their rights to live just as any other person in the country is the very essence of this rebuilding. The insidious nature of social media propaganda is that even as we counter outright lies, the use of hashtags such as #HindusAreSafeinBangladesh belie a history of discrimination and gross bigotry toward minorities that this country is still not interested in acknowledging post-independence.\nThe disinformation game is now increasingly a part of our political makeup. It is unrealistic to assume it can be fought through regular humans playing defense on their screens.\nShahriar Shaams\u00a0is a contributor at The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "The administrative void that existed for three days following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as prime minister of the country ended when an interim government, headed by Dr Muhammad Yunus, took charge on Thursday evening. The Supreme Court, in response to a presidential reference before the swearing-in ceremony, had issued a ruling clearing the way for the formation of the interim government on which students and general people are pinning high expectations. Why wouldn't they? This interim government is a product of an upsurge that the people of this country have never witnessed. Hundreds of people were killed, and properties worth billions of Taka destroyed during the movement, spearheaded by students. No one knows for sure how long this administration will last, but it would undoubtedly face tough challenges if it embarks on the task of reforming the affairs of the state. For now, it has a couple of formidable tasks--- restoration of the law and order, which has virtually collapsed, and resumption of the economic activities in full swing--- in its hand. The mass upsurge against autocracy, graft, and plundering of national resources has some clear goals, the first and foremost being the reform of the key national institutions. The composition of the interim government is a mixed bag of activists, law practitioners, former bankers, army personnel, professionals, lawyers, students, etc. None of them are politicians, and many have never had any prior experience in government. That said, this is a nonpartisan group and the formation of this government has been made on consensus and upon discussion with various political parties except the ousted Awami League. Reforms, constitutional and beyond, will bring forth some problems. Legal experts have stated some reforms that most people aspire to see will require constitutional changes. Any constitutional amendment will require a vote from two-thirds of the members of parliament. The various mainstream and smaller political parties want to see a timeline for the interim administration and early holding of free and fair polls. A significant non-political mass movement has ousted a political government, but uncertainty has gripped the country. The present interim government has yet to state a specific timeline for holding general elections, which is a significant sticking point. Much blood has been spilled, and it is necessary to get it right. In the aftermath of the anti-autocratic movement in 1990 that toppled President H.M. Ershad, the major political parties had made public pledges to enact change. History will testify that these pledges were ignored by both Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which had held power alternatively since then, except during a 2-year term of the last caretaker government. Students' demands have changed, and they are not interested in mere pledges. They now want to see results.  How the interim government will accommodate the students on the one hand and parties on the other needs to be seen. This government must give a timeline within which it will prepare the ground for holding a free-and-fair general election. It cannot be an open-ended affair - that will not be accepted by the mainstream political parties. The country cannot afford another major upheaval as the economy is already in significant trouble. The timeline issue must be addressed soon so that the interim government has scope to rebuild a shattered economy. However, through the interim administration, the students need to get all parties pledge-bound to enforce reforms and bring about necessary changes within a stipulated time to materialise the people's dream for a discrimination-free Bangladesh.",

        "full_article": "In principle, free trade means the free movement of goods, services, capital and people across borders. In practice, it means national policies and regulatory objectives put greater or lesser constraints on the movement of each. It is how the Dictionary of Trade Policy Terms [P-181; Fifth Edition; Cambridge University Press, 2007] defines free trade, adding that the meaning of 'free trade' has changed over the decades. For instance, in the case of American policy, free trade meant a tariff under 20 per cent in the early 19th century. By the middle of the 20th century, it meant a tariff of less than 5 per cent. Thus, the tariff level is critical to understanding a country's trade liberalisation process, which emphasises the gradual or complete removal of existing trade impediments in goods and services. Free trade is the ultimate aim of trade liberalisation.During the final phase of the Second World War, leaders of the Allied Powers, Britain and the United States (US) started to plan a new world order where free trade was one of the major priorities. To that end, 44 nations gathered at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA, and decided to launch three international institutions: the International Monetary Fund (IMF; the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), later known as the World Bank; and the International Trade Organization (ITO). Though the first IMF and World Bank became a reality in later years, ITO never came into existence due to the non-cooperation of the USA, whereas it was planned to deal with the real side of trade relations and promote a liberal trade regime. Instead, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the codification of a set of mutual tariff reductions agreed by 23 nations in Geneva in 1947, became the framework of trade relations globally. In 1995, GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is a modern-day form of the ITO planned eighty years ago. WTO is a multilateral body that discusses, negotiates, and resolves trade issues, covering goods, services, intellectual property, and other issues. It is also designated to assist in resolving trade disputes and overseeing national trade policies to facilitate free trade. It is relevant to ask to what extent the WTO contributed to reducing tariffs and liberalising trade among nations during its thirty years of existence. In the last three decades, global trade has surged significantly, reaching over US$30.4 trillion in 2023, registering a fivefold growth since 1995. Between 1995 and 2023, total global trade-goods and commercial services-grew strongly, 5.8 per cent annually on average.There has also been a clear downward trend in tariffs since the WTO was established in 1995. Statistics available with the WTO showed that the simple average tariff applied by WTO members on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis has declined from 13.1 per cent to 8.8 per cent from 1995 to 2022. A similar trend emerges for tariffs applied on a trade-weighted basis, with the average MFN tariff dropping from 7.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent. Again, between 1996 and 2022, the trade-weighted average of applied tariffs dropped from 6.9 per cent to 2.0 per cent, respectively. But is it solely WTO's contribution? The answer is no. Instead, two other international organisations known as Bretton Wood twins also played a critical role in this connection.Tariff reduction is the primary and most significant move to reform the trade regime of a country on the path to liberalisation. During the '80s and '90s, many highly protected economies were opened to world trade through trade policy reforms. Generally, three types of reforms were undertaken by the developing nations. These are (a) devaluing the local currencies and adopting competitive exchange rates, (b) abolishment of foreign exchange controls and conversion of quantitative import restrictions into tariffs, and (3) gradual reduction of the dispersion and level of those tariffs. In a paper titled 'The World Bank, the IMF, and the GATT/WTO: Which Institution Most Supported Trade Reform in Developing Economies?' economist Douglas A Irwin argued that in most cases, these reforms were undertaken unilaterally, often amid an economic crisis. He, however, acknowledged that the above-mentioned three international organisations 'supported and encouraged the reform efforts.'The paper, published by the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics in 2022, highlights the unilateral efforts of developing economies to reduce tariffs. Between 1983 and 2003, these economies undertook most tariff reductions unilaterally, leading to a significant decline in the average applied tariff rate from 29.90 per cent to 11.30 per cent. Of the total cut of 18.60 percentage points, 12.30 percentage points were unilateral, demonstrating their strong commitment to trade reform.Again, in 2001-13, tariffs were reduced from 7.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent on average, and most of the reduction in applied tariffs of developing nations was made unilaterally. Of this 2.6 percentage point decline, unilateral liberalisation accounts for 1.3 percentage points, WTO commitments for 1.0 percentage points, and regional agreements for 0.3 percentage points. Citing the example of India, the paper mentioned that India's tariff fell from 30.0 per cent to 9.7 per cent over this period, almost all of which was done unilaterally.Bangladesh was not committed to reduce tariffs under the WTO due to its Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Nevertheless, the country's MFN simple average tariff rate declined from 26.70 per cent in 1998 to 15.30 per cent in 2005 mainly due to conditions set in the IMF and WB assistance programmes. The country's MFN tariff rate declined slowly further and came down to 14.10 per cent in 2023. Irwin concluded that finance ministries and central banks were the key actors in all the countries that undertook extensive reforms to open their economies during the '80s and '90s. He also added that 'the Bank, the Fund, and the GATT/WTO contributed in some way and in some countries in this effort, but often more indirectly than directly.' A missing point here is that finance ministries and central banks were largely driven by the Bank and the Fund to undertake the reform programmes including reduction of tariffs.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Business and politics are totally separate entities and should never mix. Unfortunately in Bangladesh, the two have become so mixed up that the line between the two has become almost blurred. This has resulted in a troubling synergy between politicians and businessmen, with the primary objective of moneymaking. Politics is conducted like a business transaction, while business deals often required strong political connections. The contamination of the administration by money and power is so pervasive that it demands a thorough cleansing. The recent commotion in the Bangladesh Garment Manu-facturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) building where over two hundred of its members expressed their non-confidence in the current board of directors highlights the critical need to keep trade bodies independent from political influence. Citing the current board's controversial role during the recent quota-reforms movement and their failure to take any decisive actions since the board was formed over six months back, the BGMEA members demanded the dissolution of the current board and the formation of a new non-political leadership as soon as possible. It underscores the dangers of allowing political agendas to infiltrate trade organisations, which are meant to serve the interests of industries and the economy. When trade organisations are led by individuals with strong political ties, the risk of their decisions being influenced by political agendas rather than the genuine needs of the industry increases. This can lead to actions that harm the industry's reputation, both domestically and internationally, as well as undermine the confidence of key stakeholders, including buyers and investors.The garment plays a crucial role in Bangladesh's economy, accounting for over 84 per cent of the country's annual exports. Any mismanagement or politically motivated decision-making within the BGMEA can have severe consequences, not just for the garment sector but for the entire economy. The recent turmoil, including the failure to address the industry's needs during a period of significant unrest, has already led to substantial financial losses and a decline in buyer confidence.Moreover, the politicisation of trade bodies is not limited to the BGMEA. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), the apex trade body of businesses in Bangladesh, has also suffered from political interference. The effectiveness of the FBCCI has been significantly undermined, particularly at a time when businesses are facing unprecedented challenges. The recent unrest has brought many businesses to a standstill, with factories and enterprises struggling to operate due to security risks.Despite these challenges, the FBCCI has been unable to fulfill its crucial role of supporting and advocating for businesses. One of the key reasons for this failure is the politicisation of its leadership. Over the past decade, the leaders of the FBCCI have often been chosen not through a transparent, participatory election but rather through consensus among hopefuls, many of whom are backed by ruling parties. This process deprives the business community of the opportunity to choose their leaders based on merit and the needs of the industry. As a result, the FBCCI's leadership has often been more aligned with political interests than with the genuine concerns of businesses.The crises within both the BGMEA and the FBCCI serve as stark reminders of the importance of keeping trade bodies free from political interference. These organisations play a vital role in supporting industries that are essential to Bangladesh's economy. However, when their leadership is compromised by political agendas, their ability to fulfill this role is severely diminished. It is, therefore, imperative that trade bodies like the BGMEA and FBCCI maintain their independence, prioritise transparency, and focus solely on the best interests of the industries they represent. The time has come for a fundamental shift.[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "There are reports of fires, looting, and robbery in different parts of the country. In Dhaka's Mohammadpur area, news of a robbery was announced through the mosque's microphone, urging everyone to be cautious and alert. Additionally, there have been reports of small traders being robbed, with some incidents broadcasted live on Facebook. These incidents are occurring at mid-night, leaving many people concerned. Considering the situation, it is crucial to form neighborhood watch committees in every city community. Students, supported by Ansar forces, should help maintain traffic order in all areas. Furthermore, a committee should be established to ensure the safety of small traders in each neighbourhood. It's also vital to ensure that university dormitories are not occupied by unauthorised groups.Additionally, a special committee should be formed to protect the lives and properties of minorities, ensuring that they are not targeted or attacked. In the event of any untoward incident, it is essential to inform the army immediately. Unity is our greatest strength in these challenging times.We urge the interim government to ensure the security of life and property and restore law and order across the country. In many places, students have taken the responsibility of protecting Hindu religious sites, which is highly commendable. As citizens, everyone should work to establish the freedom of speech and the right to dissent.Nasir HussainDhanmondi, Dhaka",
