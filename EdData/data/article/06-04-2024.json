For young people in the world\u2019s largest democracy, shouldn\u2019t this be a powerful coming-of-age moment? An awareness campaign pitches, Mera pehla vote desh ke liye \u2013 my first vote for the country. But Apne liye \u2013 for myself \u2013 ought to be an equally strong motivation. And yet, TOI analysis indicates that only 38% of 18/19-year-olds have registered to vote so far. The disenfranchisement thus indicated is worrying.\nUn-settled |\u00a0One obvious reason is the extent to which the young are not \u2018settled\u2019, unlike their parents. Places they are getting coaching, admission, apprenticeships, jobs (skilled or unskilled), maybe completely different from the family address. This may help explain the low numbers in Bihar and UP, at 17% and 23% respectively. These are poor states with high out-migration. But then why does Chhattisgarh, in broadly the same basket as them, have a whole 54% of 18/19-year-olds registered to vote? There could be social-cultural factors at play in Chhattisgarh that are encouraging democratic participation.\n\nUn-activated | India is in crowded company, when it comes to getting the young to vote. Lowering systemic barriers is the common mobilisation effort, which all countries should focus on. In India\u2019s case, delay in activating remote voting for all is clearly costing it young votes, as well as votes of older migrants. But to mention another puzzling contrast, how has the hill state of Himachal pulled off 60% registration while adjoining Uttarakhand crawls at 35%? Telangana has an impressive 67%, next door Andhra Pradesh is 17 percentage points behind. Access is part of the answer. But clearly, not the whole of it.\nUn-satisfied |\u00a0Rich and politicised Kerala has only 38% registration. Richer Delhi, high-buzz heart of national politics, has only 21%. What is going on? Perhaps 18/19-year-olds are refusing to register to vote to express dissatisfaction with the political discourse. Or with the candidates. The numbers show little excitement among first-time voters to head towards the polling booths. And this is bad news for Indian democracy. That its young are not feeling seen and heard. Greybeard moral lectures and talk of voting as duty, would miss the point completely.\n\n",

Candidates are decided for 191 seats in 23 states that vote, in one-go or in phases, on April 19 and 26.\nSingle shot |\u00a0Tamil Nadu votes in a single phase on April 19. DMK seems the clear frontrunner. But for AIADMK \u2013 still unsure post Jayalalithaa \u2013 LS elections are a moment of reckoning. BJP roped in several small parties into NDA, and its bringing in PMK as a partner was another setback for AIADMK. Ramadoss\u2019s party has significant influence in north TN, and is contesting on 10 of the state\u2019s 39 seats. For BJP, it\u2019s a battle for the alliance to be number 2, with state leader Annamalai mounting a far more vocal opposition to DMK than AIADMK has done so far.\n\nDouble take |\u00a0Karnataka, which will hold the first of its two-phase election on April 26, is where Modi kicked off his 2024 LS campaign \u2013 Kalaburgi being Kharge turf. While Kalaburgi votes next phase, constituencies that\u2019ll see sparks fly, and high-level if not high-quality drama, are Mandya and Bangalore Rural. In 2019, incumbent MP Sumalatha, an Independent with BJP support, defeated JDS\u2019s Gowda Jr HDK in Mandya. This time, HDK is NDA\u2019s candidate. Sumalatha\u2019s threat of fighting HDK as an Independent came up short \u2013 she joined BJP on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in Bangalore Rural, it\u2019s deputy CM DKS\u2019s brother fighting Deve Gowda\u2019s son-in-law. One, fasten your seat belts. Two, there\u2019s no getting away from family for either alliance.\nThree to tango |\u00a0Rifts within alliances are also all too evident across seats. The most dramatic example is perhaps Wayanad. CPI fielded a candidate against Rahul, and BJP is also in the fray. Kerala, per local pundits, is headed for an interesting election. Congress has lost some of its mojo. And Left vs BJP has become an interesting fight.\nFour together |\u00a0Bihar BJP\u2019s Sushil Modi\u2019s cancer diagnosis is unfortunate. But as alliances go, four-party NDA is going strong. Nitish is back with BJP. But it\u2019s Modi\u2019s popularity the alliance is banking on. His combative campaign in Jamui on Thursday was a show of strength. RJD-Congress has a job on its hands.\n\n",

Like handvo, the preparation of which involved elaborate pre-cooking arrangements.\nA batter made from dals and rice was fermented overnight in curd, and was ladled out along with grated vegetables into a metal container which was put into a hole dug in the earthen courtyard of the house. Hot embers were placed in the cavity, and the container put atop them with more burning coals on the lid, which was sealed off.\nThe container would finally be opened to reveal the handvo, with its golden-brown crust which exhaled a tantalising aroma and concealed a soft centre. Bliss was never more ful.\nWhen I mentioned handvo to Bunny she found an online recipe and, thanks to modern technology, made a perfect handvo without digging holes or using fire-hazardous embers. As I ate the warm handvo with chilled yogurt, I remembered a line I\u2019d read: Home is the food you ate in your childhood.

        "full_article": "Narrow passages filled with traffic of pedalled rickshaws, pushcarts and modern high speed motorised vehicles in a mad race to overtake one another in the old part of the city called Old Dhaka is a fraught spectacle to watch day in day out. Add to it, the tumbledown structures that line either side of those alleys housing chemical depots in the basements and living quarters on the upper floors. Small wonder that disastrous fires engulf different areas of the Old Dhaka from time to time, taking a heavy toll on lives and property. For instance, the Nimtali fire of 2010 that claimed about 124 lives and the Chawkbazar fire of 2019 that took 70 lives originated from the chemical depots. So, following Nimtali fire, the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), since 2013, has stopped issuing business permits for chemical warehouses in that part of the city and then ceased renewing trade licence for such businesses after Chowkbazar fire in 2019. Temporary relocation of Old Dhaka's chemical depots to Shyampur industrial estate began from June 4, 2022. But the relocation of some 1,924 chemical depots situated in Old Dhaka as identified by the investigating teams formed as per the Cabinet Division's directive is yet to gather pace. Against this backdrop, the DSCC mayor, while speaking at a recent discussion meet in the city aimed to unlock Old Dhaka's immense business potential so far stymied by traffic gridlock, issued warning to the effect that a strong drive in that part of the city would follow the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr to relocate business entities trading in hazardous chemicals to Syampur. If past experience is any guide, nothing moves in this country until the authority in question puts its foot down. With the removal of the combustible chemicals from its buildings, the full economic potential of Old Dhaka could be unleashed. Some experts pointed out, Old Dhaka being one of the largest business hubs of the country, contributes about 20 per cent to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Even so, its actual potential remains still unrealised as its extreme traffic gridlock eats away precious working hours valued at around Tk1.4 billion every day.As a cradle of important historical sites, consider its potential for drawing tourists from across the world. So, even after clearing Old Dhaka of its hazardous chemical contents, the next step should be to revitalise Old Dhaka to give it a better look. This can be done by demolishing the old, about-to-collapse, ramshackle buildings of no historical value, but renovating the heritage structures. That would make it a better place to live in and, at the same time, be able to draw more sightseers to boost the area's economic worth. In truth, the problem of gridlock is not solely a curse of the older part of the city. To be fair, the entire country is bedevilled by unplanned urbanisation all across its length and breadth and the unbearable traffic mess is incidental to this haphazard development. Obviously, it has played its part to deprive the country of its economic growth at the desired pace. According to an estimate, the resulting overall GDP loss comes to around 2.9 per cent of the total. It is time the authorities looking after the city began to act and transform it into a safer and better place to live in.",

        "full_article": "At a time when power and energy prices are soaring in Bangladesh, the old issue of developing its proven domestic coal reserves comes to the fore. For over 15 years, energy planners in Bangladesh have dabbled with import-only fossil fuels to keep wheels of the economy turning. Undoubtedly, the country prospered in the fields of agriculture and industry. Things began to go awry due to external geo-political issues that have resulted in import-only fuel supply prices on its head and made it literally impossible for Bangladesh to foot the energy bills. With the growing political influence of the import lobby came one decision after another (at policy level) to build a power sector that is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. The issue of developing its own proven coal reserves were left on the backburner, despite having generated interest of international mining companies and having access to foreign finance to develop these mines. The government caved in to unrealistic demands of a small coterie of so-called intellectuals and so-called 'experts' and did not heed the warnings of its own professionals engaged in publicly owned companies and energy professionals.The battle was lost before it could begin and today, it has the power infrastructure to produce power, but it can't afford the energy needed to fire up those plants. To cut a long story short, the country now has over-capacity in power production but is sorely lacking in other areas of the energy infrastructure and now there is neither money nor time to rectify the mistakes that were at least 10 years in the making. So, Bangladesh is now suffering from energy poverty. Still claims are being made from certain quarters about finding some mythical gas field here or there that will solve the energy problem \"any day now\". Sadly, for both bulk (industry) and retail consumers of energy (pre-paid / post-paid gas or electricity) are regularly subjected to upward revisions of energy bills. The common excuse that's given is that state companies involved in the import and sale of these energy supplies have been suffering massive losses. Entire industrial sectors have developed over this period on the promise of cheap energy. Suddenly when subsidies on this energy or power are withdrawn, it's expected that industry will somehow \"manage\" this cost increase. It speaks volumes for the strange manner in which energy planning is done in this country. Given the macroeconomic situation, the country can ill afford capacity payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to domestic and foreign power producers. It can't even manage to pay the international energy companies engaged in gas production. Inevitably, the rate of power cuts will increase, as will the failure to supply requisite gas to consumers. Since industrial production is more important than residential consumers, the latter will have to suffer more than the former. Even then, recent media reports have stated that many small and medium industries are going belly-up all over the country because they simply cannot foot the new utility bills.There has been renewed interest in developing domestic untapped coal reserves. However, if past events are anything to go by, the import lobby with its massive clout and influence over national energy policy-making, will move heaven-and-earth to delay any serious government effort to tap into its own coal reserves. These delaying tactics have been witnessed before. For instance, the decade-long inertia to revise the production sharing contract (PSC) only helped a small coterie of self-serving, private sector group to get fat off government largesse that came through the opaque contracts inked with independent power producers (IPPs) and helped build a solely import-dependent liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure. Coal was left in peace under the ground. These days, there are debates about whether the country will stick to its failed experiment of mine-mouth evacuation (underground mining) of coal, or go for 'open-pit' mining. The usual suspects --- the pseudo-intellectual individuals who wrongly influenced government decision-making 12 years ago and landed the government and the economy in this mess --- are up in arms again. The fact that Bangladesh is a US$100 billion economy that requires massive amounts of energy and power to keep growing continues to elude a section of half-baked \"energy experts\", who have neither the requisite technical knowledge, nor of how far things have developed in the world of mining, keep harping on the same old tune. In the final analysis of things, it's up to national policymakers to either develop cheap sources of energy domestically (on which it will have control) or keep importing energy from international sources. The question is whether the state will continue to be held hostage to international market price dictates or chart a course to self-sufficiency in energy.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "As the Eid-ul-Fitr draws near, the country is also gearing up for an extended public holiday to celebrate the most significant religious and national festival. This year, the Eid holiday will merge with another national festival, Pahela Boishakh, the first day on the traditional Bangla calendar. Thus, almost a week-long public holiday will be there at a stretch, starting from April 10. The official Eid holidays will be observed until April 12 and the next day is Saturday or a regular weekly holiday. The day after or, April 14 is another holiday for Pahela Boishakh. Last week, a proposal was made in the cabinet to declare April 9 as a public holiday to ease the excessive pressure on the Eid journey. The cabinet rejected the proposal, probably because it may create a holiday trap. Nevertheless, it is likely, as the previous years' experiences show that many of the government employees will start for their home districts from Dhaka by taking an additional leave on April 09, which is the 29th of Ramadan. The government has assumed that the Eid will be held on April 11 after completion of 30 days of Ramadan. Many have, however, started sending their family members by now as they will not get their official leave before 29th Ramadan. Thus, the Eid exodus will gather pace.Eid exodus in Bangladesh is the second largest in the world after Indonesia, the largest country in terms of Muslim population. It is already estimated that some 193 million people across the world's largest archipelagic state will travel to their home districts and villages this year. Of them, around 18 million will leave the Greater Jakarta area alone, which is expected to cause heavy traffic congestion on roads and highways. In Bangladesh, around 15 million people may join the Eid journey from greater Dhaka to other parts of the country. This means that around two-thirds of the inhabitants in the capital city may rush to their villages and hometowns to meet their near and dear ones during the Eid holidays. Managing the Eid exodus is challenging due to a lack of a well-coordinated and adequate public transport system. Exit from Dhaka becomes chaotic, worsening the traffic congestion on different points of the roads. Though north-bound, east-bound and south-bound highways have improved significantly with wider lanes and over-passes, some problems remain there. Makeshift markets on two sides of many highways, unauthorised bus stops here and there, unregulated presence of small vehicles like battery-run three-wheelers and motorcycles pose risks of accidents. Some unfit vehicles on the rivers are another big risk. An inadequate number of trains increases the troubles of the home goers during Eid. Growing reliance on motorcycles by many also enhances the risk of road accidents. Against this backdrop, an extended public holiday is helpful for people to pass some better time with their families and friends at home towns and villages. So, the holiday for Lailatul-Qadar on 27th Ramadan may be shifted to next day by seeking advice from the Islamic scholars as Muslims are advised to seek the blessed night in the last ten odd nights of Ramadan.Above all, the mass exodus during Eid indicates the uneven economic growth in the country over the decades. Instead of distributing the fruits of growth across the country in a balanced way, it becomes highly concentrated in the capital city. Limited decentralisation of education, health and job facilities drives many people to come to Dhaka at any cost. So, decentralisation is the ultimate solution to the problem of exodus during Eid, which can also reduce the risks of accidents and other troubles in the future. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

Beyond mere physical abstinence from food and drink, Ramadan is a period of spiritual growth. It emphasises strengthening one's relationship with the Almighty through acts of charity, kindness, and self-reflection. This sacred month teaches self-restraint, purification, and simplicity, urging Muslims to intensify their religious observances. Known as the month of mercy, forgiveness, and salvation, Ramadan holds profound significance.Despite its annual recurrence, the essence of Ramadan often eludes us, as corruption continues to rise and unethical practices reigns supreme in almost every field. Yet, the teachings of Ramadan offer guidance to steer clear of wrongdoing. This month serves as a time for spiritual cleansing through fasting, self-sacrifice, and prayer. Additionally, it prompts us to support those in need, embodying the spirit of compassion and generosity. As Muslims, it is our solemn duty to embrace these teachings and impart them to future generations, nurturing their understanding of Islam's ideals.\nShah Muntacher Hossain MihanStudentDepartment of Social Work Noakhali Science and Technology University [email\u00a0protected]",
