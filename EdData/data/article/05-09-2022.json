Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual or of any other orientation are often subjected to conversion or \u2018reparative\u2019 therapy, particularly when they are young, to change their sexual orientation or gender identity by force. The therapy can mean anything from psychiatric treatment, use of psychosomatic drugs, electroshock therapy, exorcism and violence. This can lead to trauma, manifesting in depression, anxiety, drug use, and even suicide. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry contends that the interventions offered in conversion therapy are provided under the \u201cfalse premise that homosexuality and gender diverse identities are pathological\u201d. The \u201cabsence of pathology\u201d means there is no need for conversion or any other like intervention. To drive this point home, it is clear that an all-out effort will be required. In his landmark June 2021 judgment, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras High Court had said pending adequate legislation, he was issuing guidelines for the police, social welfare ministries of the State and Centre, and the medical council for the protection of the community. The court sought updates from stakeholders every few months.The NMC\u2019s August 25 letter to State Medical Councils states that the Madras High Court had directed it to issue an official notification listing conversion therapy as a wrong, under the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. If the Supreme Court\u2019s decriminalising of homosexuality in 2018 by striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was a first step, the NMC\u2019s notice is also a small move towards inclusivity. To make the LGBTQAI+ community feel safer, however, a lot more will have to be done. Taking the cue from countries such as Canada, which has banned conversion therapy, there should be clarity on what action will be taken against quacks, psychiatrists and doctors accused of offering reparative treatment and the punishment they will face. The groundwork has to be laid in education. Medical textbooks prescribed in 2018 still consider lesbianism a \u201cperversion\u201d, an act of \u201cmental degenerates\u201d. The change has to take place at a societal level, and complemented by laws better tuned to the needs of a diverse community than the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, has sought to do. To that effect, Indian institutions and society have a long road ahead. First, they will have to acknowledge the \u201cvariability of human beings\u201d and accord equal respect to every one, whatever the sexual orientation or gender identity.",

Over recent weeks, China\u2019s military has carried out unprecedented military drills surrounding Taiwan, following the visit last month of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Some manoeuvres crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait and were declared by China\u2019s military to have also taken place in territorial waters claimed by Taiwan. Taiwan soberly chose not to engage the PLA vessels. In the wake of the drills, the Chinese military has subsequently sought to continue asserting Beijing\u2019s territorial claims by sending drones into Taiwan\u2019s airspace. Photographs taken up close of Taiwan military personnel were subsequently shared on social media, apparently to demonstrate Beijing\u2019s capabilities, but in the process raising pressure on Taipei to show a response. Taiwan\u2019s military said it took the decision to shoot down what it called an unidentified civilian drone over its airspace in Shiyu Island after delivering several warnings. Shooting down a military drone may have elicited a different response from China, which has so far played down the incident. While the Chinese military reportedly has been deploying both military and civilian-use drones, so have ordinary residents in Fujian right across the strait, raising the risks of miscalculation triggering a serious incident.The deployment of drones has added a further layer of unpredictability to an already tense situation. The past month\u2019s developments have certainly served a reminder to the region of the fragility of the current status quo, and particularly of China\u2019s willingness to change it. While most observers expect that a Chinese invasion remains too risky a prospect for the Communist Party leadership in the immediate future, an unintended escalation no longer remains a remote possibility. Most countries, including India, have preferred to stay out of the Taiwan issue, considering the One China Policy and the needs of the complicated relations with China. But sooner rather than later, they will need to assess the implications to their own security interests of a serious crisis. Taiwan\u2019s status as a lynchpin in the global semiconductor industry is a case in point. While India\u2019s recent reference to the \u201cmilitarisation\u201d of the strait is not a reflection of a major change in its approach, New Delhi has appeared to show greater willingness to do more with Taiwan particularly in the economic realm, such as setting up an alternative base for semi-conductor manufacturing in India. These are, even if long overdue, steps in the right direction.",

Powered by a massive young demographic waiting to burst into the middle class and a robust digital ecosystem, India is certain to grow bigger in coming years. SBI Research indicates that India could become the third largest economy before this decade ends. India has survived the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war avoiding the surging inflation and energy crisis that\u2019s hit countries like the UK. In hindsight, GoI has been proved right in its resolve to not run up a high fiscal deficit, despite pressure to imitate the West\u2019s overgenerous stimulus packages.\nThe growth path ahead needs more such out-of-the-box thinking. The primary challenge is to prepare enough people to participate in the country\u2019s future growth trajectory. The low GDP per capita and the continuing Covid relief package providing free foodgrains for 80 crore people are pointers to low-individual productivity, signifying that the macro represented by GDP numbers is only one part of the big picture. The success in lifting millions of people out of extreme poverty was no small feat. But the next step, of replicating East Asian countries that have relied on manufacturing to take the masses out of agriculture, awaits.\nIndia\u2019s GDP per capita of around $2,500 is in large part dragged down by farm households; their average annual income is just $1,500. For decades, India hasn\u2019t focussed enough in areas like education, skilling and healthcare. Against Unesco\u2019s Education 2030 Framework for Action\u2019s appeal to countries to spend 4-6% of GDP on education, India\u2019s central and state combined budgeted expenditure on education in 2021-22 was just 3% of GDP.\nSuch budgeting constraints make the freebies debate relevant. The state plays a crucial role in the lives of poor people. Instead of swaying them with populism, schemes that can improve human capital must be welfare priorities. To achieve this end, states spending recklessly require transparent budgeting. Centre must also reciprocate by devolving more tax revenues to states, and avoid the cess route of resource mobilisation. Ultimately, these Centre-state tangles reflect inadequate private sector job creation that increases reliance on governments. More economic reforms are needed. All parties in government must realise that every government must be in reform mode, that\u2019s a prerequisite for mass prosperity.\n\u00a0\n\n",

The ZeNix phase III clinical trial that has shown the above result has been conducted in Georgia, Moldova, Russia and South Africa, but it is in India that it may end up having the maximum impact. This is because of the straightforward reason that India has the world\u2019s highest burden of the disease, including its multidrug-resistant strains. A simpler, shorter drug protocol here will translate into greater compliance and cure.\nBut India\u2019s long struggle against TB makes it clear that no new process or compound can be a magic fix for the complex therapeutic chain that is crying for an overhaul at multiple points. For example, a government survey finds that a high 63% of the chest symptomatic do not seek healthcare. This reflects the shortfalls of public awareness campaigns but also the broken primary care links that were exposed by Covid. Lack of timely diagnosis of TB is of a piece with the overall gaps in disease surveillance.\nHow much Covid set back India\u2019s fight against TB can be gauged by 2019-20 seeing its mortality rate increase by 11% even as there was a 25% reduction in the number of cases reported. But even besides the pandemic\u2019s interruptions, the public supply of free drugs that is generous on paper does not actually flow smoothly on the ground, barring some islands of excellence in the metros. Science may invent medical miracles daily, but ultimately it is public healthcare that has to take them to the masses. At the latter end, Indians await a pronounced upgrade.\n\n",

        "full_article": "1.\nThe history of advertising in Bengal is as old as the history of modern print media in Asia. The first Asian newspaper -- The Calcutta General Advertiser -- was published from the British Bengal in 1780. The first advertising agency in Bengal, B Datram and Company, came in 1905, followed by the India-Advertising Company in 1907, and the Calcutta Advertising agency in 1909. The functions of those agencies were to collect advertisements from business organisations and to get them published in the press. The first multinational agency, J Walter Thompson, was launched in India in 1926 to serve the General Motors company. Subsequently, a few more multinational agencies started working in India -- SH Benson in 1928, a British agency that was later renamed as Ogilvy & Mather; Hindustan Thompson Associates in 1929; and Lintas India Limited in 1939.\nAdvertising before 1947 was based in Calcutta initially, and later in Bombay. East Bengal had been left out of colonial India's development process. It was basically a monsoon dominated rice-jute economy with no major industrial background before the Partition. It was throughout a hinterland during the British period for building up the wealth and prosperity of Calcutta. East Bengal occupied only 12 per cent of the total industrial enterprises of undivided Bengal in 1947.\n2.\nDuring the Pakistan period, advertisements were mostly made in West Pakistan but released in East Pakistan for creating a market for West Pakistani enterprises. The first advertising agency in Dhaka was Green Ways Publicity which was established by Gulam Mohiuddin in 1948. Dhaka-based advertising practice started in the mid-1950s when the first full-fledged local agency, Eastland Advertising Company, was established by Salam Kabir.\nBy the mid-1960s, two multinational companies came to Dhaka, one is Lever International Advertising Services (LINTAS) and another one is the Karachi-based DJ Keymer & Co Asiatic Advertising Ltd which opened its branch in Dhaka under the name of East Asiatic Advertising Ltd in 1967 and changed its name to Asiatic Marketing Communications Ltd in 1994.\nTwo other big ad agencies -- Bitopi and Interspan (now Interspeed) -- came in the market simultaneously in the year 1967. It was a time when television just came to East Pakistan. Advertisements were mostly appearing in newspapers, radio and cinema halls. The first television advertisement in East Pakistan was a 30-minute weekly family drama named \"Ghoroa\", where different consumer items were publicised. At the beginning of 1968, telope ads (looks like a PowerPoint presentation) and movie advertisements arrived gradually. The backgrounds of those ads were gray in color, and the written text was in black and white. One slide comes after another with a voiceover like a silent movie. Before telope ads, there were only black and white print advertisements based on the features of the products and a tagline for sales. During that time, Lever Brothers introduced both toilet and washing soap by launching Lifebuoy and Lux.\nThe 1969 mass uprising against Ayub Khan had an impact on advertisements and then after March 26, 1971, it became evident that the people of East Pakistan had decided not to use any West Pakistani products. They started to use Peea Toothpaste instead of Tibbet and Collins. The telope ad of Peea Toothpaste, accompanied by an attractive jingle, was very popular at that time. East Asiatic, according to Aly Zaker, produced an ad on March 26, 1971 by writing Joy Bangla for the Crescent Jute Mill.\n3.\nAt the time of independence, only 19 per cent of the local entrepreneurs were Bangladeshis. The exploitation of Bangladesh's economic resources by West Pakistan created a deep sense of frustration in the minds of the then political leadership. Consequently, the first Bangladeshi government nationalised 92 per cent of all manufacturing industries in 1972. Private investment, both national and international, was discouraged, and the participation of the private sector was restricted to cottage, small and medium industries. Khan and Hossain (1989) indicate that \"the nationalisations of 1972 were widely interpreted as a major step towards effecting a socialist transformation of Bangladesh\" (p. 84). Therefore, we see the ad of Janata Bank, a state-owned bank, in 1972 pledging that it works for socialism.\nAs industrial and manufacturing activities became nationalised during 1972-75, the advertising practice was very much limited and mostly nationalised. Most ads usually appeared in print media, particularly national newspapers, while some appeared on national radio and television. Advertisements of different national banks, such as Sonali Bank and Janata Bank, Meril Petroleum and cigarette brands were very common in the newspapers. Telope advertising was common in cinema halls at that time. Except for Lever Brothers, no multinational company was active in the 1970s. Until 1980, Lever Brothers' toiletries had competition with local products of Kohinoor Chemical, namely Tibet soap, Tibet powder etc.\n4.\nBangladeshi advertising got in a good shape after the advent of color television in the early 1980s. Telope ads continued on BTV throughout the 80s though print media was still the dominant medium. It was about that time when competition between brands, such as Peps Gel vs Close-Up, began and it reflected on television commercials, which was an eye-opener for Bangladeshi marketers. Besides, different international companies started coming to Bangladesh from the early 1980s, and some local companies (e.g, Mala sharee, Anwar spoon, AP hair oil, Geco touch soap, Glory baby cloth, Nabisco biscuit, Haque biscuit, etc.) also began investing.\nLever Brothers was the key multinational player that played a significant role in Bangladeshi advertising throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It set the tone for Bangladeshi advertising and remained the largest spender until 2000. However, multinational companies did not consider existing local ad agencies professional and thus, there was a lack of trust between multinational companies and local ad agencies that kept Bangladeshi ad professionals in a vulnerable situation. This acted as an obstacle in developing confidence and professionalism among Bangladeshi professionals. Multinational companies used to go outside the country, particularly to India and Thailand, to ensure quality.\nThe advertisements of multinational companies, particularly cold drinks and soaps, became visible on BTV from the early 1980s. For drawing the attention of urban people, the payoff line of Lux was \"chitro tarokader shondorjo shaban\". Women in the Indian sub-continent have had a fascination towards film stars, so the advertisers tried to target the women by saying that if they use Lux, they will be as beautiful as film stars like Rakhi Gulzar. Besides, for Lifebuoy commercials, they picked football players as models because footballers were popular in the 1980s and 1990s Bangladesh. However, they have been replaced by cricketers now.\nIt may be mentioned that Bangladesh achieved significant progress in family planning from the 1980s. Advertising played a notable role in family planning campaigns. Here is an example of utilising the geographical uniqueness of Bangladesh as a riverine country, where boat was the principle means of transportation back then. Adcomm made an ad of a contraceptive, Raja Condom, on a sailing boat.\n5.\nFrom the 1990s, Bangladesh's economy experienced a significant transformation from an agriculture-based economy to a service-based economy. Within a decade of the private television channel boom, the number of viewers in Bangladesh increased by up to 33 per cent. Since the satellite channels were airing programs of superior quality, BTV, with its mediocre production quality, was finding it difficult to compete with new private channels.\nAdvertising became professional at that point. The changes were revolutionary as audiences were able to watch the rest of the world through satellite channels. Local clients started expressing many interests and advertising practitioners also tried to understand their demands, which previously did not get much attention. Bangladeshi advertising started what can be called \"scientific advertising\" in this period. Two large agencies -- Bitopi and Adcomm -- started using desktop publishing in 1994-96. New graphical technologies -- Glayva, flexography and offset printing -- brought a revolution in Bangladesh advertising at that time. The mid-nineties were a time when local agencies came into maturity. Choudhury (2008) writes, \"International advertising agencies compelled by their worldwide multinational clients were tying up with Bangladeshi advertising agencies. JWT, Ogilvy, Lintas, DDB, Bates, McCann, Leo Burnett all signed up affiliation agreements with the local big guns. Overnight we saw our billings hit previously unimaginable figures\".\n6.\nTelco companies have become major players in the Bangladeshi advertising industry from 2004-05, which set the trend for the last two decades. Bangladeshi ads started to reach international standards in terms of the quality of production during this time. Since the multinational telephone companies like Grameenphone, Banglalink, Airtel Bangladesh, Robi Axiata Ltd, among others, are the largest corporate groups in Bangladesh, they also dominate the country's advertising industry.\nBesides telco companies, some other major advertisers of this period include the real estate, private university, toiletries industries, home appliances, government and private banks, and beverage makers.\nThere are some local brands -- RC Cola, Keya, Mojo, Apex and Pran -- which came during this period. If telco commercials are considered as local advertising as they regulate everything from Bangladesh, then 70 per cent of the current Bangladeshi ads are now national, including that of local food, fast-moving consumer goods, clothing accessories, leather shoes, and others.\nCurrently, the advertising market in Bangladesh is worth about $1.8 billion, and the market is growing in volume by 10 per cent a year (Rahman, 2016). As of 2020, there are about 500 advertising agencies in the country and this sector employs more than ten thousand people. About 70 per cent of the advertisement market is dominated by some ten advertising agencies, i.e., Asiatic JWT, AdComm Ltd, Grey Advertising Bangladesh Ltd, Bitopi Advertising, Expressions, Mediacom Ltd, Ogilvy Bangladesh, Sun Communications, Unitrend Ltd and Interspeed.\nAdvertisements were more jingle-based until 2000, then it focused on storytelling in the following one-and-a-half decades, and currently it has moved into a problem-solution strategy.\n7.\nFrom 2000, local satellite channels became available for Bangladeshi audiences, and that gave them an opportunity to watch local content on local channels. Bangladeshi advertising gained maturity and professionalism during this period. The industry is now in transition as it heads toward digital advertising for meeting the demand of an emerging consumer class.\nThe demand for consumer goods was higher than the supply in the first decade, where one or two large companies dominated the market and could sell whatever they wanted to sell. Therefore, advertising had almost no progress in the first decade of independent Bangladesh. In the second stage, during the 1980s and mid-1990s, some big multinational companies, particularly Unilever, dominated Bangladeshi advertising which was dependent on external resources, mostly India and Thailand, for making its content. In the third stage, from the late 1990s to present, Bangladeshi advertising has come of age, with the presence of local companies as well as some giant multinational companies. Unilever and telco have dominated Bangladesh's advertising industry. Unilever was the key player for nearly three decades (1971-2000) and is still considered one of the biggest spenders. Telco has taken over Unilever's position since 2000.\nDr Khorshed Alam is an Associate Professor at the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism, University of Dhaka.

The rise of popularity for content from local OTT platforms has rejuvenated Bangladesh's mainstream entertainment industry \u2013 especially since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 when public entertainment options such as cinema halls and concerts were no longer an option. Now, these platforms have triggered a cultural regeneration in terms of what we in Bangladesh view as go-to digital entertainment. Most importantly, OTT platforms have allowed for local artists to make a living out of their creativity, no matter what their background. Content on such platforms also works out well for viewers as they can subscribe to each platform at more and more affordable rates, being able to avoid the nuisance caused by commercial breaks aired during traditional television content. Such success of OTT content and their large-scale recognition has given us renewed hope for the future of the country's entertainment scene.\nFor our OTT platforms to flourish, we need creative and critical minds to be able to explore and tell nuanced stories about people and the society at large. However, we are alarmed that, in addition to the repressive laws that are already suppressing freedom of expression in the digital sphere, the government wants to introduce even more restrictions for OTT Platforms. The (draft) BTRC Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms, if passed, could arbitrarily criminalise the content aired on OTT platforms based on vague criteria. The broad terms presented in the draft \u2013 prohibiting content that, for instance, \"is offensive, false or threatening and insulting or humiliating to a person\" or that threatens the \"unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign states\" \u2013 indicate just how limiting it could be for artists and their creative abilities on digital platforms. We wonder whose good is being prioritised when such regulations are proposed, given the sweeping restrictions it would impose on creators and artists for OTT platforms.\nNow that the entertainment industry of Bangladesh is flourishing again after many years of hiatus, with people choosing locally-made content both in theatres and online, it is crucial the authorities do everything possible to help our artists fulfil their creative potential. OTT platforms have made making films and shows a more accessible process, allowing all genres to exist and succeed in one place. Besides recognition, creators must be given assistance, and not be muzzled, in achieving their creative vision.\n",

        "full_article": "Henry Kissinger is not a popular person in Bangladesh. As a national security adviser of the US government, he opposed the creation of Bangladesh during Nixon's presidency. Later, he called the country a \"bottomless basket.\" This was not the first instance where he offended a nation or made a controversial statement. He advocated a protracted stalemate during the Iran\u2010Iraq War (1980\u201388) to sustain American influence in the region. Nearly\u00a0half a million people died. In 2012, he said, \"In 10 years, there will be no more Israel.\" His tacit support for the Chinese government's crackdown to end the student protest in 1989 was not received favourably by the advocates of democracy. At 99, he remains controversial for his dispassionate views.\nRecently, he suggested that Ukraine should settle with Russia by relinquishing its territorial claims to Crimea and granting autonomy to the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics. On August 13, 2022, in an interview with RT, he stated, \"We are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created, without any concept of how this is going to end or what it's supposed to lead to.\" Specifically, he was concerned about the current state of power disequilibrium among China, Russia, and the US.\nIf unchecked, the current disequilibrium could lead to World War III. This has been the observation of many, including UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. On August 1, 2022, at a global meeting on nuclear weapons, he warned that the world was just \"one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\" We must come out of this disequilibrium through peaceful negotiations.\nDespite the controversy, Kissinger's statement on disequilibrium should be reckoned with. He observed a similar disequilibrium during the 1970s and was directly involved in establishing a new equilibrium by ending the Vietnam War and opening the door to China. Over the years, that equilibrium fell apart because of many reasons: the breakup of the Soviet Union; rise of China and emerging nations; globalisation; technology and IT revolution; social media; economic growth disparity; demographic shift; and rise of nationalism.\nKissinger's views on international relations reveal a doctrine-like pattern. It can be encapsulated in three Ps: power, purpose, and pragmatism. Power dynamics is his core. He plays the power card by accepting reality. During the Vietnam peace negotiations, he retained America's supremacy by sharing power. To him, a war without a \"purpose\" or an end in sight is a meaningless undertaking. That is how he reasoned to put an end to the Vietnam war. He also advocates the realpolitik school of thoughts, which puts practical interests of nations over ideological positions. Reaching out to China was an example of his \"pragmatism.\"\nEvidently, a protracted war is not a desirable outcome for Russia. However, it will not be able to stop the war if America drags it. Lingering the stalemate to weaken Russia is an untested hypothesis. A no-compromise power play with mounting deaths and destruction is not justifiable. Inflation, unemployment, food shortages and starvation\u00a0are not defensible. The world is paying heavily for a senseless war. This is neither pragmatic, nor morally acceptable.\nHow do we end this war? Literally, it depends on the \"will\" of the two superpowers: Russia and the US. China is not directly involved in Ukraine. However, a US victory in Ukraine is not in its national interest. In the US, China is perceived as the \"rising superpower\" \u2013 as described by Graham Allison's \"Thucydides Trap\" term. Most nations in the world are helpless observers and have very little influence on the current war and its consequences.\nWorld leaders should seriously consider ending this war and establishing a new equilibrium. A negotiated outcome in Ukraine could advance a new world order encompassing change in geopolitics, economics, culture, technology, and security. We can achieve this through multilateral negotiations. The end result should a) acknowledge the power of the hegemons; b) revisit the UN structure for reform; c) restart the nuclear disarmament talks; d) establish a multipolar world; and e) offer a sustainable peace.\nHere's hoping we can come to an agreement soon. Failing to do so, the world could descend to a different kind of equilibrium after a nuclear holocaust. Definitely, that is not what we want.\n\u00a0\nDr Abu NM Waheeduzzaman is a professor of marketing and international business at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, US.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "High-level state visits between Bangladesh and India always carry importance for both the countries. This time is no exception. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India is taking place at a time when the world is trying to recover from Covid-19 fallout and is reeling from the effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. High inflationary pressure, fuel and food crises, and low job growth have crippled many economies around the world. International organisations have forecast that this situation will not be normal before 2024.\nUnfortunately, when an economic crisis of such nature and scale occurs, countries resort to protectionism instead of cooperation as they want to protect their own interests first \u2013 the pandemic has shown us that. This inward-looking strategy leads to further inequalities between advanced and poor countries. Hence, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India on September 5-8, 2022 is critical for Bangladesh. This visit is expected to resolve some economic and political issues that are mutually beneficial.\nSharing water of common rivers, long-term supply of fuel oil from India to Bangladesh, unhindered supply of essential commodities, withdrawal of anti-dumping duty on jute exports from Bangladesh, removal of other non-tariff barriers on exports from Bangladesh, speeding up rail, road and waterway connectivity, and border security and management are some of the issues that are likely to be on the discussion table.\nAs far as the economic issues are concerned, the Bangladesh-India relationship covers a wide range of sectors. Bilateral cooperation can only be meaningful if Bangladesh can benefit from this and leverage such cooperation for strengthened regional and global integration of its economy. We are currently on a journey towards dual graduation, during which Bangladesh will not only have to work on its strategies and policies, but also need support on a host of areas including trade, investment and finance from friendly countries.\nOver the last decade, a few initiatives have been undertaken to deepen bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade in goods, services and energy, multimodal transport connectivity, cross-border investment, capacity-building, people-to-people connectivity, and security measures. In the case of trade, it is not only about trade in goods, but there are also opportunities for trade in services and energy. In view of the emerging demands of Bangladesh's economy, there are opportunities for trade in services in healthcare and education, digital and information technology services, skills development, and technology transfer.\nBilateral trade between Bangladesh and India has been increasing over time; in 2021, the volume was over USD 14 billion. India has provided duty-free market access to Bangladesh under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) arrangement, which helped Bangladesh to increase its exports. In 2021, Bangladesh's export to India was about USD 2 billion. But Bangladesh's trade deficit with India is rising, and the country is yet to benefit from India's large import demand, which it fulfils from the global market.\nThe attempt to increase Bangladesh's exports to India is hindered by several challenges. The non-tariff barriers (NTBs) that India has put in place restrict the full utilisation of duty-free market access facility it offers to Bangladesh. India has imposed anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties on Bangladeshi exports. Another important NTB is the inadequate trade facilitation. This, of course, exists on both sides. Due to a lack of appropriate trade facilitation and good logistical arrangements, the cost of trading is high since time requirements for trade is high. This is discouraging for traders. Also, the land ports through which about half of the total bilateral trade between the two countries takes place are somewhat inefficient. So, the delay at the control and checkpoints increases the cost. Inspection also takes a long time, since results come from laboratories far from the border. Therefore, effective transport, investment and logistics connectivity can help increase trade between the two neighbours.\nBangladesh's graduation from LDC status will result in the loss of duty-free access to all markets, including in India under SAFTA. A joint study by Bangladesh and India has been prepared for new means for cooperation through the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). This is expected to help realise opportunities in areas of trade, transport and investment connectivity.\nBangladesh also requires huge financial resources to undertake its development activities. Following the graduation from the LDC category, most of such resources will have to be mobilised through higher revenue generation domestically. Given the continuous decline of funds from the developed countries, the importance of South-South cooperation has increased. Large developing countries such as India and China have emerged as major players in the landscape of South-South cooperation. The New Development Bank (NDB) and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) have the potential to help Bangladesh in accessing a greater amount of financial resources. In 2010, India committed to lend about USD 7.86 billion under three lines of credit (LCs). These are supposed to help Bangladesh implement some projects in economic, social and human capacity-building areas, and institutional strengthening. However, implementation of projects under the Indian LCs is very slow due to some conditionalities and the slow disbursement of funds. For effective utilisation of the LCs, these issues will have to be resolved.\nBangladesh is keen on enhanced investment and efficient connectivity. It has offered two special economic zones (SEZs) to India for private investment at Bheramara upazila in Kushtia and the coastal Mongla belt in Bagerhat. Bangladesh has allowed India to move goods between its western and northeastern states through Bangladesh's territory. It expects that the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreement (BBIN-MVA) signed in 2015 will facilitate movement of cargo-carrying vehicles across the borders and reduce costs significantly.\nDespite some positive initiatives, the path towards realisation of the potential benefits is still challenging due to the unresolved issues. This is not only unhealthy for Bangladesh and India, but also for the region. Collaboration between these two countries is an important factor for enhancing economic stability in South Asia, since all the other countries in the region have exposed their vulnerability. The people of Bangladesh are eagerly waiting to see the outcome of this high-profile state visit.\nDr Fahmida Khatun\u00a0is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).\u00a0Views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The evening of September 3, 2022 will remain memorable as the Blender's Choice\u2013The Daily Star OTT & Digital Content Awards 2021 paved the way for artists creating content on OTT platforms by rewarding them with the recognition they deserve. The rise of popularity for content from local OTT platforms has rejuvenated Bangladesh's mainstream entertainment industry \u2013 especially since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 when public entertainment options such as cinema halls and concerts were no longer an option. Now, these platforms have triggered a cultural regeneration in terms of what we in Bangladesh view as go-to digital entertainment. Most importantly, OTT platforms have allowed for local artists to make a living out of their creativity, no matter what their background. Content on such platforms also works out well for viewers as they can subscribe to each platform at more and more affordable rates, being able to avoid the nuisance caused by commercial breaks aired during traditional television content. Such success of OTT content and their large-scale recognition has given us renewed hope for the future of the country's entertainment scene.\nFor our OTT platforms to flourish, we need creative and critical minds to be able to explore and tell nuanced stories about people and the society at large. However, we are alarmed that, in addition to the repressive laws that are already suppressing freedom of expression in the digital sphere, the government wants to introduce even more restrictions for OTT Platforms. The (draft) BTRC Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms, if passed, could arbitrarily criminalise the content aired on OTT platforms based on vague criteria. The broad terms presented in the draft \u2013 prohibiting content that, for instance, \"is offensive, false or threatening and insulting or humiliating to a person\" or that threatens the \"unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign states\" \u2013 indicate just how limiting it could be for artists and their creative abilities on digital platforms. We wonder whose good is being prioritised when such regulations are proposed, given the sweeping restrictions it would impose on creators and artists for OTT platforms.\nNow that the entertainment industry of Bangladesh is flourishing again after many years of hiatus, with people choosing locally-made content both in theatres and online, it is crucial the authorities do everything possible to help our artists fulfil their creative potential. OTT platforms have made making films and shows a more accessible process, allowing all genres to exist and succeed in one place. Besides recognition, creators must be given assistance, and not be muzzled, in achieving their creative vision.\n",

        "full_article": "Against the backdrop of global instability pushing up prices of fuel and commodities, and growing economic pressures at home, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is of special significance. In recent years, diplomatic ties between the two countries have only grown stronger, especially after the resolution of major disputes over land and maritime boundaries. This time around, energy, trade, connectivity, water-sharing and security are likely to be central topics of discussion.\nGiven that rising energy prices in the country is having a knock-on effect on the cost of living and creating a great deal of economic insecurity, we hope the possibilities of energy cooperation will be of central importance on this four-day visit. Since India has been buying crude oil from Russia at discounted prices, can there be any possibilities of the two countries exploring an agreement on the import of fuel oil from India to ease the current energy crisis in Bangladesh?\nThere are a number of crucial topics of discussion in terms of trade and connectivity that will come up during the PM's trip as well, such as ensuring an unhampered supply of foodstuff like wheat, onion, pulses and spices to Bangladesh, withdrawing the anti-dumping duty imposed on exports of jute products from Bangladesh to India since 2017, and speeding up rail, road and waterway connectivity projects. Agreements on these issues will ultimately benefit both countries, since India-Bangladesh bilateral trade was worth over USD 14 billion last year, and Bangladesh is an important part of India's Look East Policy. In this regard, any potential deal must be firmly rooted in reciprocity. Given that Bangladesh's share of export to India is worth close to USD 2 billion, any deal that improves connectivity and lowers the cost of trade needs to be fully reciprocal for us to be able to reap its benefits.\nIt is also promising that, after a gap of 12 years, the Joint Rivers Commission meeting held on August 25 has led to progress on water-sharing issues, and the text of the MoU on Interim Water Sharing of Kushiyara river has been finalised. While we look forward to this, and other water-sharing agreements, being signed during this trip, we cannot help but note that no such progress has been made in terms of discussions on Teesta. However, despite certain issues that are yet to be dealt with, we are hopeful that the PM will have a fruitful visit and will continue to build on the close and friendly relations between the two countries, to the benefit of both.\n",

Given the increase in work hours and workdays, the wage hike was justified, as the managements had to meet commitments of timely shipment of their export products. It didn't take long for the RMG workers to realise the gap between their gross wage rise and the cost of running a family comfortably. A number of findings regarding the anomaly in the whole process of wage hike and the stark reality that followed were discussed at a dialogue held in Dhaka recently. The discourse was co-hosted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue, and the Christian Aid in Bangladesh at Brac Centre Inn in Dhaka. With the dialogue remaining focused on the joint study on the workers' income rise in tandem with the addition of overtime, disillusionment was a foregone conclusion. Clearly, they deserve better wages. The study noticed that despite the monthly income of the RMG workers undergoing a 1.7 per cent rise from March 2022, their family expenses had gone up by 9.5 per cent. Apparently, against the wage hike the RMG workers now had to engage in a fresh struggle to weather the crisis. The joint study didn't fail to detect hardship on the part of workers in maintaining their families. This volatile situation had been prompted by the fact that a large chunk of their enhanced income was being spent on meeting inflationary pressure. A resurgence of the country's RMG sector in defiance of a host of export impediments, indicates a return of its heyday. The fallout of the Ukraine-Russia conflicts hasn't yet posed any threat to its ready-made garments export. The RMG sector in general has been free of any large-scale destabilisation and uncertainties for quite a long time. Things bode well for the apparel sector.In spite of the propitious signs beckoning the Bangladesh apparel exporters, the CPD at the dialogue observes that the volume of exports has increased by 16 per cent with slight increase in price --- by 4.0 per cent. But shortage of workers has also gone up. Although the wage and overtime have increased nominally, the real wage remains below the living wage, the joint-study findings observe. China's distancing itself from RMG import from Bangladesh might prove a blessing in disguise. Stressing this aspect of RMG export, CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan suggests preparations for enhancement of local production and export capacity to grab opportunities for newer work orders other than those offloaded by China. The East Asian country is said to have opted for increasing its local apparel production. It's a timely suggestion put forward by the CPD chairman but he also urges full compliance with international labour standards to retain trade privileges, particularly in the EU. That Bangladesh suffers from the dearth of educated workers or trained labour has been repeated time and again. The RMG workers' enhanced wages are feared to become an ineffective financial tool for emergencies. It is set to outgrow its acute necessity, if the prices of daily essentials continue to spiral beyond the workers' buying capacity. Given the unbridled rise in prices of essentials, the RMG workers' demand for an enhanced 'living wage' warrants patient hearing.",

        "full_article": "Defaut on holding AGM and organising the same later with court permission are widely discussed issues now-a-days in Bangladesh. This has become an acute problem specially after introducing DVC (Data Verification Code) for obtaining financial statements from one basket for all. Financial statements without DVC means no audit and unaudited financial statements lead to default on holding AGM, as the perception or general interpretation is that no AGM shall be held without the audited financial statements. DVC, is a unique code used for a legal set of audited financial statements for a company. Many companies are still in a dilemma over preparing and presenting a unique set of financial statements (without any fabrication), completing audit accordingly and presenting those in AGM for approval and further process as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 1994. Many companies have already missed the deadline of their AGMs and are waiting for court permission to be complaint. Many companies, regulators and auditors are in a very complex zone while dealing with this and in guiding them to come out of that complexity. The authorities concerned should clarify whether the AGM should be held without audited financial statements or not. In accordance with section 183 of the Companies Act, 1994 the Financial Statements (profit & loss account, balance sheet etc. as described in the section) are to be laid before AGM. The section 183(1) reveals \"the board of directors of every company shall , at every annual general meeting held in pursuance of section 81, lay before the company a balance sheet together with the profit and loss account or in the case of a company not trading for profit, an income and expenditure account for the period specified in sub-section(2) of this section.\" The interpretation of this section is that presentation of financial statements is mandatory in each AGM in every year and those have to be audited under section 183(3). Holding AGM in every year is also mandatory within the 15 months of the earlier AGM (excepting the 1st AGM which has to be held within 18 months from the date of incorporation) as per section 81 (1) and the date of AGM should be on such a date nine months before the expiry date of the financial statements in accordance with the section 183(2)(b) (i). Comply with both 15 months and 9 months as stated above is mandatory and the date of AGM is set in such way that falls under both criteria. This is a separate issue. What matters is the holding of AGM. A Company must hold AGM under section 81 each year. So two mandatory issues are (1) Holding of an AGM is a must every year (2) Presenting the audited financial statements is a must under section 183 unless otherwise stated in subsection or any other sections. Section 183 (5) states about the penalty for failure to comply with the provisions of section 183 about the period of accounts (ending date of financial statements not exceeding nine months before the date of AGM) and presentation of the financial statements at AGM. The director(s) is liable to pay a fine not exceeding Taka 5,000 (five thousand). So, if the board of directors fail to present the financial statements at AGM in compliance with the time bar (ending date of financial statements not exceeding nine months before the date of AGM) as stated above, they will be penalised under section 183(5) only when the aggrieved authorities go to the court under section 396. No section or any subsections thereof is restricted or prohibited to hold AGM without the audited financial statements. So, it is apparent that they can hold AGM without the audited financial statements by paying fine imposed as above upon filing a case by any aggrieved authority. AGM has some specific agenda and presentation of the audited financial statements is one of them. The financial statements may not be audited and ready within the required date of holding AGM for various reasons as follows: (1) If records are destroyed due to disasters like fire or collapse of software and backup (2) Disagreement with auditors for any qualification point(s) where auditors may omit qualified ground for subsequent compliance. The compliance time may be longer than the period of holding AGM. In this situation, the AGM can be held without audited financial statements in spite of penalty option under section 183(5) as stated above. (3) The management or board may fail to complete it for many valid reasons The AGM is suspended or not held in time because of the need for audited financial statements. The company has to go to the court for obtaining permission under section 81(2). In order to avoid this critical situation, the company concerned can hold AGM within the legal time frame under section 81 (1) without the audited financial statements. In this case, the board of directors may be penalised for not presenting the financial statements under section 183 (5) or for not complying with the period bar (ending date of financial statements not exceeding nine months before the date of AGM) only when an aggrieved person goes to the court for remedy. However, holding AGM without the audited financial statements should not be a common practice as this will create hassles for smooth operation and growth of a company. As the financial statements are not audited, presented and approved, the dividend will not be recommended by the board and approved in the AGM. The shareholders will be deprived of dividends if there is any, and may feel aggrieved. So, presentation of the financial statements at AGM may not take place sometimes for valid reasons and those financial statements should be presented at the next AGM for approval and further processing. The companies or the regulators or the concerned authority should obtain a legal opinion on this to make it legally effective. \nThe writer is a partner of Basu Banerjee Nath & Co., Chartered Accountants [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "There seems to be a spree of frolicking with prices of essentials, less essential and luxury goods people have become accustomed to using. With improvement in the economic condition, even the poor and marginal people have long started setting aside allocation for aromatic body soap, shampoo and tooth paste no matter even if those are cheap varieties of local origin. In families with growing girl children, the demand for toiletries and cosmetics goes up proportionate to their growth from childhood to teenage to adulthood if, of course, they are not married off earlier. Coronavirus has made it incumbent on all segments of society to make arrangement for hand washing. The urgency of maintaining personal cleanliness and hygiene of the living quarters also warrants some extra expenditure on floor and toilet cleaning materials. But at a time when the low-income people have been struggling to manage two square meals ---quality notwithstanding, the few things considered essential for maintaining personal and family hygiene have suddenly become a luxury they no longer can afford. When they have to sacrifice some of the food items in order to cut cost, it is plain to see that many of them are forced to do away with some of those items which have alternatives like tender branches of neem or other trees people once used for brushing teeth. Even managing such branches of trees is not easy for the low-income people living in the capital city. Their back-breaking labour such as carrying bricks, sands or cement on makeshift stairs or splintering bricks into chips leave them hardly any time and energy to go for searching such alternatives. While it has been like a gold rush for traders ever since the injudicious price raise of fuel oils on an average of 50 per cent, people from the low-income group to middle class are reeling from the unrelenting volatility of the market. Apart from the rising cost of foodstuffs, all consumer goods necessary for living a modest life have registered galloping price escalation. Arbitrary increase in prices of eggs and cooking oil has conclusively been proved. When the production cost has increased by just Tk 0.03-0.04, the egg syndicate manipulated the market to effect a higher price by Tk5.0-6.0 on an egg. In case of cooking oil too, no logic was there to increase the price of a litre by Tk30-40 overnight. But it happened. The same is happening with every other item, rendering those to be luxury goods for the low-income people. In the black art of unilaterally skyrocketing the multinational companies hardly comply with any norm even in normal times. What is the logic behind hiking the price of a toothpaste tube of 200-250 grams by Tk 10-15 at a go? In case of prices of detergent, skincare soap, shampoo, face wash, after-shave lotion of foreign origin, it is anarchy all the way. If you are lucky and know some of the shopping tricks, you may get an item at half the price at a retail shop whereas if you are a novice shopper you have to pay even more than double the price at one of the super shops for the same item. This is commercial robbery in broad daylight. On this count, toiletries and cosmetics of local origin, albeit the disproportionate rate of price increase, cannot have price differences of atrocious levels. But the rise is still irrational and beyond the purchasing power of the low-income segment of society. The number of such people is growing with the market heating up further. If such a large number of people lose the purchasing capacity, imagine the consequence. The producers taking undue advantage of the situation will see the sale of their goods drop drastically. Not a good prospect. They are inviting stagflation as well as their business slump. Bad for them and the country's economy. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
