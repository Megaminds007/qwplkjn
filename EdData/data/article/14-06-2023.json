There cannot be any redress when groups engage in wanton and targeted violence against each other, use blockades to prevent the transport of supplies, and continue to prevent displaced people from getting back to their homes. Return to normalcy is the first step before grievances are heard to prevent another conflict from emerging. And in order to effect the first step, peace talks between eminent representatives \u2014 from civil society and political parties \u2014 in the conflict and tamping down any embers of violence that might continue following the conflagration are a must. The presence of paramilitary forces and the appeal for peace by Union Home Minister Amit Shah after a visit to the tribal and the Imphal valley areas have helped stem the violence to an extent even if sporadic incidents of ethnic violence and arson have continued a month after the conflagration in Churachandpur, Imphal and other areas. But in terms of setting the conditions of peace which would entail the return of looted arms and the slow and sure return of those displaced to their battered homes, there has been little progress.The Union government\u2019s constitution of a peace committee comprising eminent public figures in the State has hit a snag with many of them refusing to join it or suggesting that they have been added to the committee without prior consultation. The success of a peace initiative requires that all groups in a conflict are represented and includes representatives with public standing or a record that transcends their identities. The withdrawal of quite a few public figures from this initiative unfortunately reveals the ethnicisation of civil society in Manipur and complicates peace building. More worryingly, Kuki-Zo representatives have expressly withdrawn their names as the committee included the Manipur Chief Minister, N. Biren Singh, while a Meitei civil society group has raked up an unwarranted generalisation of the issue as one related to \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d to withdraw from the committee. The government should still not give up on persuading prominent political and civil society representatives to talk with one another. The fact that it requires the aegis of the Union government to push the envelope on any further step on this issue also reveals the failure of the Biren Singh administration in retaining the confidence of all parties. It seems that it is time for the Union government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to think of an alternative leadership that could ease the process of peace building as Mr Singh\u2019s actions, both in the run-up to the violence and in its aftermath, have either been ineffectual or shown up an inability to govern effectively.\u2018\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nManipur\n\n/\n\nunrest, conflicts and war\n\n/\n\npeace negotiations",

        "full_article": "Sporting heroes, like celebrated authors, have a devoted following. With time, as tastes become more defined, the fandom narrows, leaving little scope for accommodating others. Novak Djokovic has often suffered this fate. Where his illustrious rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were \u2014 and still are \u2014 wildly popular, universally, Djokovic was admired but not quite loved. Even the polyglot in him \u2014 he can speak Serbian, English, French, Italian, German and Spanish \u2014 did not fully endear him to fans outside Serbia. But his triumph in Sunday\u2019s French Open final against Norway\u2019s Casper Ruud might just herald that rare changing of the mind. The victory gave the Serb a record-breaking 23rd Grand Slam title, helping him steer clear of Nadal. At 36 years and 20 days, Djokovic is also the oldest man to win the Roland-Garros singles crown, a mark that Nadal had established last year, and is the first ever male to claim all four Majors at least thrice. A fortnight ago, Djokovic had trudged into Paris without a single final appearance since securing the Australian Open in January. In 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, widely considered the anointed one, he was faced with the tipster\u2019s favourite. But he left the French capital after winning the generational battle \u2014 Alcaraz is 16 years his junior and Ruud 12 \u2014 and regaining the World No.1 ranking.For some, Djokovic\u2019s latest feat settles the debate as to who the greatest men\u2019s player of all time is, for this is an era where success at Grand Slam events is the ultimate yardstick. But where Djokovic is really head and shoulders above others is in his overall excellence. Unlike his peers in Federer and Nadal, and yesteryear greats such as Pete Sampras, Djokovic has seldom played a curtailed schedule. That he has won all four Majors, all nine Masters 1000s and the ATP Finals at least twice, and is just two trophies short of doing it thrice, is an ode to his health, fitness and time-tested genius. Among women, Iga Swiatek, with her third Roland-Garros win in four years and fourth Slam overall, proved that she has it in her to chart a dominating course. The Polish World No.1 was flawless until the final, and once there, elevated her play when the match tightened, clawing her way back from a break down in the third set against the Czech Republic\u2019s Karolina Muchova. In less than three weeks, Wimbledon beckons, and grass is a surface where her top-spin game is not as effective. But the exceptional tennis nerd that Swiatek is, she is well capable of finding her feet, just like Djokovic, a seven-time champion at SW19.\nCOMMents\n  SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\ntennis\n\n/\n\nFrance\n\n/\n\nAustralia",

        "full_article": "A bank is perhaps the most tightly regulated business around. Its input includes public deposits and output changes the supply of money in an economy. Given the sensitivity, governing boards of banks are the first line of defence against developments that can shake confidence in the financial system. In keeping with this spirit, RBI last week notified a revised framework for compromise settlements between banks and its struggling borrowers, and write-offs of bad loans. The key element of this framework is that governing boards need to sign off on an individual bank\u2019s policies on compromises and write-offs.\nOf the two measures, write-offs of bad loans are controversial because of both the scale and opacity about the process. To illustrate, according to GOI, commercial banks wrote-off Rs 10. 09 lakh crore in the five-year period between 2017-18 and 2021-22. Of that amount, about 10% was recovered as even after write-offs banks continue to pursue the matter. Write-offs were originally associated with tax management of banks. However, about a decade ago, RBI flagged a problem with it by pointing out that they had emerged as a tool to manage bad loans, which indicated problems in credit management.\nThe clean-up of bank balance sheets over the last few years had an inevitable impact on private sector investments. It hasn\u2019t, however, ended dubious practices. Last month, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das pointed out regulatory inspections showed that the practice of \u2018evergreening\u2019 stressed loans by banks continued. Eventually, most problems and controversial practices can be traced back to the ways in which the banking system deals with stressed loans. The more opaque the solutions, the less confidence stakeholders have in it.\n\nGiven the public sector dominance in Indian banking, opacity that characterises write-offs holds the risk of inviting clumsy interventions by enforcement agencies. It can choke the flow of legitimate credit. That\u2019s why bank governing boards need to have greater oversight of write-offs. It\u2019s their job to ensure that good practices are followed. If they exercise oversight well, it will benefit the credit market while ensuring financial stability.\n\n",

The case is one more in a growing list of FIRs police forces in many states have filed on complaints from an array of outfits with a bizarre sense of what\u2019s right and wrong. Cops went one step further \u2013 charging the man under IPC sections 153A and 298, provisions against creating communal conflict. This erased yet another line drawn by plain common sense, since it deemed a profile image sufficient reason for a probe. What manifestly socially dangerous intent can the image of a long-dead royal project? And if the man was making a statement \u2013 how is that a crime, either?\nThe law requires that certain conditions are met before a person can be accused of creating communal conflict. But these IPC sections are finding mention with near-reckless abandon in several cases. Courts have quashed many such FIRs and reiterated that people are \u201cunder no obligation to avoid controversial issues\u201d. Bombay HC recently said that to invoke IPC Section 153A, the \u201cstatements\u201d must be \u201cjudged basis of what reasonable and strong-minded persons will think\u201d and not on the \u201cviews of hypersensitive persons who smell danger in every hostile point of view\u201d.\n\nIt is telling that Navi Mumbai police found it easier to book the man than coax the complainant outfits out of their \u201cgrievance\u201d. The police must recognise that filing frivolous FIRs to buy peace, instead of getting bullies to step back and step down, is appeasement and that such peace is fragile because every time cops give in, such groups get emboldened. Such policing indicates a worrying helplessness and, in effect, police officers are seen as enablers of mobs that thrive on harassment and intimidation. An unconfident police force that cannot handle FIR-hungry forever-angry \u201cyouth\u201d neither inspires confidence among ordinary citizens nor bodes well for the force\u2019s own ability to maintain law and order in politically charged times.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh has been experiencing unprecedented load-shedding for more than two weeks now, and the scale of the current crisis certainly demands an answer from the power sector officials. People have been facing 2,000-2,500MW of load-shedding throughout the day. It is expected to get even worse with the Payra Power Plant shutting down last week. Routine excuses for failure from the power ministry cite the global fuel crisis as well as the dollar crunch, which has made it difficult to open letters of credit (LCs) to import fuel and coal. But the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war can no longer be used as excuses; it is open knowledge that fuel prices have gone down in the international market. LNG prices in the spot market have dropped substantially. Coal prices have also gone down. Oil has been trading in a tight range around the low $75 per barrel, down from $100 per barrel last year.\nThe dollar crisis, however, is a real issue for Bangladesh. The taka has been depreciating alarmingly against the dollar \u2013 the price of the dollar jumped to Tk 106 this year from Tk 89 in June last year. Our foreign exchange reserves slipped under $30 billion in May, according to official figures. If the situation with our forex reserves is so dire that it's driving the whole nation down to a point where citizens have to endure long hours of load-shedding, and industries have to suffer production losses that may eventually lead to their shutdown, the government should just openly proclaim a state of emergency and address the issues that led to this crisis in the first place.\nIn that light, it is imperative to analyse the power sector's responsibility for this crisis. First, capacity charges are one source to point fingers at. The country has to pay capacity charges to privately-owned power plants in dollars, and these charges have to be paid even if a power plant does not produce any electricity. Idle power plants, and ones which are functioning at half its capacity, are still receiving full capacity payments.\nSecond, the overwhelming burden of fuel import needs to be reassessed. Our power sector is too heavily reliant on imports; the annual burden is more than $2 billion, depending on the international price of oil, gas and coal. It is axiomatic that if oil-fired power plants are being used to generate baseload electricity, fuel expenses will be very high. But the interesting fact is that more than 5,000MW of gas-fired power plants are sitting idle across the country. Electricity from gas-fired power plants is substantially cheaper than oil-fired electricity, given the current stable price of fuel in the global market. Seeing as the price of LNG has dropped in the spot market, why are gas-fired power plants not being utilised? The answer lies in the fact that we have not built enough regasification facilities to import more LNG. It is hard to comprehend the logic behind building gas-fired power plants with thousands of megawatts of generation capacity \u2013 with more on the way \u2013 while not planning efficient ways to supply the fuel needed to operate them. When LNG prices were high, not using LNG made sense. But does it make any sense now?\nConsumers are frustrated this time, because the authorities have consistently reassured the public that load-shedding would not happen this year. At the start of the load-shedding saga last year, after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, the public was forgiving \u2013 fuel prices had skyrocketed globally and the taka had started to depreciate. But this year, before the sweltering heatwaves hit the country, the officials of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) reassured the public that they were prepared to produce 16,000MW of electricity. They even declared how much they expected to generate from each source of power. Our political leaders also did not envisage electricity shortage, citing the new coal-fired power plants that have come into operation. Even when fuel prices were higher than what they are today, the authorities were somehow confident enough to claim that there would be little to no load-shedding this year.\nWith the serious dollar crisis, the only long-term solution is to lessen the import dependency of the energy and power sectors. Of course, this is easier said than done, but to what extent has the government seriously explored other options? After the onset of electricity shortage last year, the experts pointed to the serious neglect of domestic gas exploration. One year has gone by, but very little exploratory drilling has taken place. In the latest budget, very little has been allocated to gas exploration. To ensure even a minimum level of energy security through our own natural gas supply, the country needs to drill at least 25 exploratory wells every year. Assuming a success ratio of 1:5, and discovered gas reserves of 200-300 Bcf, approximately 0.8-1.0 Tcf of gas can be discovered.\nSimilarly, very little progress has been made with solar electricity panels. We are only generating around 500MW of power from grid-tied solar PV power plants. If one looks at the energy curve of late May and early June, it becomes obvious what a big difference efficient use of solar power plants can make. If 2,000MW of solar power plants were available, we could save nearly $1 million per day in fuel costs. These savings could even be used to pay off some of the overdue coal bills and import more coal. Of course, solar PV which is available only during the day (sunshine hours) cannot solve all our problems, but if designed correctly, it could save up to 20 percent of our fuel expenses. Along with more exploration for natural gas, a total of 30-40 percent savings in fuel cost is possible in Bangladesh.\nIt is unfortunate that the government is pursuing its old dangerous path of building more power plants and importing more LNG, coal and oil. Given our precarious dollar situation, this only forecasts more danger ahead. Fuel prices can escalate, the dollar crisis can deepen and consumers may resist further hike of energy prices. Given the difficult situation that the BPDB has put itself in, it is difficult to see a load-shedding-free Bangladesh anytime soon. In fact, it could conceivably get worse with the energy and power sectors becoming a huge burden on the economy and aggravating the dollar crisis.\nDr Ijaz Hossain\u00a0is former dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet).\n",

        "full_article": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) really \"intelligent\" in its creativity and decision-making? Or is it stealing others' works and perpetuating existing human biases?\nThis January, three artists filed a class-action lawsuit with the Northern California District Court against AI imagery generators \u2013 Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DreamUp. They claimed these companies are using their artwork to generate newer ones \u2013 using a publicly available database of images including theirs called LAION-5B \u2013 though the artists had not consented to have their copyrighted artworks to be included in the database, were not compensated for the use of their works, and their influence was not credited when AI images were produced using said works.\nAI is literally scraping through billions of existing works produced by raw human labour to \"produce newer ones.\" That's why several experts are already asking whether AI is at all \"artificial\" or \"intelligent.\"\nTech writer Evgeny Morozov has argued that while the early AI systems were mostly rules and programmes, and could have some \"artificiality,\" today's AI models draw their strength entirely from the works of actual humans. Built on vast amounts of human work stored at mammoth energy-hungry data centres, AI is not \"intelligent\" in the way human intelligence is as it cannot discern things without extensive human training, as Microsoft's Kate Crawford has pointed out.\nEven in decision making, AI-models can have strong biases as a 2019 article published in\u00a0Nature\u00a0has confirmed. An algorithm common in US hospitals has been systematically discriminating against black people. The study found that hospitals traditionally assign them lower risk scores than white people. Automatically, the algorithm takes that as a cue and puts blacks in a lesser risk group, regardless of the prevailing medical conditions. In another case, a painting bot returned the image of a salmon steak in water when asked to draw a swimming salmon. The AI model couldn't make this simple judgement that even a toddler could do.\nHowever, despite not being anywhere near \"intelligent,\" recent developments, especially the release of ChatGPT in November last year, have raised dramatic concerns about the effects of AI on human society. Renowned tech experts have published an open letter calling for an immediate pause on all AI development for six months. Its signatories include many big names and AI heavyweights, including Elon Musk from Tesla, Emad Mostaque from Stability AI, Sam Altman from OpenAI, Demis Hassabis from Google's DeepMind, and Kevin Scott from Microsoft. Altman even advised the US government to issue licenses to trusted companies (Does this mean only Big Techs?) to train AI models.\nIs this call for an immediate pause coming from genuine concern for human well-being? Or is there a commercial motive, as Michael Bennett, a PhD student at Australian National University (ANU) has pointed out? Potentially, AI can generate an enormous amount of wealth for whoever controls it. Let's try to understand the premise of the call.\nChatGPT isn't a research breakthrough, it's a product based on open research work that is already a few years old. The only difference is that the technology was not widely available through a convenient interface. Smaller entrepreneurs will soon develop better and more efficient AI-based models at much lesser costs, some of which is already available at GitHub, a popular repository for open-source non-commercial software. That worries the Big Techs, made abundantly clear by a leaked Google internal memo.\nThe long memo from a Google researcher said, \"People will not pay for a restricted model when free, unrestricted alternatives are comparable in quality\u2026We Have No Moat.\" Licenses would be a \"kinda moat,\" as Stability AI's CEO Emad Mostaque puts it bluntly, moat being jargon for a way to secure a business against competitors.\nAI Now Institute, a research non-profit that addresses the concentration of power in the tech industry, highlights the perils of unregulated AI in its April 2023 report because the AI boom will make the powerful Big Techs even more powerful. AI models depend on vast amounts of data, and super-fast computing power to process it, both of which only Big Techs can afford. Without access to these resources, no entrepreneur or researcher can develop any meaningful AI application, as an MIT Technical Review article elaborates.\nYes, we need regulations for AI development, and a pause if necessary, but not for the reasons mentioned in the open letter. It's to ensure that AI technology remains open source and democratic.\nThe other reason AI should be regulated is the way social media platforms have used it to fuel gender bias and extreme polarisation, and played on social divisions resulting in unspeakable violence on a massive scale (such as in Myanmar using Facebook). AI models will amplify both intentional misinformation (simple inaccuracies) and disinformation (false information) simply because they are trained on such data to produce more data (model cannibalism effect). Large language models can keep repeating fabricated and false information because of a phenomenon called 'hallucination' which independent watchdog NewsGuard has found in several online news portals.\nIntentional or otherwise, all these could be quite handy in manipulating public opinion or creating biases to benefit those in power. That makes it even more necessary to regulate AI. To ensure that the benefits of AI reaches everyone, humans must always be on top of it.\nDr Sayeed Ahmed\u00a0is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It saddens us to see how government efforts to end child labour continue to be limited mostly to observing special days, arranging seminars and such gestures, while the plight of working children remains unaddressed. The World Day Against Child Labour, observed on June 12 each year, offers us a chance to revisit this issue and renew our commitment. There are about 3.45 million child workers in the country, according to an estimate. Of them, 1.75 million fall under child labour category. Most of them are engaged in hazardous jobs, while a significant minority of them are in highly hazardous jobs.\nThe question is, why is the situation so bad even though we have so many national policies and laws to eradicate child labour? How can underage children still be employed in hazardous jobs when the Labour Act 2006 specifies that the minimum age of employment is 14 and a number of sectors \u2013 steel rolling mills, plastic and metal factories, etc. \u2013 have been declared as hazardous for children? A joint survey conducted by the ILO and UNICEF on 709 factories has found that 41.5 percent of their total workers were children, between 10 and 12 years of age. So, what have we exactly achieved after being a signatory to a number of international instruments that aim to protect the rights of children? Clearly, very little.\nWhile the government has been very keen in enacting laws, it appeared little interested in implementing them. In recent years, the number of child labourers has been on the rise mostly due to the impact of the pandemic \u2013 many students from poor households have since dropped out of schools \u2013 but we have not seen any sustained and well-thought-out measures to reverse this trend. Such inaction is unacceptable. If the government is really sincere about ending child labour, it must change its laissez-faire approach to this issue. The government reportedly has a target of eliminating child labour by 2025. If that is the case, it must double down on existing efforts to achieve that goal.\n",

        "full_article": "The antibiotics are fast losing their efficacy against infectious diseases. That is because the bacteria responsible for those ailments have learnt to survive antibiotic treatment. Unprescribed and indiscriminate use of antibiotics is largely to blame for the bacteria to grow resistance to the drugs that are supposed to kill them. This is a frightening development on a global scale. As it came out from a recently-held seminar at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) where doctors expressed their concern that worldwide 700,000 people die of conditions called Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) every year, which is another name for antibiotic resistance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number may rise to as high as 10 million in 2050.Bangladesh is also among the countries facing grave risks from AMR. The country's leading physicians at the said seminar came up with reports that should concern everyone. Even at the nation's premier institution of postgraduate medicine, (BSMMU), 52 per cent of the patients at its Intensive Care Unit (ICU) fail to respond to antibiotic drugs, while 21.5 per cent of the patients getting treatment at the hospital's heart, kidney, pediatric and neonatal units are reportedly found to be antibiotic resistant. The most alarming part of the report is that of the three groups-access, watch and reserve--of antibiotics the doctors apply against increasing levels of infection, even the 'reserve group' is proving worthless against many ICU patients at the hospital. Notably, the 'reserve group' is used as a last resort to treat bacterial infections. The 'watch group' to treat high level of infection is being used in the 64 per cent cases at the BSMMU. That, in other words, means that the 'access group' that treats primary infection has already lost its relevance. This is coming from just one of the major public hospitals of the country. So, what is happening at the national scale is not hard to imagine. In fact, the application of antibiotics is not limited to infectious disease affecting humans only. Those (antibiotics) are being used with abandon in the livestock sector including poultry and fishery. As a result, 55 per cent of the poultry products are found to be affected by antibiotic resistant bacteria. People are unwittingly becoming antibiotics resistant by consuming those poultry products.As reports go, 19 types of antibiotics are being used by poultry and the fisheries sector without proper guidance from veterinarians. Add to this the uncontrolled and unprescribed, the over-the-counter (OTC), or, worse, the quack-prescribed use of antibiotics all over the country. So, the people of this country are sitting on a veritable 'AMR bomb' ticking to explode! It is, as though, a backward journey to the pre-antibiotic era, before the discovery of penicillin, when people were helpless against any kind of bacterial infection. The only way left to face this uncalled-for, existential threat to the population from infectious diseases is to consider any application of antibiotic drugs without the prescription of a qualified doctor a criminal offence. Most importantly, as suggested by some experts at the BBSMMU seminar, the government should impose strictest control, where possible, total ban, on the use of antibiotics in the sector of animal farms including poultry and fisheries. In addition, a nationwide awareness campaign should be launched against unrestrained use of antibiotics with the participation of activists from all sections of society including, of course, the media led by the health professionals. The government, meanwhile, should consider making unprescribed use of antibiotics punishable under the law.",

        "full_article": "Currently, science and technology are no longer a forte of the Muslim world. With a population of 1.8 billion, it has achieved only 12 Nobel prizes. But between 1901 and 2022, as many as 211 people from the 16-million strong Jew community won Nobel Prizes. Besides, those Nobel prizes are marked by a high density in physics (26%), chemistry (19%), and medicine (28%). On the contrary, only four out of twelve Muslim Nobel prize winners are in physics and chemistry. But some of the branches of science began at the hands of Muslims. From the 8th to 12th centuries, they were at the forefront of discovering scientific principles and inventing valuable technologies. Muslim physicist Ibn al-Haytham made significant contributions to optics, paving the way for eyeglasses and lenses. In building a musical robot, Ismail al-Jazari (born in 1136 and died in 1206) made notable contribution to mechanics, control, automation, and robotics. Credit goes to Muslim Physicist Ibn al-Haytham's (965-1040) for fashioning camera. There have been numerous such examples. Why could the legacy not be taken forward? One notable reason has been the limited or no application of knowledge and technologies in creating economic value. There appear to be two underlying causes. The first one is that the economic value creation scope is minimal in the early stage of technology. Hence, there is a need to create a flow of knowledge and ideas for improving technologies. It appears that the British-led Europe did a far better job than the Muslim world in organising economic activities, giving incentives to profit from ideas. Hence, instead of limiting to scientific discoveries and demonstrating technological inventions like Muslims, Europe got into a profit-making race out of it. Such linking of science and technology in creating economic prosperity led to an increasing flow of resources for further advancement. Besides, the competition of digging for scientific knowledge, inventing, and innovating provided the right impetus. By creating a virtuous cycle of economic value out of science and technology, European countries, followed by the USA and Japan, emerged as advanced economies. Can others including the Muslim world emulate Europe? Indicators like R&D investment as a percentage of GDP, the density of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates, publications and patents, and many more may provide an answer. As Muslim countries have significant resources, particularly from oil revenue, they can increase funding for a research base. Can large funds be enough for reinventing past glory? And if they succeed, will it sustain? Japan can throw light on the issue. During the first 20 years of the 21st century, 19 Japanese got Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. Was it due to pursuing curiosity or showing excellence in science and technology? The answer is no. As we know, Japan is a natural resource-poor Island country. Japanese firms have been working to generate and commercialise knowledge and ideas. Hence, they have been digging deep into science to gather additional knowledge for sharpening their products and processes. Such a journey of creating economic value through science and technology advancement has been driving economic prosperity. Nobel prizes are its reward. For example, to take over the global lighting business, the Japanese targeted advanced light emitting divide technology, leading to Nobel prize-winning scientific discovery and global dominance in lighting.Similarly, to leverage the market of portable devices, the Japanese targeted to keep advancing lithium-ion batteries. This mission has brought Nobel prize and global success in the battery business to Japanese individuals and firms. In addition to driving prosperity and winning Nobel prizes, this approach of sharpening science and technology edge appears to be sustainable. Hence, instead of providing additional resources for increasing universities, R&D establishments, STEM graduates, publications, and patents, the focus should be on creating a virtuous cycle of economic prosperity out of science & technology edge. It is important to create that virtuous cycle. Lessons can be drawn from technology innovation dynamics and anecdotal references. Irrespective of the greatness, all inventions emerge in primitive form, but they are amenable to further progression based on a flow of knowledge and ideas. They are like living things having a S-curve-like life cycle. But at saturation, they are susceptible to reinvention. Due to the amenability of incremental progression and reinvention, leading to higher quality and lower cost, a profit-making opportunity arises out of science and technology advancement. Consequently, there is competition. Due to it, epicentres of inventions and innovations migrate across the boundaries of firms and nations. Thus the industrial epicentre migrated from Europe to the USA. The epicentre of consumer electronics migrated from the USA to Japan. Lately, the silicon processing epicentre has migrated from Silicon Valley to Taiwan. There is no alternative to understanding the global technology innovation dynamics for the Muslim world. It should figure out the entry opportunity in the life cycle of targeted products and processes and speedily implement synchronized responses. Most importantly, the momentum building through the flywheel effect should be sustained over years and decades to succeed as a global winner. In the technology exploitation race, as the winner takes all, the objective is to be a global winner and sustain it. Following this approach of driving economic prosperity out of S&T advancement, the Muslim world can regain its past preeminent position. Ensuring synchronized and timely responses matters. To win the global invention and innovation race, the key is incremental advancement and reinvention. Otherwise, mere investment in R&D establishments, STEM education, publications, patents, universities, and infrastructure will likely lead to wastage of resources and missed opportunities.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "There was much anticipation that the amended Bank Company Act would address some basic systemic flaws in the manner banks in the country would be governed. Sadly, hopes appear to have been dashed somewhat with what has actually been proposed in the current fiscal year. While many experts in the field had been demanding a separate law for banks to deal with growing non-performing loans (NPLs), their demand has been left unattended. The banking Act has gone through multiple revisions over the last decade or so. That there is no separate law for the banking system and the lopsided ownership structure in banks, which allow for undue power to be concentrated in the hands of a group of people on the board of banks, has facilitated the runaway situation with NPLs. This scourge has grown to phenomenal figures and has effectively put several banks in hot water. The central bank has on more than one occasion, had to step in to stop a freefall of such banks.The regulatory authority's failure to take effective action against bank defaulters for several years reinforces the claim that the latter are quite aware of what they do. They consider the risk of stealing banks' money is worth taking before facing the authorities off in the court. Evidence also points to the fact that the existing laws have proven less than effective to recover monies from defaulting parties. Given this backdrop, would it not make sense to undo the mistakes of the past? Or is it simply best to leave things as they are and let business continue as usual. Apparently, since this is the election year, it would appear that policymakers have decided to put the question of a new law for the banking sector on hold.This does not come as a surprise because if one takes a look at the ownership pattern of some banks, it would be impossible for the central bank to make any move against irregularities without explicit approval from the very top. That does not bode well for the financial health of the sector but it seems things must stay as they are for the moment. There is no way to ignore the downgrade rating by S&P Moody's and while some elected representatives may be dismissive of it, several good banks' ratings have suffered due to this revision. Perhaps the decision of internationally accepted rating agency such as S&P is not considered to count much by the authorities here, but that rating is watched by foreign investors. As Bangladesh has poured considerable resources into much-needed infrastructure development in the hope of attracting both domestic and foreign investments, it would be unwise to disregard any downgrade rating at the international level. Repeated loan scams have made a serious dent in the country's image and \"the lack of discipline in loan management in the case of some state-owned banks and private banks is now at its peak.\" This seemingly unstoppable race to make healthy financial institutions bleed dry comes at the cost of the country's economy, its image and its international reputation. Simply sweeping these unresolved issues under the carpet will bring nothing but more pain down the road. Take corrective action now or be prepared to face the consequences in the immediate future.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Setting up flyovers or circular bypass roads does not seem to lessen the capital city's frequent traffic jams. Rather, the already chaotic traffic situation of the city is becoming more complex for too many vehicles on roads and lack of parking facilities. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, some 500 vehicles are being registered every day in this city. But the roads or parking facilities are not increasing. Even if one wants to move on foot, one faces a number of problems as pedestrians. Many of the city footpaths have been grabbed illegally by traders. Also construction materials are found to be kept on these footpaths. Walkability is one of the key criteria for making a city liveable, environment-friendly, community-oriented, and less dependent on motorised transportation. So, we urge the authorities concerned to make our footpaths pedestrian-friendly. For this, they can install sheds and benches at regular intervals, which will protect the pedestrians from sun and rain. Setting up water taps for public drinking, making footpaths more comfortable for pedestrians and beautifying them with plants can attract many people to have a walk rather than sit in the traffic. \nRafid Alam, Tejgaon, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
