His visit is the first ever by a Bhutanese Foreign Minister. Moreover, the main purpose was the holding of boundary talks that have not taken place in more than seven years. The talks appeared to yield substantive progress, according to a joint statement, with both countries having also signed a cooperation agreement outlining the functioning of a new joint technical team for the delimitation and demarcation of the boundary. In the talks with Dr. Dorji, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, called for both sides to soon establish diplomatic relations and to conclude their boundary negotiations. It is true that India, given its special relationship with Bhutan, has been very wary about the possibility of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the signing of a boundary agreement. But both those outcomes increasingly appear inevitable. Indeed, only this month, the Bhutanese Prime Minister in an interview with this paper said that the two countries were inching towards the completion of a three-step road map on boundary delineation and demarcation. He asserted that no agreement with China would in any way go against India\u2019s interests.Given Bhutan\u2019s unique dependence on India, there is little doubt that it will have taken New Delhi on board in its efforts to normalise relations with China, in return guaranteeing India\u2019s security interests and red lines. One such red line will involve keeping China away from southern Doklam\u2019s ridges that overlook India\u2019s \u201cSiliguri corridor\u201d, even as Beijing and Thimphu consider a \u201cswap\u201d between territories in the valleys of the north, where Bhutan is coming under intense Chinese pressure, and on the Doklam plateau in the west. A second line will likely involve Thimphu going slow on normalising ties and opening itself up to a permanent Chinese diplomatic presence, while continuing with border talks. The question now facing New Delhi is how best to protect its interests. One lesson from the crisis that was thrust upon Thimphu in 2017, during the India-China Doklam stand-off, is that India\u2019s interests are better served by taking Bhutan on board and aligning strategies rather than by expecting acquiescence from a sovereign nation that will understandably pursue its own. A border deal that addresses Bhutanese concerns in the north while preserving India\u2019s red lines in the west will not necessarily undermine New Delhi\u2019s interests. Rather than alarm, India must approach the boundary negotiations with a greater understanding of Bhutan\u2019s reasoning, and with confidence that India\u2019s long-trusted neighbour will take both India\u2019s interests and its own into consideration before any final agreement.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBhutan\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy",

The party, known by its Polish acronym, PiS, ran a campaign that it could protect Poland\u2019s traditional values and its independence from the European oligarchy, while the Donald Tusk-led centrist opposition Civic Coalition said the election was the last opportunity to arrest the slide into autocracy. In the past eight years, PiS has shifted Poland\u2019s polity towards the right and often clashed with the European Union (EU). Its government was also accused of squeezing liberal democracy, stifling the free press, undermining gay rights and seizing control of institutions, mainly the judiciary. It emerged as the single largest party with 35.38% of the votes (200 seats), but fell short of a governing majority in the 460-strong lower House of Parliament. The Civic Coalition won 30.70% of the vote, but with potential coalition partners (the Third Way and Left party), the centre-left alliance, which has the support of 248 legislators, has a way forward to government formation.The result is an opportunity for the centrist coalition to right the wrongs of the PiS government. Mr. Tusk has already promised to make amends with the EU, strengthen democracy and institutions, roll back the near-total ban of abortion and restore gay rights. An area where there would be continuity is Ukraine. PiS had offered staunch support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion, though there were quarrels over economic issues between Warsaw and Kyiv. Mr. Tusk, a former EU bureaucrat, has promised to continue support for Kyiv and to coordinate better with NATO and the EU in this regard. But Mr. Tusk faces many challenges that begin with the formation of the government itself. There is no certainty that Polish President Andrzej Duda, who is from PiS, would invite Mr. Tusk to form the government first. If the PiS is invited first, it could lead to horse trading. Even if Mr. Tusk manages to form the government, he will have to reach a consensus with President Duda, who wields a legislative veto, to initiate critical reforms. There is a consensus on social issues within Mr. Tusk\u2019s coalition, but members have different views on economic and climate policies. Tackling Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine, which has raised Poland\u2019s strategic profile in Europe, without a spillover is another challenge. What is awaiting Mr. Tusk is a tough balancing act straddling the spheres of economy, politics and foreign policy.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\ndemocracy\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nLGBT\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\nNATO\n\n/\n\nclimate change (politics)",

The story is that researchers tried to find out which noise scared wild animals in the savanna stretches of South Africa,\u00a0in and around Kruger National Park, the most \u2013 the sound of lions roaring or human voices. They placed hidden recorders and activated them when animals gathered near water bodies or were moving in herds, or simply preparing to feast on a recent kill. Every one of them, some 19 different species, including giraffes, deer and wild boar, elephants, antelopes and leopards displayed greater fear and fled instantly on hearing human voices than when they heard a lion roar.\nAnimals may be associating human voices with intrusion, disturbance, killing, poaching, hurting, shouting and more such insensitive and violent behaviour toward other species and the environment. Predators like lions attack and kill to satiate their hunger, a basic need for survival, and the ecosystem in the wilderness is attuned to that threat, seeing it as part of their interconnected survival network. Yes, prey animals do display fear and try to flee but not with the same intensity and terror when confronted by human voices. Even a leopard that was preparing to eat an impala it had just killed \u2013 simply abandoned its lunch and fled when human voice recordings were played.\nWild animals, even the apex predators that we fear, are terrified of us, say researchers. \u201cThe sound of human voices evokes more fear than the sounds of snarling and growling lions. This underlines that our species is recognised as uniquely dangerous.\u201d Says conservation biologist Michael Clinchy at Western University in London, Ontario: \u201cThis is because we are super lethal.\u201d In contrast, there are stories of animals and humans living in harmony and trust in places like those in and around Ramana Maharishi\u2019s ashram in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. The Sage of Arunachala, as he was known, was calm, exuding peace and quiet confidence. Whosoever came to visit, went away carrying some of that peace with them.\nNew mother monkeys would visit him to show off their newborn babies; peacocks came to perform their rain dance; and troubled human souls came to the Maharishi, to unburden all their problems but found themselves sitting in complete silence in his benign presence \u2013 and leave feeling comforted, without a word exchanged. Quiet compassion and brotherhood, kindness and interconnectedness bind all species and souls in a positive, enabling manner that generates more compassion and love.\nThe sage\u2019s compassion extended to plant species as well. When he saw a worker hacking an almond tree to remove dead leaves, he asked him, \u201cPlease can you be gentle? How would you feel if I yanked your hair and pulled some off its roots? Plants can feel, too.\u201d Leopards are known to move away when they crossed Ramana Maharshi\u2019s path during his circumambulation of the Arunachala hill. He would just ask them to leave, and they would do so. Fear was never part of this kind of inter-living, something unusual and inspiring.\nRamana Maharshi\u2019s level of compassion and kindness may be very high benchmarks for us, but we could aspire to emulate at least some of it.\n\n",

A lifelong regimen of blood transfusions is the mainstay of treatment for thalassemia patients. India has the world\u2019s largest number of children with the condition (1-1.5 lakh), and every year 10,000-15,000 are born with the genetic disorder. Transfusion transmissible infections are a big risk. The tragedy is that this is entirely preventable.\n\n\u00a0\nIndia has a steadily growing population with chronic conditions, such as cancer. For these patients, transfusions are integral to treatment. Blood, as most families with patients will vouch, is a constant health emergency, yet it is an invisible crisis. Demand is high because of (preventable) health problems like complications from malnutrition, anaemia, and pregnancy. Studies show 25% of maternal deaths are due to haemorrhaging. A report by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) cited evidence that 70% of postpartum haemorrhage deaths are from a lack of availability of blood.\nPoor supply is just one aspect. Both whole blood and components are among India\u2019s most mismanaged critical resources. From collection to distribution, safety to storage, availability and accessibility for patients, the poorly regulated area chronically fails patients. Regulations for testing and screening exist, but there is scant monitoring. Spurious \u201cblood banks\u201d with outdated testing facilities fleece patients\u2019 families. A grey market in blood thrives. India\u2019s haemovigilance programme will follow up on the Kanpur case. Yet it can neither penalise nor correct. States and authorities will have to invest far more funds and work together to enable nodal agency NACO to mandate audits as well as lay down strict standards and procedures. Most crucially, NACO should be empowered to penalise blood banks and hospitals. Otherwise, more tragedies are inevitable.\n\n",

The government's insistence on a free and fair election is belied by its actions.\nThe bill is likely unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Code of Criminal Procedure (CRPC). Giving Ansar the authority to arrest and search civilians is not acceptable. Ansar is not trained, designed, or structured to practice this kind of authority. We have the police force for that\u2014the constitution and the CRPC gives them this authority. So, are they going to change the CRPC next?\nIt is also unclear why it is being introduced now when there is political pressure from both within and outside the country. Are the Ansar, who are not trained or structured for law enforcement, being primed to be used unfairly against the opposition during the election season? Will they be used to repress political opponents in rural areas and across the country?\nThe police are already accountable for numerous allegations of misconduct, but at least they are subject to oversight. How can the Ansar be made accountable?\nThe army is far better trained and coordinated than the Ansar, yet they have never had the power to arrest, even under martial law. The government's decision to grant the Ansar these powers is therefore highly questionable.\nMembers of the police have already expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed bill, and it is understandable why. If the Ansar are given similar powers and responsibilities, who will be responsible for what? What will the hierarchy and chain of command be like on the field?\nThis move will not help the government in the long run.

        "full_article": "Food inflation in the country rose to 12.54 percent in August, the highest in 12 years, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Bangladesh Bank (BB) has implemented a series of measures, some to appease the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to manage inflation. These measures include adjustments to the repo and reverse repo rates, marginal increases in banking interest rates, and higher treasury bill interest rates. However, the question arises: are these policies sufficient to effectively address the complex issue of inflation control?\nBangladesh is categorised as a free market economy. But, in practice, the country's markets do not always respond naturally to supply and demand forces. They exhibit limited responsiveness to international market dynamics and supply-side factors. After the pandemic, the prices of many products in the world market saw a decline, but the same has not happened in Bangladesh. Despite BB's effort to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by lowering interest rates, the credit flow in the private sector saw minimal improvement. Banks preferred to lend to established clients, particularly larger entities, contributing to a concentration of credit. This approach has had unintended consequences, including the risk of capital flight as larger borrowers transfer funds abroad.\nOne key factor hampering the effectiveness of BB's policies is the delay in decision-making and significant transmission lags. The time between BB's policy decisions and their impact on inflation can span several months, or even years, since the start of the problem. During this time, various macroeconomic variables undergo significant changes. For instance, the devaluation of the taka against the US dollar does not occur in a timely manner, creating opportunities for alternative channels such as hundi markets to emerge. These channels accommodate the demand for foreign currency and even integrate mobile banking and digital e-commerce platforms illegally, thus diminishing the formal inflow of remittance.\nA more continuous and incremental approach to policy evaluation would be advisable, which would allow the market to adjust to changes gradually and prevent sharp shocks due to sudden policy implementation.\nBB's inability to effectively manage letters of credit (LCs) and the imposition of onerous LC-related restrictions have led to the circumvention of formal banking channels. There is also the foreign currency reserve drain. The fluctuation in the dollar-to-taka exchange rate between the opening and closing stages of LCs has driven up prices. Importers have exploited this inconsistency and delayed releasing commodities into the market, capitalising on inflationary trends to increase profits. This situation has contributed to a self-reinforcing cycle of inflation, where the expectation of rising prices on the supply side actively contributes to increasing overall inflation.\nTo control inflation, the government initially delayed taking action. It remained unsuccessful in selling government bonds and withdrawing money from the market, due to its reluctance to raise interest rates. Instead, a disputed approach of filling budget deficiency via excessive money printing (known as devolvement), has been adopted. This fueled inflation further. Even now, new money is coming into being in the cyclic flows of this powerful reserve. Repo and reverse repo rates have recently been introduced after much ado, but their impact may be limited, given that private credit flow had already decreased before these measures were finally put in place.\nThe key challenge for our central bank lies in addressing wilful defaulters and the issues within the banking sector, particularly regarding non-performing loans. The reported data on defaulted loans is likely too low to be representative of the actual extent of the problem, and the lack of stringent actions against defaulters exacerbates the issue. These defaulters control the allocation of private investment. SMEs receive minimal private investment due to banks' preference for lending to established clients.\nThere are still more reasons behind Bangladesh's inflation. Opening of LCs for imports fell by 18 percent in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal year, compared to the same period last year. Sector-wise credit openings fell by even more: by 39 percent for consumer goods, by 28 percent for industrial raw materials, by 22 percent for energy and petroleum products, among others. And because there is no proper initiative for LC quality control, smuggling is still prevalent under the cover of imports. Without a massive reduction in money laundering, the dollar reserve crisis will not improve and the taka will continue to lose value.\nThe issue of high inflation in Bangladesh originated from a significant increase in fuel prices over only nine months. To make things worse, fertiliser prices also rose.\nTo effectively address high inflation, lowering the price of essential fuel as a strategic economic commodity is crucial. The average international crude oil price remained relatively low over the last year, but the government's taxation policies, which involve multiple levels of duties, have resulted in uncompetitive fuel prices. Maintaining these anti-people policies significantly boost government revenue. However, the existence of a large and unproductive bureaucracy increases the cost of government operations. This, in turn, limits public spending and the incentives that are crucial for addressing the impact of inflation.\nRegulatory policies can only work when the market functions properly, which is not the case in Bangladesh. Here, there are multiple layers of syndicates, including the government itself, that do not allow the market to function well. The range of structural, operational, and external factors contributing to high inflation must be confronted with timely standard practices, institutional rule, and transparent political will.\nFaiz Ahmad Taiyeb\u00a0is a Bangladeshi columnist and writer living in the Netherlands.\n\n",

On Monday, while the country was observing Nabami, at least 17 people died when a freight train, ignoring the signal light, rammed into a passenger train near the Bhairab Bazar Junction Railway Station. We must ask: how many more ordinary people will have to die in such meaningless tragedies before the authorities do something about it?\nSurvivors of the Bhairab crash recalled how gruesome the collision was. Reshma Begum, one of the injured, told\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0how her carriage was crammed with passengers. When tragedy struck, people fell on top of one another, causing so much pressure that it was hard to even breathe. Some couldn't bear the impact, succumbing to their injuries, while others stayed trapped in the mangled carriages, praying for a miracle. It took about 15 hours to end the rescue operations.\nMany dreams were thus shattered. Some of the victims were planning to go abroad, some were looking to get married, while some were waiting to meet their loved ones. Shanti Rani Shil, who was on her way to celebrate Durga Puja in Narsingdi, is now mourning the loss of her husband. Many, like Opu, a teenage passenger, were seen frantically searching for their friends and relatives amid the debris.\nAfter the incident, Bangladesh Railway suspended the freight train's driver, his assistant, and guard following a preliminary investigation. But will such measures prevent future accidents? Unfortunately, history indicates otherwise. Train accidents, large and small, are anything but rare in our country, and some common threads link them all \u2013 negligence, recklessness, dysfunction, and mismanagement. On April 16, a Dhaka-bound passenger train hit a freight train in Cumilla, injuring 30, following an anomaly in the signalling system. In 2019, two intercity trains collided in Brahmanbaria, killing 16 people and injuring over 70; the incident happened while changing tracks.\nHere's another clear pattern: the crashes happen mostly at junctions or crossings, and while switching tracks. And it is with this information that we can plan to save lives. What the authorities need to do is properly prepare conductors, drivers and assistants for their duty, making sure that there is no room for negligence. Additionally, regular maintenance of switches, signals, and the whole technical system is imperative. With these overarching measures, we can at least hope that our loved ones will not be victims of such avoidable tragedies.\n",

        "full_article": "Monday's train accident near Bhairab Bazar Junction Railway Station is a grim reminder of the danger lurking over the so-called comparatively safe mode of transportation. Rash driving by bus drivers is mostly responsible for fatal accidents on roads. In the case of Egarsindhur Godhuly Express train's tragic accident, as preliminary probe indicates, rash driving by the driver of the freight train seems to be the cause of the accident. The freight train did not stop at the outer signal when the Godhuly was switching line and for a split second it rammed into the latter's third from the last carriage, overturning two and derailing another of the three last compartments. As many as 18 lives perished and nearly a hundred others of the last two carriages had to be rushed to hospital, some of the more critical to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The last such railway tragedy involving collision of two trains happened in November 2019 at a place in Brahmanbaria, in which 19 people got killed and scores injured. Compared with road and waterway accidents, such major incidents involving trains are fewer no doubt. But the number of accidents on level crossings is much too high with the casualty figures mounting to more than a deadly train disaster. In a country where the railway has remained outdated---nearly primitive, the nation can count itself lucky for not encountering more such avoidable disasters. When engineers claim the use of bamboo for repair of rail tracks is all right, the level of maintenance gives an idea of the task. Unguarded level crossings and negligence of gatekeepers at legal level crossings are responsible for death of 145 people out of 175 total deaths from railway accidents between 2014 and 2020. This shows that 83 per cent deaths occurred on railway crossings. When buses, microbuses and cars or vans try to cross an open level crossing, trains smash into those killing passengers inside. The problem with the Bangladesh Railway is that it is yet to be given the impetus for a change lock, stock, and barrel which it desperately needs to get things in order. To ensure a safe journey for railway passengers and those of the vehicles using level crossings, the ingredient considered a prerequisite is the conceptual transformation from a moribund system to a set of modern and efficient railway infrastructure and service. Nothing less than these can deliver the goods. A driver of the goods train in this case may have taken his job rather casually in a railway environment that fails to keep his kinds under constant surveillance. Otherwise, it is unthinkable for such a driver to violate the signal. Well, it would be premature to blame the driver entirely for the accident, though. The two probe bodies the BR formed might come up with the actual cause of the accident. If it corroborates the preliminary findings, on the basis of which the driver of the freight train and two others have been temporarily suspended, the heads of the accused are set to be rolling. But if there is a twist to the incident, let it be exposed in order to find the real culprit and also in the interest of a fair trial and avoiding such accidents in the future.",

        "full_article": "Germans observed the anniversary of the reunification of their country earlier this month. When in October 1990, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic came together as a single country again, it was once more proof of the mysterious and yet inexorable movement of history.History has its own dynamism. While wars may kill and maim and while regional and global conflicts may leave countries split down the middle or brought into a single structure, it is the wheels of history which turn and which go into a shaping and reshaping of our world.It was a tragedy when, in the aftermath of the welcome fall of the Nazis in 1945, Germany found itself splintered into two states per courtesy of the nations which had freed Europe from the menace that was Adolf Hitler and his National Socialists. The rush to take Berlin by Soviet, American and British troops and the subsequent division of the country into eastern and western zones was a reality the world had to live with till 1990.The history of modern Germany makes for fascinating reading. The rise of Konrad Adenauer as West Germany's first chancellor and the strenuous efforts his government needed to put in place in order to bring his part of the old country to respectability is a page written in the annals of our times. On the other hand, when East Germany passed under the domination of the Soviet Union, it was the beginning of a new sad story for Germans. The Berlin Wall came up in 1961, which was clearly a crude attempt to divide not only a city but an entire nation. The Berlin Wall was a manifestation of the tribalism which the Soviet leadership, beginning with Joseph Stalin, sought to push the German people into. And, overall, the impression of Germany following the Second World War was that its reunification could spell disaster once more for the world. Western politicians were not too keen about reunification, though many of them railed against the Berlin Wall. In 1963, US President Kennedy gladdened West German hearts when he spoke to them and indeed to their compatriots across the wall through his ringing endorsement of democracy and the free world. Kennedy spoke at the Brandenburg Gate where, decades later, President Reagan would ask Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.For all our reading of German history post-1945, many of us yet remain ignorant about life in Germany between the allied occupation and the reunification in 1990. In the final days of the war, much of Germany lay waste through the air raids and ground assaults by troops from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France and others. Misery, of the sort to which the Nazis had subjected the people of the countries they had occupied, was visited upon the people of a defeated Germany. It would take a long time for German infrastructure, in both east and west, to be rebuilt. In the end, though, Germany recovered, to a point where many in the West were fearful of a resurgence of the Hitlerite politics which had caused the calamity of 1939-1945.Germany is today a leading global power, especially in terms of the economic strength it embodies. It is a leading player in international politics, as evident through its participation in the Ukraine crisis and of late in the critical situation arising in Gaza. The importance Germany exudes in today's global politics brings to mind the brilliant politicians that the country, particularly the western part of it prior to 1990, produced in the post-war period. Konrad Adenauer was a pivotal force in reviving German confidence after the war. But let it not be forgotten that in East Germany, or GDR as it was officially known, men such as Walter Ulbricht, Erich Honecker and Willi Stoph played critical roles, doing as best they could despite the Soviet shadow over their state.In West Germany, following the departure from power of Konrad Adenauer, political leadership successively passed into the hands of Ludwig Erhard, the Kurt-George Kiesinger-led CDU-SPD grand coalition in 1966, Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and others. It remains part of modern German as also world history that it was a German politician, in this instance Brandt, who initiated the first moves toward East-West d\u00e9tente, a measure later solidified by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev. Brandt went to Warsaw in winter 1970, knelt in contrition over Nazi crimes before the memorial to Nazi victims and so informed the world that a better global landscape could be fashioned. Brandt visited East Berlin to speak to East German leaders. It was Brandt's Ostpolitik at work.Studies of modern Germany in our times cannot fail to take into account the remarkable economic leadership provided by Helmut Schmidt in the years he wielded power as Chancellor. Schmidt was followed by Helmut Kohl, whose sixteen years in office saw the Berlin Wall come down and the two segmented parts of the country reunite, despite reservations among many western leaders. Kohl did a fantastic job of creating the circumstances that would ease East Germany's linking up with the rest of the country. Having been communist, with intelligence agencies like Stasi being big brother to East Germans, and having been a Soviet satellite state, the GDR was pretty squeamish about its reinvention as part of the old Germany. Kohl eased the process, with finesse.One of the more remarkable stories of German resurgence in global politics relates to the rise of Angela Merkel as the reunified country's Chancellor. She grew up in the communist east, had her employment there. For her it was a stifling situation and had 1990 not happened, she would have toiled away as a scientist, which she is, in East Berlin and under communist rule. But as German Chancellor, Merkel turned out to be the voice of progressive moderation in world politics during the period of her governance. Her sympathy for refugees making it to European shores may have upset many in her country, but that her heart was in the right place was made clear by her policy on the issue. In an otherwise global scene of mediocre politicians, Angela Merkel was a stateswoman, a proper inheritor of the mantle of Willy Brandt.Germans are a contented lot today. In a world where not many countries are happy about their circumstances, Germans take pride in themselves. Their parents, who felt crushed in a divided country after 1945, would have celebrated the spirit of a new Germany, shedding its past, playing a pre-eminent role in global affairs today. Olaf Scholz knows what he needs to do.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Every child has the right to a legal identity. But many children born these days do not officially exist. According to the Office of the Registrar General, Birth and Death Registration, more than half of children under five years of age in Bangladesh do not have their births registered. As a result, these children are deprived of the proof of their identities and the reason is their parents face problem accessing registration service. Without a birth certificate, children are invisible to the government. This means they may miss out on essential programmes like child protection, health care and education that help secure their most fundamental rights. Since the government made online birth registration mandatory for all citizens from January 2021, people had to undergo untold sufferings to avail 18 citizen services including enrolment in educational institutions, registration for secondary school certificate examination, applying for a passport and driving license. They face numerous difficulties while filling out the forms online as well as face harassment at the relevant government offices where they have to go in person to submit the forms or correct the errors. Many also blame the inefficiency of government employees for mistakes in birth certificates prepared manually as all the information provided by applicants are not properly uploaded online while a number of people find their data missing from the main server. Birth and death registration under the two city corporations of Dhaka often remains closed due to technical problems at their malfunctioned server. The process was closed during the entire month of August. Despite fixing the server, it continues to remain nonfunctional for most of the time. This puts many registration seekers in a rough patch. Parents who want to enrol their children in new classes in January are often the victims, because no educational institutions would accept children their without a birth registration certificate. Registration within 45 days of birth and death requires no fee. Between 45 days and 5 years, the fee is Tk 25. Applicants who follow due process and do not seek any assistance from the brokers do not get their certificates on time. According to a parent who wanted to get the certificate on his own, tried for a month to access the website, but was unsuccessful. So, to avoid hassles, people are paying the brokers Tk 1,000 to Tk 1,500 to get the certificates. Some parents fail to get the certificate even after paying the brokers. In many countries, children are registered at birth, eliminating the need for parents to apply separately. Hospital authorities provide them a worksheet to fill in and later that sheet is used to register a birth digitally. Even in neighbouring India, newborns receive birth registration certificates immediately after birth. The Philippines has recently launched an online portal to register every birth. Bangladesh has also gone virtual to register every birth and death but this has been done without properly developing the system. By using better and more efficient technology, the problems of issuing birth and death certificates and correcting their errors could be resolved. Digitisation of any system should guarantee its users better service. And the birth registration process, too, should be easier, faster and hassle-free. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The Palestinians are enduring brutalities at the hands of Israeli forces, resulting in the loss of countless lives. The recent launching of missiles on Gaza has destroyed the area. A hospital has been flattened killing nearly 500 people including children, women and elderly people. It is heart-wrenching. Despite the bloodshed, Western countries such as the UK, France, Germany and the US seem to endorse these brutalities being committed against the Palestinians in Gaza . It raises the question of whether they would show sympathy for Israel if faced with a similar situation. The US has already declared unwavering support for Israel, terming its tyrannical practices as 'self-defence' and also vetoed against Palestine in the UN Security Council. Many Muslim countries have spoken out against Israel. Bangladesh has recently observed a day of state mourning for the Palestinians killed in recent Israeli attacks, making it one of a few countries in the world to do so. However, a concrete plan to liberate the Palestinians from the shackles of the Israeli regime is still elusive. It is a high time for the Muslim states to stand in solidarity with Palestine, extending a helping hand to their brothers suffering under miserable circumstances. Organisations like the OIC can play a pivotal role in uniting Muslims for a collective response against Israel.\nSirazi Shahjahan,Malibagh, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
