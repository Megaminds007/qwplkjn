However, progress on action to keep temperatures from rising beyond 1.5\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels was limited. The 27th edition of the United Nations Conference of the Parties was projected to be an \u2018implementation\u2019 COP that would have decisively resolved questions on how developed countries, responsible for the bulk of historical emissions, would make good on an old promise to provide developing countries $100 billion annually by 2020. And whether the world would commit to end all categories of fossil fuel, and not just coal. Despite hours of negotiations, these deadlocks remain. COP27 will certainly be remembered as the COP of Loss and Damages (L&D). A nearly three-decade old movement, first initiated by the island nation of Vanuatu and the Alliance of Small Island States, has come to partial fruition. There will now be a dedicated fund to compensate the most vulnerable developing countries that are already bearing the brunt of climate change-linked natural disasters. L&D refers to impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided either by mitigation (cutting greenhouse gas emissions) or adaptation (modifying practices to buffer against climate change impacts). They also include not only economic damage to property but also loss of livelihoods, and the destruction of biodiversity and sites that have cultural importance. This broadens the scope for affected nations to claim compensation.The text approved at Sharm el-Sheikh only commits to a fund being created and leaves discussions for how it is to be set up and, most importantly, who will pay how much to it, for future COP negotiations. While there have been nominal commitments by Scotland and Wallonia (Belgium) to donate to such a fund, the estimated L&D is already over $500 billion. During negotiations this year, the European Union pressed hard for China, the Arab states and \u201clarge, developing countries\u201d \u2014 and this could include India \u2014 to contribute on the grounds that they were large emitters. This already opens up fresh occasion for acrimony in future COPs and given that barely a third of committed climate finance has made its way to developing countries, the L&D fund too might take years before it can meaningfully operate. While the gain is incremental, countries ought not to lose momentum and must work harder to ensure that COPs remain credible catalysts and are not occasions for pyrrhic victories.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\nEgypt\n\n/\n\ncoal\n\n/\n\nEuropean Union",

The Russian invasion of its neighbouring country and NATO\u2019s decision to back Ukraine with military supplies have brought the two sides to an eyeball-to-eyeball situation, with only a spark needed for a conflagration. Immediately after the missile exploded inside Polish territory, which is a part of NATO, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russia, calling it an attack on the West\u2019s collective security and a significant escalation. Russia quickly distanced itself from the incident, but at least for a few hours, the world was on edge amid fears of this incident triggering an open war between Russia and NATO. But NATO leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, responded firmly and responsibly. Mr. Biden, who was in Bali to attend the G20 meeting, publicly refuted Mr. Zelenskyy\u2019s claim, saying it was unlikely that the missile came from Russia, which Polish and NATO authorities confirmed later. What hit Poland was a Russian-made S300 defence missile, most likely fired by Ukraine against a Russian missile, they said. While their sober response avoided a showdown, the incident has highlighted the risks of this hair-trigger situation.Mr. Zelenskyy\u2019s comment was irresponsible. His anger towards Russia is justifiable given that his country is being bombarded on a daily basis, but as the President of Ukraine, what he says will have consequences, and he should wait for the facts and respond cautiously when it comes to NATO-Russia tensions. Russia should understand that Ukraine is now a tinderbox. To overcome its battlefield failures, Russia is now deliberately targeting Ukrainian infrastructure with repeated missile attacks. A misfire could turn the nightmare into reality. All stakeholders, primarily Russia which started the war, have the responsibility to put in place the guardrails against escalation. They should turn the diffusion of the Polish crisis into an opportunity for open dialogue. As the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, pointed out, the conflict could enter a frozen stage during winter. Despite Ukraine\u2019s territorial gains, it is unlikely its forces will be able to expel Russians from all captured territories through force, he said, making his case for talks. Mr. Zelenskyy, reportedly under U.S. pressure, changed his earlier position that he would not hold talks with Mr. Putin. So, there is a small window for de-escalation. Russia must respond with concrete proposals and create conditions for a constructive dialogue.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\n LinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\nmissile systems\n\n/\n\npeace negotiations\n\n/ \n\nNATO",

        "full_article": "Tortuous negotiations at COP27 yielded an important breakthrough \u2013 the agreement to set up a loss and damage fund, often referred to as climate compensation fund. A compensation fund at climate talks is not new \u2013 the 2015 landmark Paris Agreement mentions it. However, acting upon it is a big step forward because it had to clear two hurdles. One, the largest emitters historically had to accept responsibility for irretrievable damage as warming above pre-industrial levels is already having an effect. Second, as COP27 works on consensus, everybody had to come on board.\nClearing these two hurdles represents a breakthrough in a year when heat waves or floods have ravaged countries such as Pakistan, which lack resources to cope. But this is where a bigger challenge awaits the world. A transitional committee to operationalise the compensation fund will now have to get down to coming up with an acceptable solution. So far, important promises on financing have not been kept, notably the $100 billion per year developed countries agreed to jointly mobilise in 2010. Financing in its entirety represents the biggest challenge.\nThe other significant deal is that, guided by pragmatic suggestions from India, COP27 agreed to transition out of fossil fuels. Three aspects stand out. There will be both a \u201cphase down\u201d of coal and a \u201cphase out\u201d of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies while providing targeted support for the economically vulnerable. This global transformation to a low carbon economy is doable only if there are investments of $4-6 trillion a year, according to the COP27 statement. For perspective, keep in mind Japan\u2019s GDP last year was $4.9 trillion. Given the current economic hardship on account of a slowing global economic momentum, creating a workable financing mechanism is unlikely to be easy.\nNotwithstanding these challenges, the silver lining is that COP27 showed that there is now a greater sense of urgency than before. The high incidence of extreme climatic events this year have instilled a greater sense of purpose among countries. India has set itself a target of reducing emissions intensity by 45% in 2030 while using 2005 as the baseline. Even as India contributes to the solution of coming up with a workable global financing mechanism, it must move ahead on its plan of pivoting towards green hydrogen and a higher use of nuclear power. These are perhaps the most practical responses.\n\n",

That Qatar, host of the 2022 edition of the world\u2019s greatest show, sporting or otherwise, is no poster boy for many liberal values is known. But neither was military junta-ruled Argentina, World Cup hosts in 1978, or even Russia, 2018 hosts, or 2008 Olympic hosts China. Nor were allegations of dirty political deals and backroom quid pro quo solely the feature of Qatar\u2019s winning bid for this World Cup.

That Qatar changed its mind on in-stadia alcohol at the last minute doesn\u2019t reduce the validity of Infantino\u2019s argument.\nThe fact is the world\u2019s balance of power is shifting, although slowly. China is already sitting at the high table, and bigger emerging economies like India are perhaps a decade or so away from that status. But already, in global sporting bodies, the collective power of Asia matters much more, as does that of Africa. The West\u2019s accommodation of these realities has been somewhat grudging. Remember the hostile reactions of England-Australia dominated international cricket administration to India\u2019s rising financial power. Now, global cricket minus India is unthinkable.\nAlso consider the hundreds of millions of dollars European football teams have received as investments from Gulf nations and China in recent years. Not just Qatar-owned PSG, but Barcelona, Manchester City and Inter Milan, and other top European clubs have attracted vanity investments from the Middle East and the Middle Kingdom. Money talks very loudly in running sports and those who have the cash will want their share of the limelight.

        "full_article": "Henry Kissinger, the American geostrategy and foreign policy stalwart, in the book \"On China\" shows how China's national psyche is shaped by its 5,000-year-old written history and the mythology that portrays it as an eternal existence at the centre of the universe. In the third century BC, unified China became the \"Middle Kingdom\" and continues to be so in its collective memory, making every Chinese, including its current leadership, a part of their ancient lineage. History also tells the Chinese that it was always wealthy, powerful, and self-sufficient, except during the \"century of humiliation\" from the Qing Dynasty's subjugation to Japan and the Western powers in 1839 to the formation of modern China in 1949. Beijing believes it i\u200b\u200bs their destiny to lead the world by 2049, the Communist Revolution's 100th anniversary, as set out in Xi Jinping's long-term vision.\nJust as China is now, the US was also once in a similar position in the 19th century. James Monroe, fifth president of the US, in his 1823 annual message to Congress, warned European powers not to interfere in the Western hemisphere because by that time Washington had become a boisterous military power. Later known as the Monroe Doctrine, it soon became the mainstay of US policy in the neighbourhood. In 1865, it helped Mexican President Benito Ju\u00e1rez to defeat Emperor Maximilian, who was propped up by the French. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt threatened military intervention against Britain and Germany for laying siege on Venezuela to collect outstanding debts. In that same year, US Marines replaced the Panamanian government with secessionists and, soon thereafter, secured the right to the Panama Canal Zone in perpetuity. The Marines were sent to Santo Domingo in 1904, Nicaragua in 1911, and Haiti in 1915, every time to keep the Europeans out. Much to the discomfort of the smaller nations, Washington intervened militarily in South America in over 30 separate occasions to set things in its favour.\nIn 1917, the US entered the global arena during the First World War and helped Britain and France defeat Germany. Thereafter, with a mighty economy and military, it replaced Britain to become the new global leader. However, America didn't undertake the global responsibility that came with it, such as promoting security, financial stability, freedom of the seas, and free trade.\nThus, a superpower failed to play its due role in providing global public goods. It's a situation Harvard professor Joseph Nye termed the Kindleberger Trap, from the works of US economic historian Charles Kindleberger. The result was the economic chaos of the 1930s and the Second World War in 1939 that left Europe in ruins.\nWWII ended in 1945, consolidating the US position further. This time, it emerged as the guardian of peace, institutionalised in the United Nations (UN) and its Security Council. Washington also formed the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the two Bretton Woods institutions, and spearheaded reconstruction of Europe with a massive financial package, the Marshall Plan. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) soon followed, which later transitioned into the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1991, the Soviet Union fell, leaving the US as the sole superpower. In 2012, President Obama labelled China as America's greatest strategic threat, setting the stage for the classic Thucydides Trap, a term coined by Harvard Fellow Graham Allison.\nAllison used it to describe a situation where an emerging power threatens to dislodge an existing one, the result of which is often war. To explain the US-China rivalry, he referred to the Athenian historian and military general Thucydides, who argued that the Peloponnesian War had been inevitable because of the incumbent power Sparta's fears of Athens' increasing might. Allison showed that among 16 historical instances of an emerging power rivalling a ruling one, 12 ended in wars. Despite considerable criticism, the argument has since drawn much attention.\nThe US, meanwhile, again fell into the Kindleberger Trap, as it did in the 1930s. Washington's misadventures in the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan didn't demonstrate its commitment to global peace and stability. Its unilateral War on Terror bypassing the UN came to be a catastrophic failure, causing more devastation and death than terrorism did. The current situation in Ukraine is yet another case of how global wellbeing is sacrificed at the altar of superpower ego.\nThat brings us to the question of whether China, the emerging power, can learn from US mistakes and take a more responsible stand on global issues. Ever since WWII, the US has been the rule writer and enforcer. Now, with the rise of a competing power that fosters a different set of values, all that is facing an enormous challenge. China's rise could prove to be history's biggest displacement in global power balance, and international systems must also shift accordingly.\nAs Singapore's former leader Lee Kuan Yew succinctly put it: \"China wants to be China and accepted as such, not as an honorary member of the West.\" By accommodating each other and learning from past mistakes, the superpowers can become responsible leaders and escape both traps, Thucydides and Kindleberger. We hope Biden and Xi remembered that when they met in Bali last week.\nDr Sayeed Ahmed\u00a0is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The term diaspora originates from the ancient Greek dia speiro meaning a scattering of seeds. Originally used to represent the ancient Greek and Jewish exiles, \"diaspora\" is now used in general terms to refer to the movement and dispersal of people who affirm a shared identity based on their place of origin.\nMovements across national borders are part of a regional history that predates Bangladesh as an independent state in 1971. The end of British rule over South Asia in 1947, accompanied by the partition of India, spurred one of the largest mass migrations in history, of an estimated fifteen million people. However, it is only after 1971 that we see the development of distinctively Bangladeshi international migration flows and settlements, defined by their relationship to and identification with Bangladesh as a nation. Since then, the Bangladesh diaspora population, also known as \"probashi Bangali\" or people from Bangladesh who live abroad has grown. From the Shaheed Minar Monument in Toronto, Canada, to the \"Welcome to Bangla town\" signs that greet people in Hamtramck, Michigan in the USA, the Bangladesh diaspora of today is a visible and influential presence in metropolitan areas throughout the world.\nFrom 1947 to 1971, during the period of Pakistani rule, movement abroad was limited for people from present day Bangladesh because of the discriminatory practices of the Pakistani government including the routine denial of passports to the Bengalis of East Pakistan. Despite these constraints, the Pakistan era did see the development of a migration circuit between the region of Sylhet (Northeast Bangladesh) and Britain. The roots of this circuit lay in the nineteenth century history of young men from Sylhet who found work as lascars or sailors on British ships that carried out goods from the region. The experiences of these pioneering seamen created a culture of migration in the region with enduring social networks between Sylhet and Britain. In the post-WWII years, Bengalis moved to Britain as labor migrants and gradually established their presence by sponsoring family members to join them.\nStarting in the 1980s, national and global forces converged to usher in an era of expanding international migration for Bangladesh. National policies became increasingly subject to international financial regimes and the principles of state-centered development were replaced by those of integration into the global market economy. A major component of these movements is labor migration directed largely towards the oil-producing GCC states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\u00a0 Since the 1990s, these destinations have expanded from the GCC to include a wider range of countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Jordan and Lebanon. Hampering the growth of stable, multi-generational Bangladeshi diaspora communities in these societies are host country policies designed to prevent long-term settlement and integration and to ensure that Bangladeshi workers return home. Most Bangladeshis are recruited to work abroad on short-term labor contracts, often for low-skilled jobs in agriculture, construction and domestic service. With some exceptions for professional, entrepreneurial and skilled migrants, families are not permitted to join them. In these societies, citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in the territory and opportunities for naturalized citizenship are largely limited to the foreign wives of national men and. Foreign workers are generally prohibited from marrying locals.\nBesides labor migration, a second stream of post-1980s international migration from Bangladesh has been towards the Global North, to Australia, Canada, Italy, the United States and other economically developed countries. A critical feature of the second stream, unlike the first, are the available opportunities in the destination societies for family migration and permanent settlement. Unlike the first, the second stream has also largely been of Bangladeshis with middle-class origins.\nThe independence of Bangladesh in 1971 resulted in expansion in the ranks of the middle-class due to a new growth of employment opportunities in the public administration sector. Since that time, the Bangladeshi middle class has grown and stratified to include professionals, business owners, and white-collar workers in the financial and retail industries and NGO sector. In a \"brain drain\" dynamic, Bangladeshis holding professional credentials and skills that are valued in the global market have migrated in response to lucrative and attractive employment opportunities that are far superior to what is available to them in Bangladesh. Family reunification laws have enabled them to sponsor family members to join them. Besides the possibility of better employment opportunities, the goal of acquiring globally recognized educational credentials for one's children drives these movements to the Global North.\u00a0 Of relevance also is the growth of middle-class consumption in early twenty-first century Bangladesh that is oriented towards the global market. As is the case in neighboring India as well as in other parts of the world, this \"new middle class\" as it is often called, is defined by its taste for globally branded goods, whether it is electronics or fast food. Under a neoliberal global regime, migration and settlement in the developed world has been informed by goals of upward mobility through a lifestyle that satisfies emergent consumption standards.\nWhat will the Bangladesh diaspora of the future be like? Despite the increasingly restrictive policies of migrant-receiving countries, I am quite sure that the Bangladeshi presence abroad will continue to expand in size and breadth across different parts of the world. I am less certain though about how the diaspora, across its many diverse segments, will identify with Bangladesh and organize ties to the country in the years to come. Some of this depends on the state of governance and politics in Bangladesh, which will shape levels of trust in the country's institutions and confidence in its continued progress. These conditions have important consequences for how Bangladeshis abroad understand and act towards their country of origin. For example, pride in the country's progress and confidence in its future encourage the diaspora to maintain active ties with the homeland, and to invest and participate in its progress. Conversely, reports of corruption (often verified by frustrating personal encounters with government bureaucracies), human rights abuses, unsafe roads and declining democratic practices foster a desire to distance and disassociate with the country.\nWe can expect the diaspora policies of the Bangladesh state to have an impact on the relationship of expatriates to the homeland. Since the 1990s, Bangladesh has acknowledged the importance of the diaspora, especially of the remittances, for the country's economy; remittances are a major source of foreign earnings for Bangladesh. In 1990, the Wage Earners Welfare Fund, which requires contributions from each migrant worker, was set up to help migrant workers and their families in emergency situations such as illness, death or legal problems in the receiving countries. In 2002, the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment was created with the goal of facilitating labor migration, exploring new labor markets and ensuring the welfare of Bangladeshi migrant workers. Despite these efforts, successive governments have faced intense criticism for their failure to protect the most vulnerable less-skilled labor migrant citizens from the abuses of the labor migration system, especially from mistreatment by foreign employers and exploitation by recruiting agents.\nWith respect to the permanently settled diaspora population, the Bangladesh state has drawn inspiration from the much-heralded diaspora role in two of the world's most important growing economies \u2013 China and India. Like \"NRI\" (Non-Resident Indian) in India, \"NRB\" or \"Non-Resident Bangladeshi\" has emerged as an official category of identification, suggesting a particular connection and attendant privileges with respect to the Bangladesh state. These range from special NRB eligibility for certain kinds of foreign currency bank accounts in Bangladesh as well as the official waiver of Bangladesh visa fees and requirements for NRBs who are traveling to Bangladesh on a foreign passport. The Dual Nationality policy of Bangladesh, which allows those who are foreign citizens of Bangladeshi origin (as well as the children born to them) to become or to affirm their citizenship, has also institutionalized NRB status.\nIn recent years, expatriate demands for greater political rights in Bangladesh have grown. For example, segments of the diaspora have vigorously lobbied for dual nationals to hold the same rights and privileges as other citizens, including voting rights and eligibility to participate as candidates in local and national elections. These demands reflect the important role of diaspora communities in the politics of Bangladesh, whether through financial support of political parties and candidates, or the lobbying of foreign governments and bodies to support a particular cause.\u00a0\u00a0 Political leaders in Bangladesh have expressed concern at various times (especially when they are in power) about the diaspora's undue influence through its international connections, on the political scene in Bangladesh.\nBesides political and policy developments, I see the future of the Bangladesh diaspora to rest on the continued identification with the homeland of those who are of Bangladeshi origin but were born and/or raised abroad. Bangladeshis around the world have established local groups and associations that aim to facilitate and encourage the practice of cultural traditions as well as foster a sense of community among Bangladeshis. They organize social and cultural events, such as annual picnics, Bangladesh Independence Day celebrations, and cultural shows featuring celebrity singers and performers from Bangladesh. They may also hold Bengali language classes for children on the weekends and conduct fundraisers for charity and disaster relief efforts in Bangladesh. Communities also work to establish ties with local political representatives and authorities in an effort to gain recognition for community needs and support for projects ranging from introducing Bengali as a second language in public schools to permission for building mosques and community centers.\u00a0\nAnother type of diaspora association is the HTA (Hometown Association) which brings together those from a specific locale in Bangladesh with the goal of fostering social ties among them and collectively engaging in good works back in the home community. There are also alumni associations based on affiliation with schools and universities in Bangladesh as well as occupation-based groups such as the American Association of Bangladeshi Engineers and Architects. The activities of these associations typically include annual meetings, newsletters, internet chat groups, and fundraising for scholarships in Bangladesh.\nTo what extent will the community organizations of the Bangladesh diaspora, initiated largely by people who were born and raised in Bangladesh, be successful in fostering a continued sense of identification with Bangladesh among the younger generations? In my research on second-generation Bangladeshis in the UK and the USA, I found a range of attitudes towards Bangladesh: of strong commitment to maintaining ties as well as rejection of them, with most falling somewhere in the middle of these extremes. In the context of a post-9/11 political landscape with its War on Terror policies and rampant Islamophobia, many young persons were inclined to prioritize their identity as Muslims over and above their Bangladeshi origins.\u00a0\nOver the course of over fifty years of independence, Bangladesh has shifted, from a region of limited to one of extensive overseas movements. The Bangladesh diaspora, composed of a diverse set of movements and settlements of Bangladeshis around the world, continues to grow and evolve.\nNazli Kibria is Professor of Sociology, Boston University, USA.

Institutional failure follows these characters around as if their entire arc depends on the continued negligence of duty of public servants, failure of communities and perseverance of general lawlessness. Without them, the individual billionaire superhero is just another rich bored guy without a higher calling, withering away in relative anonymity.\u00a0\nBoth Bruce Wayne and his masked counterpart have a tendency to operate outside of the law \u2013 even when Batman dons his Bruce Wayne persona to interact with \"normal\" people, his wealth and status put him well beyond reproach and allows him to do extraordinary things, things we all wish we could do \u2013 like buying up an entire hotel where the manager was rude to someone once because of the tattered clothes they wore. It fuels our capitalist revenge fantasies as we imagine using a fraction of our near-inexhaustible wealth to teach the lesson of a lifetime to someone who has dared to slight us.\u00a0\nTo say Elon Musk isn't prone to the same vengeful fantasies as us would be wrong. Filthy rich or not, he's still human. Prophetic overlord of SpaceX, Tesla, The Boring Company and now Twitter, Elon is from an industry that is dominated by an adherence to the cult of personality \u2013 you don't actually need to be able to do things or even know things, as long as you hold a position of power and are able to say smart sounding things at a moment's notice, you're a god among men. Your patience, your tolerance for perceived stupidity is so low as to be legendary, and you are seen as the all-knowing being who will pull engineers, developers, business analysts and product managers out of the squalor of ineptitude and onto the path of glory.\nIt matters little that the man taking the credit for electrifying the world's roads and building the rockets that will ultimately whisk us away to safety once we're done killing this planet has very little engineering excellence to back up his claims to prophethood. To date, he has a total of 18 patents, out of which nine are inactive/obsolete and the remaining nine are mainly related to autonomous vehicles, charging ports and location based searches. SpaceX and Tesla, Elon's most successful ventures to date, are valuable purely because of speculation \u2013 based on where investors think the world is heading and which companies they see to be leading the charge.\nSo when Elon Musk undertakes an aggressive takeover of Twitter and brands it as him \"saving\" the platform and upholding the values of free speech that he believes in, one has to ask, what actually makes him qualified for the role?\u00a0\nGiven the disastrous results of the USD 8 for a \"verified\" blue tick stunt that he spearheaded right after taking charge of Twitter, the answer to Elon's qualifications seems to be clear. Parody accounts that paid the paltry sum for a verified blue tick caused billions of dollars of damages to publicly traded behemoths like CocaCola, Lockheed Martin and Eli Lilly, with scathing \"confessional\" style Tweets that would shame even the most cutthroat digital anarchist being levelled against some of the worst offenders of climate, war profiteering and healthcare. Advertisers pulled away from the volatile mess and hotbed of memes that Twitter was quickly devolving into, yet Elon's ego made sure to put a positive spin to his house burning down by marvelling at the number of people who showed up to watch it go down in flames. \u00a0\nThe saddest part of Elon's Twitter saga may have come when he claimed the social media platform's performance suffers in many countries due to the excessive number of batched Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) used by the feed to load content, only to be told to his face in a tweeted response by some senior engineers that Twitter does not use RPC protocols at all, instead favouring GraphQL. It's equally funny and sad that tech guru Elon doesn't know the tech stack of the company he's trying to \"save\", but the fun runs out when a bit of light digging reveals that Elon immediately fired the engineer(s) who had responded to him and challenged his ego on what is purely facts. Let's not even go into the hypocritical nature of Elon and how retaliatory firing of employees for speaking their minds simply goes against the \"free speech\" mandate he wants to be championing.\u00a0\nFor anyone even remotely familiar with the global tech industry, it should be clear that Elon Musk would not be qualified to hold a junior business analyst role at a tech company in Bangladesh on his own merits, and would undoubtedly be fired in no time over his antics. That his South African apartheid profiteering family and his emerald mine-backed family fortune essentially allowed him to buy his way into the world of technology, and that he's held on and risen up by swindling and dealing, needs to be made clear to the whole world.\u00a0\nFor technology to truly reshape the world and our communities in a meaningful, impactful way, we must move away from false idolatry and worshipping the cult of personality. Technological advancements have the possibility to bring net good to society and may hold the tools to ensure the continued survival of humans as a species, but it is absolutely vital that we look to community building and ensuring our institutions are functional and accountable, instead of replacing them with so-called individual superheroes. Placing our collective faith in one person's ability to manage his ego in delivering salvation might just cause everything to crash and burn faster.\nShaer Reaz is a Product Manager with SELISE Digital Platforms and is a tech enthusiast interested in social justice, human rights and history.

        "full_article": "It is not usual for presidents in this country to be critical of public institutions. This is why President Abdul Hamid's scathing remarks about the nepotism, corruption and professional insincerity of some vice-chancellors (VCs) of public universities are quite refreshing. He shared his opinion during his speech at the 53rd convocation of Dhaka University on Saturday. The president recommended that all university recruitments would be based on merit and quality, and that transparency and accountability must be ensured.\nIt is sad, however, that this bare minimum of prerequisites of a public institution should have to be stressed upon after 51 years of our independence, and at a convocation speech at our most prestigious public university. We are, of course, relieved to see that as Chancellor of all public universities, the president has frankly pointed out this gross anomaly in many of these institutions.\nBut why, we must ask, has this anomaly been allowed to flourish for so many decades? What the president was alluding to was no doubt the extensive media coverage of various allegations against various VCs alleged to have misused funds, appointed family members as faculty, become involved in question paper leaks, remained absent from campus for long periods of time, and played an inactive or biased role when Chhatra League cadres were implicated in various crimes including sexual harassment, torture, murder, and assaults on general students.\nWhich brings us to the crux of the problem \u2013 political appointment of vice-chancellors \u2013 a practice noticed during all our successive governments including the present one.\nIt is a given that a teacher has to be affiliated with a pro-government teacher's panel to be nominated for the top post. Not long ago,\u00a0The Daily Star revealed that at least 39 out of 48 VCs of public universities held posts in different pro-government teachers' wings during their career. This means that the best candidates were not chosen for such a crucial post. In a scenario where public educational institutions are already plagued by the reign of terror of members of the ruling party's student wing, with the teachers and VCs largely politically appointed, how can we expect a healthy academic atmosphere? How can we expect academic excellence, ground-breaking research, or a prestigious international ranking?\nIf one is really bothered about the health of academic life in these public universities, one can trace the cause of the disease to the politicisation of recruitment of faculty and vice-chancellor. The position of the VC is indeed exalted, because it entails an enormous responsibility to uphold the highest ethical values and academic standards of the institution. VCs are the most powerful leaders of academia and must lead by example. The government in power must, therefore, disassociate itself from the recruitment of such posts and ensure that these institutions function independently without political influence. At the same time, these institutions\u00a0must remain accountable.\n",

        "full_article": "The country's general cell (mobile) phone and internet users may not have entertained the thought even in their wildest dreams that the affordable digital devices will suddenly become unaffordable. Along with the post-Covid travails has the Russo-Ukraine conflict unleashed a plethora of woes --- especially in the communication sector. Their stranglehold on the mainstream economies including that of Bangladesh speaks of an unsavoury times vis-\u00e0-vis the fruits of the ongoing digital age. In Bangladesh, the critical phase following the halcyon days of the digital age comes as a severe blow. The shock which the country's three private mobile network operators (MNOs) have had to absorb came in the form of huge losses. As the latest data show, the operators have lost nearly two million mobile subscribers and over one million internet users in September. At the same time, the Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission (BTRC) elaborated on this statistics on Nov 16. According to it, the total number of customers in Bangladesh has dropped by 2.15 million from 183.58 million in August to181.43 million in September. The situation has come to this pass by way of many other trends linked to digital technicalities, one of the consequences being a ban on Grameen Phone's SIM chip sales. The period witnessed a 5-fold increase in the prices of SIM chips globally. That this price rise of the chips has its roots in the worldwide sources and, thus, has inhibited the subscribers' growth is implied. Of the three domestic mobile network operators, Grameen emerged as the most affected. It lost 1.2 million subscribers in September. It was followed by Robi Axiata, losing 590,000 subscribers, and Banglalink, the third largest, parting with 420,000 subscribers. Teletalk, the lone government-run operator, has, however, gained by registering 6,000 new subscribers in the month of September. Given the stark realities prevailing globally, a reversal of the situation doesn't appear to visit the Bangladesh mobile phone subscribers and internet users anytime soon. That this grim fact following loss of an astronomical number of subscribers and users leads inevitably to revenue losses is a natural corollary. Nothing could be more disheartening for these earlier semi-digitised people than letting themselves to be stuck again in their 'long ditched' analogue system. Undoubtedly, it's a straight fall from a brave new world. Perhaps, the severest damage inflicted on the fast expanding digitisation in the country is the Grameenphone embargo on SIM purchase/sale. The operator admits their limitations. Earlier, a person could use more than one Grameen SIM, which became a normal practice. The mobile phone market observers find the embargo on using more than one SIM to be one of the causes behind the anaemic mobile sale proceeds.Bad news of other types also disheartens the prospective mobile buyers. Apart from the embargo on more than one SIM purchase, another new rule on mobile phone use is now in force. It prevents phone users from reactivating their long-unused SIMs. The other two operators haven't been spared disincentives --- but those belong to other categories. All this is related to 5-fold increase in prices of SIM chip globally. The country has evidently undergone a sudden jolt stemming from higher chip price. It has the potential for leaving deleterious impacts on the country's growing digitisation as well as mobile communication --- a revolution, the ripples of which are felt in almost all segments of society.",

        "full_article": "When the world should have been more united to fight climate change, delegates of 200 countries participating in the climate talk at the UN's 27th climate summit (COP27) at the Red Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt have worked hard to finally strike a deal. It is about creating a fund to help nations most affected by climate change. But earlier there was a difference of opinions about who would compensate the developing countries for 'loss and damage' they suffered due to climate change. At a point, the climate talk was on the verge of collapsing as the EU delegates threatened to walk away saying no deal was better than a bad deal. The 27-nation EU said it was willing to compensate developing nations for the climate-change-related 'loss and damage' they have been subjected to, but they also wanted the larger emerging economies like China, Saudi Arabia and Singapore to share the burden. Moreover, they (EU delegates) argued in favour of tying climate compensation to tougher emission cuts. But that raised a question about how to define a developing country. And this controversy over who would pay for the said 'loss and damage' has the climate talk run into overtime. The rich developing economies which have joined the club of industrialised nations recently are not willing to see eye to eye with the EU, or the West for that matter. But such differences can and should be sorted out, keeping in view that the issue of global warming is an existential one for humanity. No difference in views can be big enough for any party to decide to leave the climate talk. The West needs to accept responsibility. For the fact remains that it was their (the industrial West's) indiscriminate burning of fossil fuel over the last two centuries (since the Industrial Revolution around 1830s) that the world has gradually got warmer than it was in the pre-industrial times. From that point of view, the richer developing economies' share in the present level of global warming is far less than that of their Western counterparts. Nonetheless, the neo-rich economies have also a responsibility towards the less fortunate countries worst-affected by climate change. So, the outcome of the present climate summit, though, thankfully, a positive one, cannot be an end in itself. The world's leading industrialised nations should be made to shoulder more responsibility for the climate issue. But what about the more urgent task of limiting global warming to the key threshold of 1.5C(degrees centigrade) above pre-industrial level as agreed at the 2015's Paris climate summit? The world must vigorously work for finding an alternative to fossil-fuel-based energy. As cleaner and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels to run industries and generate power are yet to be fully developed, the use of fossil fuel is still going on in full swing. The volatility in the world's energy market caused by Russia-Ukraine war and the high inflation and recessionary trend that it has triggered in the world economy have again demonstrated the grave existential threat to life on earth. In fact, a world not dependent on fossil-based energy is still far off and such fuels will continue to burn raising the global temperature. That makes it incumbent on us to avoid using fossil fuel. Of the many different approaches to developing renewable sources of energy, the solar technology has proved to be most viable so far. Admittedly, the photovoltaic cells are leading the way in this regard. But as the land necessary to install big solar panels is becoming scarcer by the day, especially, in densely populated countries like Bangladesh, new ways have to be devised to get around the problem. Recently, solar panels mounted on platforms floating on water have been gaining popularity worldwide. According to a report global demand for floating solar power is expected to grow on an average by 22 per cent between 2019 and 2024. Bangladesh is best-suited to this technology as it has numerous water bodies. Of late, floating solar panels are becoming more efficient at harvesting sunrays. For a new technology has been added to these floating solar panels so that they may track the Sun as it moves across the sky in the daytime. As a result, it can catch more sunrays in a day than the normal ones. The BBC reports that there is such a sun-tracking island (of solar panel) floating in the Oostvoornse Meer, a lake in the South-West Netherlands. The said floating island has 180 of these sun-seeking solar panels 'with a total installed capacity of 73 kilowatt of peak power (kWp). This may not look big, but consider its impact once used on a larger scale across the globe. Also, there are other technologies around to make use of the existing grid power, for example, to heat sand and store it for later use. In the town of Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, about 230 kilometres south-west of Helsinki in Finland, homes and offices are being kept warm with the help of what they call 'sand batteries'. 100 tonnes of sand stored in a 7-metre high steel container is such a 'sand battery'. The Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 sand battery is connected to the power grid and runs when electricity is cheapest. To be frank, the present level of technology is not still able to provide a single alternative to fossil-fuel-based energy. Until the time the technology is advanced enough, humanity will have to use a mix of options to reduce the use of fossil fuel as much as possible. To that end, the talks at the climate summits should be able to come up with binding rules for all countries so that they feel prompted to drastically reduce the use of fossil fuel.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The World Cup Football in Qatar, first in a Gulf country of the Middle East kicked off yesterday with the host country taking on Ecuador. But only a small fraction of football fans the world over will be lucky enough to watch matches from the gallery. However football fever has not gripped in the least those who will not be present in the stadiums in Qatar. The greatest show on Earth is expected to be viewed by the record number of football lovers all over the globe. Bangladesh may not be a contender for a place among the 32 teams that earn the right to compete at the final stage of competition, the craze for football among some of the followers here is too overwhelming to be matched by that of their counterparts anywhere in the world. The passion of some goes beyond all limits and therefore draws flaks from conservative quarters. They consider the excesses nothing but sheer insanity. What a man from a remote village called Khalla in Brahmanbaria has done can send many people's heads into a spin. He has unfurled a South Korean flag supporting that country's team. And lo! the flag he has made is four-kilometre long and it cost him a whooping amount of Tk500,000. But he is not a rich person. He and his wife saved Tk 180,000 for the purpose, which proved inadequate. So he had to sell the land property he received as a share for his wife from his father-in-law's side and on which he planted trees. Thus he satisfied his intense passion for doing something extraordinary for a team he considered most favourite when S Korea hosted the World Cup in 2002. At that time the man was in that country as an expatriate worker. It is unbelievable that he has kept alight the flame in his heart for two decades for a team that has hardly any chance of proceeding too far this time.His exceptional feat, however, has been overtaken by another flag of Germany displayed in Magura, which, its chief organiser claims, is the largest in the world. How much it cost and how the money was managed for making the flag is not known but what can be assumed is that the two record-breaking flags will make supporters, if not all, at least the crazy among the Argentine and Brazil supporters depressed. Will they also go for a flurry of never-say-die flag competition when the footballers in stadiums in Qatar will give their best to wrench a win over their rivals? Football fans in this country have mainly been divided into two camps ---Argentina and Brazil. Supporters of the two camps compete to beat their rivals in hoisting the largest flags of their preferred countries. Last time in 2018, two die-hard supporters in a village decorated their houses in the colours of Brazili's and Argentina's flags. This year also in Sirajganj town a Brazil supporter has painted his entire house including the roof with the colours of Brazil's flag. The front wall has on it a large flag of the Selecao painted and inscribed on it is 'Brazil Bari (home). So long no house painted in Albiceleste flag colours has come to notice but hopefully it will not take long to do so. If the country cannot produce world class footballers and a national team of the WC brand, what options do followers of this most popular game have open before them? They are satisfying their ego by tussling over the size of flags. But aren't they taking their cravings for entertainment much too far, particularly at a time when many of their compatriots are in no position to manage the minimum daily foods required for maintaining their body and soul together?The leading footballers of the world earn millions of dollars annually and the champion team and the runners-up will receive $42 million and $30 million respectively. Even the teams placed between 17th and 32nd will get $9.0 million each. But fans back home of the teams represented at the Qatar WC finals are unlikely to have one like the Brahmanbaria supporter of the Korean team. Thus Bangladesh beats the world in a strange way. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

However, habits like reading books are now hardly found in Bangladesh. Younger generations are losing interest in books and libraries. There are a number of bookshops in cities like Dhaka but they often remain empty. Not many people visit bookstores these days. The main reason behind the lack of visits is the lack of interest in reading books. From students to teachers, from parents to the children, all are spending most of their precious time on technological automaton. As a result, the reading habit is dying gradually. When we had no smartphones, we used to spend a large part of our day reading our favourite books and authors. Senior citizens used to tell stories to children. People used to form reading circles and have a collection of books in their drawing rooms. Lending and borrowing books for reading was a common trend. However, all these are things of the past. We have grown a kind of reluctance to our reading habit. Despite the fact that the habit of reading is facing a decline, it is high time that children were told to spend more time with books rather than technological devices. Reading books opens the vision of a nation and teaches truths and realities that lead to progress. This not only helps in envisioning the current problems but helps us predict the future and come up with solutions to overcome them. We need books more than anything else. We also need more and more libraries. It is important that both the government and society promoted reading habits\nMuhammad Jaeid, Student of Department of Sociology, Dhaka Collage, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
