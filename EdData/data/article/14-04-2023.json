Contradictions are many, at the ideological and personal levels; and they represent conflicting interest groups in most cases. Some tend to be guarded in their approach to the BJP, and when they turn strident against it, it is most often to safeguard their home turfs. The meetings between Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and other party leaders such as the Congress\u2019s Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, the CPI(M)\u2019s Sitaram Yechury and the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s Arvind Kejriwal, in New Delhi were exploratory rather than decisive. What is clear, however, is an increasing realisation among non-BJP parties that mutual animosities might turn them into easy prey for the BJP, whose hunger for power is infinite. The fact that most of these non-BJP parties were born out of antagonism to the Congress \u2014 and the BJP\u2019s national rival \u2014 makes finding common ground even more evasive. The BJP is the hegemon in the Hindi heartland, while it faces resistance from regional parties in several States. An alliance between the regional parties does not lead to any transfer of votes as they exist in different regions. Some of these parties are rivals at the State level, as in the case of the Left and the Congress in Kerala. Therefore, pre-poll alliances are of limited consequence, generally speaking.But there are certain States where parties could come together to aggregate anti-BJP votes, most importantly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where several parties are in the fray. A lot will depend on how well the Congress manages to galvanise support in States where it is the BJP\u2019s primary opponent, as in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. Social justice parties such as the Janata Dal (U) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar, and the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh can coordinate their actions with the Congress. Mr. Nitish Kumar\u2019s role is important from this point of view, but social justice politics itself is facing a crisis of legitimacy in the face of Hindutva. Alliances are important, but a shared programme and vision, amplified by sustained outreach to the public, are more important. The significant differences of opinion among key Opposition leaders over the Adani controversy, and V.D. Savarkar are cases in point. Any Opposition front will have to concede the wide variety of opinions and interests that exist among its key actors. The challenge for them is to discover common ground where they can converge. A puritan idealistic pursuit is an untimely luxury at the moment; in any case, that will not be a match to the ideological cohesiveness of the BJP.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\npolitical parties\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nAam Aadmi Party\n\n/\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nBihar\n\n/\n\npolitical development",

Earlier, Ukraine had publicly expressed its displeasure over India\u2019s position on the war. In August last year, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had attacked India\u2019s energy purchases from Russia, saying it involved \u201cUkrainian blood\u201d, and that Kyiv expected \u201cmore practical support\u201d from New Delhi. But Ms. Dzhaparova sounded more pragmatic when she said Ukraine did not want to instruct India on its energy and economic ties with other countries, but that her nation was fighting an existential battle. The war has left India in a difficult position. Russia is a historical partner which India has deep defence ties with and there is no easy, immediate alternative here. And, Russia\u2019s aggression is a naked violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and international laws. The war has also made India\u2019s ties with its western partners complicated as the trans-Atlantic powers, led by the United States, have launched an economic war against Russia, from which India and most of the Global South have stayed away.What India has done is to try and navigate this maze of geopolitics through realpolitik \u2014 it has refused to condemn Russia, maintained defence and trade ties, as well as expressed its uneasiness with the war and called for respecting the territorial integrity of all nations. But as the war drags on, this balancing act could be interpreted as inactiveness. India is the chair of the G-20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and will be pressed to do more to show global leadership and help end the war. The conflict has hurt not only Europe but also the entire world and there is growing consensus among the countries in the Global South that the hostilities should cease at the earliest. China and Brazil have sensed this urgency and have hinted at playing a bigger role in brokering peace. India should not shy away. New Delhi has good ties with Moscow, and Ms. Dzhaparova\u2019s visit suggests that Kyiv is also looking to India to play a bigger role in peacemaking. India\u2019s policy towards the conflict is rooted in its strategic neutrality. But neutrality does not mean that it should do nothing, waiting for the conflict to run its course. It should empathise more vocally with the victim, raise the voice and interests of the Global South, and call for upholding international laws and sovereignty of all states, while at the same time pushing for a pragmatic and permanent solution to the conflict.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nRussia-Ukraine Crisis\n\n/\n\ndiplomacy\n\n/\n\nIndia\n\n/\n\nRussia\n\n/\n\nenergy resources\n\n/\n\nG20\n\n/\n\ninternational relations\n\n/\n\nlaws",

        "full_article": "Two separate cases in the Supreme Court this week highlighted the abuse of India\u2019s web of preventive detention laws that confer the executive with extraordinary powers. In one case, SC ticked off the UP government for inappropriately invoking the National Security Act in a case with political undertones. In another case (Pramod Singla vs UoI), the bench pointed out that India\u2019s preventive detention laws are a colonial legacy with a potential to be misused.\nPreventive detention laws are used in anticipation of a crime. At the central level, they have existed in different forms from 1950, with the draconian NSA introduced over four decades ago. Between 2017 and 2021, annual detentions under NSA ranged between 483 and 741. Keep in mind that SC has said that laws with arbitrary detention powers must be used only in the rarest of rare cases. Also, since it centres on a potential crime, courts must give every benefit of doubt to the detenu. This cardinal principle is not followed often enough. In the case pertaining to the UP government\u2019s detention under NSA, the detenu was forced to approach SC following a delay in Allahabad HC in deciding his plea.\n\nGoI data shows that in 2021, preventive detention cases increased by almost 24% to 1. 1 lakh. States, which have their own preventive detention laws, are among the worst offenders, no matter which party is in power. Last year, Madras HC criticised the state for indiscriminate use of the Goondas Act to trigger preventive detentions. Given the politicisation of the police, inevitably the abuse of preventive detention laws has political undertones. The colonial legacy of preventive detention laws means they are often used in cases catalysed mainly by political differences.\nThe root of the problem is both the intent and wording of laws which provide a broad reading of circumstances under which constitutional rights can be suppressed. This has been the case since 1950. A recent example is the IT Rules 2021 and its amendments that can open the door to action against views deemed officially \u201cunfavourable\u201d. Given that SC rulings have unambiguously stated that conditions under which a fundamental right can be suppressed have to be narrowly defined, shouldn\u2019t some of the most egregious portions of India\u2019s web of preventive detention laws be read down? As long as they are part of the statute, they are bound to be abused.\n\n",

But with improvements in sanitation, nutrition and healthcare, successive cohorts of children and adolescents have narrowed the rural lag. That\u2019s the glass half full. On the half empty side, children growing up in cities are not showing the expected growth. Interestingly, as a global analysis conducted by Imperial College London, published in Nature, and highlighted by TOI yesterday finds, this is a trend across middle-income countries and emerging economies. They are beginning to mirror high-income countries\u2019 relatively small urban-rural height differentials.\n\nThe cause for worry for India is that the rapid decline in nutritional deficiencies and malnourishment in rural areas is going hand in hand with certain urban environments destroying all benefits of better access to healthcare and education in the city. Indeed, the risks of being either undernourished or obese rise here. Particularly in city slums, children grow up amidst poor sanitation and polluted air and without enough space to play. A 2021 ICMR-INDIAB study indicates that the risks are even higher for rural-urban migrants. Loss of social networks and support in an unfamiliar environment contributes to their low levels of physical activity, worsened by increased intake of junk food.\nLearning the right policy lessons from these findings is critical because going ahead, India shall see more villages urbanise and more villagers migrate to cities. The learnings fall broadly into two categories. We must have planned urbanisation rather than the slummification of rural India. And we must do a lot more consciousness-raising about healthy lifestyles. Better schooling is not more critical to our children\u2019s future than more physical activity and more fruits and vegetables.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Culture, which is a complex, nuanced and multi-layered concept, is intrinsically related to one's religion, ethnicity, land, and language. But, much as we desire it, in a diverse society like ours, cultural homogeneity is not possible as not everyone has the same set of beliefs or follows the same customs. Ours is \"a culture of many cultures.\" Over the centuries, it has been sliced up in so many ways that what's popular with one segment of the population may be quite unpopular with another segment. But certain ideas and occasions have the ability to transcend these differences, like Pahela Baishakh. It gives us a sense of unity amid our differences. At a time when divisions along religious, ethnic, political, and linguistic lines are ripping apart the very fabric of our society, it gives us hope about our future.\nThe history of Pahela Baishakh is tied with the history of the formulation of the Bangla calendar, the origin of which is unclear. Some historians traced it to the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar, who wanted to create a \"harvest calendar\" for local residents in line with his taxation policy; others traced it to a much earlier time. Regardless of who adopted the calendar, the start of the traditional new year has been historically observed as an auspicious day for both farmers celebrating new harvest and traders looking for a fresh start in their businesses. But it was a simple affair without the flashy trappings of modern-day celebrations that we see in cities and urban centres.\nIn 1967, Chhayanaut initiated the urban tradition of paying musical homage to the Bangla New Year. As the occasion grew in popularity, celebrations began to take new forms, and new elements were introduced. Today, Pahela Baishakh is celebrated in numerous ways. You see village-style fairs, dance and musical events, readings, open-air concerts, kite festivals, special television programmes, DJ parties, corporate-sponsored gigs, and so on. After the Unesco recognition of Mangal Shobhajatra, a sense of pride was added to the celebrations.\nPahela Baishakh has clearly come a long way since its humble, rural beginnings, and has spawned a regionwide multi-billion-taka bonanza. This, in turn, has also ignited some unpleasant questions about whether the way it is being celebrated is indeed the \"Bangalee way.\"\n\nThe search for the Bangalee way is, therefore, a misguided one. We need to seek unity through diversity. That being said, modern-day practices are a far cry from how Pahela Baishakh used to be celebrated \u2013 through simple feasts, opening of haal khata (new ledger), village fairs, etc. And the fact that it has been turned into an urban affair by people far removed from the reality of peasant folks is an irony of the highest order.\nTo put it differently, if Pahela Baishakh is part of Bangalee culture, does the way we celebrate it truly reflect that culture? You can hear murmurs of disapproval in some quarters that say that Islam, the religion of the majority, doesn't support a celebration that they think is inspired by Hindu myths and traditions \u2013 or doubt if latter-day inclusions like\u00a0panta-ilish\u00a0feasts and Mangal Shobhajatra really represent our centuries-old culture and heritage.\nThese questions are usually ignored by the cultural elite, and binned as products of a \"fundamentalist\" mindset. Doing so, however, only risks widening the existing schisms within our already deeply polarised society. I think critical thoughts, however biased or intellectually unsound, should be welcomed for the simple reason that they exist as a \"reaction,\" which should give us an opportunity to evaluate our own action. Also, such thoughts stem from long-held concerns and deserve appropriate response, the absence of which may very well mean the absence of a solid basis for said action.\nIs there really a Bangalee way to celebrate Pahela Baishakh? Frankly, there isn't. We're too different to be alike. The \"Bangalee way\" in the sense of a single, linear way is a myth at best, and nationalist propaganda at worst. It is difficult to define because there is no single definition. The vast majority of our population belongs to the Bangalee ethno-linguistic group, but it is hardly ethnically homogeneous because of the different subgroups and deep divisions that exist within that group. And even then, religion plays a big part in how a certain cultural practice will be viewed, meaning that even if it is accepted, its level of acceptance will vary depending on one's interpretation of it.\nThat brings up the question of the identity of the Bangalee Muslim. As Prof Anisuzzaman once said, \"When we identify a group of people as Bangalee Muslim, we highlight only one aspect of their self-identity. But if we observe closely, we'll see that they contain multitudes.\" He drew on historical documents and literary sources to present a compelling picture of the diversity of Bangalee Muslims of different ages in terms of their preference for language, attire, occupation, customs, and religious and political beliefs, which made them different not only from their Hindu counterparts, but also from each other. Identifying the Bangalee Hindu presents a similar challenge. So, when we single out a certain way and try to pass it off as the Bangalee way, to be followed by everyone, it serves as a denial of people's diversity and, in so doing, attains an autocratic quality.\nCulture is a fluid concept. The freedom to navigate the complex situation that arises from one's linguistic, national and religious identities/differences lies at the heart of any pluralistic society, although cultural hegemons trying to impose their vision of a unidimensional identity will make you think otherwise. They will cry hoarse about the illusive \"Bangaliyana,\" dig out age-old customs, and disparage anyone who doesn't gravitate to them. But they conveniently forget that such rigidity is an affront to those non-Bangalee ethnic groups that also respect the traditional calendar and celebrate harvesting of new paddy in their own ways.\nThe search for the Bangalee way is, therefore, a misguided one. We need to seek unity through diversity. That being said, modern-day practices are a far cry from how Pahela Baishakh used to be celebrated \u2013 through simple feasts, opening of\u00a0haal khata\u00a0(new ledger), village fairs, etc. And the fact that it has been turned into an urban affair by people far removed from the reality of peasant folks is an irony of the highest order.\nThe point I am trying to make is, Pahela Baishakh, while an integral part of the local culture and tradition, shouldn't be a cause for rifts simply because of some people's lofty idea of how to celebrate it. This, in part, also answers the questions about Pahela Baishakh from an Islamic perspective. Some Islamic scholars do no support celebrating it because of\u00a0Mangal Pradip,\u00a0panta-ilish\u00a0feasts, Mangal Shobhajatra, and other apparent Hindu influences. They mistakenly equate the spirit of Pahela Baishakh with its modern-day trappings. But Pahela Baishakh is more than that. Pahela Baishakh is an idea \u2013 it will not change, although how we celebrate it will. Pahela Baishakh is a celebration of life, a renewed awareness of what we are, what we used to be, and what we can achieve if we start together. Unlike Eids or Pujas, which come with a religious tag, Pahela Baishakh is a celebration for all. Anyone can celebrate it in their own unique way. Even a simple, unceremonious prayer for the well-being of the country would mean as much as organising big public galas.\nWhat I find interesting is the story behind the first Mangal Shobhajatra organised in Dhaka in 1989. It was meant to be a creative expression of protest by the writers-artists who organised it, as part of their movement against the autocratic regime that used religion to stay in power. So the organisers wanted to do something that would highlight Bangalee culture, which is for the people of all religions. Hence, the idea of using symbols of different traditions. It was a deliberate attempt to underscore the importance of unity through diversity. That first walk was called \"Ananda Shobhajatra.\" I wonder if those who object to the naming of \"Mangal\" Shobhajatra today would have objected to \"Ananda\" Shobhajatra too.\nThis is an abridged version of an article first published in The Daily Star in 2018.\n\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is assistant editor at The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "Being surrounded by sycophants is an occupational hazard for anyone who has some form of power. Celebrities, CEOs, any kind of leader \u2013 they are all vulnerable to the malaise of becoming blinded in the smog created by these yes men and yes women. These are not the people who genuinely care about the leader or act in the leader's best interest. No, these are the individuals who will never fail to flatter the leader at the drop of a hat and will always agree with whatever the leader says \u2013 just so they stay in favour and accrue some benefit.\u00a0\nThe sycophant will never offer constructive criticism, and in more extreme cases will offer advice that will most likely cause harm to the leader by making them less acceptable to those they are supposed to be leading. Or the sycophant will reinforce the leader's prejudice or wrong assessment of a situation, which may have undesirable consequences \u2013 such as firing a competent, talented person just because the sycophant conveniently slipped in a piece of negative information about the person.\u00a0\nUnfortunately for leaders, it is very difficult to differentiate between those who are genuine well-wishers and those who are insincere bootlickers \u2013 because both may sound almost the same. Only extremely intuitive leaders, who are not drowned in their own glory, will be able to decipher the real McCoy.\nSome of these flatterers are pure opportunists. They will gravitate towards anyone they think has some sort of superior status in society \u2013 either through wealth or position or just because of public perception. The idea is to be seen with the powerful person; having a repertoire of selfies with famous or influential people is a must-do. Because when you are with fame, some of it rubs off on you. The opportunistic sycophant is very efficient in orchestrating chance meetings with the target \u2013 at events or places they may visit, making sure a photographer is handy. On special occasions, they will post their pictures with the celebrity on social media. This has a multiplier effect with people believing that the person who is with the celebrity must also be someone worth considering.\u00a0\nSoon, the sycophant will acquire their own coterie of flatterers, thus perpetuating the disease that erodes a person's integrity, honesty, and real worth.\u00a0\nThose who are not recipients of the sycophant's attention are the lucky ones, because they are the onlookers who can see right through the fake smiles that fade far too quickly when the target is not looking. After a whole session of flattering the leader, the sycophant may have a pale, fatigued look and often displays irritation, disinterest, and superciliousness when around those they perceive as inconsequential. Sadly, these sycophants have emotional intelligence close to zero, and hence cannot really form honest relationships as they have forgotten how to be empathetic and sincere.\n\nThose who are not recipients of the sycophant's attention are the lucky ones, because they are the onlookers who can see right through the fake smiles that fade far too quickly when the target is not looking.\nBut let's leave aside the sycophant's inner demons and focus on their targets \u2013 the leaders.\u00a0\nWhat happens to them? Usually, a core circle of sycophants will surround the leader like overzealous bodyguards and make sure that the leader does not get any opportunity to think for themselves, or try to get an objective view from others. The leader will be first bombarded with adulation about all their achievements, the power they have over people, and how brilliant their every move is. They will glibly make up stories of how other powerful people have been impressed by the leader. The leader, giddy with self-love, will be left delusional and blinded. It will leach out the leader's ability to assess things in a rational, logical way.\u00a0\nOnce the blindness sets in, the leader can be manipulated to do almost anything. The brilliance of sycophants lies in the way they will make the leader believe that the conclusion that has been arrived at, the decision that has been made, is completely of their own accord. The fact that the leader has been influenced with slow poisoning, that the outcome serves the sycophant's agenda, will never be detected. It will leave the leader more and more clueless about what is really going on while pushing them further away from the people they are leading. It will give them a false sense of invincibility and grandeur. The leader will become more and more vulnerable to the lies of the sycophants. Eventually, they will stand helpless in front of a wall that has cracked in too many places.\u00a0\nSo, can leaders survive this inevitable onslaught? For some, it may be too late. But for those who still feel that twinge of conscience every now and then, there may be an antidote.\u00a0\nOne of the traits most advocated by leadership gurus is the ability to listen to people. This means listening to everyone's view \u2013 especially from those who seldom get a chance to voice their opinions. In a CEO's case, it would be the junior-most staff; in a nation's leader's case, it would be the people, the silent majority.\nFor the CEO of a company, it is perhaps easier to talk to their own staff. For a political leader, it is harder because of the layers of leadership under them that may block them from the realities on the ground as it may disrupt the status quo, expose the sycophants' inefficiencies and occasional deception.\u00a0\nThe leader must therefore seek out the voices of the unheard, the voices of reason and expertise, thus helping to identify corrosive trends like the corruption of public officials, deficiencies in administration, and excesses of the sycophants. If the leader is smart, they will use this information to mend the cracks and come out stronger than ever.\nListening, of course, requires restraint, calmness, and humility \u2013 the last trait fast becoming extinct in today's world of obsessive self-promotion. Humility will give the leader 20-20 vision and give them the patience to hear the point of view of others. Hubris, on the other hand, will cause blindness, forcing the leader to succumb to the trap laid out by the sycophants.\u00a0\nAasha Mehreen Amin\u00a0is joint editor at The Daily Star.\n",

Besides maintaining the financial stability of the country, forex reserves also ensure that the country has enough moolah to import food in case of a sudden crisis \u2013 including climate-related ones, to which Bangladesh is quite prone \u2013 and buy emergency medical supplies or arrange for fuel, as seen in recent times. But what does a country do to fight an unpredictable climate crisis? What other ways does it have to become a more adaptive nation?\nAs the current climate situation threatens the existing financial protocols and the ways in which the economy works, the world is finding new ways to address these issues. To some environmental experts, the answer is simple. The Covid pandemic has delivered a harsh lesson across the world. Nature wants to be treated right and climate change impacts will become even harsher if positive changes are not incorporated in the current practices. This includes replenishing more than just monetary reserves; it means replenishing natural water and forest reserves, restoring forests and wetlands, and reversing air pollution. Savings need not, or rather, should not, solely be financial.\nThink of it as something akin to the happiness indicator. A number of unconventional criteria help measure how happy a nation and its citizens are. For a disaster-prone country like Bangladesh, a security indicator might work, where the ecological reserves (such as land, forests, water bodies, and biodiversity) and how well they have been preserved can be used to measure how independent and secure a nation is in the advent of a climate-change-induced natural calamity.\nHistorically, when people did not have the financial ability to buy food, they would often dig up potatoes from their yard or fish from their ponds to manage the day's nutrition. They also had the option to sell these wares, or even part of their livestock, simply to survive the difficult days. If this culture can be revived, fewer people would face economic hardships and would have another, easier means of survival. This solution does not need to remain restricted to individual homes; entire communities could work together to ensure their own nutrition through similar processes.\nUrban citizens, too, can do much to preserve natural resources. Those who can avail the space on their rooftops to build gardens should take up the responsibility of doing so. This not only ensures their food security to an extent, but also ensures organic nutrition. Similarly, urban homes have solar panels that have been made mandatory by the government. Unfortunately, the use of such solar panels is yet to become widespread. Using these panels can help people become energy-efficient, promote renewable energy, and help the environment in the process.\n\nAs the current climate situation threatens the existing financial protocols and the ways in which the economy works, the world is finding new ways to address these issues. To some environmental experts, the answer is simple.\nMillions of litres of water are wasted every day in Bangladesh. If every farmer, be it rural or urban, becomes a little more conscious about wasting water, it is possible to revert the wastage and save water for irrigation purposes.\nRecycling glass, plastic, paper, and fabric can save additional dollars, and promoting the production and use of such products can help the country in the long run in the face of fewer clogged landfills and harmful gas releases. Using products that can be reused over time, such as steel straws instead of plastic straws, jute or cloth bags instead of polythene bags, can make a big difference.\nIn countries like Bangladesh, where adaptation requirements are foremost on people's minds, much has been done to help the common people until meaningful mitigation takes place. Some of these adaptation measures have, over time, turned into maladaptation practices, such as shrimp cultivation. Natural salinity of agricultural land saw shrimp cultivation as a way to adapt, whereby farmers could use\u00a0gher\u00a0(fish farm) culture to grow certain crops as well as cultivate shrimp in saline soils. However, it soon became evident that the shrimp export sector was a good way to make money in export markets, and thus, malpractices such as manually increasing salinisation in certain soils increased. While this made land conducive to cultivating shrimp, it also made it less fertile to grow any other crops on.\nAs millions of dollars have already been invested into such practices, new programmes must be incorporated for green transition. And funds must be allocated in national budgets to facilitate this transition as well as to pay for the investors' interests and encourage them for more green investments.\n\u00a0\nKazi Amdadul Hoque\u00a0is a climate, development, and humanitarian activist.

        "full_article": "We are alarmed to learn that the number of caesarean deliveries in the country has gone up amid lack of proper guidelines and interventions from the health authorities. According to a report of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) published recently, the number of C-sections performed in Bangladesh increased to at least 45 percent of all deliveries during 2020-2021, while it was 34 percent during 2017-2018 and 18 percent in 2011. The upward trend has been witnessed in both private and government healthcare facilities, even though this practice puts the health of both mothers and newborn children at unnecessary health risks. The question is, has the government done anything to check the trend?\nDetails of the BDHS survey are quite eye-opening. It has found that, of all the C-sections performed, 84 percent are done in private healthcare facilities, 14 percent are done in government hospitals, and two percent in different NGO-run facilities. Understandably, as the usually understaffed, under-bedded but overloaded government hospitals fail to properly cater to the needs of expectant mothers, private facilities have come up with healthcare packages for them in exchange for huge profits. In the majority of cases, doctors there suggest expectant mothers to have a Caesarean delivery instead of going for a natural birth. This happens even if they do not have any prior health complications for them to require such a procedure. It is this profit-driven mindset of private healthcare facilities that is leading to an uncontrollable increase in C-sections across the country. This trend must stop.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that in the last few decades, the government, with assistance from private organisations, took some much-needed initiatives including strengthening maternal and neonatal care at the upazila healthcare facilities, improving the midwifery services to ensure safe motherhood and decrease newborn deaths, and ensuring the availability of life-saving drugs, all of which have brought some positive results. We have seen a significant decrease in the maternal and child mortality rates. The BDHS survey has also revealed that the number of facility deliveries increased from 51 percent in 2017 to 65 percent in 2022, which is definitely a very positive achievement. But little has been done to discourage doctors from performing unnecessary C-sections, which is worrying.\nWe urge the government to formulate the necessary policy and guidelines to stop unnecessary C-sections. In this regard, there should be a mechanism in place to oversee the activities of private hospitals in particular, and all health facilities in general. According to the World Health Organization, the \"ideal rate\" for C-sections has to be between 10 and 15 percent of all deliveries \u2013 because on average, 10 to 15 mothers in every 100 pregnancies may experience some problem during childbirth. Our healthcare professionals must follow the WHO guidelines. C-sections should only be performed in cases where surgery is a must to save the life of expectant mother and child.\n",

        "full_article": "We're deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, 81, who breathed his last at the Gonoshasthaya Nagar Hospital in Dhaka on Tuesday. Few stars in the socio-political firmament of Bangladesh has shone as bright and for as long as he did. As Victor Hugo once said, \"Short as life is, we make it still shorter by the careless waste of time.\" Life's potential, seen through this lens, is measured by not how long it is but how well and meaningfully it is lived, and Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury has surely lived his to the fullest. As a nation, we couldn't be prouder that he chose to do so in the service of our people, tirelessly working for them until his last days.\nAffectionately called \"people's doctor\" because of his lifelong work in public health, Dr Zafrullah's name will be forever etched in our history as the man who had founded Bangladesh Field Hospital to treat wounded freedom fighters during the War of Liberation. It was the seed of what would later be Gonoshasthaya Kendra post-independence. Designed to mainly serve the poor and disadvantaged, this centre would go on to have a revolutionary effect not just in the public health sector but also in the public perception of women, empowering them by breaking gender stereotypes. Today,\u00a0this multidimensional institution includes projects ranging from primary healthcare centres and hospitals, community schools, agricultural cooperatives\u00a0and women's vocational training centres, to economic enterprises to help finance its Trust activities. But its most obvious success is its primary healthcare programme (mainly in the villages) which benefits over a million people.\nAnother notable achievement of Dr Zafrullah was his leading role in formulating the National Drug Policy, 1982, which served as a cornerstone of today's robust pharmaceutical industry. His activism in the dark days of the pandemic in Bangladesh were also exemplary. His deep love for his country and the people also drove him to tirelessly campaign on various socio-political issues. Every time there was an injustice, he was among the first to speak up.\u00a0Overall, the scope of his works was as breathtaking as their effect. He was a nation-builder like no one else.\nThe awards he received in recognition of his service were also legion. Among them were the Independence Award (Swadhinata Padak), the highest state honour given by Bangladesh government; a \"Certificate of Commendation\" for his contributions during the War of Liberation; the Swedish Youth Peace Prize for founding Gonoshasthaya Kendra and providing primary healthcare to rural communities; Maulana Bhashani Award; Ramon Magsaysay Award; The Right to Livelihood Award, Sweden; One World Action Award, UK; Fr. Tong Memorial Award, India; Doctor of Humanitarian Sciences Award, Canada, etc.\nDespite all his achievements, however, Dr Zafrullah lived a very\u00a0ordinary life. He epitomised the philosophy of \"simple living, high thinking\" \u2013 and to his credit, he knew how to realise his thoughts and visions into a reality.\u00a0So as we try to process the loss of this illustrious son of our soil, we hope more than anything that his rich legacy of pro-people, pro-poor activism will live on.\n",

        "full_article": "Ever since the celebration of New Year's day by the Babylonians in ancient Mesopotamia around 2,000 years B.C., the occasion has still remained either Pagan or religious in character. Even the New Year on the Gregorian calendar smacks of overtones of religion, Christianity and Judaism to be precise, with some infusion of myth. If the widely celebrated New Year on January 1 could not come out of the shadow of Paganism and religions over 4,000 years, Pahela Baishakh emerged as a secular New Year festival even before the birth of Bangladesh. The power of culture with its roots spread into the land's soil proved its sustainability even in time of a misstep of making Urdu the official language of Pakistan by its military rulers. In fact, the synthesis brought about between Islamic lunar calendar and Hindu solar calendar by Fathullah Siraji, scholar and royal astronomer, at the instruction of Mughal emperor Akbar to develop Bangabda had in itself the seed of secularism. On this count, Bangla sal (year) has no peer. It is unique in the way the advent of the first day of a year is now welcomed and celebrated on a note of extraordinary poise, solemnity, inspiration, human values and yearning for a better tomorrow---all of which seeks to create an unbiased soul of the Bangalee people. The Chhayanaut has ever played a pioneering role to set the tone of a highly cultured and aesthetically crafted observance through music, songs and recital of poems. But it is yet to be spread all across the country. This is because the rural-urban divide has been widening with wealth getting concentrated in the hands of a few people living in cities and towns. To become culturally developed there is obviously a need for economic backing, some leisure and dedicated cultural activists.At a time when world has become a global village with infiltration of alien cultures not always proper in oriental context thanks to advancement and proliferation of smart gadgets, the country's cultural convergence demands a reevaluation. The sub-continent has served as a cultural confluence since time immemorial. In his seminal poem, Bharat Teertha, Rabindranath has paid tribute to the host of people from different lands, continents and cultures, who came to make this Gangetic plain their home and have a share in turning its society and culture vibrant.It is against such a backdrop that the celebration of the New Year accentuates the significance of human life so ephemeral and yet so precious in relation to the eternity. On the occasion of Pahela Baishakh, the Bangalees renew their pledge to live a fuller and better life. If the majority members of a community or society can improve the quality of life, civilisation is taken to the next higher plane. Then the celebration becomes particularly meaningful. The people of Bangladesh have achieved their political liberty but now the quest is to earn their social and cultural freedom. Unfortunately, the space of healthy cultural pursuits is increasingly getting shrunk. The momentum created by the celebration of the Pahela Baishakh also got stuck due to two years' corona pandemic. But the enemies within who once bombed the function at Ramna are yet beat a hasty retreat. So, in terms of economic justice, cultural orientation and education, the challenge is daunting and it has to be faced squarely in order to overcome all adversities. Shuvo naboborsho to all.",

        "full_article": "Celebration of the New Year in one form or other ---in some cases highly colourful and aesthetically refreshing, enriching and enlivening ---is a great occasion for nations and ethnic peoples all across the world. Although the Gregorian calendar has now received almost universal acceptance for official purposes, traditional almanacs developed in ancient times are still followed in all the defining events, rituals and rites of life because of their usefulness in terms of harvesting, sowing seeds and starting various other important family programmes or projects. Thus Bangla sal (year) survives with all its appeal among the majority of rural population of Bangladesh. Before the Tarik-e-Elahi, on which the Bangla year is founded, the people used a solar calendar which was a replica of the one introduced by king Vikramaditya. In ancient India, a Vedic calendar was prevalent. Called Diwali or Deepavali, also known as the festival of light, it was celebrated after the harvest and before the start of cultivation of new crop. Essentially it symbolised the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, hope over despair and good over evil. Not surprisingly, Diwali is still celebrated in the Autumn, usually in the month of Kartik. On this occasion, Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago observe official holiday. What is remarkable is that a large number of people in the Indian states of Andhra, Maharashtra, Punjab, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat observe the New Year in different names but on the same date and period. Nepal with its calendar also called Vikram samvat, Indonesia, Cambodia and especially the Balinese Hindus celebrate the New Year under similar names like Baisakh, Vesak, Baisakhi on the same date. While the Hindu New Year or Vikram Samvat is celebrated on March 22 by the followers of Hinduism in several states of India and many other countries, Bangladesh has got the New Year's day on Pahela Baishakh with no religious strings attached to the occasion since the introduction of a new calendar, where the year came to be known as Bangabda, by Great Mughal Emperor Akbar. The emperor, who tried to introduce a secular religion called Din-i-Ilahi as well, assigned his royal astronomer Fathullah Siraji to come up with a calendar that were to combine the Islamic lunar calendar and the solar Hindu calendar that had been in use. Maybe, the intention behind this was to remove the discrepancy between the shifting lunar months and harvest period and at the same time remove the religious overtones from both calendars so that the Hindus and the Muslims could consider the calendar unreservedly their own. Also, revenue collection became easier as a result of this more or less fixed monthly and seasonal calendar synchronising with harvesting in this part of the world. The year is counted from Akbar's ascension to the throne in 1556. Thus Bangladesh has got a calendar almost flawless but it required minor adjustments in order to keep up with the Gregorian calendar. West Bengal is yet to adjust its calendar and therefore the Pahela Baishakh does not synchronise with the Gregorian calendar. As a result West Bengal has its Bangla New Year or Pahela Baishakh a day or two later, mostly. Similarly, the beginning or end of a month, according to the two calendars, also may either vary or fall on the same date. Bangladesh's adjustment has made the dates fixed to those of the Gregorian calendar. For example, Pahela Baishakh and April 14 now have a meeting point on the same day.Following the tradition and spirit of secularism, the Bangla New Year has been evolving into a national celebration of immense significance. Traditionally, it was the Chaitra Sangkranti, the last day of the month of Chaitra, which was observed as the day of Halkhata, settlement of all outstanding dues to wholesalers or shops that retailers or consumers owed to the former two categories of traders. There was no extra exuberance over the observance of the first day of the year apart from wearing of new clothes and arrangement of sumptuous dishes by those who could afford. Even those not quite well off, tried to have better meals on the day in the hope that similar meals would be available in the rest of the year. Puffed rice (muri, khai), beaten rice (chira), sweetmeat and other delicacies were generously offered to entertain guests and others who just happened to visit unannounced on the Sangkranti and first day of the New Year. In rural Bangla, large fairs called 'Baishakhi Mela' were held in many places on these two days. Such fairs continued with some gaps in other villages throughout the next month. Urban centres were yet to control the entire land's economy. In fact, these fairs gave village artisans the opportunity to present their crafts and skills and farmers in particular procured their tools they needed for agriculture from these fairs and their wives and daughter also bought household utensils along with a handful of articles of toiletries. It was simple and pure joy that governed the lives of village people. Today's luxury goods and flagrant consumerism were beyond their imagination. Amid this, however, the Chhayanaut appeared in the 60s of the last century to instil sense in the minds of the Bangalees who were taken for a ride, politically and culturally by the Pakistani rulers. The flows of cultural current the leading cultural organisation devoted purely to discovery of the national identity are growing in strength against a still perverse attempt to take the country back to bigotry and radicalism. Therefore to put the Bangalees' identity in right perspective there is a need for fostering the cultural soul of the nation. Even its influence on society and politics can bring about a sobering change now missing sorely.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "On the eve of the Bangla New Year, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the national statistical organization, on last Wednesday had come up with a piece of good news that the rate of poverty declined to 18.7 per cent in 2022 from 24.3 in 2016. The number of hardcore poor at the same time also declined at a faster rate to 5.6 per cent in 2022 from 12.9 per cent in 2022.However, the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) carried out by the BBS has confirmed a widely prevalent notion about inequality in income (expressed in the Gini coefficient). The income inequality widened further between 2016 and 2022, said the survey. The HIES-2022 has found a stark difference in the rate of decline in poverty in rural and urban areas. Though the rate is still high at 20.5 per cent, poverty in rural areas fell by 5.9 per cent while the same declined by 4.2 per cent between 2016 and 2022 in urban areas. But extreme poverty dropped by more than half in both urban and rural areas. During the period under survey, the per-capita daily calorie intake increased marginally though consumption of rice, egg and fruit declined. The results of the survey in terms of the decline of poverty both in rural and urban areas might come as a surprise to many. The period under survey has confronted two extreme developments--- the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The pandemic, which has eased to a great extent lately, has taken a huge toll on life and living around the world. Many had believed the world would not be the same again even after the pandemic was over. As the pandemic started retreating in the early part of 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine put the world in an unprecedented economic turmoil. The disruption caused to the supply of food items and oil because of US sanctions on Russia triggered price hikes across the world. Some countries were also thrown into financial instability. Bangladesh is also having problems with its external sector. Surveys done by local think tanks during the pandemic reported a reversal in the poverty situation, because of the loss of employment and sources of income, particularly in urban areas. However, the findings of the latest HIES of the BBS have proven the results of the private surveys wrong. The HIES-2022 has revealed almost an identical nature of monthly household income and expenditure. Though the average household income more than doubled between 2016 and 2022, the expenditure also saw an identical rise. Savings at the household level, thus, remained negligible. None should be surprised by the HIES finding on income inequality. It has gone up during the survey period. And, it would continue to be so in years to come. The system that regulates wealth distribution favours the accumulation of wealth in the hands of the richer section of the population. The safety nets financed by the government might have played a role in the decline in poverty rate, particularly among the hardcore poor. But those do not make a notable difference in living conditions, as the people who come out of the poverty line remain vulnerable to going down below again in the event of adverse conditions. So, there is no room for complacency. The government needs to invest more in employment generation both in urban and rural areas. That might also help achieve twin goals---a drop in spending on safety nets and income stability for poorer sections of the population. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
