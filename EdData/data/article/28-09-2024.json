It is a routine relief for anyone arrested and kept in custody to give the investigating agency enough time to gather evidence about an offence without the risk of interference by the suspect. In fraught times when agencies are seen as political weapons of the ruling dispensation, the release of a political functionary such as former Tamil Nadu Minister V. Senthilbalajion conditional bail becomes a cause for celebration among his party colleagues. The allegations against him are quite serious, and a spell of imprisonment once a serious investigation was taken up was not surprising. However, his prolonged incarceration on the charge of money laundering gave the criminal proceedings against him a political colour. After over 15 months, he has obtained bail from the Supreme Court of India. While courts have been reluctant to grant bail in money laundering cases, it was only a matter of time before the courts began reiterating that bail is the norm, and jail the exception. It is a welcome sign that the Court feels no more constrained by the bail-denying features of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and similar laws. Its concern has now rightly shifted to the possible violation of the remand prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights in the form of protracted delay in commencing and conducting the trial. Therefore, long imprisonment without hope of an early trial has become a justified ground for grant of bail.In Mr. Senthilbalaji\u2019s case, the PMLA charge arose from the allegation that when he was Transport Minister in the erstwhile AIADMK regime, he had collected bribes through his associates from job aspirants in his department, but ultimately those who had paid for jobs did not get any appointment. The police case regarding this has resulted in six charge sheets. The Court has noted that the final decision in his PMLA case can come only after the trial in respect of these cases. The former Minister, a defector from the AIADMK to the DMK, enjoys unwavering support from his present party, to the extent that Chief Minister and DMK President M.K. Stalin has extolled his \u201csacrifice\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d. However, this demonstration of support from one side and loyalty from the other should not mean that the gravity of the offence involved should be forgotten. After all, Mr. Stalin himself had, while he was in the Opposition and Mr. Senthilbalaji a Minister, highlighted the allegations and demanded action. Mr. Senthilbalaji\u2019s entry into the DMK may have changed the political equations between them. However, the cause of justice for the victims of the job scandal and a fair trial for the accused would be served well if Mr. Stalin avoids inducting Mr. Senthilbalaji again in his Cabinet until he is cleared of the charges.

        "full_article": "With the southwest monsoon drawing to a close, north India, particularly the States in the Indo-Gangetic plains, brace themselves for the annual spike in winter pollution. Earlier this week, a top functionary in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office convened a meeting with representatives from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, along with the heads of several ministries in Delhi. The brief was to take stock of the steps in place to prevent air quality from deteriorating catastrophically in Delhi. While pollution from vehicular emissions, road and construction dust, solid waste management, and diesel sets have over the years been counted as key sources of emissions, the burning of paddy stubble in Punjab and Haryana is known to be responsible for as much as 40% of the pollutant load during October and November. Punjab is expected to generate 19.52 million tonnes of paddy straw this year as compared to Haryana\u2019s 8 million tonnes. At the meeting, both States have committed to \u201celiminate\u201d paddy stubble burning this year. To be sure, last November, the Supreme Court of India had expressly ordered that such burning completely ceases. This year, it has demanded to know from the Centre the steps that have been taken to address the problem. Whether the States can comply remains to be seen. The harvest season of 2023 saw a 59% fall in the number of stubble-burning incidents in Punjab as compared to 2022; in Haryana it dipped by 40% but Uttar Pradesh saw a 30% rise. Despite the solutions to address the problem being known \u2014 create economic incentives as well as punitive measures to prevent straw from being burned \u2014 implementation remains a challenge. Punjab says that it hopes to manage 11.5 million tonnes of its paddy straw through in-situ (on the field) crop residue management and the rest via ex-situ methods. Similarly, Haryana will manage 3.3 million tonnes in-situ and use ex-situ methods for the remainder. In addition to this, 2 million tonnes of paddy straw would be \u2018co-fired\u2019 in 11 thermal power plants across the NCR region. Co-firing refers to turning the straw into pellets that can be used as a source of carbon. Experience over the years shows that several of these machines are not available to farmers when required. While using the straw in power plants has often been touted as a solution, there is no well-oiled system in place to transport straw from field to plant. The causes of the pollution crisis are multi-layered and will yield results only gradually. The States and the Centre must set aside their political differences and stay the course collectively.

Such withdrawal, and the wariness of states, is a situation SC had earlier called \u201cundesirable\u201d. Wrangles between a state and the Centre, or between two states, are inevitable. But the unending sparring over CBI investigations \u2013 the who, what and where \u2013 between opposition states and Centre is downright damaging. On the one hand, restrictions on CBI can be an impediment to investigations. On the other, so many states alleging bias in CBI investigations marks an intractable breakdown in ties.\nGOI argues it has no superintendence or control over CBI, that the agency is not GOI. But in July, SC disagreed when it accepted a suit filed by Bengal, against CBI, under Article 131 that gives SC jurisdiction over legal disputes between GOI and states. The suit seeks SC deem unconstitutional CBI probes started in the state after it rescinded general consent in 2018. In 2010, also in a Bengal-vs-GOI case, an SC constitutional bench had ruled SC/HCs could institute CBI probes without a state\u2019s consent on matters of national and international importance. It is how the Sandeshkhali and RG Kar investigations, instituted by SC, continue apace. Additionally, on Sep 24, SC set aside a Calcutta HC order for a CBI inquiry into alleged unlawful recruitments by Gorkhaland Territorial Administration. SC emphasised judicial restraint \u2013 there must be clear reasoning for a state police\u2019s inability to pursue any case before CBI is roped in.\nKarnataka saw an opposition govt assume office last year. In withdrawing general consent over a proposed CBI probe against CM Siddaramaiah, it joins Bengal, Kerala, TN, Punjab and Jharkhand. With new BJP govts in office, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram restored general consent last year. Centre-state ties are getting overwhelmed by distrust among political parties. Relations between regional satraps and party at the Centre are so strained as to impede governance \u2013 CBI is hamstrung, states are harried. \n\n",

But it wasn\u2019t threats from China and North Korea, or a slowing economy, that animated the inner-party election. The hot-button issue was Japan\u2019s marital law that compels married couples to adopt a common surname. In 95% of cases Japanese women are forced to adopt their husbands\u2019 surnames. Ishiba, fortunately, favours changing this archaic law.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompulsion to adopt the husband\u2019s surname after marriage remains a hallmark of patriarchy. It divests women of their individual identity and hitches it to their husbands\u2019. This is patriarchy\u2019s way of invisibilising women, relegating them to second-class citizenship.\u00a0\nIn India, women adopting the husband\u2019s surname after marriage remains common. But there\u2019s no law mandating this. That\u2019s a big point. People should be free to change or not change their surnames. In fact, SC has clarified that an individual should be in complete control of her name as per freedom of speech and expression under Constitution\u2019s Article 19.\u00a0\nHowever, married Indian women who retain their maiden names continue to face hurdles when accessing services such as obtaining a passport or opening bank accounts. Add to this day-to-day illegal moral policing when such women have to rent an apartment or get their children school admissions. Earlier this year a petition in Delhi HC challenged a govt notification that requires a woman wanting to revert to her maiden name to obtain an NOC from her husband. That\u2019s the kind of rule that makes a mockery out of women\u2019s equality.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "World leaders use charm in diplomacy to both seduce & deceive\nRealpolitik drives international diplomacy. National self-interest determines decisions. And yet, are human affairs ever quite so rational? Charm: How Magnetic Personalities Shape Global Politics by Julia Sonnevend\u00a0explores the theatre of personalities on the 21st century world stage, at a time when politics has never been so personalised. Party loyalty and organisational affiliation have declined, but we feel like we \u2018know\u2019 individual politicians. Charm is personal magnetism that rests on proximity to political \u2018tribes\u2019, as manifested through media platforms or direct addresses. Unlike charisma, traditionally marked by distance from citizens, contemporary leaders aim to be \u2018one\u2019 with their tribe.\u00a0\nOften, they aim for a mix, to be larger than life, but also intimate with the public.\nCharm can be seduction, or it can be deception. It can make you feel uniquely seen and appreciated. Mass media and social media help leaders convey this impression at scale, using common techniques: performing authenticity, occasional \u2018demasking\u2019, creating pseudo-events for media, showing diverse groups as a coherent community. Of course, you have to trust the performer and group they claim to represent; Trump may trigger identification for white conservatives and turn off progressives. The book examines leaders both liberal and illiberal: New Zealand\u2019s former PM Jacinda Ardern, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, Iran\u2019s Mohammad Javad Zarif, figures as far apart as Kim Jong-un and Angela Merkel.\nThe idea of a charm offensive emerged during the Cold War, and after decades, it\u2019s found new life. It rests on visual spectacle and performance, places the leader\u2019s image at the centre, and is intended for digital platforms. Ardern\u2019s live videos and UN appearance with her baby in her arms showed her as a working mother, even as PM. Knowing her gender and motherhood drew attention, she deployed these to preempt attacks and perform the authentic caregiving role that worked for her politics. The world celebrated her as an anti-Trump icon of leadership, even as she projected an everyday image to domestic audiences. A polar opposite is populist leader Orban, who has captured media and social media as a weapon. While global media characterises him as a strongman and fascist, he constructs his persona in more nuanced ways.\u00a0\nTradition, Christianity, whiteness and the nation are his themes. He refers to certain foods and pastries as quintessentially Hungarian. He stages himself as a family man, an animal lover. He shows his bonds with other right-wing leaders, posing with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni, wearing a red MAGA hat, showing ambition to star in a post-liberal world. Even Kim Jong-un recast North Korea\u2019s hermit-kingdom reputation, opening up to news photographs, making diplomatic overtures through his sister, forging a momentary partnership with Trump.\u00a0\nBut the book also presents a counter-example \u2013 German former chancellor Angela Merkel, who projected authenticity, but made no attempt to charm. Her social media kept her private life off-bounds, and showed formal pictures conveying distance. She came across as more a \u201cgrey bureaucrat than a seductive charmer\u201d, but it was still a performance of authenticity. The elusive quality of charm will affect hearts, minds and politics more than we admit, says the book. From Obama to Zelenskyy, this stardust visibly defines political power today. But abusers can be charming too, who can blind us to the qualities that should count in political life.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The postponement of one government recruitment exam after another since mid-July has emerged as a big concern, leaving thousands of jobseekers in a state of uncertainty and frustration. According to a report by this daily, this is exacerbating an already existing crisis of jobs as well as backlog of tests, and with no schedule set for these exams, both jobseekers and the authorities in charge seem headed towards an extended period of stagnation. For the students, this is particularly concerning as it directly affects their career prospects and livelihood.\nAmong the tests postponed so far are those for multiple posts at Petrobangla, Sadharan Bima Corporation, Medical Education and Family Welfare Division, Special Branch of police, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, and Palli Bidyut Samity under the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board. Meanwhile, the Public Service Commission (PSC) postponed the 46th BCS written tests and the 44th BCS viva voce in late August. It also postponed the first half-yearly departmental exams for BCS officers, among others. These deferrals have been generally attributed to the recent political upheaval and government change, floods, and even pressure from underprepared jobseekers. One wonders if the ongoing disruptions within the civil service may also have played a part in delaying recruitments.\nAmid the pressure for rescheduling the exams\u2014with a central coordinator of the anti-discrimination student movement recently urging the authorities to take immediate steps\u2014we hope that all issues causing delays will be resolved soon. The PSC has reportedly called a meeting on Monday to discuss this as well as plans for revitalising the commission and addressing concerns about question paper leaks. Under the current reality, however, we must say it is no longer enough to just hold exams. We must also overhaul the entire recruitment system for the civil service.\nThe current recruitment system, which primarily emphasises rote memorisation of facts, has long been criticised by experts for failing to attract the most capable and innovative minds. Tests should be redesigned in a way that assesses one's broader skillset, including analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, relevant experience and commitment to public service. Now that the quota discrimination has been removed, the government should target modernising the tests so that the civil service engages only the best and brightest.\nThere are also logistical and exam management issues within the PCS that need to be resolved. Considering the contrasting priorities of the present and our long-term future, we urge the higher authorities to disclose their plans in this regard.\n",

        "full_article": "The election of Anura Kumara Dissanayake as Sri Lanka's president on September 21 is an event of historic significance for the country. When he was sworn in an unusually simple ceremony at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on September 23, the symbolism of those who were present had one unmistakable message. The new president is an ordinary citizen in social terms with no pretensions to public display of power, taste, wealth or grandeur. In fact, he embodies the zeitgeist of the new social forces that have come forward together under his leadership to redefine, from below and the perspective of the ruled, the idea of political power. Presidential simplicity is also symbolic of what differentiates the new regime from the habits and cultures of the political elites who held power since Sri Lanka's independence from colonial rule in 1948.\u00a0\nThe victory of Dissanayake and National People's Power (NPP) alliance promises a fresh phase of political change in Sri Lanka. NPP's vision and policy statement are direct responses to the multiple crises and challenges Sri Lanka has been experiencing in the spheres of economy, society, governance and politics. The NPP also proposes new approaches to key areas of public policy. It places heavy emphasis on ending corruption, political cronyism, public sector waste, and haphazard policymaking. Correcting the neglect of the poor and the vulnerable social groups in policy interventions to manage the economic crisis has a special place in the NPP's agenda for inaugurating what it calls a \"fresh renaissance.\"\nNPP as a political movement has some unique characteristics. It is a relatively new political movement that has remained in the margins of electoral politics for several years. Its victory at the presidential election has immediately sent shockwaves among Sri Lanka's dominant political and social elites. Even the international press refers to Dissanayake as a Marxist, socialist, leftist and radical. These are labels that come from the early political history of Dissanayake and the political party he belonged to for about three decades since the 1990s.\nNPP is an offshoot of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, People's Liberation Front), formed in 1965 as an underground revolutionary movement, committed to building socialism. That was the time when peasant-armed struggles erupted in India and East Pakistan. Like its other South Asian counterparts, the JVP was influenced by Marxism and Maoism. The JVP launched two armed uprisings, one in 1971 and the second in 1987-89, to capture state power. Both failed and the JVP's human cost at defeat was very high on both occasions.\nIn the aftermath of the second defeat, a new generation of JVP leaders took initiatives to transform the JVP into a parliamentary party, abandoning the path of armed struggle. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was among this new generation of reformist young leaders who embraced parliamentary democracy. The NPP was formed in 2019 as a socially broad-based and ideologically non-dogmatic front of the JVP.\nWinning the presidential election is also the first major success for the NPP. At the 2019 presidential election, Dissanayake could obtain only a little over three percent of votes. NPP won only three seats in parliament at the 2020 parliamentary election.\nFrom being a small party in the opposition for years, how could the NPP succeed to win a sharply contested presidential election? The answer lies partly in two recent developments. The exacerbation of Sri Lanka's economic, social and political crisis since 2021 is the first. The second is the paradigm shift in politics facilitated by the citizens' protest movement in April-August 2022.\u00a0\nThere is also a third factor specific to the NPP. At a time when Sri Lanka's democracy and the entire system of governance were crumbling amid widespread political and bureaucratic corruption, the NPP and Dissanayake spearheaded a massive anti-corruption campaign for clean and principled politics.\nThe presidential election that saw shifting of political power from the elites to a candidate of the non-elite social forces also had a favourable political context. A protracted triple crisis in the economic, social and political spheres had defined the specificity of that backdrop.\u00a0\nThe economic crisis exploded in the form of a debt crisis in 2020-21, pushing Sri Lanka into economic bankruptcy. The government's crisis management strategy, worked out in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), stabilised the country's economy to some extent, but with a massive social cost. The economic recovery strategy and its austerity programme, worked out jointly by the IMF and the Sri Lankan government, placed most of its burden on the people through a twin policy of higher taxation and the drastic reduction of government spending, particular in the social sector.\nThe social crisis, which has been building since the Covid pandemic in 2020-2021, was a direct outcome of the economic crisis and crisis management policies of the government. Between 2020 and 2024, Sri Lanka was devastated by two waves of poverty. During the first one, the poor became poorer. During the second one, the middle classes became poor. This is a process that the Sri Lankan government and its IMF partners chose to ignore. They also probably thought that the spread of poverty was an unavoidable social cost of economic recovery.\u00a0\nParticularly during the past two years under former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, there was an official insensitivity to the widespread and increasing social suffering among the Sri Lankan citizens. This seems to have given rise to a groundswell of social discontent. People were particularly angry because they were direct victims of the debt crisis and also of the IMF-led solution to the crisis. The radical outcome of the presidential election is a direct political expression of this widespread social discontent and anger. Sri Lanka voters have not only refused to endorse the blatantly neoliberal economic and social policies of the former president, they have also given him an astonishingly low rating, with just 17 percent of total votes.\u00a0\nThe immediate political crisis that prepared the ground for the NPP to emerge as the leading oppositional political force has been in the making since 2022. Its most dramatic manifestation was the citizens' protest movement called the Aragalaya during April-August 2022. A key point that the Aragalaya highlighted is the total erosion of public trust in the dominant political class of the elites as well as the political parties they have led, and even the parliament they have dominated. Thus, the political crisis was also a crisis of governance, democracy and democratic institutions.\u00a0\nThe slogan of \"system change\" advanced by the protesters gave expression to a deeply held belief among the citizens that not piecemeal reforms but a systemic transformation could reverse the continuing democratic decay. The notion of \"system change\" embodied three expectations of radical reform. A change in the social/class character of who governs was the first. The second entailed the question of on whose behalf the rulers should rule\u2014on behalf of a small minority of economic and social elites or the vast majority of the people. The third expectation emphasised the ethical/normative framework of governing so that the old, corrupt political culture could not be built anew.\u00a0\nHowever, in the absence of a political party or an organisation to give institutionalised leadership, the protest movement could not ensure an immediate regime change. Its success could not go beyond forcing the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign from office. Even the NPP, which was participating in the Aragalaya, did not possess enough parliamentary strength to effect an immediate political change. With just three MPs, the NPP could not make claims to power within the framework of the constitution. The absence of a political agency to take the protest movement to a higher level enabled Ranil Wickremasinghe, the succeeding president, to launch a sort of counter-revolution and restore the old order.\nMeanwhile, it is the continuing spirit of the Aragalaya that preserved the social and political space for the NPP to take the struggle for political change through elections. The local government election was scheduled for March 2023. The NPP launched a well-organised election campaign attracting a massive wave of public support. Sensing an easy victory for the NPP, the then President Wickremesinghe did what an autocratic ruler would do with no ethical concerns. He forced the Election Commission to postpone the local government election indefinitely on the pretext that the national treasury faced with the economic crisis did not have money to fund an election.\u00a0\nAlthough subverted by the president, the local government election campaign was the moment for the NPP to re-emerge as a formidable electoral force. In retrospect, it was that moment that really prepared the NPP for the bigger fight 18 months later.\nAnura Kumara Dissanayake's victory is not just an election of a new president or bringing a new political party into power. It is not a mere change of government either. It is a regime change in a wider sense. It marks the gaining of political power by a political movement representing the subordinate social classes through democratic means. It also inaugurates a new phase of democratic politics in which the political power of the old class of elites has come under threat. In other words, Dissanayake's victory can be read as a major step forward in the democratic revolution that the Sri Lankan citizens launched in 2022 in the form of the Aragalaya protest movement.\u00a0\nThus, the NPP-led regime change also embodies the popular wish for a clean break from the past and a new beginning in Sri Lankan politics.\nMeanwhile, the defeated class of elites will certainly regroup and try to come back by undermining the new government with the political and other means available to them. Yet, unless thoroughly reformed, no group of Sri Lankan elites would regain the people's trust to win a free and fair election.\nThere are a few simple lessons the Sri Lankan elites should learn from the trouncing they got from the voters, the majority of whom are poor and middle-class citizens. They should recognise, even belatedly, the simple fact that the social bases of political power have effectively shifted away from them. They should also admit that both the economic crisis, which their wrong policies spawned, and their recent policies of crisis management have subjected a vast majority of the citizens to new waves of economic and social deprivation. Ultimately, they had their day of judgement on September 21.\u00a0\nPresident Dissanayake has now dissolved Sri Lanka's parliament. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 14. The new challenge for the new president is to secure a comfortable majority in the 225-member legislature.

        "full_article": "Looking back at the anti-discrimination movement, it's impossible not to acknowledge our young women's immense courage and tenacity. Their voices rang clear amidst the chaos, demanding not just reforms but justice and equity. These women\u2014our daughters, sisters, and friends\u2014stood at the forefront of a battle that sought to reshape the future of Bangladesh. In doing so, they reminded us of the power of youth and the vital role women play in driving change.\n\nThe heroines that emerged during this movement, like Nusrat Tabassum, Prapti Taposhi, and Dipty Chowdhury are individuals of integrity and conviction. Their commitment to challenging an unjust system, even in the face of arrest and intimidation, deserves our recognition. But beyond that, it calls for a deeper reflection on how we can continue to empower women in Bangladesh\u2014not just in times of crisis but in all walks of life.\n\nNusrat Tabassum, one of the key coordinators of the protests, led the charge from Dhaka University. Her determination to stay on the streets, even in the face of detention and hunger strikes, turned her into a symbol of resistance and justice. Nusrat's bravery inspired her fellow protesters and highlighted the lengths our young women are willing to go to demand what is right.\n\nPrapti Taposhi, a young activist, took to the international stage, discussing the student-led protests on Deutsche Welle (DW) News. Her eloquence and insight highlighted the broader implications of the political upheaval in Bangladesh, emphasising the necessity of government accountability. Prapti's voice became a beacon for those who sought to understand the movement's more profound significance beyond the immediate demands.\n\nDipty Chowdhury, a prominent media figure, maintained her composure and professionalism during a tense live talk show. Her ability to handle an outburst from a retired Justice with grace is a testament to her strength and poise\u2014qualities that resonate deeply with the spirit of the movement.\n\nThe role played by the female teachers from Dhaka University and Jahangirnagar University should be highlighted as well, given the courage and articulation they displayed during the movement.\n\nEven outside of Bangladesh, women demonstrated solidarity with the movement, showing that the fight for justice has no borders. These women, among many others, have shown us what authentic leadership looks like. But their journey doesn't end with the protest. As a society, we are responsible for ensuring that all women in Bangladesh are empowered to continue leading, innovating, and shaping the future.\n\nTo ensure that contributions from individuals like Nusrat, Prapti, and Dipty are not isolated, we must take concrete steps to empower the next generation of women. This begins with education, the cornerstone of any meaningful change. Access to quality education should be a right, not a privilege, for every girl in Bangladesh. But beyond mere access, we need to create an educational environment that encourages critical thinking, leadership, and a deep understanding of social justice.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to create platforms where women can express themselves freely and safely. The 2024 movement highlighted the risks that women face when they step into the public sphere. Legal protections must be strengthened to ensure that women who speak out are not silenced by fear of retribution. Support networks, both formal and informal, should be established to provide women with the resources they need to navigate the challenges of activism and leadership.\n\nWe must also address the systemic barriers preventing women from rising to leadership positions. This means not just creating opportunities but actively working to remove the obstacles that traditionally held women back. In both the public and private sectors,\nIn both the public and private sectors, women should be encouraged to lead based on their merits and abilities, rather than being forced into adhering to outdated societal expectations.\n\nMentorship programmes can play a pivotal role in this effort. By connecting young women with experienced leaders, we can create a culture of support and guidance that empowers women to take on leadership roles confidently. These mentors can provide invaluable advice, share their experiences, and help young women navigate the complex world of leadership and activism.\n\nFinally, we must continue to tell the stories of these remarkable women. Their achievements and sacrifices should not be forgotten but should inspire future generations. By celebrating their stories in the media, literature, and our educational institutions, we can ensure that their legacy lives on and continues to inspire others.\n\nThe journey toward true equality is far from over, but we are on the right path, with women like Prapti, Dipty, and Nusrat leading the way. Now, it is up to all of us to support them\u2014not just in their moments of triumph but in their everyday efforts to make Bangladesh a more just and equitable society.\nMamun Rashid is the founding managing partner of PwC Bangladesh and chairman at the Financial Excellence Ltd.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\u00a0\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Of the myriad issues clamouring for urgent attention that the interim government has inherited from its predecessor, the humongous amount of public debt is one. Some of the big external debts against mega projects have been reaching maturity. The US$12.65 billion Rooppur nuclear power plant, 90 per cent finance of which is being provided by Russian government as loan, is one example where the grace period for the loan is about to be over. Since these are bilateral loans, the terms are usually harsher than those from multilateral donors like World Bank, ADB and IMF. So, management of these debts is turning out to be a major challenge before the interim government, especially at a time when the foreign exchange reserve is dwindling. Unless appropriate short-, mid- and long-term strategies are adopted to address such debts, the country may fall into a debt trap when debt servicing begins to fail potentially crowding out other spending. These and other issues demanding urgent attention came up at a recent discussion event in the city where eminent economists from local policy think tanks expressed their views and concerns about the public debt management and other emergent issues following July revolution.Notably, as of June 30, 2024, the total public debt (both domestic and external) stood at US$156 billion of which domestic debt was US$88 billion, while the rest was external debt. The question of sustainably managing the debt arises because despite low foreign exchange reserve position, the cost of debt servicing has come to around US$4.0 billion, whereas, it was around US$2.0 to US$2.5 billion, when the forex reserve was US$48 billion. Under the circumstances, the interim government will be required to enhance its capacity for managing debts efficiently. This is to ensure that financing and meeting debt servicing obligations could be met at the lowest possible cost and the benefits of the public debt can be maximised. To this end, it would be well-advised to move gradually towards a unified debt management framework. Though, as a percentage of GDP, the overall debt showed a downward trend in the past FY2016-17 at 26.20 per cent, it has seen a rising trend in the subsequent years. However, as a portion of total debt, external debt is still lower than domestic debt. Even so, the external debts are becoming more problematic at a time when external financing is increasingly shifting from concessional to semi- to non-concessional regimes. In connection with the macroeconomic risks related to debt management comes the rising rate of inflation, which can increase expenditures on interest. This can render external debt servicing costlier in terms of local currency, unless the exchange rate is stable. Also concerning in this regard is the rising debt service to revenue ratio calling for better mobilisation of tax revenue. The interim government will be required to address the critical issues on course of an efficient and sustainable debt management regime including tackling other legacies of the past. These are massive corruption, flight of capital through money laundering, rising economic disparity, a lack of investment in the private sector. Overall, the challenge before the interim government is one of rebuilding the economy as though from scratch since the past 15 years, according to some economists, is virtually a 'lost decade'.",

        "full_article": "The fallout from economic downturn, coupled with runaway corruption was bound to affect the balance of payments of the country. Today, policymakers are indeed in a fix about how to manage the repayment of principal-plus-interest on loans taken from international sources for various projects. None is more glaring than the one for the country's first nuclear power project viz. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant (RNPP). The recent turmoil that transformed the political-cum-economic outlook, has put Dhaka on a collision course with Moscow, especially over what to do about the $11 billion plus Russian loan that has made RNPP possible. This remains a G2G (government-to-government) deal and also the largest foreign financed infrastructure project of the country under any administration. There is no contention about the fact that repayment will have to be made. It is interesting to note that very recently, a study has been published by an expatriate Bangladeshi expert where a comparative analysis has been made about the cost of RNPP and similar projects in India and Belarus. While the nuclear reactors are of the same generation and design, it is not as simple as to make a statement on graft alleged to have taken place. It has to be proven by taking into account all the variables that distinguish RNPP from the Indian and Belarus projects. That said, it is in Bangladesh's interest to complete this project and get it operational at the earliest. The country is in the midst of a major energy crunch. It is also a fact that the LNG (liquefied natural gas) experiment, the cross-border trade in electricity, the power produced and sold by independent power producers all have big questions hanging over them in relation to graft. Hence, it would be a pity to mothball RNPP on the suspicion that there was a multi-billion dollar payoff by one party to another. Russia has been pressing Bangladesh to make repayment of $650 million on the loan extended to Dhaka. Given today's economic situation, Dhaka has asked for an extension on repayment of capital, a request that has not been welcomed by Moscow. Why not? Why this direct rebuttal? It is not as though Bangladesh is bankrupt and is refusing to repay. It certainly is interesting that Russia is demanding that the payment on loan interest be made through Chinese banks (in Yuan), but the fact is that this is easier said than done. Russia is at liberty to ignore the Western-backed sanctions scheme against it, but can Bangladesh say the same?The change of the political guard in Dhaka has also shifted its focus on the definition of domestic development. The preceding five-year plan has been put on hold and the economy is no longer infrastructure development-driven. Rather, the focus is on soft loans and grants for human resources development and other interest areas. Regarding the Russian loan (including interest) payment, Bangladesh wants a renegotiation on the terms of payment and this is not unheard of globally. Restructuring of international loans happens all the time. Insistence on the \"terms of payment\" ignores the problems associated with the banning of Russia from the SWIFT banking system. Yes, there are alternative means of payment that includes the Chinese-led initiative CIPS, but that has its own problems. Bangladesh isn't a full member of the BRICS and so these problems are not going away anytime soon. There is hardly any point in getting emotional on such cold-hearted matters.Moscow has to understand the economic reality Bangladesh faces on multiple fronts. The RNPP remains the single most important power infrastructure of the country. Bangladesh requires reliable power that is affordable. Regardless of how Moscow sees the situation, there has to be a renegotiation on the terms of payment and possibly this will involve deferred payment unless an acceptable, alternative legal means to transfer the repayments can be found under international law. There is no other alternative for Bangladesh. It cannot evoke the ire of the West to please the East. On its part, Russia should think about preserving the cordial relations it has with Bangladesh. Everything must be brought to the negotiating table. All contentious issues have to be hammered out through discussion - not acrimony. It does not help either nation to be at loggerheads over RNPP. The RNPP is a long-term proposition to provide reliable and \"cheap\" power. These must be worked out by both parties and come to an agreement over the loan (and interest) repayments and also the price of power generated because of the simple fact that massive financial outlays have been made and years spent to build this project. This is simply too big to fail. Russia should get off its high horse and come to the discussion table because Bangladesh believes in \"friendship to all, malice to none\".\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh Betar, the national radio broadcast service, is thinking to resume Urdu broadcasting under its world service programme after five years of suspension. The move has simultaneously sparked a debate and criticism on social media, where some labelled it as a wrong move that went against the 'spirit' of the country's war of independence in 1971. Some also questioned the necessity of resuming the Urdu programme, which was shut down in 2019. Currently, the national radio's external services department broadcasts five hours of daily programmes in four foreign languages. These are English, Arabic, Hindi, and Nepali.The debate on the resumption of Urdu service is not surprising, as it reflects a misunderstanding about the language and its rich history. Originating around 800 years ago in the northern part of India under the Mughal rule, Urdu has flourished in phases and spread across different parts of the land, including Bengal. It was primarily known as Hindustani and later flourished as Hindawi or Hindavi. Under Persian influence from the beginning, the script is Perso-Arabic, though in some places, the Devnagri script has been introduced in later years.As British rule started in the middle of the 17th century, there was a calculated move to divide the language between the Hindus and the Muslims. The British rulers strongly backed the idea that Urdu is for the Muslims and Hindi for the Hindus. Keeping the basic grammar and structure almost unchanged, Sanskrit-influenced Hindi has become the language of Indian Hindus that uses Devnagri script. The Perso-Arabic script becomes the symbol of Indian Muslims, and the language is Urdu. After the emergence of India and Pakistan in 1947, Urdu became Pakistan's State language. In India, Hindi became the State language.The Pakistani rulers, led by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, tried to impose Urdu on the people of East Bengal, undermining their mother tongue, Bangla. The protest against the move led to the eventful day of February 21 in 1952, forcing Pakistani rulers to accept Bangla as one of the two state languages of the country. The day is now globally recognised as the International Mother Language Day. The Bangla language movement became one of the key sources of inspiration for emancipation that finally led to the war of liberation in 1971, and the outcome was the emergence of a sovereign Bangladesh.Now, the legitimate protest, struggle and war against the Pakistani oppressive regime do not mean that there should be any hatred against Urdu language or practising the language is synonymous with support for Pakistan. During the British rule, Dhaka was one of the hubs of Urdu across the sub-continent. Besides the chaste Urdu speaking people who also produced volumes of Urdu books, papers, journals and notes in Dhaka, a version of localised Urdu also developed in later decades known as Dhakkaia Urdu. Many historical documents in Urdu are still available in Dhaka. Some madrashas also teach in Urdu, as there is a lot of Islamic religious literature in Urdu. Interestingly, during the war of independence in 1971, Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra radio broadcasting centre also aired a programme in Urdu. Urdu is not just a language, it's a bridge that connects different cultures. It is widely used in some parts of India. The first Urdu newspaper in the sub-continent, 'Jam-i Jahan-Numa', was published in 1822 from Kolkata, and the editor was Harihar Dutta. Mirza Ghalib, the greatest poet of Urdu literature, lived in Delhi 200 years ago and is still revered for his works. As Urdu and Hindi are twin sisters in the language world, having command of one of those equip a person to communicate in both the languages.The reintroduction of the Urdu programme in Bangladesh Betar should not be seen as a wrong move or an attempt to 'Paksitanisation' of the country. Instead, it should be viewed as an opportunity to disseminate the country's culture and values to non-Bengali people. However, it's crucial to improving the overall quality of the radio's external service programme in order to attract the targeted audiences. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
