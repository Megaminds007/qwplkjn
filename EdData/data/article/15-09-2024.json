Provisional estimates for year-on-year price gains in August show the headline rate based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) quickened marginally to 3.65%, from July\u2019s 3.60%, as a sharp rebound in vegetable inflation led to a wider acceleration in overall food price gains. Price gains in vegetables \u2014 the third-largest constituent of the Consumer Food Price Index \u2014 surged by more than 380 basis points last month to 10.7%, spurring food price inflation to 5.66%. Among vegetables, year-on-year inflation in the most widely consumed potato and onion still remained in the high double digits for a sixth and 13th month at 64% and 54%, respectively, a moderation from July\u2019s levels notwithstanding. Other vegetables including carrot, palak and brinjal experienced a surge in price gains with all three posting double-digit inflation. Also, disinflation in the prices of pulses and cereals remained slow, with year-on-year price gains in the former still in the double digits for a 15th straight month at 13.6%, while the latter logged an inflation reading of 7.3%. Disconcertingly, food inflation in the rural areas rebounded to exceed 6%, and this at a time when stuttering private consumption is trying to regain momentum in the economically crucial agrarian hinterland. As an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee Shashanka Bhide noted in his comments at the RBI\u2019s policy review meeting last month, \u201chigh food inflation would therefore hit growth adversely as it affects consumption\u201d.A durable disinflation to the RBI\u2019s medium-term monetary policy goal of 4% headline retail inflation also faces other challenges, a key element being a resurgence in core inflation. The price gains measure, which strips out the more volatile food and fuel components, inched up to 3.38% after having snapped a 17-month decelerating streak in July. Based on responses from goods manufacturers polled for the monthly HSBC India Manufacturing PMI survey, HSBC observed this month that there was a \u201cmarked increase in prices charged for goods in August\u201d with the rate of output-charge inflation the second-fastest in close to 11 years. Add to this the spatial and temporal volatility of the monsoon, and the outlook for price stability becomes even more muddied. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said that the last mile of disinflation was proving to be \u201cchallenging\u201d. With policymakers still having to traverse a fair distance to ensure inflation does not undermine broader economic momentum, he reassuringly acknowledged that authorities \u201ccannot afford to look the other way\u201d.

        "full_article": "Earlier this week the Union Cabinet cleared the \u20b92,000 crore Mission Mausam, which primarily involves a major upgrade of instruments used by organisations such as the India Meteorological Department, the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). These are the organisations that form the backbone of India\u2019s weather and climate forecasting system on multiple time-scales. In the first tranche of the mission until 2026, the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), the nodal body executing the exercise, hopes to procure and install up to 60 weather radars, 15 wind profilers and 15 radiosondes. These are instruments that give regular updates on the changing parameters of wind speeds, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature at various elevations of the atmosphere. Had this been all that the Mission was about, it would not have been too different from the National Monsoon Mission, launched in 2012. The crux of that exercise was to evolve a new approach to forecasting the monsoon by developing weather models that relied on intensive computing. Thanks to this, India has an umbrella weather model that can be tweaked to generate forecasts on multiple timescales \u2014 from daily to seasonal monsoon predictions. Beyond the monsoon, such a model could be customised for heatwaves, cold waves and local forecasts.Making weather forecasts more accurate and improving precision is a never-ending iteration but Mission Mausam seeks to open more vistas. Instead of being a slave to weather, humankind tries to control it. One of the proposals associated with the new mission is to set up a \u2018cloud-simulation chamber\u2019 at the IITM, which will help model rain clouds. They would then test various \u201cweather interventions\u201d such as seeding clouds and tweaking them to control the rainfall from them. There are also plans to control lightning. As statistics reveal, lightning strikes are the number one cause of nature-propelled deaths, above floods and landslides, in India. While there are multiple socio-economic factors as to why this is so, meteorologists say they hope, one day, to be able to tweak the electrical characteristics of the cloud so that there are fewer lightning strikes that lethally traverse from sky to ground. While experiments have been done in other countries, there is much uncertainty on its feasibility. Investing in fundamental research in the atmospheric sciences is a welcome move. The complexities posed by climate change suggest that multiple fronts may have to be opened to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. While weather modification may not be a panacea, it will not hurt to wholesomely understand it.

Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential bid in US came like her lyrics: a bit of backstory, personal interiority, performative intelligence, a catchy refrain. An Insta post that was immediately declared a chartbuster with over 2.5mn likes in under half an hour. And while women tapped their feet and swayed to the post, not many men were caught dancing.\nThe uncle-ji lot had a collective meltdown. Swift\u2019s words, which put an arm around another woman and were, therefore, construed as too feminist, brought out the spluttering stammerer in them. Trump went from \u2018I have no idea\u2019 to \u2018she will pay a price\u2019. While some, like Elon Musk, himself a father of 12, offered to impregnate Swift, others, like commentator David Rubin, made vague threats of violence.\nAnd JD Vance, whose infamous words on \u2018a bunch of childless cat ladies\u2019 made up the emotional upholstery of the post, dismissed her as \u2018fundamentally disconnected\u2019. All these men on one side and just a Swift on the other! But who heads an army of Swifties, can carry a tune and looks better in a suit? Swift, of course.\nFrom George Clooney asking Biden to step aside to Swift\u2019s open support of Harris, US presidential polls have had their share of arty interference. Why shouldn\u2019t political battlefields weaponise star power? Swift\u2019s post went down like a sergeant\u2019s orders through her fan base, mainly young women voters and older kids pretending to be her in front of the mirror and singing into their hairbrush. The sound of them saluting smartly and clicking their heels in obedience carried its own unending digital echo.\nThis is stardom toiling at the other end, to carve out a future. When community work is backed with hope in heart and fingers crossed by the glam brigade\u2026it\u2019s IMAX 70mm societal give-back on a Dolby sound system.\nIn India, where divorces are yet to have their own shehnai, sangeet and mehndi, we prioritise kids over cats. Only babies can save a bad marriage: an old Indian saying. Investing in pets that won\u2019t look after us when we are old was never recommended by our ancestors. Kids can get us catheters, cats can\u2019t.\nMost VIPs here are too busy ingratiating themselves with political authorities so as to nab key posts. Our superstars, despite our readiness to deify them and build temples in their name, are careful what they vent, lest a future Parliament seat is denied to them.

But some questions remain\u00a0\nThat SC finally granted Kejriwal bail in the CBI case \u2013 he had got bail in the ED case earlier \u2013 settles some key questions via a high-profile legal tussle. But it raises a few other questions. The two-judge bench unanimously held that with completion of trial unlikely in the near future, Delhi CM\u2019s prolonged incarceration violates his right to liberty. SC\u2019s decision was foretold by its granting bail to several excise policy accused, including AAP\u2019s Manish Sisodia and BRS\u2019s K Kavitha, in recent months. SC has been reiterating the judicial principle that bail is the norm and jail the exception.Yesterday, Justice Bhuyan also stressed that keeping Kejriwal in jail was untenable since he had been granted bail in the more stringent PMLA case against him.\nBut bail conditions? | Just as significant is Justice Bhuyan\u2019s view that Delhi CM\u2019s arrest by CBI in June raised more questions than it answered. With the same conditions imposed on him in the ED case applying now, Kejriwal cannot visit his office or sign official files. On this too, Justice Bhuyan expressed reservations. Kejriwal is responsible for governance of the capital. Wouldn\u2019t it have been enough to set conditions that kept him away from anything related to excise policy? SC itself has stressed the importance of bail conditions being reasonable in several cases.\nWhat about Delhi? | Yet, CM\u2019s prolonged incarceration or his conditional bail can\u2019t be cited by AAP to explain away the misgovernance Delhi is subjected to. For a party that won 62 of 70 seats in last assembly elections and controls Delhi\u2019s municipal corporation, there can be no justification for civic woes remaining unaddressed in the capital. As for BJP, while it has a point that AAP seems flailing at governance, it won\u2019t admit that changes in admin rules have handicapped the elected govt. This fight reminds you of driving through waterlogged Delhi streets \u2013 there\u2019s no end in sight.\n\n",

        "full_article": "How a shy animal was bred to change human history\u00a0\nNo animal has had as profound an impact on human history as the horse, says Raiders, Rulers and Traders: The Horse and the Rise of Empires by David Chaffetz.\u00a0\nThrough early history, the horse was just a strange, shy beast that humans hunted for food. They are the most commonly depicted animals in cave art in Europe. Then they were domesticated for nutritious mare\u2019s milk in the Eurasian grasslands. But horses couldn\u2019t be corralled for long. Herders spread out across the Eurasian steppe. It was here that humans and horses first became entangled in an alliance that changed civilisations including China, India, Iran and eastern Europe.\u00a0\nThe power of horses was the petroleum of those times. Breeding changed the nature of the horse, into the swift, strong charger we know today. The Mongol empire from 1208 to 1368 was the apogee of horse-breeding rule, with its triumph over sedentary peoples. Even after the advent of gunpowder, the Mughal empire relied on horses. Manchu China used them to extend its borders. Russia needed the horsepower of Ukrainian Cossacks to conquer large parts of Eurasia. Genghis Khan used his cavalry as a symbol of world dominion.\nThe reason we don\u2019t see the centrality of horses in the story of the world is perhaps because European empires were based on sea trade.\nThe Silk Road should be called the Horse Road, the book argues. Horse breeding and trading were fundamental to it, while silk was currency. In China and India, horse fairs were grand hubs of commerce. Monarchs wandered the fairs at Haridwar and Pushkar; festivals grew around these events. The horse trade pushed Indians into wider trade networks.\nThe Rig Veda prizes the Ashwamedha yagna. The Mughals were obsessed with cavalry, horsemanship was an ethic, a symbol of self-control and political control. Rajputs also lived in the saddle, with both men and women riding between encampments.\u00a0\nArt and legend surround famous breeds: the Akhal-Teke, the Kathiawari, the Balkh stallion. The Chinese organised expeditions to find the fabled \u2018blood-sweating\u2019 horses of Ferghana. Whether Punjab\u2019s Lakhi or the British Hackney, each breed was suited to its own context. And each region had its own superstitions: the Mughals feared feathers (whorls) on the forehead, Marathas considered a feather under the belly unlucky.\nMilitary success depended entirely on horses, as rulers knew only too well. The Portuguese smuggled hundreds of Persian horses to the Deccan rulers to fight off the Mughals. The British tried to raise a stud farm in the Himalayan foothills. Meanwhile, the horse networks were used for espionage during the Great Game between the British Raj and the Russians.\nIt was only in the early 20th century when cars and planes showed up that the era of the horse decidedly ended. And today, Central Asia is one of the most isolated and impoverished regions in the world. As we struggle to imagine a world without petroleum, it\u2019s worth thinking of how energy dictates the map of power, and how dramatically the picture can change.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are deeply disturbed by the repeated incidents of harassment of women in public places over the past month by individuals who apparently consider themselves above the law. In the latest incident, a group of men led by Mohammad Farokul Islam, a local resident, attacked several women in Cox's Bazar on the night of September 11. Video footage showing the men beating the women with sticks and verbally abusing them has been circulating on social media, as the group themselves posted the videos, boasting about their actions. Last month, we encountered a similar video showing a man harassing and beating women in the capital's Shyamoli area with a stick. These incidents of vigilante justice are a troubling sign for the country and calls for urgent action by our law enforcement agencies.\nReportedly, the men verbally abused a woman at the beach and forced her to do sit-ups while holding her ears. They also questioned another woman about her presence late at night and forced her to leave the beach. In yet another incident, Farokul, the ringleader, was seen repeatedly hitting a woman with sticks while she lay on the floor begging them to stop. The question is, what were the tourist police doing when these criminal offences took place? Farokul even defended their actions on Facebook, labelling the women they attacked as \"prostitutes.\" Even if his claims were true, who gave them the right to beat and harass them? This trend of mob justice, moral policing, and targeted attacks on women must stop.\nSince a case has been filed against six people including Farokul, after his detention on September 13, we urge the police to immediately arrest all the others responsible for the attacks on women in Cox's Bazar. It also needs to be investigated whether anyone in the local administration is behind the group, as Farokul claimed that he was being backed by the administration.\nWe also call upon the home adviser and the police to send out a strong message that mob beatings and attacks on women won't be tolerated anymore. And that if anyone is involved in vigilante justice, they should be handed over to the police. It is only through upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for victims that we can eradicate these heinous practices from the country.\n",

        "full_article": "Conversations around sex work in Bangladesh are almost always clouded by taboos. Whether these stem from cultural sensitivities, simply discussing the existence of these women is often evaded or whispered in hushed tones. However, the opinions surrounding prostitution in Bangladesh do not render the trade non-existent.\nProstitution was formally legalised in Bangladesh in 2000 through a High Court ruling, sparked by the yearlong detention of 100 sex workers. However, \"legal\" entry into sex work requires signing an affidavit to signify that the person is at least 18 years old. Other provisions aimed at combating trafficking include sections 364A, 366A, and 373 of the Penal Code, which prescribe imprisonment of anyone who attempts to abduct and traffic a child under 10, induce a minor into forced sex work, or purchase the sexual services of a minor.\nIn theory, these provisions might seem like a solid foundation for addressing forced sex slavery. However, the reality is quite different.\nSex trafficking has been rampant in the country, and even extends beyond borders. Young girls and women are typically lured into trafficking rings with false promises of better work opportunities that would allow them to support themselves or their families. There have also been reports of women turning to sex work as a last-ditch effort to survive on their own or feed their children.\nGiven the lax nature of Bangladesh's legal enforcement measures, traffickers can easily coerce victims into signing forged documents stating that they are of legal age and willingly entering the trade. If that doesn't work, police personnel can be easily bribed to ignore the situation.\nOnce these women are sold into prostitution, they are further trapped by fabricated debts by brothel owners or pimps. The girls are often forced to stay at brothels or work as floating sex workers to repay debts that seem astronomical compared to their meagre incomes. Even if they manage to pay off their initial debt, the amount is often increased several times over, further ensnaring them in the business.\nOnce victims enter the trade, they are subject to abuse that has historically been associated with the profession. They are often forced to ingest steroids to gain weight and attract more clients despite the long-lasting detrimental impacts on their health. The situation worsens with exposure to various sexually transmitted infections. Physical violence is rampant as well, with 80 percent of street-based and transgender sex workers reporting in a survey that they have been physically assaulted by clients or others.\nThe violence extends beyond sex workers to those involved peripherally to the trade. On August 29, a former sex worker, currently working as a field officer for Ahsania Mission's project on HIV prevention, was brutally attacked by a man while she was distributing contraceptives to floating sex workers in Shyamoli. On the same day, another field worker was beaten in the Sangsad Bhaban area while on duty.\nIf these women seek justice for the abuse or attempt to escape their nightmarish situation, they are often met with indifference or outright dismissal.\nAs it stands, the very operational nature of sex work in Bangladesh traps these women into a never-ending cycle of abuse based on the exploitation of their circumstances. The narrative that gets lost is that these women are generally coerced into this life, seemingly trapped until their deaths. They often end up giving birth to children, either within the confines of the brothels in which they are bound, or within their line of working as a floating sex worker. The cycle of exploitation ultimately continues, with a general pattern of female children being groomed into the business and male children oftentimes becoming pimps themselves.\nEven if the women manage to escape sexual slavery, they are typically subjected to a lifetime of ostracism and discrimination. They are barred from most employment opportunities, and their reintegration into society is hindered by widespread conservative views that regard them as \"less than\" due to their past.\nGiven the current circumstances, combating sex trafficking in Bangladesh seems paradoxical. Women currently involved in sex work usually undergo years of harsh abuse, only to be met with more abuse and staggering levels of discrimination if they manage to escape.\nIn this time of reform, victims of sexual exploitation should not be overlooked simply because the nature of their work is considered \"taboo.\" Provisions should be introduced to free existing workers from abuse and discrimination and to make sure the alarming rate of sex trafficking is mitigated.\nReform needs to start with law enforcement. Victims of abuse and violence cannot be expected to turn to those who ignore their suffering or perpetuate it in exchange for bribes.\nAdditionally, reforms should extend beyond sex work itself. In most cases, the women are forced to give away a significant portion of their lives to the trade, which means their scope for obtaining education and employment is heavily obstructed. Victims cannot rely on their families or previous communities either, as they are frequently shunned.\nTherefore, more efforts should be focused on the women's rehabilitation and assimilation back into society. It is unlikely that sex workers can save up enough to sustain themselves outside of brothels, as pimps and madams typically take the majority of their earnings, leaving just enough for basic necessities. This is especially troubling if the women end up having children to look after. At minimum, provisions should include shelter and employment opportunities to ensure financial independence and a comfortable livelihood.\nIf workers have children, it must be ensured that the children do not face discrimination that prevents them from pursuing an education on par with other children their age. Although public opinion may not shift dramatically in a short time, more efforts are needed to establish schools that prevent such discrimination, especially in neighbourhoods with large populations of sex workers.\nOn a larger scale, a massive shift in our collective thinking is required. By viewing these young girls and women through a prejudiced lens, we are ultimately forcing them back into the very lives that we are judging them for being a part of. Reforms may not occur overnight\u2014but it is necessary that the process be started. Because ultimately, even if someone views sex work as a negative abstraction, the suffering of these women continues to be very real.\nFatema Jahan Ena is a member of the editorial team at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "In an era where financial scandals have become alarmingly commonplace, the importance of financial literacy for our youth cannot be overstated. A Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) report published on August 12 paints a grim picture of our banking sector, revealing that a staggering Tk 92,261 crore was embezzled in 24 major banking scams between 2008 and 2023\u2014more specifically, during the 15-year rule of the Awami League. This amount, equivalent to 12 percent of Bangladesh's national budget for FY2023-24 or two percent of the GDP for FY2022-23, highlights the dire state of our financial institutions. The banking sector, meant to be one of the pillars of our economy, has instead become a house of cards, teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nConsider the case of BASIC Bank, once a top-rated institution. After Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu was appointed board chairman in 2009, the bank's reputation plummeted. From a mere 4.81 percent of soured loans in December 2009, the bank's defaulted loans skyrocketed to 55 percent of total outstanding loans by March 2023. Despite the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filing 60 cases related to this scam, Bacchu himself was not named in any lawsuit, highlighting the culture of impunity that plagues our system.\n\nThe Hallmark group scandal involving Sonali Bank is another glaring example. Between 2010 and 2012, the bank's Ruposhi Bangla Hotel branch lent an astounding Tk 3,547 crore to Hallmark and five other firms based on fake documents. Both the board and management of Sonali Bank were implicated, yet the bank has recovered little of the swindled funds.\n\nThe saga of PK Halder further illustrates the depth of the problem. The former managing director of NRB Global Bank and Reliance Finance Limited fled Bangladesh in 2019 after allegedly syphoning off about Tk 10,200 crore from four non-banking financial institutions. Being a fugitive for two years, he was arrested in India in May 2022, only proving the challenges we face in bringing such criminals to justice.\n\nThese high-profile cases are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a systemic rot. The fact that many of the perpetrators remain unpunished only serves to embolden future wrongdoers.\n\nBeyond these high-profile cases, another threat has been looming on the horizon lately: digital financial crimes. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting our youth through social media platforms and mobile financial services (MFS). Their tactics range from convincing victims to reveal their NID to organising elaborate engagement programmes in luxurious hotels. These scams not only result in financial losses but also inflict severe psychological trauma on victims, with some cases even leading to suicide.\n\nIn this landscape of financial peril, financial literacy emerges as a crucial safeguard. It's not just about understanding banking terms or investment strategies; it's about developing critical thinking skills to detect scams, make informed financial decisions, and manage money responsibly.\n\n\nIn 2022, the Bangladesh Bank took a step in the right direction by issuing financial literacy guidelines to banks and financial institutions. However, if we look at the recent banking scams and the rise of loan defaulters, it is evident that the central bank's guidelines could do little to no help, and it has repeatedly failed to take any action against the financial crimes.\n\nTo add to that, statistics present a far more bitter truth. As of December 2023, the financial literacy rate in Bangladesh is only 28 percent, according to the Financial Inclusion Insights (2018) Programme by Intermedia Research. Therefore, unarguably, we need a more comprehensive, nationwide approach to financial education and must do our part as aware, responsible citizens.\n\nFirst and foremost, financial literacy, covering digital banking as well, should be integrated into our national curriculum. Our youth need to be equipped with the knowledge to navigate the complex world of finance from an early age. This education should not be limited to traditional classroom settings but should also leverage technology to reach a wider audience.\n\nWe also need a collaborative effort involving financial institutions, NGOs, universities, and community organisations to offer financial literacy programmes. These initiatives should be inclusive, ensuring that women, people with different educational needs, individuals with disabilities, and those in remote rural areas have access to this crucial knowledge.\n\nOur law enforcement agencies need specialised training to understand and combat digital financial crimes. The government should also establish research bodies dedicated to identifying new scam trends and developing innovative awareness strategies.\n\nThe banking scams and digital financial crimes plaguing our country are not just economic issues; they're a threat to our social fabric and our aspirations for a reformed Bangladesh. By prioritising financial literacy, we can arm our youth with the knowledge and skills they need to protect themselves and contribute to a more stable financial future for our nation. Financial literacy is not a luxury; it's a necessity. It's time we treated it as such.\nMahiya Tabassum is a journalist at The Daily Star.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "Soon after coming into office, the interim government had made its intention to look into the development works undertaken by the previous administration clear. That there would be stocktaking across the board was expected and the present government has already formed various committees to look into projects belonging to different ministries and departments. In line with that decision, a committee has been formed to examine the Information & Communication Technology (ICT) programmes the erstwhile government had taken up under the aegis of 'Digital Bangladesh'. Over the years, domestic media has exposed various irregularities in ICT division. The same can be said of the various think tanks (both domestic and international) and policy critiques who have highlighted wrongdoings by this division and its subsidiaries over the course of the past 15 years. Since billions of Taka have been spent from the national exchequer in the name of \"development\" in the digital sphere, the formation of the committee is a welcome piece of news. According to a report published in this paper last week, \"The committee has already held its first meeting, which was attended by representatives from various key organisations, including the Hi-Tech Park Authority, a2i Project, and the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC). However, representatives from the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Department (IMED) and the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), responsible for evaluating government procurement, were absent, as their respective officials are yet to be selected.\"The mandate of this committee is straightforward. It will investigate potential instances of corruption and then the authorities will decide where to go from there. The committee's formation is also a departure from the past. There is a technical expert who is a member and one who can assess precisely what progress (or lack thereof) has been made in the 22 ongoing ICT projects running under the FY 2024-25. There have been questions about the manner in which public procurement was done, whether rules were adhered to in concluding public-private partnerships (PPP), reservations expressed on the quality of audits on completed projects, etc.One major criticism had been the manner in which the construction of hi-tech parks around Bangladesh was done. Serious concerns had been expressed about the manner of site selection and about whether proper feasibility studies had been conducted prior to their construction. Ultimately, some were finished, but only a fraction of envisaged companies moved there. The idea of an \"ICT hub\" replete with infrastructure and digital services was questioned. Sadly, many things were totally left out of the equation. People expect a certain level of quality of living in terms of schooling for children, entertainment, ease of access (communication) and since these were not priority areas, these projects didn't achieve their primary goals - to become centers of attraction for foreign direct investment (FDI). Even many local companies didn't bother to relocate.Similarly, there was much consternation about the way consultants were hired to spearhead the ICT division. Again, the question of procedural irregularities had been raised which were ignored by then-government. Indeed, this division had been the den of irregularities but one that got very large allocations of public money in every single budget since 2010. Although the committee has not set any timeline, yet is expected to work swiftly and efficiently in the national interest. Hence, it is all the more crucial that the committee go through the books minutely to uncover all financial and procedural irregularities. Unnecessary projects need to be shelved, corruption-riddled projects need to be identified and those responsible be held accountable. Ultimately, the ICT division has to be turned into a body where accountability and transparency in budgeting and operation is ensured.",

        "full_article": "As cross-border free trade in goods and services is a vital tool of globalisation, the opponents of globalisation usually blame free trade for income inequality or socio-economic disparity in the world. To what extent globalisation, expansion of international trade to be more precise, is responsible for the persistent income disparity across the countries is, however, a matter of close scrutiny. Proponents of globalisation have been arguing for a long time that free trade has played little role in widening inequality. A number of studies and literatures have also been published so far to establish the argument with data and evidences. The World Trade Report 2024, published by the World Trade Organization (WTO) last week, is the latest addition in this connection, providing key insights into the relationship between global trade and income inequality. Before entering into the core findings of the WTO report, a quick understanding of globalisation and its relationship with trade will be helpful. Last month, the Peterson Institute for International Economics released an updated version of its feature 'What Is Globalisation? And How Has the Global Economy Shaped the United States?' discussing various aspects of globalisation and its role in the advancement of the US economy. Originally published in 2018, the feature mentioned: \"Globalisation describes the growing interdependence of the world's economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information.\"The article also pointed out that globalisation is often measured by the value of total trade relative to gross domestic product (GDP) or total economic output. \"By this measure, globalisation has gone through five distinct eras since 1870, rising during the latter half of the 20th century to its peak right before the global financial crisis of 2008-10, and slowing since then, amid major trade conflicts between the United States and China, and the COVID-19 pandemic,\" it added. Thus, the world is now in the era of 'globalisation' - a phenomenon which involves a slowing down of the pace of global integration. Before globalisation, the world witnessed almost three decades of liberalisation from 1980-to 2008. In 1981, the ratio of international trade in goods and services in terms of world GDP was 39 per cent, which reached a peak of 61 per cent in 2008. In 2023, the ratio stood at 59 per cent of the global GDP, according to the estimation provided by the Peterson Institute. In other words, there has been a gradual expansion of trade over the last four decades, despite a slowdown in the last one and a half decades. In this context, the latest trade report of the WTO showed that the expansion of trade has contributed to enhancing overall incomes and reducing poverty without necessarily increasing inequality. The report, however, mentioned that, on average, income inequality has slightly declined over the past 30 years, but it remains high in absolute terms, and some large economies face rising inequality. The answer to the role trade plays is: \"Trade may increase or decrease inequality within an economy, but its overall impact on inequality tends to be small. The slight fall in inequality over the past 30 years coincided with a substantial increase in trade.\" The WTO publication added that trade openness and inequality are weakly and negatively correlated. This means that trade does not necessarily increase disparities and does not contribute significantly to reducing inequality, though the role of trade in poverty reduction cannot be ruled out. The quantification of the role is also not an easy thing, but the potential benefits of global trade are significant. The latest version of the world trade report pointed out that though most people gain from trade, some suffer losses, especially if they are exposed to distortions and barriers that limit their adjustment or access to foreign markets. Again, many gains from trade depend on redistribution within economies, from relatively less to more productive firms, sectors or regions, and the distribution of the gains from trade among workers is unequal, according to the report. Earlier, the above-mentioned analytical piece of the Peterson Institute analysis showed that globalisation has 'helped narrow inequality between the poorest and richest people in the world', with the number of people living in extreme poverty reduced by half since 1990. Nevertheless, in many countries, including the US, inequality is on the rise. The reason is the exposure of the countries to globalisation that have 'alleviated inequality to different degrees through tax and welfare systems.' In other words, some countries do not mobilise government policies sufficiently to reduce inequality.Returning to the WTO Trade Report 2024, it makes a clear assertion that the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, a situation that is not solely due to trade policies, but often to domestic policies as well. The report's key conclusion is that while reducing trade would also reduce prospects of growth and inclusiveness, relying solely on trade and trade policy would not fully seize these opportunities. The report emphasizes the crucial role of domestic policies in shaping the impact of global trade, underlining the need for comprehensive solutions to make the gains from trade more inclusive. An opinion piece titled 'The complex interplay between inequality and attitudes about globalisation' is included in the report. Written by Stefanie Walter, a professor at the University of Zurich, the piece briefly explains why people think that free trade, as well as globalisation, is responsible for inequality. He concluded that instead of directly shaping the views and the debate about globalisation, the \"effects of inequality on people's perceptions of globalisation are conditioned by the economic, societal and political context in which they play out.\" The conclusion is significant in understanding the depth of trade's role in reducing or enhancing inequality.

        "full_article": "Commuting in Dhaka has always been a dreadful experience, but more recently it's become a living nightmare in terms of duration, expense, and energy loss. It's near to impossible to attend a scheduled meeting on time, unless you set out the day before. Commuters are often compelled to travel by filthy, run down, and overcrowded buses to and from their workplaces completely exhausted. It is a day-to-day horror experienced by every commuter in the city. In recent weeks, the city's traffic congestion has significantly worsened, primarily due to the unrestricted movement of both pedal and battery-run auto rickshaws, along with easy-bikes, on main roads. Previously, these vehicles were prohibited from operating on major roads, but traffic police, for reasons best known to them, are now allowing them without restrictions. Particularly alarming is the sight of these vehicles on flyovers, where their presence not only slows down traffic, but also poses serious safety hazards.Experts have long warned about the dangers of battery-run auto rickshaws. One may like to admire the inventiveness of people for improvising the manual rickshaws by adding a motor to them, but they are not built according to standard design. As a result, they lack balance and operationally hazard-prone. Their biggest risk factor is said to be the fact that they have brakes only on the front wheel. Moreover, some drivers think they're participating in a Formula One event or attempt to match the speed of CNGs or private cars, which make them more precarious and accident-prone than manual rickshaws.Despite being banned over a decade ago, due to safety and high-energy consumption concerns, the number of these vehicles has continued to increase unabated in the city. Operating without valid licenses, the battery-generated rickshaws flood the streets, back streets, alleyways, and lanes of Dhaka. Similar problems are experienced elsewhere in the country. Policymakers appear to be unsure about how to address the ever-growing presence of auto-rickshaws and the problems they're causing to the city's public transport system.Not only do the vehicles lack valid registration papers, but also there are no legal charging stations. This results in a proliferation of illegal charging outlets, widespread electricity theft, and rampant extortion and bribery to sustain the illicit operations. Small wonder that the number of battery-run rickshaws kept growing despite the ban due to bribery and extortion. Many also blamed the previous government for maintaining a formal ban on auto rickshaws, while allowing their numbers to multiply on the ground under the influence of extortionist rackets.It's estimated that Dhaka city alone is now home to approximately 1.3 million battery-run vehicles. Nationally, estimates suggest that there are over four million, employing around six million people. It is important that safety concerns regarding these battery-run rickshaws are addressed as well as steps taken to legalise them. For now, main roads and highways must be made off-limits to the motorised rickshaws, and the main roads to rickshaws. Later, a comprehensive solution regarding their safety features and registration process should be drawn up. A third-party agent could be employed to oversee these technical specifications, as the BRTA alone may not have the capacity to regulate such a vast number of vehicles. There is no scope for remaining indifferent to the questionable service they offer and the chaos they cause.While removing them from the roads and highways may not resolve Dhaka's horrendous traffic problems entirely, it will no doubt help at least to ease it.[email\u00a0protected]",

While the campus has many beautiful features and advantages, there are some drawbacks as well. One of these is the condition of the Chittagong University railway station. This station is not only used for student transportation but also serves as a central hub for socialising, much like Dhaka University's TSC. It has become known as CU's TSC, where tea circles, discussions on life and livelihood, writers' gatherings, and various cultural events take place from evening until dawn. It is the heart of student entertainment.However, it is unfortunate that the station's infrastructure remains outdated, with insufficient lampposts. Many of the existing lights are either dim or completely non-functional, damaged, or defective. Renovation and modernisation of the station are urgently needed.
