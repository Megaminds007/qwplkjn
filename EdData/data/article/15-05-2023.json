No doubt, some of the vote share accrued to it negatively as the principal party that was in opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This also became clear in the erosion of support for the Janata Dal (Secular); the space for a third player shrank considerably. The BJP won less than half the number of seats the Congress did, but the party that might have suffered an irreversible slide is the JD(S), which was seen as a family syndicate devoid of any moral compass. Voters could be forgiven for not having known which way the JD(S) would lean after the election. Surely, the opportunism of individual MLAs and the JD(S) following a hung Assembly in 2018 weighed heavily on their minds. Another indecisive verdict would have been as good as defeat for the Congress. Throughout the campaign, the Congress stayed united, focused and dynamic, while BJP leaders sought to settle scores with one another and worked at cross purposes. The Congress showed maturity and composure as the BJP tried to make up for its unpopularity by raking up divisive and extraneous issues. As the ruling party, it refused to be accountable for its track record in government and underestimated the intelligence of the voters by offering them communal opiates. The Congress largely stuck to issues that could have an impact on lives and livelihoods. For very good reasons, the BJP deserved its defeat as much as the Congress deserved its victory.The Congress and the BJP have lessons to be drawn from the Karnataka verdict. If the BJP truly wants to be a party trusted by all religious and linguistic communities, it must learn to respect them. After its failed strategy in West Bengal in 2021, and now in Karnataka, the party must see the writing on the wall. Its totalising project is harmful not only for itself but also for the nation. A violation of long-cherished and productive regional aspirations is unsettling for national integrity and progress. The attempt to undermine native dairy brand Nandini is a case in point. In a remarkable shift from the past, the Congress acknowledged that it must address questions of caste justice too, while holding on to its opposition to religious sectarianism, and expanding welfarism. The Congress needs to move beyond the tired rhetoric of the old order and frame a new paradigm that is inclusive towards the regional, religious, class and caste diversities of the country. It has made an experimental beginning in Karnataka. Between the failed experiment of the BJP and the successful one of the Congress, Karnataka voters have imparted important lessons to India\u2019s political class.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nKarnataka Assembly Elections 2023\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\nWest Bengal\n\n/\n\nwelfare",

        "full_article": "The reading for retail inflation braked sharply last month to an 18-month low of 4.7%, aided in no small measure by the fact that price gains had hit an eight-year high of 7.8% in April 2022. While at the headline level inflation cooled by 96 basis points from March\u2019s 5.66%, the month-on-month price gains based on the provisional Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April showed a quickening to 0.51%, from the 0.23% pace in March. Inflation also slowed in April on the back of a year-on-year softening in food price gains with the Consumer Food Price Index easing almost lockstep with the broader index \u2014 the reading slid 95 basis points from the previous month\u2019s 4.79%, to 3.84%. Oils and fats were a vital contributor, with a deflation in prices widening to 12.3% last month, from 7.86% in March. Also, inflation in cereals, which has the highest weight of almost 10% in the CPI, slowed by 160 basis points to 13.7%, from 15.3% in the preceding month.However, a closer look shows price gains accelerated sequentially in nine of the 12 subgroups of the food and beverages category that contributes almost 46% weight in the CPI basket. While vegetable prices remained in deflationary territory when compared with a year earlier, they registered 1.7% month-on-month inflation. And prices of fruits surged almost 4% from March\u2019s levels, even as year-on-year the price gains were half that pace at 2.1%. Of concern is that prices of pulses and products as well as sugar and confectionery showed accelerations in both year-on-year and month-on-month inflation rates. With the domestic output of pulses weaker in the current crop year, the Centre has already moved to tighten its monitoring of tur and urad dal stocks held by traders, so as to head off any attempts to hoard and push up prices. It is also reportedly mulling more export curbs on sugar amid a production shortfall. To be sure, besides the Centre\u2019s supply side measures, last year\u2019s base effect is bound to ensure that headline retail inflation is unlikely to go back above the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s upper tolerance threshold of 6%, at least during the current quarter. Still, there is no room for complacency. As Jayanth Varma, a member on the RBI\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, flagged last month, there still loom two major risks to the inflation outlook \u2014 oil prices and uncertainty on the monsoon. The heightening prospect of an El Ni\u00f1o forebodes the possibility of erratic or even significantly deficient rainfall impacting foodgrains production, and policymakers can ill afford to drop their guard on inflation.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\ninflation and deflation",

        "full_article": "The BJP must find a new leader, and the JD(S) a reason for existence\nThe Karnataka assembly results, where the Congress has obtained a clear majority of its own, is not exactly a break from the past. If anything, it confirms the three-decades-old trend of each election going against the party in power.\n\nWhere it is different from the past is in how the two national parties are gradually squeezing out the regional parties. This time, the tilting \u201ckingmaker\u201d party, the Vokkaliga-based Janata Dal (Secular), appears to have lost out in some of its key areas of support to the Congress. The three-way vote split, where the BJP gained some votes, but not seats, and the JD(S) lost vote share, is what helped the Congress sweep the polls that it otherwise may have won with a smaller majority.\nThe peculiar aspect of the Karnataka electorate is that it is the only southern state in which the BJP has a strong base; but its base, which is geographically concentrated in coastal Karnataka, Central Karnataka and Mumbai-Karnataka, apart from some pockets in Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Karnataka, gives its proportionately more seats that its vote share. The Congress, with its votes spread in most parts of the state, gets more vote share but fewer seats than its vote. This time, though, the perceptible shift in voter mood has allowed it to sweep away this disconnect between vote share and seats and emerge victorious.\nAnother distinguishing feature of this election is that the vote is against the proximate government, and not the one that ruled in the first two years after the last assembly elections in 2018. That election threw up a hung assembly, and for the first two years, it was the shaky JD(S)-Congress coalition that ruled. Since August 2020, when the BJP managed to get enough legislators to switch sides, it was BS Yediyurappa, the BJP\u2019s tallest leader in the state all these years, who ran the show. For the last nine months, though, after Yediyurappa resigned, it was Basavaraj Bommai who became Chief Minister. The verdict against the BJP is probably the voter\u2019s unhappiness over the slippage in governance after Bommai took over, especially since it failed to improve governance or deal with internal dissidence. The party\u2019s bid to replace a whole lot of sitting MLAs, who looked likely to lose, with fresh faces obviously came too late to save the day.\nSo what does this election result mean for the three main parties concerned? And what are the lessons? For the Congress party, this is surely a shot in the arm before 2024, as control of a rich state will help it raise the resources to fight the larger general election. As long as it reins in internal power blocks \u2013 the tensions between former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, the party\u2019s key fund-raiser, are difficult to overlook \u2013 and governs reasonably well, the state will be okay. The larger lesson is this: when a state has strong regional leadership, and the high command does not meddle too much, the Congress is a much stronger party than it looks. The fact that the new Congress President, Mallikarjun Kharge, is from the state and represents a Dalit face, will surely have helped. The Congress clearly benefits from strong regional leadership and that is the main thing it must focus on, and not the Gandhi dynasty.\nFor the BJP, though, there are larger lessons to learn. First, with Yediyurappa now aging, it has to find a new regional face who can not only hold the party together, but also retain the strong Lingayat base that has stayed loyal to it for many years. The party will have to develop new Lingayat leaders, and also leaders from other communities, including the Vokkaligas, Kurubas and Dalits. If it wants to extend its reach in weak areas like the Old Mysore region, it must give opportunities to leaders from this region. The party can thus be happy that it is making inroads here, though this is not yet enough to gain it seats. As long as the BJP sees itself as a long-term player in Karnataka, it can set aside the loss this year as part of its growth story.\nThe BJP\u2019s should also be concerned about the erosion of its vote in the northern and central parts of the state, which were its previous mainstays. Clearly, it must make amends here.\nFor the JD(S), the message is stark. It looks like a declining force, and if it wants to revive its fortunes, it must have a broader agenda that goes beyond retaining a base in one community and in one region. It cannot forever live in the hope that a hung assembly will give it the best chance of being part of the power structure. The JD(S) has paired up with both the BJP and the Congress in the past, and both times the alliance ended in tragedy. At some point it must ask itself: what is its reason for existence?\nThe last point is about 2024. Here, history is of some use. In 2018, the BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls despite failing to return to power in the state. This suggests that when Narendra Modi is the man one is voting for, the electorate will see the party differently in the assembly and Lok Sabha polls. The party will be hoping that next time too this will remain true.\nA lot depends on how the Congress delivers this time. But the JD(S) and BJP have a lot of thinking to do.\n\n",

        "full_article": "As Pakistan\u2019s multi-pronged political crisis matured over the past year, the issue always was when something would give. We cannot say whether the drama of Imran Khan\u2019s arrest, the civic unrest and violence that followed and his equally dramatic release was that moment. What appears likely is that the melodrama which played out over the past few days constitutes only a punctuation mark and the political logjam and confrontation, so characteristic of Pakistan in the past year, will continue.\nPresently, the crisis reverberates around four poles: The Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)-led government; Imran Khan, his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, and his street-level fan following; thirdly, the judiciary and, in particular, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; and finally, the military and the chief of army staff. In its bare bones, the current contestation in Pakistan and the role of this constellation is not new. From the 1990s, Pakistan has seen similar contests as political protagonists have battled each other in concert with the army and the judiciary. Imran Khan\u2019s transition from being the army\u2019s chosen favourite to its biggest headache is also part of an older script which other politicians have also enacted. Anti-army sentiment has also for long been a factor in Pakistan\u2019s culture of political mobilisation.\nThis, of course, is not to say that nothing has changed. The violence that followed Imran Khan\u2019s arrest had a certain raw intensity that appeared different. The protests also had an audacity which was new: that the residence of the Corps Commander in Lahore can be torched speaks for itself and is representative of the emotions and adulation that surround the PTI leader. There are conspiracy theories about how such a thing could take place at all and this has reinforced speculation about rifts within the army and the extent of support for Imran Khan amongst ex-servicemen. But the more important takeaway could well be that it makes the army look ineffectual and vindicates Imran Khan\u2019s postures of defiance.\nIf that is unusual in Pakistan, what is also unusual is the uncharacteristic behaviour of the Supreme Court and its Chief Justice in taking positions that incline towards Imran and appear to be at odds with what the army wants. To some this is again suggestive of divisions within the army. It may well also be another sign of the continued politicisation and simultaneous erosion in standards of different institutions. Or it could be that the court, divided as it is, is simply caught in the political crossfire and every decision will be viewed through the lens of a deeply polarised polity. These are questions daily debated in Pakistan with no clear answers.\nWhat are the main trends that we can identify as outside observers? What is most evident is that Imran Khan\u2019s popularity and his street power continues to rattle both the government and the army. His self-image as representing a new kind of defiant politics means that he is prepared to use any means and this gives to him and his followers an unpredictable, almost eccentric, quality. His release on the orders of the Supreme Court within two days of being arrested and the subsequent bail may well have wrong-footed both the government and the army. But at the same time the release also defused a tense situation and prevented a possible escalation of street protests and the prospect of having to use force against the Pakistani public \u2014 the one thing that the army wishes most to avoid.\nBut the government\u2019s efforts to book him with the army\u2019s support on any of the various corruption charges against him will continue. These are precisely the means used against Nawaz Sharif to disqualify him from political office. Many in Pakistan feel that Nawaz Sharif\u2019s disqualification was tantamount to making Pakistan\u2019s politics structurally tilt towards Imran Khan and stability will not return till a balance is restored by undoing that disqualification. In this view, Imran Khan\u2019s indictment and disqualification will be the necessary step towards a level-playing field. Other pressing issues including provincial and national elections will have to await the resolution of this basic contradiction. But there are also other clocks ticking in the background, not the least of which is a near crashed economy which urgently needs steroids in the form of a cash injection \u2014 but none appears likely.\nPut together all this may not amount to implosion or civil war as some accounts in social media breathlessly suggest, but it certainly indicates a chronically confused situation where anything could trigger a constitutional crisis with no clear way out. For India this means a chaotic and dangerously divided neighbour. Perhaps the best-case scenario in the circumstances would be for the status quo in the currently minimal bilateral relationship to continue and that the ceasefire on the Line of Control holds.\n\n",

        "full_article": "On a quiet December evening in 1989, a bored scanner chanced upon a report of a curious bedtime conversation between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles in which the current king made an important confession. He professed a desire to \u2018live inside her trousers\u2019 and claimed he wanted to be reborn as Camilla\u2019s tampon.\nWhen a transcript of this leaked phone call made the headlines, my neurons immediately decided that while it was acceptable to promptly forget every element in the periodic table and even the names of some of my relatives, this bit of information needed to be carefully preserved for over thirty years and dredged up when I saw the coronation.\n\n\u2018Be ambitious and work hard,\u2019 we keep telling our children, \u2018so that someday you can rise right to the top\u2019. Now they will throw this back in our faces with, \u2018Stop it Mom, look at Charles, his ambition was just to be a tampon and now he is a King!\u2019\nCoronation week meant a four-day holiday and my university extended our second term submission deadline by a day. This meant that instead of sitting at my desk and revising my essay for the eleventh time, I had some extra time to join the celebrations in my own way. I promptly bought a Meghan Markle cardboard mask, put it on and started walking all over London so I could do my bit towards making up for her absence at her father-in-law\u2019s coronation.\nI only understood the reason for Meghan\u2019s non-attendance after seeing a reel by Zarna Garg. The comedian put her absence in context rather eloquently: \u2018My father-in-law also just went to get his driver\u2019s licence renewed, do you think I went with him?\u2019\nConversations about the coronation seem to have brought up the old Kohinoor controversy. Traditionally, the Queen\u2019s coronation involved wearing the crown with the infamous diamond. On this occasion, the palace issued a statement that the Kohinoor would not be used in the ceremonial proceedings. This didn\u2019t stop Indians from once again asking for the return of the Kohinoor. I would just like to ask the Brits to return not just the Kohinoor, but as requested earlier, our two other anmol ratans, Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi as well.\nCoronation Day chatter would not be complete without mentioning Rishi Sunak, the brown man ruling the land of his former colonisers. Indians have been overjoyed at Sunak making history as the United Kingdom\u2019s first Indian-origin prime minister. His ascent may have surprised many people but not his mother-in-law. In a recent interview, Sudha Murty, one of India\u2019s most beloved writers, quipped, \u2018\u2018I made my husband a businessman. My daughter made her husband Prime Minister of the UK.\u2019\nHer comment provoked immediate backlash but her light-hearted comment did have a certain verisimilitude. After all, standing beside every great man, there is often a woman constantly telling him what he is doing wrong. And she is usually right.\nLet\u2019s take a digression from rulers of land to the rulers of our cultural zeitgeist. Royalty in the virtual world doesn\u2019t come with crowns or a 10 Downing Street address, it comes with a verified checkmark. On Twitter, the kings and queens of culture may or may not have blue blood but they definitely have a blue tick.\nElon Musk, who seems to run Twitter the way I try to lose weight, which basically means having no fixed plan and hoping for divine intervention, recently decided that no one would get a blue tick unless they paid for it. To his surprise, Elon bhai soon discovered that once the celebs lost their verified status, the rest of the Twitter tribe didn\u2019t care if they had one or not. He forgot a simple rule: If everyone is naked then nudity doesn\u2019t just become acceptable, it becomes desirable. After this \u2018oops a daisy\u2019 moment, Elon bhai abruptly gave celebrities their blue ticks back, claiming they had subscribed and verified their phone numbers. This resulted in blue ticks reappearing on accounts of dead people like the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, and sportspersons like Pele and Kobe Bryant. I am still unsure how they verified their phone numbers for Twitter Blue unless Elon bhai used a psychic and a Ouija board.\nMeanwhile, with blue running through their blood and account status, the Royal Family has been tweeting official portraits and recipes of their coronation quiche. I have a cousin who has already tried out the quiche recipe and a bunch of older relatives who have asked me to collect coronation memorabilia for them and bring it back home. So, I now have a bag full of plates decorated with pictures of Queen Camilla, coffee mugs with William and Kate grinning around the rim and a children\u2019s sticker book with illustrations of King Charles. And yes, when I bought my Meghan mask, I also picked up a bunch of masks with pictures of the other royals, in case all my buas and phupha jis want to indulge in some royal role-play.\nI can understand the British being invested in King Charles\u2019 coronation, but so are a large number of Indians despite our legacy of colonisation and our convoluted relationship with the symbols of British imperialism. This fascination seems a bit like a relationship with an ex-lover, even one who has mistreated you. You don\u2019t miss them or ever want them back, but still find yourself occasionally stalking their Instagram feed, or as in this case, streaming live broadcasts of what one of my daughter\u2019s classmates described as, \u2018Two hours of watching a man sitting on a chair and trying on a hat\u2019.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Congress\u2019s Karnataka victory in the only state south of the Vindhyas where BJP held power, marks significant departures in the local political matrix. It also has several implications for national politics. At the local level, this election has been bookended by several major shifts in Karnataka\u2019s regions and social groupings.\nBJP\u2019s dominance in Karnataka has historically been built on the support of the influential Lingayat community (about 17% of the population).\nThis time, though BJP retained some Lingayat support, Congress made major advances into this bastion. It doubled its seat-share in Lingayat-significant seats to 42 (from 21 in 2018), while BJP\u2019s tally here fell to 22 (down from 38 last time).\n\nJDS\u2019s fall in the Vokkaliga-dominated areas of Old Mysuru directly benefited Congress. The community makes up about 11% of the state\u2019s population and the party gained from a Vokkaliga consolidation, doubling its tally (28, up from 11 last time) in seats where they make up a significant chunk.\nCongress also swept almost all of the state\u2019s ST reserved seats and most of its SC seats.\nWhile BJP held its own in urban areas, Congress won the majority of rural seats in Karnataka. This is a big shift from 2018.\nAfter BS Yediyurappa, who did not contest (though he campaigned), the state BJP in Karnataka is clearly in the process of transition. It is yet to find a pan-Karnataka leader with a similar stature.\nSimilarly, Deve Gowda\u2019s JDS now seems in long-term decline. This turned Karnataka into more of a two-party battle, rather than a three-party contest.\nPM Narendra Modi\u2019s voter appeal remains high. While BJP has been trounced in this state poll, without Modi\u2019s roadshow in Bengaluru towards the end of the campaign, the party\u2019s tally may have been much worse.\nBJP managed to actually increase its seats in the Greater Bengaluru region (from 11 in 2018 to 15 in 2023). In contrast, BJP\u2019s tally went down in every other geographical region in the state. PM Modi\u2019s campaigning may have staved off a worse showing by the party.\nBeyond Karnataka, what does this result mean for national politics?\nWith a strong anti-incumbency sentiment against BJP in a state that hasn\u2019t elected an incumbent to power in over three decades, Congress was always expected to win. Yet, the scale of the victory (136 seats with over 43% vote-share \u2014 and a 7% gap with the BJP) is a big morale booster for the main national opposition party.\nKarnataka has the third biggest economy of any state in India (after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu). Winning control of such a prosperous and politically significant state is a fillip to Congress on the road to 2024.\nCrucially, this is the one state where Congress had a strong local leadership and party machinery. In Siddaramaiah it had a pan-state leader with an appeal to a wider social coalition, in DK Shivakumar a strong Vokkaliga powerhouse with organisational strengths, and in Mallikarjun Kharge its national president, a pan-state Dalit leader.\nThe Karnataka win also raises Rahul Gandhi\u2019s political stock. The night before the results, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh argued that Rahul Gandhi had spent 23 days during the Bharat Jodo Yatra in Karnataka and that the party\u2019s road to victory in the state began with that journey. While local factors were paramount, Rahul Gandhi campaigned a fair bit in the state, with a good strike rate. He has fronted the charge against BJP nationally so far. This victory will be a confidence-booster for the Congress leader.\nIt will also increase the Congress\u2019s bargaining power with efforts on for forging opposition unity with other parties ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\nKarnataka will be followed by state assembly elections in key Hindi heartland states later this year: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. While local politics in each state varies, Congress will look to replicate some of the lessons of this campaign.\nFinally, what about Karnataka in 2024? The state has 28 Lok Sabha seats. Historically, voters in Karnataka have voted differently, in state and national elections in the past three decades. While Congress will be greatly enthused, it would be premature at this stage to extrapolate these state results directly to 2024. A lot of politics remains between now and 2024 \u2014 in Karnataka and the rest of India.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In a few days, the whole world will celebrate the centenary of Sen: the man who changed India's cinematic landscape forever. As this will inspire a lot of fresh reflections on his cinema, I can guess that there will be a lot of focus on Sen's formal experimentation and the uncompromising political conviction of his subjects. Yet, for me, the man Mrinal Sen can never be summed up only through his cinematic output alone. Unlike many of his (equally illustrious) cinematic contemporaries, his most profound contribution to the field of Indian art and culture is in this radical and self-reflective empathy: guided by his sense of warmth, unpretentious sense of humor (once during a sound check with a Belgian documentary crew he introduced himself as the \"King of Belgium\" with a straight face) and an all-around collaborative spirit. This sincere desire to connect and converse with others with unfeigned sincerity makes the stature of the man Mrinal Sen even more valuable than his incredible cinematic oeuvre. Sen's spirit of belonging to the community requires greater attention in our anxious, paranoid, and narcissistic times. This December it will be the fifth anniversary of this death in late 2018. I was in Kolkata for Christmas vacation when the news of his death reached us. My father has been a film critic and journalist for many decades and conversed with Sen on many occasions in both formal and informal capacities. As the sense of loss in our house was personal and profound, my father recalled how Sen would solidly grip the shoulders of colleagues and journalists in Nandan or other adjoining areas during long hours of interaction. Many of Sen's colleagues fondly recall that embrace of solidarity and presence, including directors like Gautam Ghose or Sen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Anjan Dutt.\nThis spirit of reaching out has constantly provided the rich creative amplitude of Sen's films. He made feature and documentary films in five Indian languages: Bengali, English, Hindi, Odiya, and Telugu. This is a feat unmatched by even his contemporaries Ray and Ghatak. Just like them, Sen constantly looked for inspiration from literary sources, but Sen's literary influences and inspirations were uniquely pan-Indian, which further testifies to his position as one of the most important *Indian* filmmakers of the last century.\n\u00a0Sen's debut film Raat Bhore (1955) was based on the eponymous novel by Bengali writer Swaraj Bandyopadhyay, published only two years ago in 1953. Sen would later consider his debut film to be a forgettable experience. For his next film, Neel Akasher Niche Sen adapted the short story Chini Feriwala by prominent Hindi writer Mahadevi Varma (1907-1987). Sen's first film to prominently feature Calcutta as a backdrop, the film told the story of a Chinese immigrant street vendor (played by Kali Banerjee) in the city forming a platonic yet tender relationship with a Bengali house wife, played by Manju Dey. Another one of Sen's early films, Pratinidhi ( released in 1965, now sadly lost) is based on the novel Pracchadpat, by Bengali writer Achintya Kumar Sengupta (1903-1976). Sen's earlier film Punashcha (1961) too was adapted from a story by Sengupta. Akash Kusum (1965) was adapted directly for the screen by Sen's long-time comrade and collaborator Ashish Barman (1927-2002) who also wrote the stories of Interview and Padatik. Sen's first foray into Odia film, Matira Manisha (Man of the Soil, 1966) was based on the eponymous novel by noted Odia polymath Kalindi Charan Panigrahi (1901-1991). Later for Mrigayaa (1976), he would adopt another Odia short story, Shikar, by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi (1908-1943), one of the most fiercely political writers in Odia literature, and a staunch Communist activist.\nBhuvan Shome (1969), the pathbreaking Indian New Wave film that catapulted Sen to the national and international stage was made in Hindi. But it was based on a charming Bengali novel published in 1957 by Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay (1899-1979), a physician cum writer who wrote under the pseudonym Banaphul (the wildflower). Sen's next Hindi film Ek Adhuri Kahani (An Unfinished Story, 1972) too was based on a Bengali story: Gotrantar by Subodh Ghosh (1909-1980). Probably among Sen's most well-known works, Calcutta 71 (1972), is an anthology film, featuring four interlinked stories about the social and political crisis of the times. At least three of the four storylines were based on short stories written between the 1930s and early 1950s, by writers steeped in then emergent progressive and realist tradition of Bengali literature: Manik Bandyopadhyay, Samaresh Basu and Prabodh Kumar Sanyal. Manik Bandyopadhyay (1908-1956) was probably the most active political thinker among the trio. His story Atmahatyar Adhikar (The Right to Suicide) was set in 1933. It is about the plight of a working-class family during a night of torrential rain in a city slum. Prabodh Sanyal's (1905-1983) Angar (Ember) is the second story, set during the devastating year of the Bengal famine of 1943. Sen again turns our attention to a working-class family of a mother and two daughters driven to prostitution by hunger. The third story is by Samaresh Basu (1924-1988), a writer who was a dedicated Communist worker in his youth, even going to prison for his belief. His story, Esmalgar (The Smuggler) is about a bunch of teenagers smuggling rice. The final story was written directly for the screen by its main protagonist, Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay (1933-1983). Bandyopadhyay was a doyen of Bengali theater who had translated many plays into Bengali. He was also one of the founding members of the theater group Nandikar. The story too is the most theatrical both in the setting and the narrative structure among the four. Later, for Chorus (1974) and Parasuram (1979) Sen would collaborate with another well-known contemporary thespian and playwright, Mohit Chattopadhyay (1934-2012). Chorus probably has the most surrealistic elements in all of Sen's films, yet it was based on real-life scenes of youth desperation and mass unemployment on the streets of Calcutta observed by Sen himself, and his co-writer Golam Kuddus.\nFor Oka Oori Katha (The Marginal Ones, 1977) Sen again took a radical step to broaden his creative horizon, by visualizing Kafan, a Hindi story by Munshi Premchand (1880-1936), but making it in Telugu. A scathing tale of social injustice in rural India, the film was acclaimed nationally and internationally. For two of his films, Sen collaborated closely with his comrade Amalendu Chakraborty (1934-2009), a progressive writer and school teacher. Sen's Akaler Sandhaney (In Search of Famine, 1982) was made on the basis of a novelistic draft by Chakraborty. The film would actually precede the publication of the full version of the novel in 1982 by Dey's, a noted Bengali publisher. Previously, for Ekdin Pratidin (And Quiet Rolls the Dawn, 1979) he collaborated with Chakraborty, basing it on his novel Abirata Chenamukh. Another masterpiece of his \"Absence Trilogy,\"Kharij (The Case is Closed, 1982) is based on Ramapada Chowdhury's (1922-2018) novel of the same name. It brutally exposes the hypocrisies of Bengali middle-class morality. For his 1989 Hindi film Ek Din Achanak (Suddenly, One Day; 1989) Sen would turn to Chowdhury for inspiration again, basing it on the writer's novel Beej (Seed). The film, which also has one of the earliest cinematic references to the then-emerging Metro Railway Service in Calcutta, is about the sudden disappearance of a college professor, and his family's struggle to cope with the reality of the situation.\nKhandhar (Ruins, 1984) was based on Premendra Mitra's (1904-1988) short story Telenapota Abishkar (Discovering Telenapota). Sen's most conceptually ambitious (Yet clumsily executed) film Genesis (1986) was based on a Samaresh Basu short story. Mahaprithibi (World Within, World Without, 1991) is about the Post-Cold War global order and anticipates the effect of the neoliberal turn in the everyday lived realities of Bengali middle-class life presciently. The story was directly written for the screen by Anjan Dutt, who also acts in it. In the elder son's (played by Victor Banerjee) return from Germany, one could find some hints of the autobiographical experience of the author, as Dutt himself worked in Germany as a theater worker in the 1980s. Sen's penultimate film Antareen (The Confined, 1993) is based on a 1950 Urdu short story by Saadat Hasan Manto (1912-1955), titled Badshahat ka Khatimah. For his final film Amar Bhuvan (This, My Land:2002) Sen chose to work on the novel Dhan Jyotsna by Afsar Ahmed (1959-2018).\nThis tracing and indexing of Sen's multilingual oeuvre is crucial, as it signals a critical aspect of his creative personality. Sen was not just an \"avant-garde maverick\" with an edgy style and radical; politics. For Sen, who referred to himself as a \"private Marxist\", filmmaking was intimately connected to his broad and immersive readings in literature, and his sensitive understanding of Indian history. Such a capacious range of inspiration too contributed to the generosity of his spirit, and forever cements his place in the broader artistic community of India, and not just the cinematic community. This also explains Sen's broader international appeal among writers of great stature, for example his friendship with Nobel Prize winning Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1927-2014). Sen and Garcia Marquez met for the first time as fellow juries for Cannes Film Festival in 1982. By then, Garcia Marquez, who had a very good knowledge of international cinema, had already seen Khandhar and Genesis. They met again and spent a lot of time together as fellow juries for the Moscow Film Festival in 1986. Sen was invited to visit Escuela Internacional de Cine y TV (EICTV) film school established by Garcia Marquez just outside Havana, in Cuba. They bonded well there and maintained a warm relationship thereon. Such international outreach, going beyond the lucrative film markets of the global north, is sadly missing among most contemporary mainstream Bengali filmmakers, for whom literary adaptation is largely motivated by extraction of the \"brand value\" of the original story. Would most of them have the courage to choose from such a variety of sources, as Sen did?\nYet, for Sen, more important than choosing a broad range of stories to tell was the consciousness of who gets to tell these stories, and how. He has always been remarkably self-reflexive about the ethics of cinematic representation (the 1971 film Interview would be a good example) in his films. In his later works, especially, Sen showed a deep understanding of how cinematic subjects are intimately bound to an interrelated media landscape globally, controlling and reflecting the consumerist realities of middle-class lives around the world. A wonderful example of this is his unreleased film Chaalchitra (Kaleidoscope, 1981). Being one of the rare films for which Sen received solo writing credit, it is a good example to conclude this essay. As the film progresses, we quickly appreciate the reason behind this, especially knowing Sen's quirky and self-reflexive persona. In the film, Calcutta's crisis is not a grand narrative principle but filled with much more proximate uncertainties and suspense: just like the speculations on the suave, urbane gentleman stripping down to his bare minimum underwear in his ramshackle apartment in the city. Anjan Dutt (in his debut film performance) plays Dipu: a young and eager journalist in search of a breakthrough story, an \"intimate study\" of his own \"middle-class milieu\", commissioned by the editor of a leading city newspaper (played by Utpal Dutt). Dipu's effort to find a sellable story starts from his own courtyard in his shared accommodation, capturing a cleaning spree of the space headed by the women of the household. Yet every effort by Dipu to find a kaleidoscopic portrait of his clan goes in vain. As Dipu struggles to find his subject matter, the city emerges as an atmospherically distended landscape of precarious matter: starch, coal, smoke, hand fans, insecticides, moss, steel, and other material assemblages that are always situated in hazardous conditions. This precarious assemblage of quotidian crises emerges as the real \"scandal\" that mainstream media is in search of. Sen's Calcutta here is not just a simplistically portrayed \"post-colonial\" city, it is also very much a part of a global network of consumerism, \"a shopping center\", as described by Dutt's character. This vulgar yet vital consumer ecology, where astrologers tout their English-speaking skills in front of unsuspecting Western tourists, is Sen's creative inspiration. In a crucial sequence of the film, Dipu's younger brother Apu (played by a young Kaushik Sen) asks him, looking over the roofs of hyper-contiguously situated houses in their neighborhood: how many ovens are there in Calcutta? Instantly, Dipu finds his breakthrough topic. Yet, he still cannot extract a story from the subject of smoke. Unlike his editor, for Dipu, \"smoke is not a positive nuisance\", but rather a necessary and integral aspect of working-class lives in the city. Sen reframes our understanding of pollution purely from an ecological issue to a fundamental lens through which we look at Calcutta's social, cultural, and ecological crises.\nSuch attention to both the human and non-human agency is a key aspect of understanding Sen's late cinematic style. It complements his radical materialist politics. As we celebrate the first hundred years of Mrinal Sen's extraordinary life, we should pay attention to this larger politics, whose potential transcends the scope of any archive.\nSomak Mukherjee is finishing his PhD in the Department of English at University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The economist\nIt has been my privilege to have known Nurul Islam over a span of 58 years, as a friend, colleague, and comrade in the struggle for building an independent Bangladesh. While such a long and intimate association has provided me with some unique insights into the man and his work, it obviously does not lend itself to any objectivity in preparing such an appreciation. I will, therefore, as far as possible, let the facts tell the story.\nI met Nurul Islam for the first time in October 1957, at the Economics Department of Dhaka University. I had just joined the department as a senior lecturer. I had heard through the grapevine that Nurul was the bright star of the department. He had returned a year ago with a PhD from Harvard University, where his records had been among the best in a class from which a number of his classmates eventually rose to positions of eminence in the academic world or working for the government. On his return, he had, on the strength of his outstanding academic records, been appointed a reader in the Economics Department.\nI discovered that Nurul not only had a deep understanding of the discipline, but an incisive mind projected through a rather sardonic worldview. Since Nurul spent much of his spare time doing research in the library, an area less frequented by his colleagues, he was not in great social demand. He, thus, found in me a willing acolyte with whom he could not only share his erudition, but also his own concerns at the inadequate appreciation of academic excellence.\nNurul was elevated to a professorship in 1960 and eventually took over as chair of the Economics Department in 1963, when Prof Huda departed for Karachi to serve as a member of the Planning Commission. In the first half of the 1960s, we were both involved in debates highlighting the disparities between East and West Pakistan and the identification of policies and institutions needed to address this divide. The ideas generated from our work contributed to the preparation of the Six-Point Programme presented to the people by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which became the magna carta for self-rule for the Bangalees.\nNurul's most significant contribution to economics in then Pakistan came from his tenure as the first Pakistani director of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE). Nurul maintained and added value to PIDE's growth as an institution of excellence. He not only provided leadership to the group of expatriate economists who continued to provide the professional base for leading PIDE's research agenda, but also inspired a further generation of young Pakistani economists. He was particularly effective in bringing over to PIDE a younger generation of more talented Bangalee economists. Under Nurul's leadership, this group of Bangalees at PIDE constituted a veritable think tank of policy ideas which fed the agendas for self-rule for East Pakistan and incubated further policy options for the germinating state of Bangladesh.\nNurul's unique quality as a professional economist originated in the common sense and pragmatism which influenced his great faith in empirical work. Unlike some of us who tend to be influenced by our own particular ideological baggage when we advocate policy, Nurul put greater faith in letting the evidence influence the ideology and even shape theory. He did, however, contest theory which was not sustained by evidence and challenged policies founded on insufficient empirical work. Such an approach may have kept his research work out of the more exclusive economic journals and made him a less influential policymaker, but it made him an outstanding commentator on received academic wisdom and a critic of half-baked policies.\nThe freedom fighter\n\nThe one area where Nurul tended to subordinate his belief in the primacy of empiricism was in his commitment to the idea of Bangalee nationalism driven by his visceral hostility to the hegemony of Pakistani rulers. His antipathies influenced his research priorities, which focused on aspects of the national policy that widened and perpetuated disparities between East and West Pakistan. Such a politically oriented research perspective encouraged Nurul to guide younger Bangalee researchers as well as some of the expatriate economists at PIDE to channel some of their research towards diagnosing the dynamics of the East-West divide.\nNurul's own less flamboyant personality discouraged him from flaunting his antagonisms towards Pakistan's policymakers in public, but did not inhibit him from sharply articulating his views in more academic fora. Nor did his strong views diminish the quality of his academic research, which remained committed to drawing on credible empirical work.\nDuring his tenure at Dhaka University, Nurul played a leading role among the Bangalee economists who drafted the critique of Pakistan's discriminatory economic policies towards East Pakistan at the conference of the Pakistan Economic Association on the First Five-Year Plan, convened in Chittagong at the end of 1956. Nurul and I had also been invited to participate in an extended discussion in Rawalpindi in 1961 on the Second Five-Year, where we had crossed swords with the top economic policymakers of Pakistan in critiquing their neglect of East Pakistan in the plan.\nNurul's writings and views, which remained highly professional in content, further encouraged the government to invite him to serve as a member of the first Finance Commission, where he was again the lead draftsman in preparing the dissenting report presented by the Bangalee members of the commission. It is, thus, a tribute to Nurul's professional recognition as the premier academic economist of Pakistan that he was acceptable to Pakistan's top policymakers to head the PIDE in 1965, when the debate on the deprivation of Bangalees was at high tide.\nAn enemy of the state\nNurul's move to Dhaka coincided with the elections of December 1970 which, through the overwhelming victory of the Awami League in East Pakistan, definitively transformed Pakistan's political landscape. Within days of his arrival in Dhaka, Nurul, Kamal Hossain, Anisur Rahman, Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury, Professor Sarwar Murshid and myself were called in by Bangabandhu to give shape to the operationalisation of Six Points within the AL's constitutional draft and its incorporation into their final negotiating position at the forthcoming meeting of the newly elected constituent assembly.\nWe spent long days sequestered in a house on the banks of the Buriganga, engaged in intensive discussions with Bangabandhu and Tajuddin on the constitution. By that time, Nurul's fate, even if he may not have been fully aware of it, had been inextricably linked to the fate of Bangabandhu and the future of the emergent state of Bangladesh.\nDuring the birth of an independent Bangladesh in March 1971, when Bangalees attained self-rule under the leadership of Bangabandhu for the first time since the Battle of Plassey in 1757, Nurul's home in Dhanmondi became a small outpost for the virtual government of independent Bangladesh, with its headquarters located at Bangabandhu's residence, and its branch office at the residence of Kamal Hossain. Nurul Islam's residence became a meeting place of the economic team who met with officials and business groups to discuss and resolve emergency problems such as the emerging shortage of currency notes in the banks or problems of delivering fertiliser to farmers during a period of total government shutdown.\nWe academic economists had our first exposure to addressing real-life problems in real time, rather than through writing papers. Our recommendations were passed upwards for Bangabandhu's approval and then passed on by Kamal and Tajuddin to a liaison group of senior bureaucrats for implementation.\n\nAfter the departure of Tajuddin, one of the few people whom Bangabandhu implicitly trusted, Nurul was his first choice to take over as finance minister.\nIn the last days, prior to the launch of the genocide on Bangalees by the Pakistan Army, Nurul, Anisur Rahman, and myself were involved in backstopping the Awami League team of Tajuddin Ahmad, Syed Nazrul Islam, and Kamal Hossain in their ongoing negotiations with a Pakistani team involving General Peerzada, MM Ahmed, and ex-Chief Justice Cornelius to reach a settlement to avert the final crisis. The negotiations were, of course, a deliberately duplicitous exercise initiated by Yahya Khan while they prepared for a military crackdown. When Operation Searchlight was launched by the Pakistan Army, the economists were still at their respective homes. Fortunately, I had been persuaded by our mutual friend, Muyeedul Hasan, on the morning of March 27, that I should leave my home as the army may be after me. This advice was providential since a posse from the army did come to my home in Gulshan to arrest me on the afternoon of March 27.\nI had not, till then, appreciated that in the eyes of the Pakistan military I had been elevated from the ranks of a political economist to an active participant in a war of national liberation. Nurul Islam, fortunately for him, continued to be categorised as an economist and could still attend the PIDE office in Motijheel for a few days when curfew was lifted on March 27. But once I had been targeted, there was every likelihood that his role, in the critical months of March, would place him within the gun sights of the army. So our friend Muyeedul Hasan who had, along with Mukhlesur Rahman, another friend, organised the exit of myself and Anisur Rahman across the border into India at the end of March, arranged for Nurul to cross the border a few weeks later. In Narsingdi, en route to the border, Nurul may probably have established himself as the only Harvard PhD to have been exposed to strafing by US-provided F-86 Sabre jets of the Pakistan Air Force. He eventually met up with Anisur Rahman and myself at the residence of Dr Ashok Mitra, then economic adviser to Indira Gandhi, whose Delhi home in Lodhi Gardens emerged as a sort of refugee camp for senior Bangalee economists.\nNurul managed to get across to the US where he was provided with an academic billet at Yale University, while Anis was similarly accommodated at Williams College. While I, too, had been offered an academic position at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, my more substantive role throughout 1971 was to travel across Europe and North America as the envoy of the Mujibnagar government with the task of stopping aid to Pakistan. In this campaign, Nurul and Anis made their contributions through reaching out to the US academic community. At one stage, Nurul joined me in Washington DC, around the end of October 1971 during the annual meeting of the IMF, World Bank where, along with AMA Muhith, we met various delegates from donor countries to argue for the stoppage of aid for Pakistan and for recognising the independence of Bangladesh.\nPlanning for a new nation\n\nAs Bangladesh's liberation became imminent, Nurul faced a critical life choice. He had been offered a senior position as director of research at the World Bank, which could put him back on his original career path of development research, from where he could have eventually been elevated to even more senior positions. But his competing tension of serving Bangladesh brought him back to a still unsettled Dhaka, after the liberation of Bangladesh on December 16, 1971, where I met up with him following my return home on December 31, 1971. Nurul and I met Bangabandhu, within a day of his return to Dhaka on January 10, 1972, who had no hesitation in inviting Nurul to take on the challenging task of deputy chairman of the yet to be established Planning Commission. He also asked Anisur Rahman and myself to become members and agreed to our request that Mosharaff Hossain, who had played the lead role in establishing the Planning Cell in the Mujibnagar government, should join us as a member.\nNurul has written his own accounts of how we responded to the challenge of setting up a national planning agency in a newly created, resource-less, war-devastated nation. The real challenge for Nurul was to effect a transition from what had, till then, been an exclusively academic life, to take on the far more challenging task of designing economic policies and making decisions which impacted the lives of real people and had direct political consequences.\nThe Planning Commission, in its conception and design, was believed to be the fountainhead of economic decision-making. But as we discovered from experience, designing policies and having these approved by the cabinet was a complex political task. Even approved policies remained a long way removed from ensuring the outcomes which were supposed to flow from these policies. The implementation of policy depended largely on the ministries and their interface with the complex political economy which influenced their respective spheres of action.\nThe senior bureaucrats who were entrusted with operationalising policies at the ministerial level were far from cooperative with the professionals at the Planning Commission. Many of the secretary-level bureaucrats were senior to Nurul and his members in years and experience, particularly in the practice of governance. They had come of age in the governance culture of the Ayub raj, where the CSP was king, the minister was his public relations officer and the technocrat was the workhorse of the department. A new order, where ministers were politically empowered, and did not need to depend on policy guidance from their secretaries since they had access to alternative advice from the technocrats in the Planning Commission, who had acquired their own political credentials through engagement in the liberation struggle, was a rather traumatic experience for senior bureaucrats. In this fraught environment, Nurul not only had to establish an entire planning apparatus from ground zero, but he had to navigate the process and operationalise the commission through these treacherous shoals in the murky waters of a still evolving process of governance.\nSince the Planning Commission had, inter alia, been entrusted with the responsibility of aid negotiations, Nurul had to also deal with aid donors who had once lorded it over an accommodating Pakistani state. It should be kept in mind that in the 24 years of Pakistani rule, no Bangalee, whether at the ministerial or official level, had any exposure to aid negotiations. Had the commission simply taken its cue from MM Ahmed and the Pakistan Planning Commission, we could have rolled over on our backs and re-established the hegemonic influence of the World Bank who would have happily intermediated our aid relations with the rest of the donor community.\nBut all of us were, at that stage, young enough to be intoxicated with the notion that a nation which had emerged out of a protracted struggle, through blood and fire, should take charge of its own affairs. Tajuddin Ahmed, the first planning minister and chairman of the Planning Commission, strongly believed in protecting our independence from external influences. However, our self-belief would have amounted to little had Bangabandhu not invested his own authority behind us in setting up the commission and establishing an independent position in our relations with the donor community.\nThe positives of the challenge are part of the historic record. Nurul, ably backed by the secretary of the Planning Commission and External Resource Division, Syeduzzaman, negotiated over a billion dollars of assistance, which were allocated among politically powerful and resource-hungry ministries, each with their retinue of political intermediaries. It is notable that during the three years of Nurul's tenure as deputy chairman, not a single charge of corruption or malfeasant conduct could be attributed to the Planning Commission. Such a record would be hard to imagine today. The commission itself was set up from scratch with a recruitment, exclusively made on merit, of over 300 of the best professionals in the country. Again, not a single appointment was made on political consideration or under political pressure, even though such pressures from newly empowered political players was enormous. Here again, the protection provided to the commission by Bangabandhu was critical in the independent exercise of Nurul's responsibilities both in setting up the commission and dealing with the external world.\nFinally, within a period of 12 months, between August 1972 and September 1973, the Planning Commission presented Bangabandhu with Bangladesh's First Five-Year Plan, prepared exclusively by the professional staff of the commission, without resorting to foreign consultants or genuflection to external donors. The document itself was overtaken by the fallout of the global economic crisis and the unfolding political events which culminated in the assassination of Bangabandhu with its consequential regime change. But as a statement of a newly independent regime, committed to build a more equitable society, the first plan deserves to be re-read as a testimony to a now bygone age, which, in my view, still stands the test of time. Mosharraf Hossain, ably supported by Syeduzzaman, played a seminal role in putting this document together. But Nurul as deputy chairman, with the massive professional effort of AR Khan and his colleagues in the General Economic Division, designed the macro-economic framework of the plan and skilfully integrated this with the sectoral components of the plan.\nOnce the first plan was approved by the cabinet in November 1973, Mosharraf and Anis returned to academic life and I followed them in September 1974. Nurul arranged his own exit through a fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, but this was a more complex task since Bangabandhu was, among all of us, the most disinclined to let him depart. He had extraordinary faith in Nurul because of his integrity and loyalty. But the quality he perhaps most appreciated was Nurul's pragmatic approach to policy advice and his willingness to speak truth to power. In a milieu where political passions, pre-set philosophical positions or personal interests tended to influence policy advice, Nurul Islam's objective, unmotivated advice was particularly appreciated by Bangabandhu.\nAfter the departure of Tajuddin, one of the few people whom Bangabandhu implicitly trusted, Nurul was his first choice to take over as finance minister. But the unresolved tensions within himself had persuaded Nurul that he should, for the moment, return to academic life. Such was Bangabandhu's faith and generosity towards Nurul that he insisted that Nurul go to Oxford on a year's leave of absence and then return as his finance minister. The assassin's bullets eventually resolved this tension for Nurul and set the seal on his lifetime self-exile from Bangladesh.\nSumming up\n\nAt the end of these years, the contradictions inherent in the worldview and lifestyles of academics who had strayed into the real world of politics caught up with all of us, but particularly with Nurul, who was the most academically oriented among us. By training, inclination and temperament, Nurul was destined to be a professor of economics at Harvard University. But he had also aspired to shape policy and contribute to forging the destiny of Bangladesh, a largely political task for which we and Nurul, in particular, were ill-suited. We were not just content to be bureaucrats and technocrats serving political masters. We genuinely sought to change the world in which we grew up and to help in shaping a newer, better, world. But this was not a task which could be carried through by academics with a casual involvement in the political process. As, at the climax of Bangladesh's liberation struggle in 1971, we would have had to fully commit ourselves to a political life with all the risks and inconveniences involved. Among us, possibly only Mosharraf Hossain was suited to this task and missed his true vocation by returning to the academic world at the end of 1973.\nNurul Islam, the best of the economists among us, found himself caught between his two conflicting dreams. Nurul today is recognised, with respect, in the profession of economists. He did commendable work as the assistant director-general of FAO and then at IFPRI. But these engagements were hardly the summation of his real worth as an economist. Nurul could have been in contention for a Nobel Prize in economics or he should have ended his career as the transformative economic czar of an economically vibrant Bangladesh. This tension could never be satisfactorily resolved through a conspiracy of circumstances as much as the contradictions within himself which committed him to two inherently irreconcilable dreams.\nThis is an abridged version of a tribute to Prof Nurul Islam from 2015.\nProf Rehman Sobhan is chairman of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).\n",

        "full_article": "Not unsurprisingly, Bangladesh's banking sector now has the second-highest ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) in all of South Asia, as lenders continue to face numerous challenges emanating from scams, a lack of corporate governance, and reluctance by borrowers to make regular instalment payments. It is not an achievement to be proud of by any means. The only country that has a higher ratio of NPLs in South Asia is Sri Lanka, which has been enmeshed in a severe economic crisis.\nA World Bank report titled \"Expanding Opportunities: Toward Inclusive Growth\", which exposed this disturbing fact, also revealed that Bangladesh has the highest ratio of NPLs among non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in the whole of South Asia. In most South Asian countries, NPL ratios remained below the 2021 levels and the 10 percent threshold commonly used to indicate systemic stress in countries of the region. The only exceptions were Bangladesh, where the NPL ratio reached above the 2021 level and reached dangerously close to the 10 percent threshold \u2013 logging in at 9.4 percent \u2013 and Sri Lanka.\nAs of December 2022, defaulted loans at banks in Bangladesh had increased 16.8 percent year-on-year to Tk 1,20,656 crore. According to central bank data, the ratio accounted for 8.16 percent of the outstanding loans given out by banks as of December, up from 7.93 percent a year ago. The increase came despite the Bangladesh Bank further relaxing the rules on rescheduling to bring down the rate of default loans last July. What this clearly shows \u2013 for the umpteenth time \u2013 is that relaxing rules can't tame defaulted loans, as experts have said repeatedly.\nIn February, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified the problems in the banking sector, including the high volume of NPLs, as one of the three major domestic risks that may derail the economy in the short- to medium-term, and said that the likelihood of it spilling over to the wider economy ranges from medium to high. This is also something economists have been saying for a long time.\nThe one saving grace for the banking sector and the larger economy could be the adoption of the draft Bank Company (Amendment) Act, 2023, which could potentially usher in major consequences for habitual loan defaulters and restrict the influence of families on a bank's board. However, what is strange in that regard is that the government is yet to publish the draft of the Act, which it was expected to do after the cabinet approved it on March 28. Since it is not a secret document, the government should publish it to receive feedback and recommendations from stakeholders. It should also begin to enforce strict banking rules for habitual defaulters, and ensure that no more scams occur right under the noses of our regulators.\n",

        "full_article": "Not unsurprisingly, Bangladesh's banking sector now has the second-highest ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) in all of South Asia, as lenders continue to face numerous challenges emanating from scams, a lack of corporate governance, and reluctance by borrowers to make regular instalment payments. It is not an achievement to be proud of by any means. The only country that has a higher ratio of NPLs in South Asia is Sri Lanka, which has been enmeshed in a severe economic crisis.\nA World Bank report titled \"Expanding Opportunities: Toward Inclusive Growth\", which exposed this disturbing fact, also revealed that Bangladesh has the highest ratio of NPLs among non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in the whole of South Asia. In most South Asian countries, NPL ratios remained below the 2021 levels and the 10 percent threshold commonly used to indicate systemic stress in countries of the region. The only exceptions were Bangladesh, where the NPL ratio reached above the 2021 level and reached dangerously close to the 10 percent threshold \u2013 logging in at 9.4 percent \u2013 and Sri Lanka.\nAs of December 2022, defaulted loans at banks in Bangladesh had increased 16.8 percent year-on-year to Tk 1,20,656 crore. According to central bank data, the ratio accounted for 8.16 percent of the outstanding loans given out by banks as of December, up from 7.93 percent a year ago. The increase came despite the Bangladesh Bank further relaxing the rules on rescheduling to bring down the rate of default loans last July. What this clearly shows \u2013 for the umpteenth time \u2013 is that relaxing rules can't tame defaulted loans, as experts have said repeatedly.\nIn February, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified the problems in the banking sector, including the high volume of NPLs, as one of the three major domestic risks that may derail the economy in the short- to medium-term, and said that the likelihood of it spilling over to the wider economy ranges from medium to high. This is also something economists have been saying for a long time.\nThe one saving grace for the banking sector and the larger economy could be the adoption of the draft Bank Company (Amendment) Act, 2023, which could potentially usher in major consequences for habitual loan defaulters and restrict the influence of families on a bank's board. However, what is strange in that regard is that the government is yet to publish the draft of the Act, which it was expected to do after the cabinet approved it on March 28. Since it is not a secret document, the government should publish it to receive feedback and recommendations from stakeholders. It should also begin to enforce strict banking rules for habitual defaulters, and ensure that no more scams occur right under the noses of our regulators.\n",

        "full_article": "Biman just can't seem to stay out of negative headlines. After having raised eyebrows last week with reports of an unreasonable decision to purchase 10 Airbus planes and a mid-flight glitch in a plane that had carried the PM to Tokyo, the flag carrier is now reported to be sending about 100 officials to Saudi Arabia in the name of \"assisting\" Bangladeshi hajj pilgrims. According to sources, about Tk 8-10 crore will be spent for their 37-day stay in the kingdom. The lavish spending on something that Biman already has people on the ground to do for it has raised questions about the decision.\nReportedly, officials selected for the trip come from various departments. There are at least 33 from customer service, eight from the engineering and material management department, 28 from sales and marketing, two from administration, and so on. There are allegations that service rules have been violated while making the selections. The bigger question, of course, is whether such a large team is at all necessary. Biman's managing director tried to justify it by saying that there are a lot of services to be provided to pilgrims. But the airline already has a General Sales Agent (GSA) as well as country and station offices in Jeddah, Medina and Makkah that can provide those services. For example, the GSA is obligated to do all kinds of ticket-related work. Why are 28 sales and marketing officials going then? Even with the involvement of additional men, Biman has never been known for ensuring customer satisfaction pre- and post-hajj.\nWhy does it continue to send such teams then? Apparently, its staff see this as an excursion and a money-making opportunity. A Biman official will get a daily allowance of $220-$225 (around Tk 24,000) during this trip, in addition to other facilities. As a former director told\u00a0Prothom Alo, \"it is like an annual outing for them.\" It adds nothing substantive to the service provided by Biman. In reality, this is nothing but a wastage of public money. At a time when the government is struggling with a sheer dollar shortage and a protracted economic crisis, such trips by state officials are completely unacceptable.\nWe urge Biman to refrain from normalising this illogical move. Biman is already suffering from an unending \"bimar\" (affliction), with mismanagement and irregularities thwarting its progress. Let's not add to that now.\n",

        "full_article": "Child marriage, especially of teenage rural girls, has not received the focus it deserves for quite some time. There are reasons. Over the past few years, with the school-going girls emerging with better results in the SSC exams, some preparing for college admissions, they have been able to make themselves stand out. Few thought that the custom of child marriage could be insidiously present in villages. Also, the stifling environment of the pandemic provided a favourable ground for parents, particularly of poor and low-income families, to get rid of girls considered extra mouths and a burden on such households. Against this backdrop, the data contained in a recent UNICEF report, released early this month, may make one feel dejected. According to the report, Bangladesh has the highest prevalence of child marriage with 34.5 million among the South Asian countries. In Bangladesh, 51 per cent of young women are married in their childhood, it notes. The report uses data from the Bangladesh 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. As it elaborates on the data, it has the eighth highest prevalence of child marriage in the world. Approximately, 34.5 million women in Bangladesh are married before they turn 18 and over 13 million women are married before they turn 15. A strikingly different picture of girls also exists in Bangladesh. While most of the rural parents start worrying about their daughters as they study at the primary stage, many others are found encouraging these girls to take part in extra-curricular activities. That many teenage and post-teenage girls are groomed in the fields of sport has a lot to do with these liberal parents. Besides parents, teachers at the girls' respective schools also play a dominant role in discovering their students' flair for activities other than textbooks. These talented girl footballers nowadays play in the local and regional soccer tournaments. Dozens of outstanding girl football players have lately emerged from obscure villages across the country. Many schools, local clubs, social organisations remain engaged in bringing up newer girl players. It's a pointer to the seeds of progress being sown in the villages alongside those of orthodoxies and obscurantism. It's amazing to see rural school girls going to school in groups riding bicycles, a spectacle unthinkable a decade ago. Ironically, this is not the whole picture. Parents are found getting busy in marrying off their teenage girls. It's not that they are against their daughters engaging in sport. What scares them is social stigma. In the eyes of many social guardians in Bangladesh rural society, girls ought to be married off soon after they are in their teens. These parents remain ever worried about the marriage of their daughters --- in most cases with males much older than the girls. To speak tersely, it's the parents' fear of being ostracised by society because the dictates of tradition encourage most of the child marriages. According to an analysis by the UNICEF, despite progress the number of child brides in Bangladesh is staggering. Millions of these girls are being robbed of their childhood, and denied their fundamental rights. This is unconscionable. In unanimity with the UNICEF, it's time to assert that there is an urgent need to protect girls from child marriage.",

        "full_article": "Admittedly, an industrial economy is vital for creating a large number of better-paying jobs. The success of the industrial economy is the underlying factor of the rise of major economies like Japan, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Hence, other nations have been after it. No wonder, Bangladesh has been developing 39 high-tech and software technology parks and numerous special economic zones. But how does industrialisation create economic value and better-paying jobs? What is the purpose of developing an industrial economy? Does the purpose vary across the nations? Furthermore, do all purposes equally pay off for every nation? An industrial economy creates economic value by extracting and transforming natural resources so that those can play an improved role in helping customers to get their jobs done better. For example, silicon-bearing sand has a limited utility role in its raw form. But transforming it into silicon chips increases its economic value creation ability by a factor of 1,000 or more. To shed light on pertinent questions, let's look into how industrialisation creates economic value. There have been three broad windows of creating economic value through industrial development. Creating market for natural resources and labor: Right after independence in 1947, India pursued an industrial economy to transfer low-cost labour and locally available natural resources into economic value. Hence, India pursued an import substitution strategy. The focus was to make copies of imported products by operating imported capital machinery. Like India, many less developed countries such as Bangladesh have followed this strategy. But as the purpose of the industrial economy in transferring labour and natural resources into economic value does not focus on advancing the products, underlying technologies, and production processes, such a purpose of benefiting from the particular type of economy has been failing to create a sustainable wealth creation base. Thus, like India and Bangladesh, many other countries could not develop a robust industrial economy by focusing on labour and natural resources. In the context of import substitution strategy's failure to create a labour market, the opportunity of offering labour to multinational companies by manufacturing their products arrived in the latter part of the 20th century. This opportunity gave birth to export-oriented manufacturing for developing the industrial economy. But the purpose remained the same --- creating a market for labour. Despite initial success in creating jobs for the unemployed low-skilled workforce, such a model is neither sustainable nor scalable --- let alone creating high-paying jobs. On the one hand, technology has been progressing in reducing the role of labour in manufacturing. Due to better infrastructure and higher incentives in other countries, low-cost labour still enjoys demand there encouraging migration but rendering source countries' economic progress transient. Making a few people rich at the cost of mass population: Due to the growth of the import of industrial products, special interest groups in less developed countries pursue import substitution. But unfortunately, the low-cost labour advantage is not good enough to profit from assembling imported components. Hence, they seek tax differentials, preferential loans and cash incentives. As local value addition in assembling most finished products like mobile phone handsets is less than 5.0 per cent, such incentives are the only option for profiting from import substitution. For example, mobile handset assemblers in Bangladesh enjoy more than 40 per cent tax differentials. Thus the more than 90 per cent locally produced handsets is all about allowing the assemblers to profit from incentives instead of creating economic value. Due to decreasing role of labour, such purpose keeps increasing the incentive. As a result, the goal of building an industrial economy makes a few people rich at the cost of the mass population. Such a purpose shows the initial success of locally made tag but it fails to scale up economic value creation capability. Most less developed countries have this purpose. Consequently, besides the failure to develop an industrial economy in driving broad-based economic growth, the approach has been increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. This explains the rise of billionaires in less developed countries without the success of the development of a globally competitive industrial base. Hence, rising inequality (Gini index) in less developed countries is of no surprise. Creating market of knowledge and ideas: Upon making initial advancement in economic status, primarily through remittance income and export-oriented labor-centric manufacturing, less developed countries like Bangladesh, India have envisioned to be high-income countries. But how to attain that status is an important question. Two popular prescriptions have been around. The first is to increase investment in education and the next is to incentivise high-tech firms. A common argument is that there is a positive correlation between higher education and R&D and economic growth in advanced economies. Besides, there have been high-density high-tech firms in those economies. But how to transfer the knowledge and ideas created through education and R&D investment into an economic value is mostly absent in the discourse of developing industrial economies in less developed countries. Thus staggering growth in graduate production has become a significant cause of unemployment. The industrial economy's strength lies in transferring knowledge and ideas into economic value. They have focused on improving products and processes by continually producing knowledge and ideas. Their purpose in developing an industrial economy has been to create a market of knowledge and ideas. Unfortunately, without having adequate understanding and focus on this vital issue, less developed countries have been pursuing higher education, university ranking, publications, and patents. Unless they address this key issue, neither will they succeed in creating a sustainable, solid industrial base, nor will they create high-paying jobs for their growing number of graduates. True, the industrial economy underpins economic development. But the implication depends on the purpose. The focus on creating a market for low-cost labour and natural resources has a limited scope for helping nations to prosper. Then the industrial economy, out of import substitution, has been suffering from the erosion of value addition. Unfortunately, in many less developed countries, the purpose of the industrial economy through incentive-driven replication has a natural tendency to make a few people rich. How to engage local graduates to produce knowledge and ideas and transfer those into economic value through the industrial economy is overlooked or misunderstood. It is time for the less developed countries to take a fresh look and leverage the industrial economy on way to scaling up higher development parameters. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "In the face of opposition from traders, the Dahaka North City Corporation (DNCC)-led drive under a magistrate to seal off the dilapidated and risky kitchen market at Kawran Bazar had to be postponed on Thursday last. In order to avoid an untoward incident, the eviction team left but not before informing the market committee of its decision to come back once again on May 25 to carry out the eviction drive and seal off the market. But this is not the first such ultimatum. The magistrate told early last month the traders were given two weeks' time to vacate the place but did not pay heed to the instruction. The Fire Service and Civil Defence has found 58 markets and shopping malls to be at risk --- nine of them at high risk and 14 at moderate risk. But these are constructions that primarily run the risk of catching fire. Kawran Bazar run the double risk of both collapsing and catching fire. As early as 2010, the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) declared it hazardous and in 2019 the divisional commissioner also found it so and recommended vacating before demolition of the structure. About four years have passed since then and still traders are running their business there. One wonders if the urgency now shown by the authorities would have been there if three catastrophic blast and fires had not devastated markets and mall on Elephant Road near the Science Laboratory, at Siddique bazar and Banga bazar. But now that the authorities have become active to take the required steps, the traders are not only unwilling to cooperate but also defying the order to vacate the place. This is unfortunate. Admittedly, traders carrying out business for long in certain cases for generation have a huge stake here. But if life is under serious threat, there is no option other than leaving the place for safety. The magistrate who headed the eviction drive is on record, saying that a market in its final stage of construction at Jatrabari is meant for their relocation. This once again reminds one of the relocation of tanneries from Hazaribagh to Savar. Without completing the facilities including the central effluent treatment plant (CETP), an impression was given that the owners of tanneries were to blame for not moving to the new location. After so many years, why is the market at Jatrabari yet to be ready to welcome traders from Kawran Bazar? The traders have rightly asked for full resettlement and shop allocation. This is the minimum they deserve. Kawran Bazar is a prime location. A move to a new place is not always propitious for business for several reasons. But if they are not assured of allocation of shops to their names at the new site right at the beginning, they are sure to feel insecure. In this country there is always many a slip between cup and lip. These are in fact the symptoms of underdevelopment. The approach is half-hearted and at times it is like putting the cart before the horse. True, the worn-out building of the kitchen market at Kawran can collapse any time; it could do so even earlier. So the plan of eviction and relocation had to be carried out years ago. If that had not happened, reason dictates that the relocation has to be without hassle. To do so the part of the job the authorities were in charge had to be completed before initiating the move to evict the traders from their present location. Again, the question of the place's future use is an important issue. If the market is permanently shifted from there, no question of the traders' return arises. If a fresh trading centre is built at the place, the evicted traders should be given the priority for doing business there.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The International Nurses Day has recently been observed in Bangladesh as elsewhere in the world with elaborate programmes. Different government and non-government organisations have celebrated the day to appreciate the hard work and dedication of the nursing community. The theme for this year's International Nurses Day is 'Our Nurses. Our Future', which aims to highlight the challenges faced by nurses and the importance of investing in their development. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, three nurses have to be recruited against one doctor. So, considering the number of registered physicians in Bangladesh, we need more than 324,000 nurses. However, the number of the registered nurses in the country is only 77,838, according to the Bangladesh Nursing and Midwifery Council. And the number of nurses working in government hospitals is only 42,330, which is quite insufficient compared to the requirement. Healthcare is a team work. We cannot imagine a better healthcare system without adequate number of nurses. Therefore, recruiting an adequate number of nurses and creating a proper work-environment for them is mandatory for our healthcare system. International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12 to commemorate the birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing. The day provides an opportunity to recognise the dedication and contribution of nurses to healthcare globally. In Bangladesh, the day should hold significance because nurses have been at the forefront of averting serious healthcare challenges including the Covid pandemic. The government, healthcare organisations and the public should recognise the efforts of nurses who have been serving tirelessly. Healthcare organisations should celebrate the day by organising seminars, workshops, and training sessions to enhance the skills and knowledge of nurses. Recognition and awards should be given to nurses who have shown exemplary dedication and service in their profession. This will not only boost their morale but also promote a culture of appreciation and recognition. Everyone should express their gratitude and appreciation for the nurses. We can use social media platforms to recognise their efforts and share our experiences of receiving care from them. \nAfroza Sheikh,Dania, Dhaka,[email\u00a0protected]",
