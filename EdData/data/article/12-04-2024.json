In July 2023, Gauhati HC invalidated Kri\u2019s election, for not including in his nomination papers the fact that he had three vehicles.\nSC made three significant observations. One, a politician has a right to privacy as much as anyone else, and need not disclose every aspect of assets. Two, the voter has no \u201cabsolute right\u201d to know everything about a candidate, that a candidate is \u201cnot required to lay his life out threadbare\u201d for examination by the electorate. Three, the value of what Kri had left undeclared was \u201cminuscule\u201d in proportion to his declared assets of \u20b98.4cr. Not every non-disclosure is a cardinal omission.\nNeta\u2019s right to privacy:\u00a0SC has provided some shade to the much-maligned tribe of politicians. Much of the diatribe is well deserved, but for some years now, even politicians\u2019 families haven\u2019t been spared coarse public discourse. Their private tribulations and difficult relationships have been discussed in basest of manners by fellow netas and media, which no longer seems to have a red line on private lives, from sexual orientation to divorce. As SC said, right to privacy applies to \u201cmatters of no concern to voters or irrelevant to his candidature for public office\u201d.\nVoter\u2019s right to know:\u00a0Following powerful advocacy and an appetite for some reform in politicians\u2019 behaviour, rules for affidavits declaring assets and court cases were introduced. Regulating politician behaviour is difficult. But voters\u2019 right to know was a hard-won battle. However, as SC said in Kri\u2019s case, voters\u2019 right to know about a candidate is \u201cnot absolute\u201d. Scrutiny is important, information must be limited to matters related to public office and individual behaviour.\nProportionality & balance:\u00a0Which brings one to the final point on non-disclosure. The nub of the order was the proportionality test. SC said that for a non-disclosure to be considered a defect, even a minor one, would require a sizeable asset, of value by itself, or one that would reflect upon the candidate in terms of lifestyle. Kri\u2019s three vehicles in this case were a scooty, a motorbike and an ordinary van.\nNo amount of regulation is likely to bridge the gap between what citizens expect, and how politicians behave. To balance the two is what SC rightly attempted in Kri\u2019s case.\n\n",

But you have enjoyed many an in-flight tipple, without at all going overboard. This is where flight crews\u2019 judgment and airline protocols\u2019 solidity are tested. So, DGCA has done right to reiterate that it is up to the discretion of airlines where to draw the line. They get to decide the upper serving limits. The corollary of course is that they bear the responsibility of judging which passengers have climbed into the plane already stoked, and should not be served even the bare minimum.\nMoral ground control:\u00a0This is the just, joy-respecting, individual approach. Prohibition has its basis in the undemocratic idea of collective punishment. Because some persons abuse alcohol, the right to drink is taken away from all persons. Govts passing prohibition policies do not bother with data on the percentage of abusing persons to total drinking persons. Some parts of such govts know well that if such data were to be collected, it would take all the fizz out of their case.\nCalm cabin: The 2021 Capitol attack saw American Airlines temporarily banning alcohol on flights to and from Washington. This was a fair judgment call, to try to provide a calm flight environment for every passenger, and protect against mob behaviour.\nJudicious landing: When an \u2018overtly friendly\u2019 co-passenger shifts into harassment mode, how effectively does the crew respond? This is the crux of the matter. This is what the regulator should focus on. So that everyone who drinks responsibly can keep flying enjoyably. As it is, Indians are only served alcohol en route to other countries. Domestic flights are bone dry. Are they any \u2018rulier\u2019 than international ones?\n\n",
