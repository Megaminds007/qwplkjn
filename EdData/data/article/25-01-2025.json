The BJP, which was critical of the ruling AAP\u2019s unrestrained populism as \u201crevdi\u201d, or a freebie culture, has not only promised that the schemes that are already in place in Delhi will continue but has also promised more. The sum of \u20b92,100 that AAP has promised to women every month has seen the BJP and the Congress offering \u20b92,500 instead. In the speeches of Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, there is an attempt to instil fear in the electorate that if they vote for the BJP, the free electricity, water, health care and education available to the poor would stop. He is also promising to extend the gravy train to the middle class; more specifically to sections of society such as dhobis, pujaris, residents\u2019 welfare associations and autorickshaw drivers. But he has also made a public admission that three guarantees, namely, cleaning the Yamuna river, ensuring that Delhi\u2019s roads meet European standards and providing 24X7 clean drinking water to all, have not been fulfilled, and that if reelected, will have the AAP government focus on the issue of unemployment.The BJP\u2019s campaign has centred around the promise of a double-engine government if it is elected to govern the National Capital Territory. It is also making an all-out effort to tarnish AAP\u2019s claim of incorruptibility. Allegations of corruption in the allotment of liquor licences and the exorbitant amount of public money that was spent on the official residence of Mr. Kejriwal are the BJP\u2019s talking points. The AAP government has not tabled 14 reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Delhi Assembly that the BJP and the Congress say highlight proof of AAP\u2019s corruption. The BJP has promised to put out these reports in the public domain and constitute a probe. The central pitch of the Congress, which has seen its Chief Ministers, current and former, from other States campaigning for it, is that Congress governments have been more efficient and prompt in delivering welfare schemes. The Congress is also trying to invoke the past, highlighting the infrastructure development in Delhi that was carried out under former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. The party has sensed that the late leader still evokes some nostalgia in the Delhi electorate. The party has criticised Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s silence on the demand for a caste census. The BJP is fielding Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as his appeal may influence migrant voters from U.P. and Bihar, now the fastest growing voters\u2019 segment in Delhi.

        "full_article": "The Iron Age in India has been a subject of fascination and discussion. In the rest of the world, the Iron Age succeeded the Copper-Bronze Age or bridged the gap between the Bronze Age and the Early Historic period. But the situation in India is different: when the region north of the Vindhyas belonged to the pre-iron Chalcolithic or Copper Age, the south, with over 3,000 sites, was associated with iron. Many archaeologists have, generally and conservatively, placed the Iron Age to be in the second millennium BCE. Given this backdrop, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin\u2019s recent statement, that the origin of iron in the State could be traced to the first quarter of the fourth millennium BCE, is significant as this pushes the antiquity of iron further. After excavations in the mid-Ganga Valley of Uttar Pradesh about 25 years ago, early evidence of iron technology was dated to 1800 BCE. But now, the work in Sivagalai in Tamil Nadu, which was carried out between 2019 and 2022, has made authorities attribute the introduction of iron in the country to the early part of the fourth millennium BCE, even though the period of 2500 BCE-3000 BCE is taken as a mid-range value. This forms the highlight of a study by the State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA), titled \u201cAntiquity of Iron: Recent radiometric dates from Tamil Nadu\u201d. The TNSDA had the scientific dating results of its study validated by renowned institutions such as the Beta Analytic laboratory in the U.S. Mr. Stalin\u2019s observation was made keeping the findings in mind. Early this month, he announced a $1-million prize scheme for deciphering the script of the Indus Valley Civilisation.The work by the TNSDA should spur new thinking with regard to the strategies to be adopted by archaeologists who are working on the Iron Age of India. They may have to look for more iron-specific sites than copper-cum-iron sites, which will save time, energy and resources. Even though the Tamil Nadu government supports research projects on a wide range of themes in other States, the TNSDA has its constraints with regard to territorial jurisdiction. This underscores the need for complementing Tamil Nadu\u2019s efforts with those of other southern States. The Archaeological Survey of India should take the initiative of bringing the entire southern region under a common fold and enabling well-designed and coordinated work. After all, the idea is to share available resources and expertise in the country to arrive at more reliable findings. At a time when certain forces are increasingly using history and culture as powerful instruments to pursue their political agenda, credible and concrete evidence on the antiquity of the country will naturally put to rest any claim based on baseless assumptions.

        "full_article": "Elites are suspicious of crowds, which are often forces of reform\nCrowds have a bad reputation. Watching the crowds at Bastille, French thinker Gustave Le Bon cast their behaviour as madness, a loss of individual good sense \u2013 and this idea remains seductive to those in power. Multitudes: How Crowds Made the Modern World by Dan Hancox tries to tell a more balanced story of how crowds function, how susceptible we are to being swept along by those around us, and why we may be better together.\nA carnival or concert, a political protest or melee, religious congregation, different crowds have different dynamics. The joy and celebration of a carnival is the crowd at play. Singing and dancing together is a vital, ancient part of who we are as social animals. Chanting in unison at a sports match is a release of collective adrenaline, a halo of energy.\nThe modern age is the age of the crowd. Crowds often show up as a surprise at special moments of world historic intensity \u2013 because the suffering experienced alone by its members had not been visible to those meting it out.\nWhen we gather in a crowd, we are changed by it, and we change our history. Crowd membership gives us a freedom and strength we could not possess as individuals. Think of the French Revolution, a popular insurrection born of exhaustion and misery. It was a joyful collective catharsis, though it was misinterpreted by thinkers like Le Bon, who saw in it disorder and nihilistic violence.\nThese theories about crowd savagery have proven to be durable even today, among elites and thinkers. But hostility to the mob is often hostility to democracy, the book says. The 19th century was haunted by the spectre of a hostile mob: this paranoia showed up in militarised colonial policing, whether in Derry, Ireland or Amritsar, India.\nOf course, not all crowds are seeking a better future, says the book, pointing to 2021 Capitol riots in US, or Brazilian demonstrations in 2023 egged on by Bolsonaro or the history of fascist and authoritarian crowds, including Mussolini\u2019s march on Rome or Hitler\u2019s beer hall putsch. These reactionary vanguards are usually a violent counterweight to a rising mass progressive movement. They are often facilitated by those in uniform, tacitly supported by corners of the establishment and punished lightly, if at all, by the right-wing judiciary. Meanwhile the vast totalitarian crowd does not look sideways at each other, but upwards at the leader.\nCrowd scenes represent the density of urban life, whether Times Square in New York or Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing, or in any of our own metropolises. The idea of cities full of people, of strangers, carries a sense of menace for some, just as others appreciate the safety in numbers, the sensory bombardment of cities.\nCities spooked by uprisings like Tahrir Square have gone out of their way to scotch public conviviality and loitering, with urban design directing citizens directly to shops and homes and offices. Privately owned public spaces are replacing squares and streets, replacing civic mingling with transactional activities or profit making events. The surveillance revolution, police drones and cameras are another constraint on free assembly and social spontaneity. The fear of the crowd lives on in contemporary culture, with screeds about \u2018mobs\u2019.\nWe\u2019re all in it together, the book reminds us. To defend the self-assembled crowd is to defend democracy and freedom, it says.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Court response to artworks reminds us what\u2019s constitutional\nArt gallery DAG, from whose exhibition two MF Husain paintings were seized following a plea in a Delhi court alleging \u2018religious sentiments hurt\u2019, plans to pursue \u201clegal remedies against complainant for false and mala fide accusations\u201d. It signals an appetite for a robust defence of art, and freedoms as enshrined in the Constitution. The court didn\u2019t allow a case to be filed, but the very fact it allowed a seizure of the paintings is the core problem. The trope of \u2018obscenity\u2019, coupled with \u2018religious sentiments hurt\u2019 are tools of individual peeves seeking state interference. Courts are guardians of people\u2019s constitutional rights. To that end, regardless of the subject of art or its depiction, framing of any such miffed complainant\u2019s plea must be in terms of Articles 19 and 21 \u2013 fundamental rights guaranteeing freedom of expression and right to liberty unambiguous in their breadth.\nOct last, Bombay HC ordered Customs to release Souza\u2019s works, seized in 2023, saying, \u201cEvery nude painting or every painting depicting some sexual intercourse poses cannot be styled as obscene.\u201d Husain, a Padma Shri (1966), Padma Bhushan (1973) and Padma Vibhushan (1991), was forced to leave the country following death threats. The state failed to protect him. The intrinsic value of his art remains undimmed. Police found nothing to merit an FIR in DAG\u2019s exhibition of Husain\u2019s work. But the complaint survives even if the \u201coffence\u201d is not actionable legally.\nThe challenge before HCs is training subordinate courts that are quick to apply sharp narrow lines of criminal code, whether IPC or now BNS, to crack down on forms of expression \u2013 art, cinema, music, books, theatre. Subordinate courts can often be as moralistic as complainants. But courts are not private durbars. Individual moral codes must be left at the gates. Inside a courtroom, the canvas can only be that of the Constitution \u2013 Articles 19 and 21.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is unfortunate that Bangladesh's power generation from renewable sources pales in comparison to its neighbours, despite our role as a climate change champion on the global stage. According to a recent report, only 0.8 percent of total power in Bangladesh comes from renewables\u2014mainly wind and solar\u2014whereas India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam generate 11.5 percent, 3.7 percent, 10.8 percent, and 13.6 percent, respectively, from those two sustainable sources.\nBangladesh's transition to renewable energy has been slow, complicated, and hindered by contradictory policy decisions. Corruption and inefficiency plagued the country's entire energy sector during the last regime, and renewables were no exception. To partially fulfil her government's commitment to producing 6,000MW-16,000MW from renewable sources by 2030, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina approved 37 renewable plants, without following due process, under the controversial Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provision) Act, 2010. The law was repealed after the interim government took power in August, and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) floated tenders for 22 solar plants in various areas of the country with a total capacity of 853MW.\nUnfortunately, the interim government, unlike previous administrations, has decided not to underwrite bills of power-generating companies if the PDB defaults. Ironically, PDB, which sells power at prices lower than its production or purchase cost, has a record of defaulting on payments. While the interim government's decision could be seen as an attempt to incentivise institutions to operate more efficiently and profitably by not bailing them out, it risks discouraging businesses from investing in renewables.\nGiven that Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has long advocated for actions to mitigate climate change, we would expect his administration's policy decisions to reflect a commitment to transitioning to renewables. Decisions that contradict this aim should therefore be avoided. Also, a mechanism should be put in place to hold future political governments accountable if they fail to accelerate the transition to renewables. Moreover, reform of relevant public institutions is essential to ensure that Bangladesh does not fall behind in renewable power generation. Reducing our dependence on fossil fuel-generated power is not just necessary to cut costs and reduce reliance on foreign power supply sources, but because renewables may soon be the only viable options left for us to generate power.\n",

According to a report by\u00a0Bonik Barta, the interim government revoked the appointment of its then chairman in early September. Since then, this position has remained vacant, as have other posts in the five-member commission (the tenure of the remaining members ended in August). Moreover, several key office posts including secretary and director also remain unfilled. With only a skeleton staff available to keep the lights on, the commission has virtually become a rudderless ship, totally incapable of fulfilling its mandate to prevent river encroachment and pollution.\nThis is particularly alarming given how\u2014despite there being a non-political government in place and a well-known environmentalist at the helm of the environment ministry\u2014degradation of rivers continues unchecked. The NRCC is supposed to play a leading role in this fight. Established in 2014 following a High Court ruling that granted rivers the status of \"living entities,\" it is supposed to coordinate with all relevant institutions to guide state efforts against any encroachment or pollution, and bring those responsible to book. Unfortunately, even a fully-staffed NRCC could not live up to that expectation, due partly to its lack of power and independence and partly to the non-cooperation of other agencies.\nDespite that, activists warn that the current leadership vacuum has left rivers further vulnerable, and it is already having dire consequences. Over the past five months or so, we have witnessed how new politically connected individuals came into the fray to exploit rivers for their own gain. The unchecked pollution of our waterways is another alarming issue, threatening aquatic ecosystems and public health. Despite these pressing concerns, no effective steps have yet been taken to restore the commission's functionality. We, therefore, urge the government to immediately appoint a competent leadership for the NRCC and ensure it has the authority, independence, and resources necessary to carry out its mandate.\n",

        "full_article": "Sheikh Hasina's flight from Bangladesh under duress marked a momentous \"event\"\u2014a term philosopher Alain Badiou employs to describe a \"radical rupture\" in the historical and political fabric. Her ignominious ouster, following a popular uprising, exposed deep political fractures. It seemed to signify the end of an era dominated by her authoritarian rule. Yet, its aftermath lingers like the spectral presence of a purloined letter: visible yet elusive, significant yet unresolved. Her escape, an act unfolding in plain sight, remains steeped in symbolic implications, clouded by the political and social dynamics it unleashed.\nIn Jacques Lacan's reading of Edgar Allan Poe's\u00a0The Purloined Letter, the \"lost letter\" symbolises a hidden truth that remains elusive despite being in plain view. It is not absent in a literal sense, but displaced and misinterpreted. Similarly, Hasina's \"purloined escape\" embodies an act both present and absent. While her departure is a visible fact, its underlying significance remains deferred\u2014a symbol open to multiple interpretations. Like the purloined letter, her flight disrupts the established order, evoking uncertainty and perpetuating the structures of power and resistance it was meant to dismantle.\nHasina's absence exemplifies Lacan's concept of deferred meaning, where significance is perpetually postponed. In Poe's story, the ongoing search for the letter creates the illusion of stability despite underlying turmoil. Similarly, Hasina's escape transforms her from a political leader into a symbolic figure whose influence lingers in her absence. The question of moving forward while grappling with the structures she left behind remains unresolved, caught in the paradox of her \"absence of presence\" and \"presence of absence.\"\nEntrenched binaries and deferred relevance\n\nMajor political parties, notably the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami, struggle to assert relevance, clinging to their unforeseen adversarial posture. Despite, or perhaps because of, Hasina's dramatic departure, they remain entrenched in the binary opposition of Awami League versus BNP, failing to adapt to a shifting political reality. Their efforts to position themselves against the interim government, already accused of being mired in inefficiency and elitism, ironically amplify Hasina's lingering influence.\nThis inability to evolve underscores their reliance on a familiar, albeit antiquated, political script. Rather than reimagining their roles in a post-Hasina polity, they perpetuate old rivalries, allowing her symbolic shadow to dominate. Their reluctance to transcend the oppositional framework\u2014built on decades of political polarisation\u2014delays the potential for meaningful reform. In this stasis, they fail to address systemic challenges that demand attention, undermining their relevance in an evolving political landscape.\nRevolutionary fervour meets institutional inertia\nMeanwhile, the students who spearheaded the July uprising face the daunting task of translating revolutionary fervour into institutional change. The inertia of the very systems they sought to dismantle threatens to co-opt their idealism, reducing their efforts to yet another cog in the machinery of political stagnation. While their aspirations to launch a new political party reflect a desire for transformation, these efforts risk dilution through compromises with questionable political stakeholders, potentially undermining their revolutionary ethos.\nThe students' struggle is emblematic of a broader challenge: the collision between transformative aspirations and entrenched political structures. Their movement, though a catalyst for Hasina's ouster, now faces the task of sustaining momentum in a landscape rife with obstacles. The risk of becoming subsumed by existing political dynamics looms large, threatening to erode the revolutionary potential they embody.\nThe interim government: Navigating fragile terrain\n\nThe interim government\u2014tasked with navigating this fraught transition\u2014bears the weight of stabilising a fractured polity. Yet, the entrenched remnants of Sheikh Hasina's regime, particularly within the business and civil-military bureaucracies, persist. These institutions, far from collapsing, perpetuate an illusion of continuity. Their complicity reinforces the structures Hasina built, making her absence paradoxically more pronounced. In this sense, her symbolic presence haunts the nation's politics, raising doubts about whether genuine change is possible or if the illusion of her authority will endure.\nThe interim government's inefficiency and elitism further complicate this precarious moment. Its increasing connivance of, if not entanglement with, entrenched interests limits its capacity to enact transformative reforms, perpetuating the structures that enabled Hasina's authoritarian rule.\nHistorical reckonings and structural flaws\nThis moment must be contextualised within Bangladesh's broader historical trajectory. Sheikh Hasina's rule was characterised by consolidation of power, suppression of dissent, and the erosion of democratic institutions. Her escape represents not only a political rupture but also a profound challenge to the nation's collective psyche. It forces a reckoning with the deep-seated issues that allowed her authoritarian regime to thrive.\nThe remnants of Hasina's centralised power structure\u2014entwined with businesses, civil and military bureaucracies, and law enforcement\u2014pose a formidable challenge. These institutions must not merely adapt to her absence, but critically interrogate the systems that sustained her rule. Bangladesh's true challenge lies not in pursuing the illusory stability of her presence, but in confronting the foundational flaws that perpetuated her authority.\nBeyond the illusion: Seizing the moment\n\nThe lessons of\u00a0The Purloined Letter\u00a0remind us that the endless pursuit of illusory truths delays meaningful progress. Bangladesh must look beyond Hasina's absence to address the systemic issues that sustained her rule. Only by doing so can the nation hope to transcend the shadow of her legacy and build a more accountable and democratic future.\nThe stakes are high, and the path ahead is fraught with uncertainty. Yet, within this uncertainty lies the potential for transformation\u2014a chance to reclaim agency and forge a new political order. Hasina's escape, like the purloined letter, is a conspicuous truth resisting resolution. The pressing question remains: will Bangladesh seize this moment to confront its past and shape a new future, or remain trapped in cycles of deferred meaning and contested power?\nThe shadow of authority: Lacanian insights on deferred meaning\nLacan's notion of deferred meaning, grounded in the idea that meaning is always postponed through language and its inherent instability, provides a powerful lens through which to view the political situation in Bangladesh under Hasina's leadership. Her physical absence may be a clear reality, but the symbolic structures and institutions she built persist in shaping the political and social landscape. This creates a tension where the country is caught between the absence of a visible, authoritative figure and the continued, often oppressive, presence of the systems she put in place.\nIn Lacanian terms, Hasina's absence operates like the\u00a0petit objet a, the object-cause of desire\u2014an absence that nonetheless fuels desire and longing, as it remains unfulfilled. In this case, her absence becomes the catalyst for political stagnation and potential change. It paralyses the public, as they remain fixated on her legacy and the systems she left behind, unable to move past them. This paralysis is akin to the feeling of being trapped in the shadows of a once-dominant figure, where the country remains obsessed with a past it cannot escape.\nYet, Lacan also suggests that absence can open the door to a new kind of freedom. Just as Poe's\u00a0The Purloined Letter\u00a0remains hidden in plain sight, so too does the potential for transformation in Bangladesh. The systems that continue to operate in Hasina's name are not static\u2014they are open to reinterpretation. But for this to happen, there must be a willingness to confront the shadows she left behind and embrace the ambiguity of her symbolic absence. The unresolved question is whether Bangladesh can move beyond the constraint of her legacy and reimagine its political future in a way that is not tied to her shadow.\nThis process of redefining the nation would require confronting the fragmented meanings that linger in the wake of Hasina's influence. Lacan's theory reminds us that meaning is never stable; it is in constant flux, deferred, and subject to reinterpretation. The challenge for Bangladesh lies in whether it can seize the opportunity created by the gap left by Hasina's absence to reconstruct its identity on its own terms, no longer defined by the shadow of its former leader. This involves not just dismantling the systems of power she established but also reimagining the underlying symbols that continue to shape its political consciousness. Only then can the country begin the difficult process of liberating itself from the ideological structures that still hold sway and begin anew in a post-Hasina era.\nDr Faridul Alam\u00a0writes from New York City, US.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.
