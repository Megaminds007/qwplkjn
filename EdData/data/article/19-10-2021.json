        "full_article": "In the first eight months of 2021, at least 79 girls with disabilities have been subjected to rape in the country, according to a recent report by the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum Bangladesh. There is a culture of impunity regarding sexual violence faced by children, but pursuing justice becomes even more challenging in case of girls with disabilities\u2014especially if they have intellectual, speech, hearing, and psycho-social disabilities.\nChild sexual violence, abuse, and exploitation happen in many ways, which can range from inappropriate touching to rape. Children are abused in all settings: homes, schools, playgrounds, workplaces, etc. This is a serious violation of children's rights and has a long-term negative impact on their lives. Most of the cases of child sexual abuse remain unreported, and the likelihood of the abuse being unreported is higher in the case of children with disabilities. There is chronic inaccessibility and structural discrimination that children with disabilities face within the legal system in Bangladesh. Therefore, survivors and their families usually refrain from speaking out about the violence against them. This makes children with disabilities even more vulnerable. So, it could be safely said that the number cited above reflects only the tip of the iceberg.\nAccording to \"Out from the Shadows: Sexual Violence against Children with Disabilities,\" a report jointly prepared by Save the Children and Handicap International, children with disabilities are at a greater risk of experiencing physical and sexual violence than children without disabilities. They may be hidden in communities due to stigma and discrimination, and excluded from schools and other educational opportunities. Adolescent girls and boys with disabilities (particularly those with intellectual disabilities) are usually excluded from activities that could increase their knowledge about violence, sex, and healthy relationships, as well as from peer networks that might protect them from violence.\nAs a result of the isolation, children with disabilities are perceived as an easy target for violence. In many cases, parents of children with disabilities are unaware of the risks facing them, and cannot take actions to protect their children. Perpetrators could be a relative or anyone on whom the child is dependent, which makes it very difficult to address the issue.\nChildren with disabilities usually find it hard to move away from risky situations or call for help. Often they don't know if a crime has happened to them, or can't tell other people what happened. In most cases, police, legal, and medical professionals do not have the capacity and sensitivity to communicate with children with disabilities in an effective way, and cannot provide the required support.\nIn Bangladesh, children with different types of disabilities face different challenges. A survivor with speech and hearing impairment cannot give testimony to the court directly, as there are no lawyers or judges who know sign language. Courts require interpreters in such cases. But there are only around 10 of them in the country, and most of them are based in Dhaka. In case of survivors with psychosocial disability, the police are not willing to document such cases because the survivors cannot prove the incident. Those who have multi-sensory impairment are completely unable to give testimony.\nPerpetrators should be brought to justice through speedy trials. Social and structural discrimination that prevents children from accessing services should be addressed. We should guarantee equal access to education and other opportunities that decrease the isolation of children with disabilities. There is a need for a change in public attitude regarding children with disabilities, which will contribute to creating an environment where they feel included. It is important to prohibit all forms of discrimination that may hinder access to justice as well as medical, legal, psychological, and social services. For example, legal provisions that automatically prohibit children with certain disabilities from being recognised as competent witnesses must be changed. If the burden of proof could be shifted to the accused perpetrator from the victim, it may be easier to get justice.\nThere should be investment in high-quality, free services that prevent and respond to sexual violence against children with disabilities. We must ensure that the children get the support they need. This includes medical care, support to cope and keep safe, someone to assist them to understand information or use sign language, advice to help them get a lawyer for free, and support to speak in court in a way that is safe for them.\nThere should be capacity building efforts for the police, judges and court staff, social workers, doctors, nurses, and other health staff so that they could provide adequate support to the children with disabilities with sensitivity. Infrastructures and services should be designed in a way that all children with disabilities could use them easily.\nChildren with disabilities should be consulted to ensure services are appropriate and accessible to them. They should have access to information on their rights, which will help them in identifying, preventing, and acting upon violence against them. The laws related to rape and disability rights must be disseminated to them in accessible formats (through braille, sign language, etc). Parental awareness should be developed so that they can prevent and detect the early signs of sexual violence faced by their children with disabilities. This will be helpful in taking measures to protect them quickly.\n\"It makes me so angry when I see the man who raped my 13-year-old daughter with disabilities proudly roaming around the neighbourhood, saying, 'What's so wrong with raping a retard? She's a reject anyway!'\"\u2014this remark by a frustrated father of a girl with intellectual and physical disabilities expresses the reality faced by the children with disabilities. Due to the additional vulnerabilities faced by them, we have more responsibilities to do all we can to protect them from sexual violence. The government, civil society, service providers, media, parents, and community members should play their roles properly to ensure that children with disabilities are protected from sexual violence. Let's make them a priority and always consider their best interest.\n\u00a0\nLaila Khondkar is an international development worker.\n",

        "full_article": "The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K) is emerging as a major threat to peace in Afghanistan, proving the Taliban's previous judgement of their capabilities wrong. Ever since the IS-K was established in 2015\u2014when they were at the height of power in Syria and Iraq\u2014the offshoot of the international terror network has carried out constant attacks across Afghanistan. One would remember the horrific shooting at a maternity ward in Kabul in 2020, when fighters suspected to be members of IS-K shot at expecting mothers, nurses, and doctors. Twenty-four people, including mothers and newborn children, were killed.\nOver time, the IS-K has carried out many daring attacks on the previous Afghan government and politicians, local and international security forces (including the US and NATO personnel), international humanitarian agencies and their personnel, minority groups, and the Taliban, among others.\nMore recently, the IS-K has claimed two suicide bombings at Shia mosques on two Fridays in a row. The first of these two suicide attacks, targeting Friday prayers, was orchestrated at Said Abad Mosque in Kunduz province in northeast Afghanistan, on October 8. More than 50 worshippers were killed in the suicide attack, and hundreds were injured. It was the third attack on a religious institution that week. The mosque attack, along with the recent transgressions of the IS-K, raised concerns among the Afghans, the ruling Taliban, and the United Nations; UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said it was part of a \"disturbing pattern of violence.\"\nThe latest suicide attack, on October 15, only added to the apprehensions of the people. This attack was carried out at a packed mosque in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. At least 65 worshippers were killed, while hundreds were injured. The UN secretary-general called the attack \"despicable.\"\nAn attack at the heart of the Taliban's power centre\u2014the southern city of Kandahar\u2014sends them a very alarming signal: they are perhaps no longer capable of safeguarding their own stronghold. While the world is still coming to terms with the fact that the US had to make a botched exit from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years of occupation\u2014thanks to its own premature Afghanistan strategy and mismanagement of resources\u2014and that an extremist group is now ruling the country again, the emergence of IS-K bodes ominous portents for the world community.\nAlthough the Taliban has been dismissive about the capacity and strength of the IS-K in the past, they are now realising the mistake of undermining the IS offshoot. After the Kunduz attack, a Taliban spokesman tweeted, \"This afternoon, an explosion took place in a mosque of our Shiite compatriots\u2026 a number of our compatriots were martyred and wounded.\" He suggested that the Taliban were investigating the bombing. There were also talks of strengthening security at the religious institutions in the Shia dominated areas. Despite that, the Kandahar attack took place\u2014under the very nose of the Taliban.\nThe Nangarhar and Kunar-based IS-K, being an offshoot of the Islamic State, follow their belief systems. The IS-K fighters include hard-line jihadists from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and also include some former members of the Taliban, who harbour a more extremist worldview.\nWhile IS-K fighters are now challenging the Taliban and trying to dent their image through these atrocious attacks, they are unlikely to stop at this. The IS-K\u2014as per the ideology of the IS\u2014is likely to target establishing a caliphate in the region through destabilising regional peace and order. Since many of these fighters are from Pakistan and Uzbekistan, they are also likely to have a good understanding of these countries, which they can use to their advantage as and when required.\nJason M Blazakis, professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in an article on Defenseone.com, suggested that while the Taliban was focused on local victory, \"ISIS still wants the world.\" He further added, \"ISIS-K also believes that al-Qaeda and the Taliban are too locally focused and disinterested in establishing a global caliphate\u2026 al-Qaeda was always opposed to creating a global caliphate too quickly, citing the need to govern successfully by tending to the masses. ISIS instead bet on its ability to metastasise globally and for a time eclipsed the already-diminished al-Qaeda within jihadist circles.\"\nHowever, to what extent the Taliban and al-Qaeda will be able to keep IS-K at bay remains to be seen. Crushing the IS-K would be a difficult task for any actor\u2014local or foreign. Nangarhar and Kunar are mountainous and semi-mountainous terrains and provide ample opportunities for cover. And with the constrained resources, the Taliban is stuck between a rock and a hard place with regard to eliminating the threat of IS-K.\nAnother challenge that the Taliban face is internal strife between the various factions within the organisation. There are radical, extremist elements within them, many of whom are not happy with the more moderate attitude of the Taliban\u2014those who believe in the old dogmas and feel that the Taliban are not hard-line enough. To these factions, IS-K might look like just the right association.\nThe IS-K's possible affiliation with the powerful Haqqani network, with whom the Taliban are also strongly connected, also makes it difficult for them to go after the IS-K. A BBC report quoted Asia Pacific Foundation's Dr Sajjan Gohel as saying that \"several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan.\"\nThe Haqqani network is currently in charge of internal security in Afghanistan. Its influence with the Taliban and their prominent roles in the government have made regional and global players uneasy about the ability of the Taliban to deliver on its promise of security.\nThe IS-K\u2014known for its notorious ambitions, radical ideologies, and unpredictable actions\u2014 had even unnerved the US security forces with the atrocious Kabul airport attack, which pushed the US forces to further hasten their evacuation. The IS-K is not a force to be trifled with. These jihadists are blood-thirsty and would do anything to achieve their goals. This terrorist outfit of Islamic State should be stopped in its tracks now, before they muster more support and resources to emerge as a stronger malicious force than it already is.\nThe IS-K is not just Afghanistan's problem; it is the problem for the region. The regional players now need to take a good, hard look at the situation in Afghanistan, and take concerted and comprehensive measures to stop the IS-K from spreading its wings further. A distraught and vulnerable neighbour being forced to harbour terrorist elements is not a desirable geopolitical scenario for anyone.\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb is a columnist for The Daily Star.\nHer Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n",

        "full_article": "Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar is global vice-president and country director, The Hunger Project, and secretary of Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujan). In this interview with Eresh Omar Jamal of The Daily Star, he talks about the constitutional obligation of formulating a law to establish the Election Commission and why politicians so far have ignored it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDespite the constitution providing for the formulation of a law to establish the Election Commission (EC), why is it that we still don't have it?\nBecause, in simple terms, our politicians did not want to have the law. A law would lay down some procedures, restrictions and guidelines, so you cannot do whatever you want\u2014although laws may have loopholes, and if your intentions are not honest, you can manipulate them. But a law ties your hands to some extent, and our politicians did not want that. They wanted to do whatever they wanted and appoint whomever they wanted.\nConstitutional obligations aside, why is such a law necessary? How would it improve holding elections?\nAs I've already said, a law would set some boundaries, erect some guardrails and set out certain procedures. It could, for example, ensure that appropriate and non-partisan people are appointed to the EC, who may be able to withstand pressure from vested quarters. It may not guarantee that we will have free and fair elections, but it will definitely increase the likelihood. It is in the public's interest that we have free, fair and credible elections, so that a democratically formed government runs the affairs of the state. That way, those in charge are more accountable to the people.\nWhat kind of boundaries or procedures am I talking about? See, a law could spell out the qualifications or disqualifications of candidates for the EC posts. If the appointing authorities\u2014the president and, indirectly, the prime minister\u2014are honest in their intentions and want to abide by the law, then we are likely to have qualified people appointed to the EC. With regards to qualifications, the first important provision in the law could be that the candidates would be required to submit their antecedents in the form of affidavits, which should be made public.\nThe law could lay down the procedure to appoint EC members through a search committee that represents different stakeholders. One committee member could be appointed by the PM, one by the leader of the opposition, one by the third largest party in parliament\u2014even though most members of our current parliament were not elected by the people. The search committee could also be headed by an honourable person such as a former chief justice or a former justice of the Appellate Division. There could also be a representative of the civil society and another from the media. The comptroller and auditor-general could also be included. The workings of this committee should be made transparent. The minutes of their meetings and their deliberations should be written down and made public.\nIn the past, the PM would decide the appointees. Since 2011, the president has been holding dialogues with political parties to constitute a search committee. And how was it constituted? If you look at Article 48(3) of our constitution, it essentially says that except in the case of appointing the PM and chief justice, the president will have to act on the advice of the PM in all matters. In forming the search committee, I am pretty sure the president had to get the advice of the PM. So, basically the head of the executive branch\u2014the PM\u2014decided who became members of the search committee. And we have no knowledge of how those search committees functioned and how they came to their decisions.\nAnother alternative could be to have a parliamentary special committee\u2014representing the different parties in parliament\u2014in lieu of the search committee. But the problem with that is the parliament in our country is not representative, and most of the incumbent MPs did not get \"elected\" with the consent of the people. Another reality is that the parliament has become subservient to the executive, so I don't think such a committee would work here.\nThe framers of our constitution perhaps never thought that there would be a day when the people in power would select EC members who would serve their own interests, rather than the interests of the people. I have talked to a few of them, who said they thought honourable people would be selected for the EC, not those who would hold tainted elections. They never thought we would ever have what is now practically a one-party government.\nHow would you rate the performance of the present EC, particularly in light of the fact that voter turnout in recent polls has dropped to an abysmally low level?\nNot only did the present Election Commission harm our electoral system, but there are also serious allegations of fiduciary nature against them. This is the first time that such allegations have been made against such a body and its chief. Earlier, when the BNP was in power, the incumbent CEC was forced out of his job\u2014being victimised by the BNP. Later, the Awami League government reinstated him with the rank of a secretary, even though he was a joint secretary when BNP had forced him out. So, there is reasonable ground for him to take a negative view against one party.\nOne may recall that the CEC had made a public commitment about electronic voting machines (EVMs), that they would not be used unless there was political consensus. Yet, when all the opposition parties were opposed to EVMs, he did not keep his words, and went ahead with using the EVMs. The EVMs that we bought do not have any paper trail, making them vulnerable to manipulation. Also, they were bought at a price that was 11 times higher than the ones bought in India (\"EC procures EVMs at 11 times higher than India's price\", October 16, 2018, Prothom Alo). When our EVMs were bought, a technical committee was formed, headed by the late Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury, who refused to endorse the purchase of these EVMs because they did not have paper trails.\nAt first, India too had EVMs that did not have paper trails. But then, the Indian Supreme Court directed the election commission to add paper trails\u2014VVPAT, or Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail. So the Indian election commission had to modify their EVMs. Bangladesh could do that too. In addition, our EVMs are directly under the EC's control, and there is no way to verify any of the election results they give. One example of manipulation could be seen in the Chattogram City Corporation elections, where the result was declared at least twice, according to media reports. I also wrote about it myself. EVMs should not have the scope to publish results twice.\nWhat had happened was that the results that were published on the night of the election were embarrassing\u2014showing the BNP candidate receiving zero votes in 22 centres and so on. So they had to issue a second version. Even the results of the 11th parliamentary elections raised a lot of questions. I, for example, wanted to have the centre-wise election results. In the past, the EC would publish centre-wise election results on its own, but the present EC did not publish them. We tried to talk to them and convince them, but they paid no attention. So I submitted an RTI application. Eventually, after much dillydallying, they published them on their website. When we analysed the centre-wise data, we found that in 213 centres\u2014out of 40,000\u2014there was 100 percent of votes cast, which is impossible because the voter list was created many months prior to the elections, and there were people who had died, people who were out of the country, people who were in jail. Not only that, they even showed a candidate in Chattogram getting zero votes, which they later changed. Centre-wise results showed that the BNP-led alliance got zero votes in 1,177 centres. And even AL got zero votes in two centres.\nIt is unfortunate that the present CEC and three other election commissioners acted in a manner that many may consider less than honourable and that, in my view, was not in the public interest. In fact, I would say, this is the worst election commission we have had in our history.\nJust to illustrate this point: the present commissioners created 15 special designations for themselves\u2014such as special speaker, course adviser, course director, course coordinator, assistant course coordinator\u2014and they got paid for performing these tasks, although they are employed to do these things anyway. Past election commissioners performed the same tasks but never charged extra money for it. Boishakhi Television aired a seven-part series unearthing these irregularities. And a group of 44 citizens, including myself, had written two letters to the president asking for an investigation into this. We gave specific information supporting our allegations, although the burden of proof does not fall on us. But the president did not even acknowledge our letters.\nHowever, I must add, the EC alone cannot hold free and fair elections. If other stakeholders such as the law enforcement agencies and the bureaucracy\u2014that is, the government in power\u2014do not function in a neutral manner, even the strongest EC will not be able to deliver free, fair and credible elections. But it can prevent tainted elections. The Appellate Division of our Supreme Court, in Altaf Hossain vs Abul Kashem case, said that the EC can even \"add to the statutory rules\" for the sake of free and fair elections. So the EC has almost unlimited power to hold fair elections. If the EC realises that it is impossible to hold a fair election, it can always stop the election or cancel the results of tainted elections after an investigation. But this EC did nothing. Even when there were attacks on Dr Kamal Hossain and other opposition leaders, it did not bother to take any action.\nAs we celebrate 50 years of independence, couldn't the Awami League leave a lasting legacy by finally giving the country a law to formulate the EC? What reasons could it have for not doing so?\nWe have moved far away from the spirit of our Liberation War and the guiding principles of our constitution, democracy being one of them. Article 11 of our constitution says that, \"The Republic shall be a democracy...\" Article 59 says that people's rule will be ensured in all administrative units at the local level. We have moved away from these commitments, even though our freedom fighters gave their lives for these ideals, including the right to self-determination of the people.\nThe declaration of our independence pledged that \"it shall be a fundamental aim of the state to realise, through the democratic process, a socialist society free from exploitation and a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.\" This is why we fought our Liberation War. But we have deviated from those ideals. The state is no longer run in the public interest\u2014but in coterie interest. It is no longer run with those principles in mind, but to ensure that whoever is in power, stays in power. So that is why they are not doing it.\nWe as a nation are at a dangerous juncture. There are a lot of disaffection and unhappiness among the people. And this can lure many of our young people towards undesirable, radical paths. In fact, I am not really surprised when I hear that some people support the Taliban and such radical groups, although I find it abhorring. This should be a big red flag for us. When people are disillusioned and unhappy, and they see no way out, they may take extremist routes, seeking religion-based solutions, which will not serve anybody's interest. So I pray and hope that our PM will have the wisdom to make the right decisions and leave behind a legacy that she will be proud of\u2014that all of us can be proud of.\nWhat is your take on the constitutionality of the search committee and the caretaker government?\nThe ruling party says that the EC would be constituted with a search committee. The law minister said that the search committee is close to law\u2014and there is no time to formulate a law. I do not get it. First of all, when it is said that a search committee is close to law, I have to ask, how close? Either it is a law, or it is not. It also does not make sense to claim that there is no time. The ruling party has been in power since 2009, and the law minister himself has been in charge for quite a few years. So what did they do all this time? This was a constitutional mandate. Also, this is a simple law\u2014 three to four pages in length\u2014and it would not take much time.\nThe Dr Shamsul Huda Commission prepared a draft in 2011 before they left office. Based on that draft and using the experiences of other countries, we prepared a draft in a week. So a law could be drafted quickly and opened up to the public for their feedback. There are still several months left to do that. So these excuses that they give do not make any sense. We have already shown that it can be done, and we are willing to help.\nAnother thing the ruling party says is that it wants to abide by the constitution. Well, the election-time government\u2014the caretaker government\u2014is not in the constitution and they do not want to discuss it, and we can understand that, although I have a different view. But a search committee is not in the constitution either. So they are basically cherry-picking. They want to use the constitution when it is in their interest, but avoid it when it is not.\nIn 2011, a parliamentary committee was set up under senior lawmaker Sajeda Chowdhury. This committee, comprising senior leaders, held extensive consultations with different stakeholders. This is what Tofail Ahmed had said at the committee meeting: \"My personal opinion is that it won't be appropriate to change any major aspect of the caretaker government. Even if we do away with the caretaker government, keep it for another two terms. After two terms, if we are in the opposition, then we may have to clamour for it to be brought back\" (\"Which constitution, whose constitution\", October 28, 2013, Prothom Alo).\nAmir Hossain Amu said: \"If we really want to make a change, then a lot of complications will arise. We will get into a lot of hassles. Instead, it is better to just keep it as it is.\" Abdul Matin Khasru, the late law minister, said: \"When we sat down for discussions, we prepared some guidelines which said we won't get into anything that could lead to conflict. I sincerely want to say, the caretaker government system that we have, let's just leave it as it is.\" Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury said: \"We don't need any changes to the caretaker government system right now.\" The late Suranjit Sengupta said: \"In spite of all the limitations, we should proceed with it [caretaker government system].\"\nThe committee \"unanimously\" recommended amending the constitution keeping the caretaker government provision, and went to meet the PM. The change came later. So the chief of the ruling party and head of the executive branch decided to do away with the caretaker government. Not only that, the Appellate Division under Justice Khairul Haque gave a divided short order, where they kept the option to keep the caretaker government, if the parliament wanted to, for two terms. The manner in which the amendment was brought about created a lot of questions that still linger in the public mind.\n",

        "full_article": "The world might look a very different place 10 years from now. If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that nothing can be taken for granted\u2014in life or in business.\nBangladesh's RMG industry entered 2020 primed for further growth. Our main concern as an industry at that time was the unrest around the new minimum wage and workers' rights. While such issues can never be ignored and we must take them seriously, they look like nothing at all compared to the tsunami we as an industry have undergone these past 18 months.\nI won't lie, the first year of the pandemic was extremely tough\u2014as RMG factories and many of our major export markets were in lockdown. It was difficult to get raw materials. Brands and retailers were cancelling orders left, right and centre. And there was a general level of uncertainty and chaos in the air, the likes of which I have not experienced in more than two decades as a business owner.\nIt is only as we have gotten further into 2021 that our industry has begun to find some breathing space. Several things have been in our favour. The first is the global vaccine rollout, which has led to the opening up of major markets and the removal of lockdowns across the US and Europe. The second is the \"bounce\" we have seen as shoppers return to shops and make up for lost time in purchasing clothing. Many are calling this \"revenge\" spending. The last issue is that our rivals in Vietnam and China have had harsher lockdowns of their textile industries than Bangladesh. This, combined with the fact that Myanmar\u2014another competitor\u2014has had a military coup has led to brands and retailers placing more orders with us. In a world of uncertainty, Bangladesh is seen as a \"safe bet\" right now for fashion retailers. We cannot, however, rest on our laurels.\nThroughout this past 18 months, Bangladesh's RMG industry has shown strength in adversity. The relative stability of our political environment coupled with our pragmatic management of the pandemic\u2014allowing factories to remain largely open was a smart move by our industry leaders\u2014means we are well placed to capitalise on future opportunities.\nBut we must use this time to build resilience in our RMG sector and not let our hard-won gains go to waste. To return to the point made at the beginning of this article, none of us can be sure of what is around the corner. A recession in 2022, which some forecasters are predicting, could quickly derail things.\nSo how can we build this resilience in the months ahead? How can we ensure we are prepared for the next crisis or to ride out any future recession?\nI can think of three ways.\nThe first refers to the current situation we find ourselves in. We are picking up extra orders due to complications in the supply chains of some of our competitors. We need to make these orders stick and turn them into long-term business opportunities. We must see it as an important feather in our cap that buyers have turned to us in their hour of need, at a time when all retailers are struggling to secure product in the run up to the festive season.\nAll of us need to go above and beyond to illustrate that Bangladesh is a safe pair of hands\u2014a true thoroughbred when it comes to textile and garment sourcing.\nThe second issue relates to logistics. One thing we have seen in the past few months is how a few small issues in terms of moving cargo about can soon mushroom into much larger ones. A problem in one part of the world can spread like a virus, and supply chains can quickly become unstuck.\nMore than ever, we need to invest in our logistics infrastructure\u2014our roads, our ports, our rail network\u2014to make moving product about slick and seamless. There is talk of a 10-fold increase in the global cost to move a container from one part of the world to another this past 12-months. Nobody can live with this kind of uncertainty long-term. China has been particularly hard hit, but these problems can strike anywhere.\nAll options must be on the table. I was delighted to see the major projects being undertaken by our government recently for upgrading airports, including the construction of a third terminal at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. This will help to meet future demand of air cargo transportation and contribute to further economic growth in Bangladesh. More of this please.\nFinally, we must continue to lead on sustainability in line with the demands of buyers. The presence of Bangladeshi representation at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is critical for our industry. Our buyers, more than ever, are turning to us for solutions to their emission challenges. The environmental crisis will not be solved in the shiny stores of our buyers\u2014for instance, the products in the stores need to be manufactured back in Bangladesh using renewable energy.\nThe solutions lie in resilient, future-proofed, garment supply chains.\nWe know what we need to do.\nMostafiz Uddin is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

        "full_article": "Amid all the development that Bangladesh has been witnessing of late, it may be hard to believe that there are still villages where people are deprived of basic facilities, such as education and healthcare, or bridges over the rivers flowing through those villages. Over the years, this daily has published a number of stories of such neglected villages, where development seems like an unknown word. One such report, published on Monday, revealed the predicament of the people of seven villages at Mokna union in Nagarpur upazila, Tangail. For decades, with no concrete bridge over one of the branches of the Dhaleswari River connecting these villages, the villagers have been suffering on a daily basis.\nAt present, there is a fragile bamboo bridge over the river that the villagers themselves built three years ago. Every day, commuters including school and college students use the bridge to go to their destinations. Since it is built on the road that connects the Upazila Headquarters with the seven villages, people heading to the headquarters for various purposes have no other option but to cross the bridge. In the absence of a concrete bridge, they often have to cross the river by small boats. It is particularly difficult for the locals to take emergency patients to the upazila health complex, while farmers also face difficulties to carry their produce to the nearby markets.\nThe villagers reportedly raised the issue to the local administration several times, and were given the assurance that a permanent bridge would be constructed there. Unfortunately, that promise has yet to materialise.\nWe urge the authorities concerned to look into the matter and direct the responsible departments to take necessary measures to build a concrete bridge in Mokna union as early as possible. Once built, this small bridge would not only make the lives of the villagers easy by improving communication, but will also create scopes for better trade and business, enhancing the villagers' economic condition. As we have already said, there are many such neglected villages, especially in regions where poverty is traditionally high with fewer economic opportunities. Any development work undertaken there may not make big headlines, but this is where development is most needed. We hope the government will pay equal attention to their development by building the necessary infrastructure, so that these people are included in our overall development drive.\n",

        "full_article": "It is extremely disheartening that, amid the increased economic struggles of people due to the pandemic, the prices of essential commodities have continued to remain high in Bangladesh's kitchen markets. One would have expected the government to address this issue more urgently. In fact, given that prices of certain commodities have historically gone up during this time of year, the government should have pre-empted this by taking appropriate measures before prices shot up to such heights. What is more disappointing is that, in the case of certain commodities, the price hike seems to be completely unjustified\u2014the result of traders trying to exploit consumers to make exorbitant profits.\nTake the price of onions, for instance. Traders have been trying to blame its rising price on disruptive weather in India. What is interesting, however, is that right after the five percent import duty on onions was withdrawn on Thursday, its price came down from around Tk 80-85 per kg to Tk 60-65, even though it takes at least four to five days to bring onion through the land port from India\u2014which means traders lowered its price even before they could possibly import more of it. This is a clear example of how traders are exploiting the increased prices of certain commodities in the international market to raise prices of all commodities in the local market.\nThe government has time and again acknowledged the existence of syndicates trying to take advantage of any crisis and raise commodity prices. But what has it done to root out such syndicates? As far as we can tell, its actions have been wholly inadequate, and it is the consumers who always suffer as a result of such failures. Moreover, when it comes to certain commodities such as onion and sugar, the government consulted with traders to fix an appropriate rate for them to sell these commodities, which the traders are not adhering to. So, on what basis were the prices set, if they are not enough for traders to sell the items at and make profit? All these questions have to be answered by the relevant authorities.\nAt the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that commodity prices remain stable and affordable for people. For this, the government has plenty of resources and personnel. If prices are in danger of rising due to supply issues in the international market, the government should have taken counter measures to address them. Unfortunately, it has once again failed to do that. Now it must urgently provide direct support to people who are struggling to even meet their daily nutritional needs. Additionally, it should investigate why state officials once again failed to control prices of essential commodities during this time of crisis for the people.\n",
