Democracy flourishes when there is reconciliation through legislative debate. Yet, adversarial relations resulting in confrontation following the lack of discourse over differences on issues of public import, speak poorly of legislative conduct. This holds true of Kerala, where legislative business has come to a standstill after a severe deterioration in relations between the ruling coalition and the Opposition. What began as an issue of the Speaker repeatedly disallowing discussion on Rule 50 notices by the Opposition United Democratic Front last week has grown into a full-blown confrontation, with legal cases being filed against legislators after incidents that resulted in a ruckus in the Assembly. A case can be made that it ill behoves the Opposition to resort to parodying Assembly proceedings after the Speaker\u2019s denials or to protest in an unparliamentary way against the Chair, currently held by A.N. Shamseer. But the onus is on the Speaker and the ruling front to ensure that the Opposition\u2019s legislative privilege to have discussions on pressing issues is respected and allowed. Clearly, the repeated denial of discussions on Rule 50 notices and the filing of serious legal cases against Opposition members have only deepened the confrontation. Other grievances expressed by the Opposition that their legislators do not get sufficient play on Sabha TV, the official broadcaster, also seem to have merit.On Monday, the Speaker struck a conciliatory note by expunging remarks made by him against a Congress legislator. He also assured the Opposition that he would uphold their rights that included the privilege to move Rule 50 notices on matters of \u201cvital public importance\u201d and ensure that the Assembly broadcaster was non-partisan. This should be the cue for both sides to begin a dialogue leading to the reversal of vituperative legal actions and the resumption of normal legislative discourse. Kerala is India\u2019s bellwether on socio-economic issues, but it faces unique challenges as an ecologically fragile State that has to work on a balance between development and ecological sustainability, as the Brahmapuram fire incident also exemplified. Healthy discussion and debate over ideas, even if adversarial, would go a long way in ensuring good governance by keeping the LDF government on its toes. How the ruling coalition and, by extension, the Chief Minister, responds to the Opposition\u2019s call for non-partisan conduct of legislative proceedings will determine the course of normalisation of relations between the two fronts in the State.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nKerala\n\n/\n\npolitics\n\n/\n\ndemocracy",

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated a global conference on millets, extolling them as the \u201cdoor to prosperity\u201d for India\u2019s marginal farmers, the \u201ccornerstone of nutrition\u201d, and as a potential ally against \u201cclimate change\u201d. The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Budget speech in February, singled them out as \u2018Shree Anna\u2019 \u2014 roughly translated as the \u2018best among grains\u2019 \u2014 adding that the Indian Institute of Millets Research in Hyderabad would be supported as a centre of excellence.Millets such as sorghum, bajra and ragi are strongly linked to Indian dietary traditions, which is why the country has for long been the largest producer of millets in the world. It is no surprise that this cereal family is popular because it is energy dense, can be grown with ease in arid soils and, relative to grains such as rice, wheat and maize, is less susceptible to pests. Why such a \u2018super food\u2019 got sidelined by the Green Revolution of the 1960s in favour of rice and wheat has little to do with nutrition and more with the development of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat, that produced twice or thrice per acre. Coupled with guaranteed procurement by the government, the rice-wheat combination enabled India to be food secure even in droughts and climate blights. However, this food security came at a cost such as the wanton exploitation of groundwater, a surfeit of pesticide-use, and ossified systems of grain production and procurement that, over the years, is decreasingly remunerative for the average farmer. With average global incomes having risen since the 1960s and rising demand for \u2018sustainable agriculture\u2019, India is looking to market millet as a global panacea. However, competing with the global rice-wheat-maize troika, which according to the Food and Agriculture Organization constitutes 89% of global cereal production, means that millet production must be many times more remunerative than now. Hybrid varieties of jowar and bajra exist, and that yields have not dramatically risen in decades despite this means that it would be unrealistic to expect quantum jumps in yield from technological tweaks alone. Dietary shifts are slow processes and promoting certain grains as \u2018superior\u2019 or inferior is self-defeating as it ignores the economics of production and promotes cycles of hype \u2014 as seen in cash crops. This can have consequences for marginal farmers. Letting all grains grow and helping a wider base of consumers access the cereal they want is a more sustainable enterprise.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nAgriculture\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\ndiet (health)\n\n/\n\nagricultural research and technology\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nUnion Budget",

After a slowish takeoff, today its power is writ large across the entire higher education ecosystem. At universities and colleges, an impending NAAC visit sets off a tense flurry of activities from literally whitewashing to non-stop faculty conferencing. For students and parents, it can be the most influential guide for where to seek admissions. But as complaints mount about this accreditation system\u2019s unreliability and corruption, UGC and the education ministry must stop watching from the sidelines. Step in and fix the rot.\nFrom a little-known deemed university beating IISc to the top to another deemed university incredibly jumping five grades between two NAAC assessments to a private university receiving the highest achievable grade within just over a handful of\u00a0 years of establishment, the assessments themselves have been screaming for a closer look. This month Bhushan Patwardhan stepped down as chair of the NAAC executive committee while highlighting the awarding of questionable grades. At the same time the Joreel committee has listed how data verification is not following any scientific method, which is damning for a process built upon self-assessment by institutions. Even worse, more opacity rather than transparency is being built into the system.\nAs it is, the need to overhaul NAAC to meet current needs has been obvious for some time. It assesses outcomes poorly. It gives institutions credits for papers they say they have published without quizzing them on research connections with industry or patents won or new products/processes devised \u2013 as other international ranking agencies would be wont to. When the demands on education are changing rapidly, with game-changing AI inroads being one example, a static evaluation rubric can as likely do harm as good. Now add corruption to the mix, with subpar institutes wheedling better grades than their better teaching peers. Building systems to assess what is not easily measurable can take time.

        "full_article": "The suspicious handling of a suspected mastermind behind a series of highway robberies involving export-bound RMG products has once again highlighted how highway safety, particularly that of cargo trucks, is still ignored by the authorities. The mastermind in question is Md Shahed alias Sayeed, who was arrested in 2021 for his involvement in the theft of RMG products on their way to the Chattogram port. According to a police statement then, Shahed led highway gangs that stole apparel products from at least 5,000 lorries for around two decades. Yet, in a recently submitted charge sheet in one of the cases filed in this connection, he was downgraded to \"accused no. 7\" among a group of eight.\nThe question is, why would police go against their own statement? Why would they submit a charge sheet without naming a mastermind? On the face of it, this seems to be an example of weaknesses in the investigative process. A criminal lawyer told\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0that recovery of the stolen goods and confessional statements from other accused robbers would have been sufficient to prove whether Shahed was the mastermind. But as we know from experience, flawed investigations are often down to underhand dealings, where investigators show leniency in exchange for bribe, etc. But there is a bigger issue at play here: the threat that unchecked cargo theft poses to our RMG industry, which must ship products on time and in full.\nLast month, the BGMEA president also highlighted the problem at a press conference, saying about 20-22 cases of theft occurred on the Dhaka-Chattogram highway in 2022 alone. This, according to him, is posing a serious threat to the RMG sector. \"There are gangs who are committing the same crime over and over again and getting away with them without any punishment,\" he said, adding that often they are abetted by dishonest employees of the industry, buying houses, shipping lines and C&F agents. He also called for severe penalties for organised cargo thieves, amending the law if necessary.\nThe recommendation for amending the law deserves consideration. According to police and Rab, there are about 10-12 gangs involved in stealing \"30-40 percent\" of the apparel products, mainly from major consignments, carried to the Chattogram port for shipment. As well as RMG products, cargos of other kinds and passenger buses are also vulnerable on the highways. This is clearly an organised crime, yet miscreants behind cargo theft are charged with \"regular theft\", which is a bailable offence with a maximum punishment of three years in jail. They usually secure bail within days of their arrest, and get back to the crime.\nWe must put an end to this cycle. We urge the authorities to take this issue seriously and improve highway security.

        "full_article": "Recently, our State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid has said that Bangladesh does not have much unexplored gas and that this is why we need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG). But this statement contradicts reality.\nFirst, his comment contradicts the findings of surveys done by different foreign organisations in the past. According to the last report by Gustavson Associates published in 2010, Bangladesh has at least 38 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of undiscovered gas. Even the government's own gas sector master plan of 2017 (published in 2018), prepared by Denmark-based engineering consulting company Ramboll, acknowledged the 2010 findings to recommend investment in gas discovery.\nSecond, the government has not invested sufficient effort into discovering potential reserves over the last 15 years. Without conducting surveys and drilling, refusing to recognise past findings is akin to evading accountability.\nThird, different news reports and research findings have informed us of the huge amounts of unexplored gas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and in Sylhet, Bhola, and Shariatpur districts. The government has already taken initiatives to explore some of these areas. As such, does the state minister's comment on our gas reserves not contradict the government's own gas exploration initiatives?\nIn the gas sector master plan of 2017, it was recommended that the government should not spend money to import costly LNG and should explore indigenous gas instead. The plan estimated that Bangladesh would have to spend $3 billion by 2030 to import LNG, while exploration of indigenous gas resources will be much more cost-effective.\nHowever, we haven't seen much initiative from the government to do so. After the gas crisis hit the country last year, Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited (Bapex) urgently started exploring new gas fields. The government's proactive role instantly made it obvious how neglected our gas exploration activities have been in the past. After the crisis began, Bapex drilled nine wells and saved at least Tk 1 lakh crore on LNG import by spending only Tk 812 crore. This means that Bapex can extract gas at a much lower cost, whereas buying LNG from the spot market requires huge amounts of forex reserves.\n\nEven if the government can import LNG from the spot market at a relatively lower price than what it is during times of peak demand, there is no guarantee that the price would not increase in the future. Therefore, it is not sustainable to rely on LNG imports for ensuring energy security.\nThe increasing import dependency over the last decade is at the root of our current energy crisis. This dependence will only increase if we continue to become dependent on imported coal and LNG. The Rooppur nuclear power plant itself involves massive import of technology and fuel.\nThis year, the Rampal power plant has already started to supply electricity to the grid. Although the government had informed us that the per unit cost of electricity would be Tk 8, recently we found out that the cost is Tk 14-15. Electricity from Adani's Godda coal power plant is also being supplied to our grid at high costs. So, we are still implementing the plans we made in 2010.\nThe master plan seems to have been developed more to serve the interests of producers and technology suppliers than to ensure energy security. As a response to external shocks, our energy security is now at peril because when the dollar crisis came about, the import-dependent energy sector was hit first. Sadly, the wide range of discussions held on these issues recently could not stop the government from pursuing plans it had already committed to, such as power plant constructions and the imbalanced contract with Adani.\nNow, traders and businessmen are worried about whether they will get enough gas after paying the increased prices. Their concerns have valid grounds, too.\nThe government's new projects are facing a crisis due to our declining forex reserves. We recently saw that it delayed paying to import coal for Payra. There was also a delay in producing electricity at the Rampal power plant due to coal import payment having to be in US dollars. Under these circumstances, businesses are losing faith in the government's ability to pay for imported LNG from the spot market. Recently, the LNG price has come down to $14 and the government is planning to import it from the spot market.\nEven if the government can import LNG from the spot market at a relatively lower price than what it is during times of peak demand, there is no guarantee that the price would not increase in the future. Therefore, it is not sustainable to rely on LNG imports for ensuring energy security. What we need to do instead is explore our own gas resources. There is no alternative to discovering new gas fields and starting gas exploration. It is in no way believable or acceptable that we do not have any gas left.\nMoreover, offshore exploration has bright prospects in the country, but we are yet to explore our offshore blocks. While Myanmar has already discovered some offshore gas blocks, we have not conducted any proper surveys yet. Experts think that there is huge potential in deep sea blocks because the blocks of Myanmar and Bangladesh share similar geological structures. ExxonMobil has proposed a production sharing contract (PSC) to do surveys on the deep sea blocks, and the government is considering this proposal.\nThe price of gas as per the current PSC is $2.75. The new contract may offer around $10. Bangladesh's share of profit gas might also go down from between 55 percent to 80 percent down to 40 percent to 70 percent. No matter what, we can guess that signing a PSC with any foreign companies will only allow them to take control of our indigenous resources.\nTo say that we do not have the capacity to explore offshore blocks is illogical. No country in the world starts exploration after developing their capacity, they build it through their efforts and a slow process of technology transfer. A company like India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) itself outsources its tasks to other companies abroad. Bangladesh can develop its capacity by outsourcing some tasks, retaining overall control over management, developing its regulatory institutions and human resources, and closely engaging in the technology transfer process.\nWe have previously seen how the government expressed doubts about Bapex's capacity to explore new gas fields and how it hired foreign companies like Gazprom to spend three times more money. This approach proved to be unsustainable. Instead of being dependent on foreign companies for gas exploration, we should establish our own control over the sector in order to ensure true energy security.\nMoshahida Sultana Ritu\u00a0is associate professor of Economics at the Department of Accounting and Information Systems, University of Dhaka.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The horrific crash that killed 19 people on the Dhaka-Bhanga expressway on Sunday highlights nearly all the problems with our road transport system. Firstly, the bus which smashed through a highway fence and plunged into a ditch should never have been on the road in the first place. Having been involved in another serious accident only four months ago \u2013 which killed three people and injured 15 others \u2013 the bus had its registration and route permit suspended by the authorities. Its fitness permit also expired on January 18. Yet, the owner of the vehicle kept it running. All this exposes the serious lack of enforcement of rules by the relevant government agencies, including the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the highway police.\nBRTA authorities have reportedly said that they do not have the manpower to check whether all vehicles plying on the roads have proper documentations. Such excuses to escape responsibility for tragic consequences seem to have become the norm among government officials and agencies, but at what cost? The number of lives that continue to be lost as a result of unfit vehicles or drivers keeps piling up. Who will answer for them? As one expert has said, the highway police should be well aware of the fact that early mornings are risky hours and, therefore, should strengthen monitoring at that time. But such steps should be taken before accidents happen although, in our case, they are usually not taken even after so many tragic deaths.\nEven though the cause of the latest crash has not been confirmed yet, witnesses alleged that the bus was speeding. Other suspected reasons include a punctured tyre \u2013 which could have been avoided had the vehicle gone through proper fitness testing \u2013 or the driver falling asleep at the wheel. Given the inhumane working hours that drivers of passenger vehicles in our country are forced to endure, despite the Road Transport Act 2018 clearly stating that drivers cannot drive for more than five straight hours or a total of eight hours a day, such accidents are, in fact, just waiting to happen.\nAt the heart of it all is the enduring problem of lack of enforcement of relevant rules by the authorities. For any improvement to take place, road safety campaigners and experts say, there must first be a shift in the business-as-usual attitude of those in charge of the transport sector, including the top brass at the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges. Yet, nothing seems to change.\nTheir continued apathy and dereliction despite the loss of so many lives can only be considered criminal. This must be fixed before anything else. Responsible agencies and officers must be held accountable for their repeated failure to do their job. As for the Dhaka-Bhanga expressway tragedy, the authorities must punish the vehicle owner for flouting suspensions and keeping the bus running. We don't need exemplary punishment; we need regularly meted out punishment in light of the law so that transport owners/drivers know better than to breach it. There is no alternative to enforcing the law properly, evenly and regularly.\n",

        "full_article": "Sunday's Dhaka-Bhanga Expressway accident at a place called Kutubpur of Madaripur's Shibchar is the deadliest ever since the inauguration of the Padma Bridge and the expressway. Following the ritualistic pattern of pointing accusing fingers at the many lapses such as indifference to and wilful violation of legal bindings, mechanical failure and human errors, in this case also a number of causes behind the accident have been advanced by survivors of the tragedy, the highway police and experts. But the tragic fact is that the 19 people who lost their lives and the 27 wounded ---some of them severely at risk of dying ---will not return or lead a normal life. Apart from the bursting of tyre, all the other reasons cited were preventable if the whole system of transport operation and its management was right. Even if the tyre gave in, the passenger bus should not have knocked the guardrails and fell 100 feet below to crash into the wall of the underpass. In fact the expressway is the most modern of its kind and one has to be lax or suicidal in order to get involved in a serious accident. It is because of this, the loss of so many lives and injury to even more passengers are inconsolable. Why come up with all the information now after the accident that the registration and route permit of the bus have remained suspended following an earlier accident on November 17, in which it rammed into a standing sand-laden truck from behind in Gopalganj? This means the bus was operating illegally and how could it do so for months. Isn't it the traffic police's duty to ensure that the bus is taken off the road? Here the bus company did not change its name but report has it that Suprobhat Paribahan, banned along with Jabal-e-Noor following killing of students, started operating its fleet under the disguise of Victor Classic and Akash. A five-member BRTA committee found that only 18 out of 163 buses had valid documents and cancelled the company's registration in 2019. Banned or suspended vehicles can run on routes if there is an unholy nexus of some members of the different agencies in charge of enforcement of traffic rules and regulations. In the case of the expressway accident, the bus could not be on the road in the first place. People assigned to monitor if a banned or suspended vehicle, particularly one involved in an accident only four months back is running, cannot avoid responsibility for the tragedy. The highway police claims the bus was running above the 80-kilometre limit. What are the patrol police on duty doing then? Another highly important issue concerns the required rest for drivers on long route. A contemporary reports that the driver was drowsy at the time on account of his duty for 30 hours out of 48. Under the Road Transport Act 2018, a driver must not drive more than five hours at a stretch and there should be two of them on long routes. In this latest case, the driver was exhausted from five trips to Pirojpur and Khulna from Dhaka. Apart from drivers of a few leading and luxurious bus companies, most of them are overworked and become potential sacrificial goats in such accidents. Sound transport laws are of little use unless those are enforced in letter and spirit.",

        "full_article": "Despite being the producer of one of the finest varieties of jute, Bangladesh has yet to enjoy a handsome share of jute exports. Similar is the case with jute products. To speak forthrightly, the export of Bangladesh jute and the goods made of the fibre experienced a decline in 2022. Export of jute and jute goods declined by 11 per cent to $406.60 million during July-November 2022. The export of raw jute, jute yarn, twine and jute carpet etc experienced a downward trend in the period. Once it was indisputably recognised that fancy items made of jute had been set to conquer the overseas markets. It was because myriad types of Bangladesh-made products had to pass muster with many a local test. They passed the tests in style by excelling the rival countries as they showcased similar items.True, the Bangladesh jute products couldn't retain their position of glory. But thanks to their unique style of artistry and uniqueness they were able to leave a lasting imprint on the minds of their connoisseurs. The fact is the export market, be it one of jute or jute products or of frozen fish, is dispassionate. One has to carve out one's place in the sector, and put in their best of efforts to retain it. It's time Bangladesh kept this plain truth in mind if it wants to survive in the 21st century jute export market. While opening a 5-day multipurpose jute goods exhibition at the city's Shilpakala Academy on March 12, Textiles and Jute Minister Golam Dastagir Gazi underscored, quite naturally, the holding of jute goods fair regularly to expand their market at home and abroad. He emphasised more exhibitions would help expand markets of diversified jute products, stressing the imperative of exploring new destinations for exporting jute goods.The older-generation jute goods failed to attract clients at home and abroad thanks to their coarseness and lack of professional finishing. Taking this opportunity, the rival countries continued to march ahead of Bangladesh. Amazingly, Bangladesh has no dearth of craftsmen excelling in making fanciful jute products. Apart from fancy goods, home decoration items, carpets, door mats, bags, toys, and, even shoes etc have already proved their market strength in both traditional and non-traditional overseas markets. A challenge the Bangladesh products face at these points of export is aggressive marketing of the rival countries. In the present-day world, Bangladesh has to make its way through a number of other jute-producing countries like India and those in the Far East and Southeast Asia. The world's leading jute-growing countries at present are India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand. India is the present world's largest producer of raw jute and jute goods. It contributes to over 50 per cent and 40 per cent respectively of global production. Decades ago this enviable position used to be held by Bangladesh.The drop in jute cultivation in the country occurred for many reasons. The decline in profits from jute growing compared to other crops like rice, its abrupt fall in global jute market, climate adversities are some of the reasons. Moreover, the multi-pronged aggression of plastic and polythene products, like sacks, bags etc also played a vital role in the cornering of jute in the world market of fibre products. Thanks to their so-called strength, user-friendliness and other benefits the synthetic sacks eventually began to be preferred by clients to gunny bags and the other products made of jute and hessian. In spite of the temporary fall in the biodegradable fibres like jute, in course of time the goods made of natural fibres staged a comeback in a remarkably big way. But the growers and traders of jute had to remain prepared to say goodbye to the golden days of jute and other fibres like hemp.Thanks to the shops being filled with synthetic, meaning non-biodegradable, products they are not likely to go back to the days of natural fibre. Attempts to innovate superbly finished fibre products may go on. Fabrics or hard and flexible jute-made objects may flood the market. But they are feared to suffer from limitations. Green activists are expected to step into this dilemmatic situation. They have long been waging a global battle against plastic and non-biodegradable materials. To their woes, the campaigns in favour of jute and similar substances proved mostly ineffective. Upon seeing a fall in the demand of products made of natural fibre, incentives being given to jute cultivators witnessed periodical cuts. It has prompted many jute-growers in poorer coutries to turn to profitable crops. In reality, lobbyists of plastic product industries are formidably stronger than the green platforms. In spite of these depressing developments, the activists do not leave the scene. Many believe it is the assertive role of the green activists advocating the use of jute which plays a strong role in the survival of jute in the industries. The jute fibre may not be around in the distant future in the face of onslaughts coming from the synthetic objects; but their complete disappearance may take a long time. Jute and other natural fibres are expected to stay on; because stronger pro-jute camps may emerge upon detecting newer hazards in widespread plastic use.Many people belonging to the platform of the 'brave new world' dream of a time without the natural fibres. They are highly optimistic about the invention of synthetic fibres which might emerge biodegradable sometime in the future. But there are also the pragmatic segments of people, who dismiss these high dreams as mere fantasies. In the meantime, the genuine race to innovate superfine natural fabric from jute to manufacture user-friendly products may not see a break.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The tiny coral-rich island, the St. Martin's, located close to the southernmost tip of Bangladesh, Teknaf, is facing an existential crisis. As with climate change, it is again human action, greed, to be specific, that is playing its part. This beautiful piece of land in the sea with its abundant flora and fauna, its unique biodiversity and ecosystem that has evolved over the millennia may one day disappear. For people have bought or grabbed the island's land and built hotels, resorts and cottages where tourists can stay. And tourists, as usual, pollute the island's environment by dumping used plastic water bottles, food packets, polythene bags, cigarette butts, you name it, on the island. Government buildings, too, have sprung up on the island for official as well as business purposes. None of those buildings, whether private or government-owned, were erected after getting clearance from the Department of Environment (DoE). In any case, the DoE could not have issued any clearance certificate for erecting those structures on the island simply because the government declared the island an ecologically critical area (ECA) in 1999. Saint Martin's has been getting smaller since long. And that may be due to natural causes such as cyclones or erosion of corals. Of some 176 diverse species of flora and fauna the island is home to, many have already become extinct. Sea turtles are vanishing, for light and sound pollution from the seaside resorts is driving away the mother turtles from the sandy nests on the island close to the sea beach where they lay their eggs. Snails, oysters, seaweeds, the green top cover of the island are also vanishing in a similar fashion. If humans are allowed to indulge in whatever way they want, then the process of the island's sinking below the sea will only be accelerated. St. Martin's Island is one of the 13 ecologically critical areas of the country. It must be protected. Otherwise, the intricate ecosystem of the entire deltaic plain, that is Bangladesh, might be irreversibly damaged. The DoE, without any power to implement its directives, can only declare that certain places are ecologically vulnerable and should be protected. In that case, the district and upazila administrations under whose jurisdiction the St. Martin's Island lies need to act to stop illegal building activities on the island. Also, they should control the number of tourists visiting the island. The number of ferries or ships shuttling between the mainland and the island carrying visitors and the frequency of the trips, too, have to be limited. Immediate steps need to be taken to implement the measures. The government, or the tourism authority, for that matter, should not treat the island purely as a cash cow. According to reports, hotels, resorts, restaurants, etc (some 230 of them) have been operating on the island and their numbers are increasing fast. It is time the government put its foot down and stopped further growth of such illegal structures on the island. Most importantly, the government itself should set example by not erecting any structure or engaging in any business activities on the island. Otherwise, private entrepreneurs won't listen to any government advice on the matter. Political and social elites including retired government officials have been buying lands on the island. And as reports go, everything is going on with the connivance of the district administration and the DoE. If true, that is scandalous! To all appearances, St. Martin's Island is beyond the reach of the law.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Road accidents are a leading cause of death in Bangladesh. Despite taking some measures, we seem to have failed to curb these tragic incidents. Recently, at least 19 people were killed and many others were injured after a bus plunged into a roadside ditch in Shibchar upazila of Madaripur. According to the media, the main reason behind this accident was the bus driver's inability to control its speed. This horrific accident should be a wake-up call for us since it shows the dangers of travelling by bus on the highways. Experts say that not driving at the right speed is one of the causes of road accidents. According to Accident Research Institute (ARI) of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), at least 84 per cent of all road accidents are caused by high-speed driving. Most of our drivers do not have any formal training to drive vehicles on the roads and highways. And oftentimes, they keep violating traffic rules. As a result frequent accidents occur on our highways causing hundreds of deaths every year. What is further worrying is that most of these drivers start driving without any valid driving licence. Unlicensed drivers are naturally unskilled and are most likely to be in trouble while driving. The authorities concerned should make sure that any person aspiring to be a driver must not sit at the steering without proper professional training on driving. Moreover, more driving schools should be set up so that we can get more trained drivers. The government should also form a committee to make sure that all the public buses are fit for operating on the highways. \nMuhammad Abdun-Noor Awsaf, Student of Department of Geography and Environment, Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Savar, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
