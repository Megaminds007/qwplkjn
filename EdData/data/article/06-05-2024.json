His grandfather, grandmother, and mother were among those who represented this constituency, located around 80 km south-east of the State capital Lucknow. Mr. Gandhi had lost the adjoining Amethi constituency in 2019, even as he won Wayanad in Kerala. He is seeking re-election in Wayanad, and had to decide whether to contest at all from the Hindi heartland and, if so, whether it had to be Rae Bareli or Amethi. He chose Rae Bareli, which was won by his mother Sonia Gandhi in 2019, who is now a member of the Rajya Sabha. A family loyalist has been fielded in Amethi. Mr. Gandhi has been vocal about his liking for Wayanad, and waited for voting there before the candidacy in Rae Bareli was announced. This reeks of a scheme, perhaps unintended, but certainly avoidable. A forthright and early decision would have been more appropriate for his stature, and respectful towards the electorates. His sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has emerged as an impactful campaigner for the Congress across the country, chose not to contest, while her husband Robert Vadra\u2019s embarrassing public demand for the party ticket has been overlooked by the party, and rightly so.Mr. Gandhi has declared that resisting the BJP\u2019s Hindutva politics and advancement of social justice are his life\u2019s mission. That battle is being fought primarily in the Hindi belt and the western region of the country. Electorally and ideologically, the BJP derives its strength from those regions. While the BJP is focused in its efforts to expand in the south, the Congress is confused in its strategy to regain its lost glory in the Hindi States. By deciding to contest from Kerala in 2019, Mr. Gandhi made a strategic mistake of seeking refuge in a comfort zone. He had the opportunity to correct it by returning to the tough battle in U.P. this time, but he kept vacillating. Though it has been not done in the best manner, his entry could enthuse the Opposition in U.P. The Congress is in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) in U.P., and the decision of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav to contest the election from Kannauj could also help the alliance. Considering the dominance of the BJP in the Hindi belt, the Congress faces an uphill task. In the event of winning both Wayanad and Rae Bareli, Mr. Gandhi must retain the latter and make it clear that he is in the ideological war with the BJP for the longer term.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n/\n\nRahul Gandhi\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nAmethi",

The constituencies in Jammu have already voted in the first and second phases while elections have been postponed from the third to the sixth phase in the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency. While the turnout in Udhampur (68.27%) and Jammu (72.22%) were encouraging and more or less in line with the participation figures of 2019, it would be an achievement for Indian democracy if voters turned out in good numbers in constituencies in the Kashmir Valley. The turnout figures for Srinagar (14.43%), Anantnag (8.49%) and Baramulla (34.6%) were among the lowest in the country. This was largely due to a sense of disillusionment among the electorate over the dissolution of the erstwhile State\u2019s Assembly. Since 2019, the Valley has been subject to persistent central rule that has led to phases of severe repression followed by attempts to rejig its polity and electoral map. The abrogation of special status for the erstwhile State and the continuance of J&K as a UT have not helped reverse the alienation. But the polls could provide a platform for the disenchanted electorate to air their grievances in the form of a decisive mandate.The enduring distrust between the Kashmiri polity and New Delhi also explains why the traditional parties in the former have sought to oppose the postponement of the polls in the Anantnag-Rajouri seat, ostensibly due to weather conditions. But the mainstream Kashmiri polity including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (NC) that came together with others to form the People\u2019s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration could not unite and contest as one in the Lok Sabha elections. The NC and PDP have revived their political hostilities in the Valley; the former is in alliance with the Congress as part of the INDIA bloc. As for the Bharatiya Janata Party, its triumphal talk of \u201cunifying\u201d the country by abrogating J&K\u2019s special status sounds hollow: it has limited its contest to the Hindu-majority Jammu and Buddhist-majority Ladakh. In Ladakh, the campaign led by activist Sonam Wangchuk has brought the question of Statehood and environmental concerns to the fore. But that has not been enough to rev up the Opposition. The Congress and NC could not come up with a consensus candidate for the Ladakh constituency that includes the Leh and Kargil areas, leading to the Congress fielding a candidate from Leh, while the Kargil units of both parties are supporting an independent from that area.\nRead Comments \nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\n\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n/\n\nGeneral Elections 2024\n\n/\n\nelection\n\n/\n\nvoting\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nalliances and coalition\n\n/\n\nJammu and Kashmir National Conference\n\n/\n\nPeoples Democratic Party",

But there\u2019s a case to take a closer look at his messy observations. He attributed America\u2019s economic strength to its welcoming of immigrants. He\u2019s right. America is still the most sought-after destination for immigrants.\nAlways churning |\u00a0US is technologically the most consequential country. A look at Silicon Valley and other hotspots of technology there shows the beneficial spillovers of a system that\u2019s a magnet for the world\u2019s best and the brightest. It\u2019s just not Indian-origin CEOs who stand out. Even entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jensen Huang of Nvidia chose US to pursue their dreams.\n\nThis is the most important takeaway from Biden\u2019s clumsy communication. A system that holds the promise of allowing anyone a chance to realise their dream will always be competitive, notwithstanding social discord. That\u2019s the lesson for xenophobes in US politics.\nAging without appeal |\u00a0Japan\u2019s median age is close to 50, while that of China and Russia is close to 40. Japan and Russia collectively have a few million migrant workers. But that\u2019s just a controlled flow to offset demographics. Hardly any driven youngster seeks to move there to realise a dream. The odds are stacked against them, and against authoritarian China too.\nIndia\u2019s chance |\u00a0India\u2019s evolution is different. It didn\u2019t have the economy to be a global magnet. Yet, it sheltered millions of refugees in 1971 during Bangladesh\u2019s liberation. India is today hamstrung by the absence of a refugee policy. But if there\u2019s a bigger lesson for us: it\u2019s to create an environment that not just retains talent but also attracts it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are alarmed by the government's decision to follow up its March energy price hike with three more raises this year, especially at a time when inflation is at its highest in more than a decade. After raising energy prices several times last year, the government again increased prices in March. Worryingly still, prices are likely to be increased in four rounds next year as the government plans to withdraw energy subsidies altogether in accordance with the IMF's $4.7 billion loan condition.\nThe issue here, as we understand it, is the government's poor revenue collection. As it struggles to increase revenue, it feels it has no other option but to cut back costs. But repeatedly increasing power prices will badly affect businesses, which are already complaining about having to struggle to keep up with foreign competitors amid escalating costs. And since power prices will further decrease people's disposable income, domestic demand will continue to drop, further adding to their woes. This may significantly worsen the economy and negatively impact growth.\nConsumers, too, will be hammered by the price hikes. As power prices together with living costs continue to rise, while incomes remain stagnant, people will have no alternative but to further cut expenditures. And while higher power prices will affect all, it will hit the poor much harder. Given that lower-income groups have already reduced consumption of even essential food items, how are they supposed to be able to pay higher electricity bills? Did the government take all these factors into consideration when taking such an untimely decision?\nTo cut back on costs, the government should have renegotiated with the private power plants to reduce its absurd capacity charge payments\u2014which are reportedly taking up 81 percent of the energy subsidies. But instead of doing that, its decision to put the burden on businesses and consumers is totally ridiculous. This just goes to show the lack of transparency and accountability in the sector which has had an abysmal impact on the economy.\nIf the government wants to do away with subsidies, it should start by removing all capacity charge payments to private power plants first. It's decision to do otherwise shows how policymaking has been captured by special interests. The government must stop surrendering to vested interests and reverse its decision. Power price hike is only acceptable if the government fixes all such issues draining its coffers and bring much-needed transparency and accountability in the sector.\n",

        "full_article": "Recently, the European Parliament approved the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), moving it one step closer to formal adoption by the European Union. The CSDDD, once adopted, will create a legal liability for companies in relation to environmental and human rights violations within their global supply chains.\nThere has been a huge discussion about the CSDDD in Western media, with concerns raised that it has been significantly watered down from the initial proposal. But what is this directive/legislation, and how will it impact Bangladesh's garment manufacturers?\nThe CSDDD actually represents a significant regulatory initiative by the EU to promote sustainable business practices across various industries, including the garment sector. At its core, it mandates that large companies operating within the EU take active steps to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for the adverse impacts of their operations on human rights and the environment. It is built on the principle that businesses should be proactive in their sustainability efforts, rather than reactive or merely compliant with existing norms.\nThe regulation covers a number of areas. In terms of due diligence requirements, it means that companies are required to conduct due diligence processes to assess and address the risks associated with their business operations and their entire supply chain. It also means looking into how their products are made, where materials are sourced, and the working conditions in factories, among other factors. All have obvious implications for manufacturers, particularly with regard to the rights of garment workers, which are a contentious issue throughout Asia.\nTransparency is also a crucial aspect of the CSDDD. The new regulations mandate that companies must regularly report on their due diligence activities, findings, and the measures they take to mitigate negative impacts. The reporting ensures that stakeholders, including consumers and investors, are well-informed about the company's sustainability practices.\nThe key here is that, to ensure greater transparency, fashion brands will have to further engage with suppliers. Will this mean more audits and questionnaires for manufacturers? This seems to be a distinct possibility.\nStakeholder engagement is another key aspect of the CSDDD. Engaging with potentially affected groups and other stakeholders is essential under the new rules. This includes dialogue with local communities, workers, and NGOs to gain insights into the real-world impacts of business operations. If a company identifies that it has caused or contributed to adverse impacts, it must provide or cooperate in remediation. This could involve compensating communities for environmental damage or improving working conditions in factories. Previously, the issue of remediation had been left for the supply chains to sort out. To this extent, it will be interesting how the issue of remediation plays out under the CSDDD.\nIn Bangladesh, the garment industry is already heavily scrutinised for its environmental and social impacts, ranging from excessive water usage and pollution to labour rights abuses in the supply chains. Given that, I assume the CSDDD could significantly impact garment manufacturers in several ways.\nThe first of these is supply chain scrutiny. Manufacturers will need to have a thorough understanding of their entire supply chain\u2014from raw material sourcing to the final product. This includes ensuring that all parts of the supply chain adhere to environmental standards and respect workers' rights. For instance, manufacturers might need to switch to suppliers who use sustainable materials or enforce fair labour practices.\nThe potential for increased costs is another issue. Implementing comprehensive due diligence processes can be costly. Garment manufacturers might face higher operational costs as they invest in better supply chain management systems, conduct audits, and potentially pay higher prices for sustainably sourced materials. These costs could also affect pricing strategies and profit margins.\nOn the other hand, adhering to the CSDDD could provide a competitive advantage for some suppliers. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the environmental and social impacts of their purchases. Companies that demonstrate genuine commitment to sustainability may attract more customers and build stronger brand loyalty. This could be an opportunity for some suppliers, and we are already seeing this as brands put more effort into supporting progressive, responsible garment manufacturers.\nThe directive may also spur innovation in the industry. Manufacturers might invest in new technologies and processes that reduce environmental impacts, such as water recycling systems or energy-efficient production techniques. This can not only help comply with the CSDDD but also improve overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nMoving forward, for garment manufacturers in Bangladesh, compliance with the CSDDD is going to be essential for accessing the European market\u2014our largest market alongside the US. Non-compliance can result in legal risks, including fines and restrictions on market access. Therefore, it's crucial for the manufacturers to align their practices with the directive to avoid such risks. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\nWhile the transition may be challenging and costly, the long-term benefits of building a sustainable operation could outweigh these initial investments\u2014not just in profitability, but also in contributing positively to society and the environment.\nMostafiz Uddin\u00a0is the managing director of Denim Expert Limited.

Its importance is further illustrated by ongoing sufferings amid the longest heatwave on record in the country, which has again brought into sharp focus the consequences of mindless encroachment of parks, playgrounds, and such green areas. Why then is a youth club being allowed to transform the Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmad Park in Gulshan? As per a report by this daily, the Gulshan Youth Club, authorised by the city corporation, is constructing football turf and other structures there in violation of park designs and environmental laws.\nProtesting against these activities, locals recently formed a human chain where they said that the club authorities encroached on the park's open space, divided it with nets, and turned it into a sports ground. They also alleged that the park ground was rented for commercial purposes on different occasions. The youth club also maintains an office there. Restricting and repurposing a public space meant for general recreation and exercise is totally unacceptable.\nWhile we support healthy youth activities, including sports, this cannot be at the expense of the wider community, and certainty not by restricting, commercialising or concretising a public park. Parks are not merely patches of greenery; they are essential components of a city's infrastructure that contribute significantly to the physical, mental, and social well-being of its residents. In Dhaka, where pollution levels are extremely high and recreational spaces are limited, parks play an even more crucial role in providing a breather from the concrete jungle. As the designer of the Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmad Park has put it: \"Each park in our area is like a fan or AC. If we do not keep it as it is, we have to face the consequences.\" We already are.\nThere can be no debate over what is the right course of action in this particular case. The authorities of the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) must take immediate steps in line with the demands of Gulshan locals for strict adherence to the park's original design, removal of all illegal structures, and inclusive park management in consultation with local residents. Similarly, the government must ensure proper management, maintenance, and accessibility of all parks across Dhaka and other cities.\n",

        "full_article": "The High Court in a welcome rule recently directed the authorities concerned to take necessary measures aimed at stopping the uncontrolled price hike of medicines. The apex court's order could not come at a more opportune time when drug companies were having a field day setting and pushing up prices of their products arbitrarily. This illegal practice was taking place right under the nose of the Health Service Division and the Director General of the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) whose job it is to fix the prices of drugs under Section 30 of Drug and Cosmetics Act 2023. This provision allows drug companies to freely price more than 97 per cent of about 20,000 branded medicines they produce in the country, while the drug authorities have the control only on 460 drugs under 117 generic names so far as their pricing is concerned. Worse yet, reports say, the pharmaceutical companies hardly manufacture even 50 per cent of those generic drugs of which the prices are fixed by DGDA. Notably, the High Court passed the order after an initial hearing of a petition in public interest submitted by the Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB), which attached a newspaper cutting containing a report that said drug prices were increased from 7.0 to 140 per cent by drug companies in just two weeks. In fact, prices of medicines are going up for the last two months. Especially, increase in prices of antibiotic tablets, insulin injections for diabetic patients, etc., has badly patients requiring those drugs. It may be recalled that earlier in February last year, the CAB, in a letter raised the issue to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare Ministry and Bangladesh Competition Commission complaining that the drug companies were not even manufacturing 60 drugs out of the 117 as mandated by the Drugs (Control) Ordinance, 1982. On the other hand, they were pricing the brand medicines not covered by the 117 generic names at will. It is indeed a sad commentary on our drug manufacturers that rather than being ethical and service-oriented, they have entered the dog-eat-dog world of competition to make profits at the expense of the common people. In its letter to the parliamentary body, the CAB further noted that DGDA itself had not been properly doing its job of fixing drug prices as mandated by the said drug control ordinance as it upwardly adjusted the prices of 53 drugs. Dollar crisis, rising costs of imported raw materials, etc., were the arguments DGDA's price fixing committee put forward in this regard. Not surprisingly, the pharmaceutical companies have also been advancing similar arguments in support of their price hiking spree. Clearly, the lackadaisical approach of the government agencies concerned to enforcement of discipline in the drug market has given rise to this anarchy in medicine pricing. Not only drug manufacturers, retailers too have taken advantage of the situation to charge higher prices for medicines to the dismay of the general public and critical patients dependent on certain drugs. Against this backdrop, the apex court has, as expected, questioned the legality of inaction of the DGDA in this regard and hence ordered it to fix the prices of medicines as per section 30 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act-2023. Implementation of the court order is mandatory but the drug authority should do more to make medicines affordable for the less privileged.",

        "full_article": "Lure of jobs has led many youths to go on a perilous voyage across the Mediterranean Sea to the shores of Europe, especially Italy. Of the hundreds of thousands who embark on such a dangerous journey from different countries, thousands are from Bangladesh. According to the UNHCR data, last year, close to 160,000 who went on a risky voyage across the Mediterranean on board rickety boats bound for Italy from different corners of the world, some 13,000 were Bangladeshis. But all these illegal migrants undertaking such hazardous journey are not lucky. Many ill-fated travellers are either tortured to death by traffickers or end up in a watery grave as they are often squashed like sardines on board the boats they undertake the journey. Last year, the UN report says, 1,897 went missing during the treacherous voyage across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.Twenty-two years old Mamun Sheikh of Rajoir upazila of Madaripur was one of the eight Bangladeshi victims whose journey to Italy ended in a tragedy. He along with seven other Bangladeshis choked to death under the deck of their traffickers' boat. As the deck of the boat was too small to accommodate 53 migrants, the ill-fated eight including Mamun were forced to go inside boat's hull. They died there for want of oxygen. Thus ended the journey of Mamun Sheikh and his fellow travellers to the dreamland of Europe! The bodies of all those eight youths, some of them in their late teens, reached Dhaka last Thursday (May 2) by a Saudia Airlines flight to be received by their heartbroken parents and relatives.The tragedy took place off the coast of Tunisia where the coastguards of that country recovered the living as well as the dead from the traffickers' engine-propelled boat.Such tragic end of dozens of Bangladeshi youth grabs media headlines from time to time. Even so, there is no end of fresh recruits by brokers who inveigle the youths into the death trap.In 2022, around 15,000 Bangladeshi youths illegally tried to migrate in the same manner to Italy with help of traffickers. According to a study, between 2009 and 2023, around 70,900 illegally travelled with the help of traffickers to Europe and their route was Libya. Notably, the aforementioned Mamun Sheikh and others who died at the traffickers' hands also had travelled to Libya via Dubai before they started their fateful journey to Italy. The UNHCR further reports that traffickers take their Europe-bound victims through some seven routes and all these routes start either from Libya or Turkey. Among those, the one through the central Mediterranean that begins from Libya and ends up in Italy is the most travelled route. The youths from Bangladesh who fall prey to traffickers' deception pay to their agents -- so-called brokers -- to the tune of Tk 1.5 million each in advance as passage money to Europe. But once they are in control of the traffickers, their ordeal begins. They are actually held to ransom and subjected to inhuman treatment at every step of the journey to extort more money from their hostages' family members in Bangladesh. Thus the dreams of the Europe-bound youths are shattered the moment they are put in the so-called 'game ghor', the temporary shelter where they are kept before the voyage to Italy begins. But those 'game ghors' are basically torture chambers. But youths are still attracted to such dangerous journeys. The stories of successful travellers after all the ordeals they undergo perhaps inspire the youths to take the challenge. The traffickers' agents take advantage of this. Those agents are people familiar with the victims and their family members. Traffickers' agents convince victims of their 'bright future' in Europe. This is how another youth, Kamrul Hasan Bappy (21) of Naria upazila in Shariatpur died of hypothermia while crossing the Mediterranean Sea in January 2022. He was among seven others from Bangladesh who died from extreme cold under the same circumstances off the coast of Italy. In Kamrul's case, his father, Abul Bashar, said the traffickers' agents 'brainwashed' his son, who was otherwise doing well with his business as a grocer. Kamrul also used the same route as Mamun Sheikh to reach Libya via Dubai. Since the conjurors who dupe the gullible village youths into undertaking deadly journeys to Europe are in many cases the victims' acquaintances, they must be exposed. The Public Security Division of the home ministry in its National Plan of Action for Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking 2023-25 has identified three districts-Cox's Bazar, Mymensingh and Jessore-as hotspots for human trafficking. But what measures have been taken so far to stop trafficking of youths from these hotspots? There are also anti-trafficking tribunals in seven divisions empowered by the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act. But cases related to human trafficking, some 3,700 of them, against 34,500 accused individuals are learnt to be pending in courts. But justice delayed is justice denied. The traffickers who are misguiding thousands of youths of the country to join the death march must be punished. Youths who are being preyed on by traffickers are not from the very poor segment of society because they can pay more than a million taka to agents or brokers. They sell property including lands and even take loans from relatives and village money lenders to pay the passage cost to traffickers' agents. These families are obviously rendered poorer as soon as the tragedies strike. The government should be able to ferret out traffickers and their agents and hold them to justice.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "Waves of protest by university students from the United States have now shaken not only the campuses of highest seats of learning in that country as well as Europe and Australia but also the world conscience that went into hibernation or has long become moribund. The protest against Israeli genocide significantly began on April 17 last on Columbia University campus where 56 years ago on April 23, 1968, the flame of the anti-Vietnam war campaign was first ignited. There has been a repeat of police brutality of the 1968 on the student campers of the 50 tents they pitched on the campus. The campus was cleared of protesters but students started rallying all across the US. It is remarkable that the Ivy League member acted as the cradle of the anti-Vietnam movement among students and youths in 1968 and it has once again made the point clear that US policy on Gaza war is an aberration of principles that made America what it is today. The US administration made a historical blunder by waging a war on Vietnam and Joe Biden's government is committing a similar mistake by fuelling the Israeli crime against humanity in Gaza. It is a monumental shame that Biden is supplying the war machines to Israel, which are being used to kill scores of civilian Palestinians on a daily basis. At a time when world conscience has taken a leave of the Western leaders who toe the American line, any hope of prevailing on them is the youth spirit. Student movement shook the political systems in the 60s of the last millennium, shaping a new reality. Countries as diverse as the US, Japan, France, Mexico, West Germany, Brazil, Italy and Czechoslovakia felt the heat of student uprising. Crest-fallen America had to leave Vietnam that earned its hard-fought independence. Under the rule of Joe Biden, the principle of human liberty its original charter upholds is trampled and unless the clarity of vision youth movement brings when civilisation finds itself at a crossroads takes over, the rogue state's hegemony on Palestinian lands backed by American money and military hardware cannot be eliminated. The conservative and derelict leaderships in the West still pursue a policy of maintaining pockets of conflicts or even creating new ones in the interest of weapon sale and trade monopoly so that countries remain independent only on paper but actually turn into outposts or fiefdoms of big powers. The saga of Palestinian ordeal and tragedy is the worst injustice that the Western powers led by the UK and US could do to a people in modern times. An artificial state has been implanted on the Palestinian soil while the people of the land are denied of their right to live as a free nation. Even the status quo has been violated by the Israeli government and its military umpteenth of time since the creation of Israel and there has been brutal response to any counteraction to Israeli atrocities and occupation of Palestinian territory beyond the original boundary. If students of the US Ivy League institution have taken the initiative to impress upon the leaders of big powers, their peers in Paris's Sorbonne University and other universities in London, Rome, Sydney and Tokyo have taken the cue. This is not just an awakening for the world's young population but also a clear message for conventional leaders across the free market spectrum that justice must be done and people must not be treated like vermin and annihilated as such anywhere in the world. The 1968 student movement together with the civil rights movement brought about phenomenal changes to societies. Let this latest student protest consolidate and the growing solidarity with the hapless Palestinians bring their ultimate freedom. Let also those who wage war on civilians and finance proxy war be dumped into the dungeon of history. \n[email\u00a0protected]",
