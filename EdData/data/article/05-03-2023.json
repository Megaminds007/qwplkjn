The Court has ruled that a three-member committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, or the leader of the single largest Opposition party, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI), will choose the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (EC) until a law in passed. As a constitutional body vested with plenary powers of superintendence, direction and control over elections, the ECI is a vital component of the republic that requires functional freedom and constitutional protection to ensure free and fair elections. It has been the practice that the President appoints the CEC and ECs on the advice of the Prime Minister, but the Constitution Bench has pointed out that the original intent of the Constitution makers was that the manner of appointment should be laid down in a parliamentary law. Article 324 says the President should appoint the CEC and Commissioners, subject to any law made in that behalf by Parliament. However, successive regimes have failed to enact a law. Justice K.M. Joseph, who has authored the main verdict, has based the Court\u2019s decision on \u201cthe inertia\u201d of the legislature and the perceived vacuum in the absence of a law.Few would disagree with the Court\u2019s fundamental proposition that the election watchdog should be fiercely independent and not be beholden to the executive; and there should be no room for an appointing authority to expect reciprocity or loyalty. The government\u2019s argument that the existing system was working well and there was no vacuum was quite weak, as, admittedly, the convention now is that the Prime Minister chooses a name from among a database of high-ranking civil servants and advises the President to make the appointment. However, a relevant question is whether the presence of the CJI in the selection panel is the only way in which an institution\u2019s independence can be preserved. There is no clear proof that the independence of the Central Bureau of Investigation Director, who is appointed by a panel that includes the CJI, or his nominee, has been preserved or enhanced. Further, the CJI\u2019s presence may give pre-emptive legitimacy to all appointments and affect objective judicial scrutiny of any error or infirmity in the process. On its part, the government will be well-advised to enact a law \u2014 but not one that seeks to preserve the current convention to get around the verdict \u2014 that is in tune with the spirit of the Court\u2019s emphasis on the ECI\u2019s independence.

The FMCBG is part of the key \u201cFinance track\u201d of the 20 most advanced economies, set up in 1999 to help global economic coordination after the Asian financial crisis. The other, the \u201cSherpa track\u201d, works on the G20\u2019s goal setting process. With the experience India gained in Indonesia last year to bridge the Russia-West divide, the challenges for India\u2019s presidency, amid dynamic geopolitical changes, should have been clear. In Bengaluru, however, the surprise was when Russia and China refused to accept the language on the Ukraine war that they had agreed to just three months ago. As a result, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was constrained to issue only a Chair\u2019s summary and outcome document, rather than a joint communique. The government also decided to include the paragraphs that Russia and China had objected to, naming them in the document. This is something of a precedent, as last year, the Indonesian chair\u2019s joint communiques at the Leader level and FMCBG expressed the sentiments of \u201cmany\u201d and \u201cmost\u201d countries. After the brinkmanship in Bengaluru, it was ambitious, if not a bit surprising, that the government chose to attempt negotiations for a joint statement for the FMM. Eventually, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar issued a Chairman\u2019s summary and outcome documents too, citing differences over the two Bali paragraphs. This was a first, as FMMs have not attempted to issue statements at all.While the two meetings have given India\u2019s G20 process a rocky start, there is a long road ahead to the Leaders\u2019 summit in September. Mr. Jaishankar has pointed out that the bulk of the statements that pertain to the critical issues for the Global South, such as food and energy security and debt management, have been ironed out. Second, there is clarity that India cannot bank on the language of the Bali Summit, and Sherpas will need to iron out a new consensus language on Ukraine. This will require a keen ear and creative formulas that take into account Russian grievances with the language, as well as the western desire to retain its successes in condemning Russia\u2019s actions in the Bali document. As host, India is in the \u2018hot-seat\u2019 and will benefit from enlisting those countries in the grouping other than the entrenched camps of the G7, U.S.-led developed world, and the now-strengthened Russia-China combine, to ensure that a middle path is found.",

The decision of the Supreme Court to radically reform the method of appointment of chief election commissioner (CEC) and the two members of Election Commission is one such. The court held the President would no longer appoint the CEC on the sole advice of government. Instead, a committee of the Prime Minister, leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha and the CJI would advise the President. By wresting control of the appointment of members of EC from government, the court holds out the promise of free and fair elections, ensured by a truly independent watchdog. Democracy wins.\nBut when courts step in to legislate in such a manner, frustrated by Parliament\u2019s unwillingness to act for 73 years, democracy also loses.

Neither the absence of a communique nor the unsettled nature of contemporary geopolitics is a reflection on multilateralism, which cannot always find a ready solution for deep-seated disputes. But it does provide opportunities to de-escalate and open the door to durable outcomes. The Delhi summit did just that through meetings on the sidelines such as the ones between the US and Russia, and between Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang.\nJaishankar was realistic in assessment of bilateral ties with China. He termed these abnormal and added that \u201cthere are real problems in that relationship that need to be looked at.\u201d Fatalities at Galwan in 2020 marked a turning point and China\u2019s attempts to paper over the issue or adopt an intransigent posture in talks don\u2019t help. Sensibly, India avoided a knee-jerk approach to trade in its reset of the bilateral relationship. Trade is dominated by supply chains that split production across countries. Consequently, looking at bilateral trade deficits in isolation is meaningless.\nTo illustrate, two critical imports from China are integrated circuits and plastic raw materials. China\u2019s just one link in the IC supply chain that feeds into India\u2019s burgeoning electronic exports. China contributed 13.8% of India\u2019s imports between April and December 2022, the largest source. That, however, will not hold back tighter integration among Quad members, who met yesterday. As the Quad joint statement pointed out, a rules-based international order encompasses respect for territorial integrity. It can no longer be business as usual with China. A forum such as G20 allows India to get the message across.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Picture this: In late October of last year, it's the night of the Sitrang cyclone. It has been raining in Dhaka city since morning, and in the evening that turns into a storm. I don't feel relieved like I usually do as my time to leave the office draws nearer. But head out I must. Predictably, my go-to bus for Mirpur is nowhere to be seen that night, just as the other public buses which occupy every square foot of the Farmgate intersection. Miraculously, though, armed with my going-going-gone umbrella, I only have to stand on the roadside for a couple of minutes before a bus appears \u2013 a single-decker, accordion-style, red BRTC bus carrying (and this will shock you) all women. It won't take me as close to home as I would like, but that will have to do. I rush to the entrance and hop on.\nThis was also when I first noticed the frustration of the men on the roadside as they realised that this is one bus they cannot board. So much so that, at a later stop, when myself and the other passengers were habitually stopping men from getting on, one man screwed up his face into a half-leer, half-frown and demanded, \"Ken? Apnera ki amader bus e uthen na?\" (\"Why? Do you not use\u00a0our\u00a0buses?\")\u00a0Mon dieu, the brother had put me in my place!\nSelf-soothing sarcasm aside, where is a Bangladeshi woman to go, then, if she is supposedly undeserving even of the place specifically reserved for her?\nFrom what I have observed within the capital at least, most men seem to harbour a negative attitude towards women receiving \"special treatment\" on public transportation. It starts, of course, with some men acting as if buses having \"reserved seats\" for women is somehow the same as depriving the former of their human rights. More recently, some buses have also been refusing to let women on if there are no seats available and if they will have to stand during the journey. Much kudos for such performative chivalry, I say!\nIf only this sentiment was consistent and men didn't loudly express their discontent at women sitting on regular, non-reserved seats. Men's complaints even take them to the point of demanding, \"Ai mohila uthais na!\" (\"Don't let women get on!\").\nAlas, women's side of reality is even less rosy. The five to nine (depending on the bus' size) reserved seats that male passengers seem to covet are really no prize. They are usually placed on top of the engine, making the seats too hot to sit on comfortably. Moreover, the women's seating area is usually more cramped, with leg space being slim to nil. Then there's the proximity to the driver, who is often no more a gentleman than the male passengers whose gaze (and touch) the reserved seats are supposed to protect women from.\n\nFrom what I have observed within the capital at least, most men seem to harbour a negative attitude towards women receiving \"special treatment\" on public transportation. It starts, of course, with some men acting as if buses having \"reserved seats\" for women is somehow the same as depriving the former of their human rights. More recently, some buses have also been refusing to let women on if there are no seats available and if they will have to stand during the journey. Much kudos for such performative chivalry, I say!\nAnd while I openly admit that women passengers are really not as good at standing on a moving and swerving bus as their male counterparts, one really cannot expect them to be, either. Childhood may be a different story, but starting from puberty, girls are discouraged from being active or agile. Beyond their studies, most are taught to shelter themselves from the male-dominated outside world. As such, even in a country that is half theirs by law, girls and young women grow up practising being as anonymous as possible, so as to avoid commonplace sexual harassment or violence.\nSo, how can women travel on public transport without feeling like sub-humans?\nThe most realistic and provenly effective solution is women-only buses. However, they are a sight rarer than a bi-yearly blood moon. The first women-only buses were introduced in the capital in 2010 by the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC). Rangs Motors followed along with their own Dolonchapa buses in 2018. And while the number of these buses plying our roads was never able to meet commuter demands adequately, the situation worsened during the pandemic recovery period.\nAccording to a report by\u00a0The Business Standard\u00a0from October 2022, of the original 22 women-only buses from the BRTC, 18 have been phased out for various reasons over the years. The four that remain only operate on four routes. Dolonchapa's plan of expanding from four to 60 women-only buses, too, has not met fruition. Now, the four buses only offer two trips, operating on one single route.\nIt is unfortunate that what really stands between women and affordable transportation is a lack of profitability. Still, nowadays, the ratio between male and female passengers on any given bus is much closer to being equal than what it used to be even a decade ago. More students and working women now use public transport within the capital, given the mode's affordability.\nBut the exclusionary \"rules\" imposed by transport companies \u2013 coupled with the deficient supply of public buses themselves \u2013 mean that many women, especially during the rush hours, are unable to board a bus even if they want to, and might ultimately decide to use a different, more expensive mode of transport. For them, the rare sighting of a women-only bus is always a welcome blessing. When I boarded that all-women BRTC bus in October, for instance, I felt relieved in equal parts because I had found a ride home during a storm and because I wasn't having to be alert about men standing too close to me and touching me inappropriately. More importantly, I felt that I was occupying my place on a city bus as a dignified and deserving citizen, not as a social pariah who inconvenienced men simply by existing.\nAs such, a feasible solution might be for our government to subsidise the operation of women-only buses to make up for the alleged low occupancy rate of non-peak hours. This would also bring the country closer to achieving a number of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, such as Goal 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 10 (Reduce Inequalities), and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).\nAll things said and done, travelling on public buses is one experience I have never been able to romanticise. It is obvious that women and their mobility are something our society actively opposes (and will continue to oppose for a long time), and that public transport is where this is best exemplified.\nBut beyond the technicalities of laws, regulations, and The System, my suggestion to women would be to simply take up space. If you can walk, do so briskly and surely, no matter how many men are crowding the footpath that is also rightfully yours. When a man is seated next to you on the bus, don't cower into the corner. Instead, claim your half of the seat (that you are paying for) physically and, if needed, verbally. And when you see a man occupying a seat reserved for you by law, demand that he leaves it. Be coarse when needed. Plant your feet firmly onto the bus floor and try to keep steady against the impractical system given to you. Even having a patriarchal mob practically pressed against you, stand tall and occupy\u00a0your\u00a0square foot or so of space.\nAfter all, in the words of womanist writer and activist Audre Lorde, survival \"is learning how to stand alone, unpopular and sometimes reviled\u2026 to make common cause with those others identified as outside the structures in order to define and seek a world in which we can all flourish.\"\nAfia Jahin is a member of the editorial team at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "In Bangladesh, nature has been at a crisis point for quite some time, and one only needs to look at the present state of our rivers, forests and hills to understand that. This destructive trend has extended to biodiversity as well. Over the last several decades, there has been a persistent drop in the country's wildlife population. Populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish are all also shrinking. This is a deeply troubling situation which we must address.\nThe threat to wildlife has come under renewed scrutiny on this year's World Wildlife Day. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, wildlife trade has been going on unabated in many parts of the country. The report cites a study done by a Cambridge University team which mentions 13 districts where illegal trade in live animals and animal parts is thriving. Often wild animals, including endangered species, are caught from these districts and brought to Dhaka and Chattogram. Live animals are most trafficked to neighbouring India and Myanmar, while Thailand, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos are also potential destinations.\nAccording to sources, there has been an uptick in wildlife trafficking in recent months, suggesting the involvement of a powerful gang. As well as live animals, animal body parts including meat, bones, teeth, nails, skin and even blood are also reportedly sold or smuggled. The rarer and more endangered the animal, the higher its price. Although police occasionally seize consignments of animals and animal parts, clearly those haven't been enough to put a brake on this lucrative trade. Moreover, while low-level criminals are sometimes arrested in these drives, the ringleaders remain almost always untouched, thanks to the involvement of powerful patrons and lack of political support to stop this trade.\nSadly, trafficking is only a part of the problem facing wildlife in Bangladesh. Often the threat also comes from irresponsible conduct by state officials. For example, not long ago, we have seen how open electrical lines have been allowed to go through the Lawachhara forest, leading to many animals getting electrocuted. At Lawachhara, as well as live wires, wild animals have also been exposed to the risk of being run over by incoming trains. According to an estimate, at least 35 wild animals were killed in train accidents in the last five years at the Lawachara National Park. What's worse, the railway authorities have yet to act even after a month has passed since all trains were instructed to run at a maximum speed of 20 kph to ensure the safety of wildlife. More alarmingly, wild animals are also suffering from increasing habitat loss due to destruction and degradation of forests.\nThese developments only symptomatise the ongoing neglect of wildlife in Bangladesh. Officially, the government retains the policy of supporting biodiversity conservation, but the reality is totally different. Given the grave, multidimensional risks that wildlife and our natural world face, we need to critically rethink our approach to this issue. We urge the authorities to ensure that all threats to wildlife are eradicated. They must take firmer action in this regard.\n",

        "full_article": "Taylor Jenkins Reid's best-selling novel, Daisy Jones & the Six (2019), tells the story of a fictional group of musicians who became an iconic rock band in the 1970s.\u00a0 Decades after the group's final gig, the tale is shared through the transcript of a series of interviews with band members, managers, and others involved in the rise and fall of The Six and their star female vocalist, Daisy Jones.\u00a0\nThe book leaves readers wanting nothing more than to listen to Daisy Jones & The Six's sole album, Aurora. Enamored readers have tried. When you type in \"Is Daisy Jones\u2026\" into Google, a prompt automatically pops up: \"Is Daisy Jones & The Six a real band?\"\nOn March 3, they became one. The book has been adapted into an Amazon Prime Video 10-episode limited series. The first three episodes are out now.\u00a0\n\u00a0Reid has openly spoken about her inspiration and admiration of Fleetwood Mac, particularly Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, and how her protagonists in their own ways are representatives of the '70s rock scene and the tumultuous romance that plagued Fleetwood Mac.\u00a0\nIn her novel, Reid delves into the impact of infidelity on a marriage, the trappings of fame, and a man caught between his personal ambitions and his devotions to his family.\u00a0\nHer story is about addiction and the great loves of one's life. In the 70s, that was drugs for Daisy and it grew to include rockstar Billy Dunne, a man she knew she couldn't have because of his marriage to Camila and his commitment to his family. For Billy, it was and always had been Camila from the moment they met. But he had become more than infatuated with Daisy\u00a0as they worked on music together.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the forefront is Daisy's struggle with drugs, how they lit her up just as bright as her talent and brought her down as low as her insecurities and loneliness. She's a firecracker in the book, the kind of woman songs are written about but who'd rather be howling into a mic telling her own stories for others to listen to. Billy struggles with alcohol and drug addictions of his own, and vows to get better for his family. The show doesn't toss their addictions to the wayside, but it's less preoccupied with them.\nReid's story explores themes of art, creativity, and expression, particularly through collaboration. It looks at how personal relationships and behind-the-scenes drama shape iconic music, and what happens when artistic visions and personalities clash. The show unquestionably captures the fierce spirit and vibrant energy of the book, thanks in large part to Riley Keough and Sam Claflin's rich portrayals of Daisy and Billy respectively, and\u00a0Daisy Jones & the Six's now real album Aurora, produced and co-written by Grammy Award-winning producer Blake Mills.\u00a0\nIn particular, the granddaughter of the \"King of Rock\" Elvis Presley playing the lead role couldn't be more perfect. As Daisy, Keough has an undeniable magnetism. She takes a complicated, beloved character and more than does justice to the nuances of her at times frustrating personality. Keough and Claflin sing with their real voices on the show, and all the cast members play their own instruments. Although the words are changed, fans can finally listen to the novel's memorable songs, such as Regret Me and Look At Us Now (Honeycomb), which are entirely believable as hits.\u00a0\nThe book takes us through closed corridors in achingly unnerving yet touching ways, requiring us to look beyond the words and towards the intentions. The \"unreliable narrator\" concept is clearly laid out\u2014we readers are led to believe that the individual accounts of events, which cut back and forth between perspectives, are as the people involved choose to remember them, and not necessarily how things actually happened. It makes for an exhilarating journey through the band's ascent, but after a while, we long to get closer, to find out what the characters aren't confessing on the record, or zoom out to take in more of the '70s.\u00a0\nThe streaming adaptation retains the flash-forward tell-all interview framing device through an on-screen documentary. Unsurprisingly, this format lends fertile ground to open interpretation of what really happened between the characters, with the\u00a0 showrunners taking creative liberties and reading between the lines in order to effectively portray the band's demise. However, the show barely bothers to age up its characters, which takes away considerably from the poignancy of seeing older, wiser souls reflect on the follies of their youth.\u00a0\nThe series tries harder with Simone, a disco star in the making, who is the first character to see Daisy for who she is and love her for it. Simone has more air time in the show than she does in the book, allowing us glimpses into her own romance and career and offering the perspective of a queer Black woman in the '70s.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Camila, the source of goodness and reason in the book, is given the freedom to be more vulnerable on screen. She is a photographer who has her own artistic ambitions. And despite her hard-headedness about Billy and her expectations for him to show up for her and their family, she has her own insecurities about marriage and motherhood. Might these insecurities soon translate to the blossoming relationship between Billy and Daisy?\nRocky, and plagued with melodrama much like the titular band itself, the show hits (almost) all the right notes of the book. By the end of episode 3, and the end of a transcendent studio performance between Billy and Daisy, we are all in. I will be seated to see how it all ends.\u00a0\nShababa Iqbal is a Journalism graduate from Independent University, Bangladesh, who likes Jane Austen's novels and Disney movies.

This is a deeply troubling situation which we must address.\nThe threat to wildlife has come under renewed scrutiny on this year's World Wildlife Day. According to a report by\u00a0Prothom Alo, wildlife trade has been going on unabated in many parts of the country. The report cites a study done by a Cambridge University team which mentions 13 districts where illegal trade in live animals and animal parts is thriving. Often wild animals, including endangered species, are caught from these districts and brought to Dhaka and Chattogram. Live animals are most trafficked to neighbouring India and Myanmar, while Thailand, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos are also potential destinations.\nAccording to sources, there has been an uptick in wildlife trafficking in recent months, suggesting the involvement of a powerful gang. As well as live animals, animal body parts including meat, bones, teeth, nails, skin and even blood are also reportedly sold or smuggled. The rarer and more endangered the animal, the higher its price. Although police occasionally seize consignments of animals and animal parts, clearly those haven't been enough to put a brake on this lucrative trade. Moreover, while low-level criminals are sometimes arrested in these drives, the ringleaders remain almost always untouched, thanks to the involvement of powerful patrons and lack of political support to stop this trade.\nSadly, trafficking is only a part of the problem facing wildlife in Bangladesh. Often the threat also comes from irresponsible conduct by state officials. For example, not long ago, we have seen how open electrical lines have been allowed to go through the Lawachhara forest, leading to many animals getting electrocuted. At Lawachhara, as well as live wires, wild animals have also been exposed to the risk of being run over by incoming trains. According to an estimate, at least 35 wild animals were killed in train accidents in the last five years at the Lawachara National Park. What's worse, the railway authorities have yet to act even after a month has passed since all trains were instructed to run at a maximum speed of 20 kph to ensure the safety of wildlife. More alarmingly, wild animals are also suffering from increasing habitat loss due to destruction and degradation of forests.\nThese developments only symptomatise the ongoing neglect of wildlife in Bangladesh. Officially, the government retains the policy of supporting biodiversity conservation, but the reality is totally different. Given the grave, multidimensional risks that wildlife and our natural world face, we need to critically rethink our approach to this issue. We urge the authorities to ensure that all threats to wildlife are eradicated. They must take firmer action in this regard.\n",

        "full_article": "For a country that depends on the earnings of migrant workers for its economic stability, it is certainly a worrying trend when remittance keeps on declining year after year. What is particularly perplexing is that this is happening despite an increasing number of Bangladeshis leaving for jobs abroad each year. In 2021, for instance, 617,209 workers left for overseas jobs, bringing in $22.07 billion in remittances. In 2022, a record 1,135,873 workers found jobs abroad, which should have almost doubled our earnings. Yet, the remittance inflow was actually 1.5 percent lower year-on-year at $21.25 billion.\u00a0\nOne of the major reasons for this fall \u2013 and the one most often highlighted by the government \u2013 is that an unknown volume of money is being transacted through unofficial channels, i.e. hundi. Migrants prefer unofficial channels because they are offered better exchange rates than banks, they are not charged any transaction fees, there is no unnecessary paperwork or bureaucracy, and it is easier and considerably faster for them to send money to their families in the villages than through banks.\u00a0\nGiven these realities, the question is, what has the government done to ease banking through official channels? The 2.5 percent incentive provided by banks is simply not sufficient to counter the attractive package offered by hundi agents, unless exchange rates are made competitive, transaction costs are removed, and bank services are made efficient and migrant-friendly. In addition, the lack of financial literacy and difficulty in accessing banks, particularly of female family members of migrants, must also be addressed through sensitive policymaking.\u00a0\nAnother reason highlighted by migrant rights experts is the exorbitant recruitment costs, about 50-60 percent of which goes towards \"paying\" visa traders in the destination countries, even though selling or buying job visas is illegal. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, on average, the recruitment cost of a Bangladeshi migrant worker is $4,903 or Tk 4.16 lakh, while the average monthly salary is Tk 23,093, which means it takes 17.6 months for a worker to simply recoup the amount he or she has to spend for recruitment. Many of them end up with no job even after spending such a huge sum of money, and are subsequently deported. Without meaningful efforts to reign in the ever-increasing recruitment costs, particularly the illegal visa trade both in home and destination countries, migrants will continue to bleed financially.\u00a0\nAdditionally, most of our migrant workers are employed in low-paying, unskilled jobs, as a result of which the amount of money they eventually send back to the country \u2013 after their recruitment and living costs are deducted \u2013 are pitiful. According to the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU), 78.64 percent of workers who migrated in 2022 were less skilled, and are prone to fraudulence and exploitation. It is of urgent importance that Bangladesh takes steps to upskill its workers and look for emerging markets where they can compete successfully.\u00a0\nThe government needs to come up with a holistic plan to address the complex reasons that are holding back the growth of our remittance earnings. It needs to ensure coordination among different ministries to address migrants' needs and concerns at all levels, and to provide them and their families with the necessary knowledge and skills to prosper.\n",

        "full_article": "It appears that the chronic problems associated with implementation of some foreign-funded programmes have taken a serious turn. The World Bank (WB) is rethinking its financial commitment on a number of bilateral projects with the government that have not been doing well for some time. Some eight projects that involve over US$3 billion have been called into question. From what has been published in this paper, it is understood that the lending agency is not too keen on extending the timelines for these projects. That is hardly good news for the country, especially at a time of economic slowdown.During a recent review meeting that brought together government officials and WB representatives, project authorities were asked either to streamline the slow-moving projects or return the unspent amounts. The government\u2019s Achilles heel is that the agencies under its control are slow in executing development projects. So, more needs to be done to build the capacity of the various departments and agencies to see that foreign-funded projects are completed on time. The warning coming from the WB is more than 'embarrassing' for the authorities concerned, rather it should act as a wakeup call. Were this major lending agency to go ahead with their announced intention, it may well signal similar action by Bangladesh's other major foreign lending agencies engaged in development projects. That is something the country can ill afford under any circumstances.Unlike commercial loans, development grants and loans carry a much easier loan repayment regime that is stretched over many years, if not decades. Such bilateral lending agencies commit much-need foreign currency loans to pull people out of poverty and their involvement simply cannot be understated. What policymakers need to understand is that a failure to improve the implementation capacity would lead to a loss of interest on the part of international development partners and that has multifarious repercussions at many different levels.Hence, there is no way to ignore the concerns raised by WB. The failure to expedite programmes despite several reminders over the preceding few years gives the impression that the country does not need foreign assistance. Is that really the case for any developing nation? On the contrary, every nation with a growing economy that is also densely populated will inevitably need foreign development assistance. Given that the country's own weaker resource base for revenue mobilisation, coupled with an ambitious infrastructure development plan, it is natural that the government will reach out to bilateral organisations for support - which will be answered. However, as a global lending agency, the WB will naturally have its own conditions for the judicious use of its funds, within stipulated timeframes because Bangladesh is not the only country that needs funding for such programmes. In fact, such funds are crucial to developing the rural economy. Most developing nations face similar hurdles. So, authorities should not think that these funds cannot be better spent in some other country. It is time to stop procrastinating and get a move on with the eight projects. Much depends on preserving the credibility of authorities to get the job done as per agreed upon timeline.",

        "full_article": "Just in progress is a global event where leaders of the least- developed countries have gathered in Doha, the capital of Qatar, to brainstorm a comprehensive roadmap for these countries to move forward in the next decade. The five-day international conference, starting off Sunday, is the second and final part of the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5). Usually held once in a decade, the current meet is expected to finalise 'The Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031.' The work-programme \"manifests a new generation of renewed and strengthened commitments between the least-developed countries and their development partners, including the private sector, civil society and governments, at all levels.\" Originally adopted a year back and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, the Doha Programme of Action (DPoA) is a set of targets to achieve by these countries by 2031. This is another ambitious global endeavour to support growth of the countries lagging behind in the global march for advance onto newer highs. Currently there are 46 LDCs, 35 of which are members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as of now. The share of the LDCs in the global trade in goods and commercial services has been static for almost a decade. In 2017, the share was 1.14 per cent which reached 1.17 per cent in 2019. It came down to 1.15 per cent in the pandemic-afflicted year 2020 and remained he same in 2021. The tiny share falls short of the target set in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Target 17.11 of the SDGs gives the direction to 'significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least-developed countries' share of global exports by 2020.' The share of LDCs' exports, however, stood at 0.93 per cent of the global total in 2020 and remained same in 2021. The full-year update data for 2022 are not available yet. So far, Bangladesh is the top merchandise exporter and importer amongst members of the group. The country's exports covered 20 per cent of all LDCs' exports in 2017, which stood at 19 per cent in 2021, according to statistics compiled by the WTO. In 2017, Bangladesh's share in LDCs' total imports of goods was 22 per cent which increased to 26 per cent in 2021. Cambodia (9pc) and Ethiopia (7 pc) were the second-and third-largest importers respectively. The Covid-19 pandemic came as a big blow to LDCs' export of goods, which declined by 1.8 per cent in 2019 and dropped further by 7.8 per cent in 2020. The exports, however, rebounded in 2021, recording a growth of 26.90 per cent. A note prepared by the secretariat of the World Trade Organisation last year said that LDCs' goods exports benefitted from rising energy prices in the last year while exports of commercial services lagged behind (posted 9.10-percent growth) due to pandemic-related travel restrictions.Trade is a critical instrument for the LDCs to move ahead. That's why these countries have been offered duty-free market access to most developed countries and some developing countries, too. For example, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland offer cent-percent tariff-free market access to LDCs. The offer from Chile, the European Union, Iceland and the United Kingdom is 99-percent duty-free market access. In addition, Canada, Japan and China offer at least 97-percent duty-free market access. Meanwhile, some other members grant duty-free access. Countries like India and South Korea also offer 90 per cent or more of their tariff lines duty-free for the LDCs. Nevertheless, LDCs have yet to tap the full potential of these offers of tariff-free or preferential market access mainly due to various bottlenecks. A series of non-tariff measures (NTMs), adopted by the developed and developing countries, make it more challenging for the LDCs to utilise the advantage of tariff-free marketing. Lack of product diversification coupled with inadequate infrastructure and skilled manpower also makes it difficult for these poorer countries to enhance their productivity and competitiveness. The fourth key focus area of the DPoA is 'enhancing international trade of least- developed countries and regional integration.' Under the area, the programme outlines several key action areas. These are (a) duty-free and quota-free market access (b) preferential rules of origin (c) LDCs' services waiver, technical assistance and capacity building, including through Aid for Trade (d) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right or TRIPS (e) agriculture and cotton (f) WTO agreement on trade Facilitation (g) e-commerce (h) special and differential treatment and (i) regional integration. One can easily find that all these areas have long-been included in the WTO agenda for negotiation. Some remarkable improvements have already been observed in some areas. Others need more combined efforts to make the things easy for the LDCs. Though there is no lack of commitments from the developed and some developing countries to support the LDCs, the words have yet to be adequately matched with deeds. DPoA sets a target to 'significantly increase the exports of least-developed countries, in particular with a view to doubling their share of global exports by 2031.' It means, LDCs' share in global export needs to reach 1.90 per cent to 2.0 per cent by the end of 2031. If the current trends of 6.6-percent average growth of last six years continue, it is unlikely that the target could be reached within a decade. As a number of LDCs will come out from the UN-defined category of poor nations by 2031, the total number of LDCs will also decline. So will the volume and share of LDCs' trade. Thus, the target of doubling the LDCs' trade will not be achieved. Bangladesh, Lao PDR and Nepal are set to graduate out of the LDC category by 2026. Bhutan, Angola, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Solomon Islands were scheduled to be graduated by 2024. They, however, get five years' preparatory period. Moreover, nine more are also on the list of graduation provided they fulfil all the required conditions. Thus, the number of LDCs may come down to below 40 by the end of 2031 from the current 46. DoPA has also set a target to 'enable 15 additional least-developed countries to meet the criteria for graduation by 2031.' The roadmap also underscores the specific measures to support LDCs graduate for 'making the graduation sustainable and irreversible.' How the latest endeavour will bring a significant advancement of these countries can be observed after a decade. Meantime, the core challenge will be to adjust with global changes in-between to keep the path as smooth as possible. [email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "The grand view of the 6.15km Padma Bridge and the scene showing the dismantling of engine boats used for carrying passengers between Mawa and Zajira points uphold a universal truth. The ferry boats' utility has been consigned to the grey past from whose mist emerges the majestic bridge. The universal truth revolves round the ever relevant fact of the 'new' replacing the 'old'. Many people find it hard to accept it as reality, reminding them of the pain of saying bye to primitive tools to welcome the fruits of the Industrial Revolution. The implements were absorbed in all segments of life --- from agriculture to the industrial sector.With motorised vehicles starting to roll along the country's longest bridge, thus becoming integral to many a national activity, the ferry boats and small launches have been declared redundant. That was the only pragmatic option. Once upon a time, large and imposing ferries used to carry passengers from one bank to another --- on the Mawa-Zajira route. Now that the long-awaited Padma Bridge is in place, the ferries' necessity has been proved to be anachronistic. The situation can be compared to the use of the newly invented automobiles in place of the age-old horse carriages. Many bring up the topic of sea routes, which were once dominated by large sail ships, the oarsmen adding to their speed. Eventually they had to make way for the propeller-driven ships and those powered by steam. Modern ships are mostly run by diesel-electric engine and gas turbine. While comparing the two ways of transport --- an operational modern bridge and river ferry service --- the latter has to leave the scene.The owners of the river vessels operating at Mawa and Zajira are now busy winding up their business. Finding not even a slim chance to return to their old profession, they are now seen dismantling their ferry vessels with a view to selling the engine boats as scrap metal. The whole scenario can be compared to a nearly similar one when the motor launches were introduced to the land in the 1950s. The reaction of the poor country-boat owners was one of protest and anger. Incidents of damaging launches, attacking their crew continued unabated for long. As expected, the launch owners hit back. It was followed by a truce of sorts. The plight of the Padma ferry owners is nothing extraordinary. Fatalists may bring up the issue of fate. In reality, all this alludes to the eventual victory of technology. Humans cannot afford to live a technology-blessed life until they welcome the newer wonders of science. Padma Bridge and the ferry vessels are not antagonistic. Theoretically, they have no clashes of interest. But stark reality shows, the ferry boat owners being the weaker and outdated segment have to give in to the national interest. They just did that.Yet the nation owes this segment of business a lot of gratitude for their long service of ferrying people across the mighty Padma. Despite many deaths and missing in ferry capsizes in the river, the crossing of the Padma would have been a hazardous adventure without these engine boats. Now that they have to switch over to other professions or fall on hard times, the higher authorities cannot turn their back on them.[email\u00a0protected]",

But the festival was held without ensuring complete distribution of the books to students. In many parts of Bangladesh including Bhola, Khagrachhari and Satkhira, secondary and primary students have not yet received all textbooks. Madrasa students are also yet to get the new books on different subjects. This is concerning given that school students in Bangladesh are already suffering from learning loss as a result of the Covid outbreak. The government has been distributing free textbooks from pre-primary to secondary students since 2010. The delay in the distribution of textbooks has, however, become a common experience these days. And it suggests that the authorities concerned are more interested in publicising the free textbook distribution programme than ensuring its actual implementation.
