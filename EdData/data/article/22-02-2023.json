All through Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s 85-minute address, the Opposition kept raising slogans, which Sansad TV that does the live telecast of the proceedings blacked out \u2014 the camera did not pan towards the Opposition benches. Earlier, acting on a complaint filed by a BJP Member of Parliament, Mr. Dhankhar suspended Congress Member of Parliament Rajani Patil for allegedly recording the proceedings on her mobile phone. The Congress cried foul that due procedure had not been followed and that she had not been served a notice giving her a chance to explain her position. Mr. Dhankhar interjected the speech of Congress president and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge\u2019s 88-minute speech during the Motion of Thanks to the President\u2019s Address several times. The Opposition has protested the Chair\u2019s repeated direction to \u201cauthenticate\u201d remarks made during speeches. Mr. Kharge has pointed out that \u201cit would be [an] inversion of the system of government if the opposition members are expected to carry out complete investigation, gather evidence and then raise the matter on the floor of the House\u201d.Six portions of Mr. Kharge\u2019s speech were expunged from the Rajya Sabha records, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Lok Sabha speech got 18 cuts. Parliament is the platform where the Opposition has the responsibility to ask questions of the government, which the Council of Ministers has the responsibility to answer. There are parliamentary rules and norms that have evolved over time to achieve this objective. It will be a travesty of parliamentary democracy if the Opposition is penalised for seeking accountability from the government, which in turn is allowed to hide behind rules and obfuscate the issue. It is the government that is in custody of all the information, over which queries are raised in Parliament. The authenticity, or the lack of it, of any assumption that a Member of Parliament may express in the House must be clarified by the government, which is its duty. It is a strange situation that the government has not responded to the serious allegations that it faces of protecting private business interests at the cost of public interest, while those who are raising the questions face suspension in the name of discipline. Parliamentary discipline must ensure that discussions take place, and the government provides the answers.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nparliament\n\n/\n\nParliament proceedings\n\n/\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n\n/\n\nIndian National Congress\n\n/\n\nRajya Sabha\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi",

This time period was given to members of the Employees\u2019 Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 who were in service as on September 1, 2014 and whose employers had made PF contributions in excess of the statutory ceiling, which was \u20b95,000 (up to May 31, 2001) and \u20b96,500 (up to August 31, 2014). But, the EPFO took its own time. The Court, using \u2018discretionary powers\u2019, under Article 142 of the Constitution, had granted these members the four months, which it called a \u201cfurther chance,\u201d as two opportunities had been provided in the 2014 amendment of the EPS. The Court\u2019s rationale was that it found uncertainty as regards the validity of the amendment (quashed by three High Courts), and that the authorities\u2019 interpretation of the cut-off date had come in the way of eligible employees exercising the option within a maximum period of one year (as stipulated in the amended scheme). Unfortunately, the latest circular is not comprehensive. Eligible employees would need additional circulars to be issued before they can make their decision. And, all this needs to be done on or before March 3 \u2014 the Court\u2019s deadline. A member\u2019s expression of consent involves their willingness to allow the transfer of money in the member\u2019s individual PF account, to the Pension Fund, which is a pooled fund. Such a decision cannot be taken in a hurry as such a transfer would mean hiving off a substantial portion of lifetime savings.\rBesides, the number of prospective applicants is likely to be high, as the Court\u2019s judgment made it clear that the amended pension scheme would apply to employees of exempted establishments too \u2014 as in the case of regular establishments. Under such circumstances, a flood of submissions, online or offline, is inevitable, disrupting the normal workload of the PF authorities. The circular has also not taken into account factors in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some employers, having suffered a severe fund crunch, have restricted their contributions to the statutory ceiling even though, till the outbreak of the pandemic, they had, like many others, been making their contributions in excess of the statutory ceiling. The EPFO has to shed light on how it will compute pension for such employees. It would not be out of place to suggest that the time period be extended. Nevertheless, with the EPFO having to comply with the Court order, it should expedite issuing all its guidelines with clear illustrations on higher PF pension.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\npension and welfare\n\n/\n\nwage and pension\n\n/\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nCoronavirus",

        "full_article": "Aggressive exchanges are so ubiquitous in social media that it takes a special one to really shock us, and this is exactly what IPS officer D Roopa and IAS officer Rohini Sindhuri have served up. So nasty, personal and public has been the clash between the two senior women bureaucrats in Karnataka that it has even embarrassed the state government. In a high-pitched election season, opponents have tried to cast this unruly slugfest as a reflection of a weak government. In a counter, both officers were transferred yesterday. But what this startling clash has really put in focus is a larger, disturbing change that civil service ethos is undergoing through participation in social media.\nLast year a parliamentary standing committee said there are 22% fewer IAS officers in the country than the sanctioned strength, and the sanctioned strength is not enough to begin with given the evolving needs of Indian administration. The thing is the private sector still isn\u2019t attractive enough and big enough for government services to lose their charm, aka, prestige, power and job security. Ferocious competition for limited seats tells us that. Therefore, finding more applicants is not the issue. Governments will have to recruit more.\nBut besides quantity, quality has also emerged as a major issue. As D Subbarao has written on this page, lack of reform in incentives and penalties have helped ineptitude, indifference and corruption creep in. The permanent executive also suffers lack of functional independence from the political executive. However, the self-aggrandisement stimulated by social media addictions is a fresh big blow to the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 that are meant to govern both IAS and IPS officers. In social media, promoting work takes a distant second place to promoting the self. Social media activities of some bureaucrats make short shrift of not just \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d but \u201ccourtesy and good behaviour\u201d, too.\nIn the present case Roopa reportedly shared private pictures of Sindhuri on social media. That an IPS officer would do this is bad enough, but, further, police did not register an FIR saying that they were consulting \u201cthe higher-ups for legal opinion\u201d. Sindhuri\u2019s public barrage of allegations against Roopa likewise bypassed official channels for a bigger stage. The reputational damage from ugly social media boil-ups will also extend beyond the individuals concerned. Service seniors and ministers must take note.\n\n",

        "full_article": "February has recorded an unusual surge in temperature. GoI, like everyone else, will be anticipating a torrid summer. Initial forecasts are that peak power demand in April will be 229GW, higher than the June 2022 record of 211GW, and therefore, by the time it\u2019s June this year, demand will be even more. The Electricity Act empowers GoI to ask thermal power plants that rely on imported coal to run at full capacity. Reportedly, this is being done \u2013 if so, it\u2019s good proactive planning by GoI.\nHowever, the 15 power plants designed to run on imported coal represent a weak link in the power generation ecosystem. They are mostly locked into inflexible power purchase agreements when it comes to electricity tariff adjustment. So, their instinct is to rationalise costs. When international coal prices rise these plants\u2019 capacity usage is low. On February 15, they had, on average, a plant load factor of 21% and their coal stock was just 42% of the normative requirement. This strains the system as coal-based plants usually account for 70% of power generation, which climbs to beyond 80% when demand peaks.\nAs coal prices began to rise over the last two years, the share of imports fell as a percentage of total domestic consumption. It was 26% in 2019-20 and by 2021-22, it declined to 20.3%. Higher domestic coal output cannot offset this problem right away. In the short term, GoI now needs to ensure that coal and railway ministries are ready to face the summer surge. The long-term solution may have to centre on pending plans to supply these 15 power plants with domestic coal that is treated to lower its ash content. The heat of the coming summer should add to the urgency.\n\n",

By now, we all know the details of how Phulpori was tortured for hours and threatened by the female leaders of the IU BCL unit for staying at a residential hall without taking their permission.\nUnfortunately, after Phulpori filed a written complaint with the university authorities, it took them a while to take any action in the incident.

However, this day also brings to our attention the thousands of languages around the world whose existence is under constant threat. And we fear for the status of the languages which are dying out in Bangladesh itself, with next to no efforts being expended to preserve them. The number of living languages in the country currently stands at 42. Of these, 36 languages are spoken by Indigenous peoples.\nAccording to a linguistic survey conducted by the International Mother Language Institute (IMLI), there are 14 languages in the country which are considered to be endangered. Of these, for instance, only two speakers of the Kharia language exist anymore. Neither of them has been able to convince their younger kin to practise the language, nor can they themselves write in it. With the passing of these two Kharia speakers \u2013 sisters over the age of 70 who reside in Sreemangal upazila of Sylhet's Moulvibazar district \u2013 the language and the culture associated with it will all but die, too. And this is the unfortunate fate facing several other Indigenous languages, including Kondo, Koda, Soura, Mundari, Kole, Malto, Khumi, Pangkhua, Rengmitcha, Chak, Khyang, Lusai, and Laleng (Patro). And even the more widely spoken ethnic languages, such as Sadri in the northern flatlands, are becoming more and more diluted with Bangla.\nIt is an understandable but unfortunate tragedy that the youth of many Indigenous communities themselves do not feel keen on using their own languages,\u00a0with Bangla being the dominant language in all arenas. Couple that with the relevant government authorities' own lack of efforts, and it is no wonder that these languages are on their way out of existence. We must ask, what has the IMLI been doing to ensure that the country's Indigenous and ethnic languages can be promoted and preserved? The aforementioned linguistic survey has been its only notable achievement since its establishment in 2010. But even that is supposedly coming out in volumes, with the first and only one being published way back in 2019. The government's initiative to print textbooks in Indigenous languages (till a limited number of classes) also falls short as it has failed to ensure that there are teachers appointed in schools who are properly trained and can actually conduct lessons in these languages, too.\nThe UN has declared the period between 2022 to 2032 as the International Decade of Indigenous Languages. We hope that our language authorities will heed this initiative and not only take active steps to preserve the dying Indigenous languages of the country, but also fulfil some of their earlier promises in this regard as well as the demands of Indigenous and ethnic communities themselves. We cannot just sit back and watch the demise of so many rich languages and the cultures attached to them.

        "full_article": "The world has entered the third era of loss and damage from human-induced climate change. In the first era, the experts were focused on completely avoiding the potential losses and damages from climate change by stopping \u2013 or at least drastically reducing \u2013 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which caused the global temperature to rise. This understanding came from the scientific community through the first and second assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At the global policymaking level, it led to the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and subsequent Kyoto Protocol in 1997, in which developed countries agreed to reduce their emissions, with developing countries to follow later.\nOne other aspect of this first era was the emphasis on mitigation measures to reduce emissions, which was treated largely as an environmental issue.\nHowever, when the third assessment report (AR3) of the IPCC was published in 2001, it became apparent that the promises of reducing emissions were not taken seriously, and emissions were continuing to rise.\nThe main message from AR3 was that the world had failed to avoid climate change impacts through mitigation, and that there would now be inevitable impacts that the world now needed to prepare for through adaptation measures. This started the second era of minimising losses and damages. The second important message in AR3 was that, while all countries would be adversely impacted over time, the poorest countries and the poorest communities in richer countries would be affected first and the hardest.\nThis, in turn, led to adaptation being adopted as a new strategy at COP7 in Morocco in 2001. This era of adaptation actions also meant that the development actors both at national and global levels began to get involved in climate actions along with the environmental actors.\nUnfortunately, the world failed to make use of the adaptation measures too. Hence, as of last year, we entered the third era of addressing loss and damage from human-induced climate change. The turning point was the publication of the sixth assessment report (AR6) of the IPCC where the climate scientists, for the very first time, stated that there was unequivocal scientific evidence that there were adverse impacts that could be attributed to the fact that the global temperature had already gone above one degree Celsius since the First Industrial Revolution due to GHG emissions.\nThis game-changing scientific report was accompanied by the visible evidence of unprecedented extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, heatwaves and wildfires around the world.\nAt the UNFCCC level, this reality was also recognised by the historic achievement of establishing a funding mechanism to address loss and damage, agreed upon by all countries at COP27 in Egypt last year.\nOne of the most significant outcomes of this realisation is that climate change and development can no longer be treated separately. Indeed, the main lesson of the Covid-19 global crisis also points to the need to tackle all the different crises facing the globe in a multisectoral as well as multinational manner, which is not easy.\nAs we enter this third era of loss and damage, for which no country is really prepared, the whole world will need to find better ways of cooperation within and across national boundaries. Bangladesh has the opportunity of being a global leader in this mission. The first step would be to acknowledge the reality of losses and damages from human-induced climate change in different parts of the country, and then involve all stakeholders in developing a national strategy to tackle loss and damage through a whole-of-society approach.\nThis new initiative on loss and damage can then build considerable knowledge and capabilities for the government as well as civil society to adapt to climate change.\nDr Saleemul Huq\u00a0is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).\n\n",

The government's initiative to print textbooks in Indigenous languages (till a limited number of classes) also falls short as it has failed to ensure that there are teachers appointed in schools who are properly trained and can actually conduct lessons in these languages, too.\nThe UN has declared the period between 2022 to 2032 as the International Decade of Indigenous Languages. We hope that our language authorities will heed this initiative and not only take active steps to preserve the dying Indigenous languages of the country, but also fulfil some of their earlier promises in this regard as well as the demands of Indigenous and ethnic communities themselves. We cannot just sit back and watch the demise of so many rich languages and the cultures attached to them. Lest we forget, the state is constitutionally mandated to \"take steps to protect and develop the unique local culture and tradition of the tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities.\"\n",
