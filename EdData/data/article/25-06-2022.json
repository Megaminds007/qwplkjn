That this bloc of five disparate countries has not only made it to its 14th summit, but has been able to demonstrate some concrete, albeit modest, outcomes of cooperation, such as the emergence of the New Development Bank (NDB), suggests there remains a strong convergence of interests amid undeniable differences. Indeed, ever since the first summit in Yekaterinburg in 2009, BRICS has had more than its fair share of naysayers, particularly in the West, and has been derided as a talk shop. In his address to the summit on June 23, which was hosted by China this year and held virtually, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the binding glue as \u201ca similar approach to global governance\u201d. That approach, according to the lengthy joint Beijing Declaration that followed, was premised on \u201cmaking instruments of global governance more inclusive, representative and participatory\u201d.That is certainly a laudable goal. However, the NDB, which has since its launch in 2015 funded around $30 billion worth of projects in emerging nations, still remains for the grouping an isolated example of their common interests translating into tangible outcomes. That points to another summit take-away: despite a tall agenda, the bloc remains constrained by differences. For instance, on two key issues for the grouping \u2014 UN reforms and terrorism \u2014 members India and China have found themselves on opposing sides of the debate. India and Brazil have made common cause on pushing for an expanded UN Security Council, yet China has suggested it is not in favour of a permanent seat for India. On terrorism, the recent blocking by China of an attempt by India to sanction the LeT terrorist, Abdul Rehman Makki, at the UNSC sanctions committee, served as a reminder of contrasting approaches. Indeed, those two different approaches found mention in the Beijing Declaration, which acknowledged both India\u2019s concerns on a lack of transparency at the sanctions committee and Chinese claims, seemingly driven by the desire to shield Pakistan, that these cases amounted to \u201cpoliticisation\u201d. On Ukraine, the bloc affirmed a commitment to respect sovereignty, despite Russia\u2019s actions, and stopped short of condemning NATO, as Russia and China have done, reflecting different views within BRICS. These differences certainly cast doubt on the bloc\u2019s loftier goals of reorienting the global order. They do not, however, suggest that the BRICS countries cannot cooperate on issues where interests align, whether in financing projects, as the NDB has done, working on climate change, as India and China have continued to do despite the LAC crisis, or even on space cooperation, where the five countries have agreed to create a joint constellation of remote sensing satellites.",

        "full_article": "A pre-dawn court order may have granted temporary relief to AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam from being stripped of his part in the party\u2019s joint leadership, but it is doubtful if his isolation can be prevented for long. It may only be a matter of time before the 50-year-old party comes under the full control of co-cordinator and Mr. Panneerselvam\u2019s partner-turned-rival Edappadi K. Palaniswami. What has divided them now is possibly that Mr. Palaniswami seems to have greater support among legislators and district secretaries, and his camp has begun to feel that Mr. Panneerselvam is enjoying disproportionate clout in the party\u2019s affairs. At a General Council (GC) meeting on Thursday, it was expected that the party\u2019s by-laws would be changed to abolish the current \u2018dual leadership\u2019 (coordinators), and restore the post of general secretary as the sole seat of power. An attempt to obtain a restraining order against the meeting failed before a single judge, but the Panneerselvam camp managed to get the Chief Justice\u2019s permission to move a midnight appeal before a Bench. Passing orders at around 4.30 a.m., the Bench restrained the GC from making any decision other than upon the 23 items on the agenda that had the approval of both coordinators. That they had agreed on a set of resolutions was used to make a prima facie case for an interim order against any other decision being made, scuttling plans for an impromptu discussion or decision on the leadership question.A question arises over the need for the eleventh-hour judicial intervention. Any likely prejudice could always have been subsequently remedied if it truly went against the party majority view. It is doubtful whether a leader can seek a restraint on a majority-backed decision by which he would be possibly aggrieved. Even though a dual leadership system is in place, it is difficult to contend that nothing that lacks the approval of both leaders can be decided by the party\u2019s apex decision-making body. After all, it was this body that abolished the general secretary\u2019s post in 2017 and created the posts of two coordinators. It had also changed the \u2018unamendable\u2019 rule that the general secretary should be elected by all the primary members. In 2021, the party\u2019s executive committee again amended the by-laws to the effect that the primary members would now elect the two coordinators jointly by a single vote. Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami were jointly elected in a subsequent election. One of the resolutions ultimately not taken up at the GC meeting was to ratify this decision. The effect of non-ratification on the party\u2019s affairs remains to be seen, but it is clear that Mr. Panneerselvam\u2019s options are limited to either playing a subordinate role or striking it out on his own.",

        "full_article": "The need for a bridge over the mighty Padma River may not have been felt so dearly by people other than those who have been born and bred in the southwestern part of Bangladesh. The Padma has been a major stumbling block for the people of the relatively underdeveloped southern region, in terms of communication and trade, as the turbulent river literally isolated the entire region from the rest of the country \u2013 including the capital, Dhaka.\nAs someone with a root in one of the southern districts, I have been a witness to the innumerable miseries that people have been enduring while crossing the river. From getting stuck in tailbacks at the ferry terminals to the agonising wait for boarding ferries or launches \u2013 many of which are in dilapidated conditions \u2013 and the risks involved in travelling by launches by navigating the strong current of the river, the journey of millions of people from the 21 southwestern districts to and from Dhaka has always been strenuous and perilous. And the suffering compounds ahead of any festival like Eid or during natural calamities.\nI have been commuting to and from the capital quite regularly since mid-1999, when I came to Dhaka to pursue my higher studies. At that time, the long-haul buses would come to Dhaka either via Daulatdia-Paturia route or Mawa-Kawrakandi route. And every time before I took a trip back to my home and before I returned to Dhaka, I used to shudder at the thought of getting stuck in a tailback at the ferry ghat at Daulatdia of Rajbari and taking the long ferry journey. In fact, my first ever experience on the Padma River was terrible and tedious. I can still remember the day when our bus, after being stuck at the ghat for two hours, boarded a seemingly decades-old larger ferry, popularly known as a ro-ro ferry. The weather was gloomy, with strong currents disrupting the normal ferry services. It took us more than three hours to reach Aricha ghat. At that time, ferries and launches used to follow the Daulatdia-Aricha route for crossing the river \u2013 a route that would take more than two hours to complete by ferries. When it came to trucks loaded with non-perishable goods, the situation got quite horrible as they had to wait for two to three days at the ghat to cross the river on a ferry.\nBut it was around that time that I, like millions of people in my region, started dreaming of a \"Padma Bridge,\" as a bridge across the mighty Padma had already been in talks. The idea gained momentum after the construction of the Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge (which was opened for the public in June 1998) over the Jamuna, ushering in new hope and optimism among the people of the southwestern region. I can remember the chitchat of fellow passengers desperately yearning for a bridge over the Padma when we would get stuck at the ferry ghats on our way home or to Dhaka. We saw our collective dream slowly taking a shape in the following years when the newspapers and television channels reported primary measures like the feasibility study being finalised for building a bridge. And in 2007, the people of the southern region were elated to see the government approving the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project to be built with donor assistance.\nHowever, in September 2011, our dream faced a severe blow when the lead donor, the World Bank, suspended its promised USD 1.2 billion in loans over allegations of corruption conspiracy, which the government denied. Other financiers, like Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), also cancelled their loan proposals, leading to the billion-dollar project being stalled for some time.\nAlthough the allegations against the government officials were later found to be untrue by the Anti-Corruption Commission and a Dhaka court, we were heartbroken and prayed that the endeavour of building the bridge would succeed. Then, in 2012, we saw a revival of our dream when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made her bold announcement to go ahead with the implementation of the project using the country's own funds. Hope was rekindled among the southern people. And when the prime minister inaugurated the main construction work of the country's most challenging engineering project in December 2015, we realised our dream was inching closer to reality. As the construction work progressed \u2013 with tonnes of steels and rocks piled up on both banks and gigantic cranes installing spans \u2013 we, the southern people, and the entire nation, started waiting with bated breath for the glorious moment. Today is the day when our dreams come true as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurates the Padma Bridge.\nFrom tomorrow, the agonies of crossing the Padma River only by ferries or launches would come to an end. From tomorrow, a new chapter is expected to begin in the lives of the people of the southern region as the bridge will enhance connectivity, facilitate transportation of agri-products, and play a significant role in boosting trade and commerce in the region. The impacts that the 6.15km Padma Bridge is going to have on the communication system and the economy have widely been discussed with economists, projecting a growth of the GDP by 1.2 percent.\nOf course, the economic benefits of the bridge can only be attained to its potential if it is considered as an economic corridor instead of a mere means of connectivity. For that, the government needs to build infrastructures like special economic zones and industrial parks so that a wide range of industries can be developed, which will create employment opportunities. As a native of the region, the inauguration of the bridge will be a moment of pride for me, and the bridge itself is something I feel emotionally attached to. It will be a dream come true for the people of the southern region. Yet, I believe, the real benefits of the Padma Bridge will be brought about when the government puts the supporting investments and policies in place.\n\u00a0\nWasim Bin Habib\u00a0is deputy planning editor at\u00a0The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "The United States appears to have entered a new cold war with both China and Russia. And US leaders' portrayal of the confrontation as one between democracy and authoritarianism fails the smell test, especially at a time when the same leaders are actively courting a systematic human rights abuser like Saudi Arabia. Such hypocrisy suggests that it is at least partly global hegemony, not values, that is really at stake.\nFor two decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the US was clearly number one. But then came disastrously misguided wars in the Middle East, the 2008 financial crash, rising inequality, the opioid epidemic, and other crises that seemed to cast doubt on the superiority of America's economic model.\nOf course, America does not want to be dethroned. But it is simply inevitable that China will outstrip the US economically. Not only is its population four times larger than America's, but its economy also has been growing three times faster for many years.\nWhile China has not done anything to declare itself as a strategic threat to America, the writing is on the wall. In Washington, there is a bipartisan consensus that China could pose a strategic threat, and that the least the US should do to mitigate the risk is to stop helping the Chinese economy grow. According to this view, pre-emptive action is warranted, even if it means violating the World Trade Organization rules that the US itself did so much to write and promote.\nThis front in the new cold war opened well before Russia invaded Ukraine. And senior US officials have since warned that the war must not divert attention from the real long-term threat: China. Given that Russia's economy is around the same size as Spain's, its \"no limits\" partnership with China hardly seems to matter economically.\nBut a country at \"war\" needs a strategy, and the US cannot win a new great-power contest by itself; it needs friends. But Trump did everything he could to alienate those countries, and the Republicans have provided ample reason to question whether the US is a reliable partner. Moreover, the US also must win the hearts and minds of billions of people in the world's developing countries and emerging markets \u2013 not just to have numbers on its side, but also to secure access to critical resources.\nIts long history of exploiting other countries does not help, and nor does its deeply embedded racism. Most recently, US policymakers contributed to global \"vaccine apartheid,\" whereby rich countries got all the shots needed while poorer countries were left to their fates. Meanwhile, America's new cold war opponents have made their vaccines readily available to others at or below cost, while also helping countries develop their own vaccine production facilities.\nThe credibility gap is even wider when it comes to climate change, which disproportionately affects those in the Global South, who have the least ability to cope. While major emerging markets have become the leading sources of GHG emissions today, US cumulative emissions are still the largest by far. Developed countries continue to add to them, and, worse, have not even delivered on their meagre promises to help poor countries manage the effects of the climate crisis that the rich world caused. Instead, US banks contribute to looming debt crises in many countries, often revealing a depraved indifference to the suffering that results.\nEurope and America excel at lecturing others on what is morally right and economically sensible. But the message that usually comes through \u2013 as the persistence of US and European agricultural subsidies makes clear \u2013 is \"do what I say, not what I do.\"\nAt the same time, China has excelled not at delivering lectures but at furnishing poor countries with hard infrastructure. Yes, these countries are often left deeply in debt; but given Western banks' own behaviour as creditors in the developing world, the US and others are hardly in a position to point the finger.\nIf the US is going to embark on a new cold war, it had better understand what it will take to win. Cold wars ultimately are won with the soft power of attraction and persuasion. To come out on top, we must convince the rest of the world to buy not just our products, but also the social, political, and economic system we're selling.\nThe US might know how to make the world's best bombers and missile systems, but they will not help us here. Instead, we must offer concrete help to developing and emerging-market countries, starting with a waiver on all Covid-related intellectual property so that they can produce vaccines and treatments for themselves.\nUntil we have proven ourselves worthy to lead, we cannot expect others to march to our drum.\n\u00a0\nJoseph E Stiglitz,\u00a0a Nobel laureate in economics, is University Professor at Columbia University and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.\n",

        "full_article": "I have to admit it, I am becoming a fan of Ananta Jalil. Not because of the explosive, deafening trailer of his latest movie, Din: The Day \u2013 a Bangladeshi-Iranian joint venture shot in Iran where AJ (\"A Zay\") the superhero is performing logic-defying stunts, shooting a hundred bad guys while keeping his makeup intact and sporadically sporting his long auburnish w-i-g \u2013 ahem, mane. Neither is it because of that distinctive diction we so love as he makes speeches, listing the accomplishments of Bangladesh including how it has hosted the Rohingya refugees (which, I am sure, is somehow relevant to the intricate plot involving Afghani terrorists, drug cartels and an extravaganza of guns that would put the staunchest supporter of the National Rifle Association of America to shame).\nNo, this time it's because of Ananta Jalil the human being.\nWhen news of the devastating floods and human suffering started coming in, we were pleasantly surprised by a Facebook post from the much reviled and revered star. Ananta Jalil, of \"Mansester\" and \"orenz zues\" fame, without any cringe-worthy utterings,\u00a0 announced he would stand by the flood victims and help them as much as he could. He would donate money for relief from profits earned from his business and movies. Admittedly, one would have wished he hadn't mentioned that he would sacrifice one or two cows instead of the usual 12 and donate the money instead, but at least we know his heart is in the right place. According to news reports, he will be donating Tk 30 lakh for flood victims. What's more, he has urged the well-off to do the same.\nIn fact there are individuals, NGOs and private organisations (like Bidyanondo Foundation) taking the initiative to help. The biggest challenge is to actually reach the relief to the people in remote areas where the water is so choppy and the weather so volatile, even the armed forces are finding it difficult to navigate. Tour operators like Onirban Boat have turned their holiday cruise boats into rescue boats, picking up stranded people from the remote areas, taking them to shelters. A number of tourism agencies part of the e-Tourism Association of Bangladesh used their boats stationed in remote areas to rush to the stranded people, housing them, providing food and carrying relief items. They are trying to raise funds from members and other sources to continue their relief operations.\u00a0 A barrister, Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, announced on his Facebook page that he has raised Tk 97\u00a0lakh in just two days. Bangladeshi expatriates in the US are raising funds to arrange relief to be reached to the stranded.\nThese are heartwarming examples of spontaneous empathy and quick action. But they are still far from being adequate considering the widespread, prolonged nature of this catastrophe. An estimated 7,334,000 people have already been affected in Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar,\u00a0 Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Habiganj, Brahmanbaria, and Mymensingh. This is an ongoing humanitarian disaster, the financial, social and health effects of which will continue for months on end. In the meantime, every second counts and people's lives are on the line. So, why isn't there a more enthusiastic response from the wealthier sections of society?\nIt brings us to the issue of a bubble culture \u2013 people inside the bubble are impervious to the suffering of others as long as they do not know them and definitely if those suffering are part of the \"invisible masses.\" They will cry oceans with the tortured heroine and battered hero in their favourite drama serial but will feel nothing for the real life heroes and heroines battling for their very lives as the waters swallow up all their belongings, their homes, their crops, food, possessions, their cattle and, terrifyingly, sometimes even their loved ones. They will not know about the mother and her five children who have not eaten for two days, the farmer who has lost all the paddy he had kept to sell and feed his family in the coming months or the thousands of families who await a bleak future of destitution and endless borrowing from loan sharks just to stay alive. What kind of Eid these people can expect to have is not something the majority of the rich have time to think about.\nThere is a disturbing obtuseness among the wealthy that makes them unmoved by the acute suffering of their compatriots who are lower down the social ladder. Perhaps the floods in Sunamganj or Sylhet are not part of their newsfeed as much as the latest update on Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Perhaps we need to revive the photo opportunities of the old days when anyone could get their few seconds of fame by handing a check to the PM's relief fund and be seen on BTV news while doing so. It is strange that people will spend huge amounts of money for the salvation of their soul or a confirmed seat in paradise but not for helping someone just for the sake of helping. Why is philanthropy so rare in Bangladesh, despite the rising number of millionaires?\nThere is something ignoble about a class of people which spends obscene amounts of money on jewellery, watches, cars, and expensive holidays in Europe but have hardly any money to spare for charity just to be good human beings. Ananta Jalil has stated what rich people are supposed to do with their money \u2013 share it with the needy, helpless, and distressed. The privileged in society should listen to his appeal and stand by their brothers and sisters whose lives have been turned upside down by this disaster. If we can't help them directly, we can always give our money to groups and organisations involved in rescue and relief. Sometimes we just need to be reminded of the obvious, as Ananta Jalil philosophically stated in his Facebook video: You can't take your wealth to the grave.\n\u00a0\nAasha Mehreen Amin is joint editor at The Daily Star.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Over the last few years \u2013 under the BJP government \u2013 India's religious polarisation has increased in degree and intensity. Multiple factors have contributed to the ever-expanding divide among religious communities in India, from policy-related institutionalised approaches which are divisive in nature, to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam, to the more administration-related decision \u2013 that is, new rules being imposed in various states that are biased against minority communities, and petty actions such as hijab bans in educational institutions, the right-wing rhetoric of majority of BJP leaders, and the attacks on Muslim and Christian places of worship. This polarisation has resulted in the side-lining of some of India's core precepts of pluralism, polyphony, heterodoxy, and communal harmony \u2013 ethos the nation has been built upon since its independence in 1947.\nThe recent protests, although sparked by irresponsible, derogatory, and provocative comments by BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), is the outcome of built-up sentiments among Muslims as a result of recent years of religious discrimination and \"hate\" massages they have had to endure in their own motherland.\nThis latest incident has not only disrupted India's internal stability, with communal unrest spreading in multiple states, but the nation has also had to face backlash from various countries, including its key trading partners in the Middle East. According to Al Jazeera, India's financial trading with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries exceeded USD 150 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2022. Its exports to the Gulf countries had been of around USD 44 billion, a 58 percent increase from the previous year. Indian imports from the Gulf countries stood at around USD 111 billion, an increase of about 85 percent. And these strong trade ties have now been put at risk by the provocative comments of the BJP spokesperson.\nWhat is worrying is that using this incident as a tool, vested quarters in both the Gulf countries and in India are propagating the boycotting of trade relations. Social media is abuzz with hashtags such as #BoycottIndiaProducts and #BoycottQatarAirway. This is an alarming development, not just for India but for the overall state of global trade, as trade disruptions between India and its key trading partners in the Middle East would have a ripple effect on global trade.\nThese incidents should be an eye-opener for India, leading to a moment of realisation for the government that the majoritarian, right-wing policy that it is currently pursuing is highly destructive for the nation and its people.\nIndia \u2013 the world's largest democracy, home to more than 200 million Muslims, a melting pot of diverse faiths and cultures \u2013 is also one of the fastest growing economies in the world. According to the IMF, India is projected to grow by 8.2 percent in 2022-23, compared to the 4.4 percent estimated growth for China. At this point, India cannot afford internal unrest that may hamper its economic growth.\nTo realise its full economic potential, India must change its current course of action with regard to its treatment of minority religious communities. Suppression of minority communities, disrespecting their basic human rights, and their rights enshrined in the Indian constitution, discriminating against them, and cornering them in their own country will only aggravate the current internal tensions which may spiral out of control in the short- to mid-term. This would be a highly undesirable development, not only for India, but also its neighbours, including Bangladesh.\nThe way India has so far handled the current protests through coercive actions \u2013 state government in UP bulldozing Muslim homes; law enforcement agencies unleashing force to suppress the protests, leading to two deaths \u2013 shows that the government is still perhaps under the impression that its hardline policy against minorities is the right track to be on. But this only shows that minority sentiments are at a boiling point, which need to be cooled down at the earliest, for the greater interest of the nation and of the South Asian region.\nThough we appreciate the few stern, albeit belated, measures the Indian government has taken against these hate-mongering elements, further such measures are immediately called for. Those who wish India well hope that it will understand that the only way forward for the nation is religious inclusion and communal harmony. According to Mahatma Gandhi, \"True religion is not a narrow dogma. It is not external observance. It is faith in God and living in the presence of God. It means faith in a future life, in truth and Ahimsa.\" It is this same philosophy that the current Modi government needs to revisit and internalise, principles the nation's foundation is based on.\nFrom Ashoka to Akbar to Gandhi, everyone advocated for a healthy practice of heterodoxy and dialogues, which has sustained India's vibrant secular character. And these are deeply rooted in how Indian thoughts have been shaped over centuries; one needs only to revisit the Vedas and the two great Indian epics, The Ramayana and the Mahabharata, that are so rich in discussions and deliberations encompassing a wide array of topics, including theology, philosophy, and politics. These values and characteristics have helped the Indian democracy thrive, enabled communities to live together in harmony, and it is these same attributes that need to be reintegrated into the nation's perception of its identity for it to overcome the challenges it is facing.\nThe present government needs to rebuild the burnt bridges by engaging in dialogue with the aggrieved communities and assuring them of their rights and security, which should be backed up by appropriate actions, including policy interventions, in order to demonstrate the commitment of the government towards religious inclusion.\nMoreover, everyone should be aligned towards common national objectives of shared prosperity and economic growth.\nThe government, as distinct from the BJP, needs to think beyond the Hindutva agenda, and consider the bigger landscape of Indian historic legacy and global standing. It is the core values of the nation that need to be prioritised over the agenda of a particular section, regardless of it being the majority in terms of numbers. Nothing less is expected from the world's largest democracy, with such a rich history of religious co-existence and communal harmony.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTasneem Tayeb\u00a0is a columnist for\u00a0The Daily Star.\u00a0Her Twitter handle is @tasneem_tayeb\n\n",

The 6.15km multipurpose bridge, one of the longest river crossings in the world, is expected to increase the GDP of the impoverished south-southwest Bangladesh by as much as 2.3 percent, and the national GDP by 1.2 percent. In addition to establishing the much-needed direct road and rail communications between Dhaka, the capital city and the hub of all things, and 21 districts in the southern region, the bridge will also lead to greater connectivity and trade among Asian countries. Despite concerns about the escalated cost of the project, credible and independent research has concluded that for every taka spent on the bridge, it is expected to generate about Tk 2 of social good. It is reassuring to know that the people's investment will be returned to the people.\nBut beyond all facts and figures, the Padma Bridge stands as the embodiment of the dream of hundreds of thousands of people in south and southwest Bangladesh for decades. It is a testament to a nation's determination to confront and conquer all challenges and stand on one's own feet. Padma is notorious for its strong current. Taming this river to build the foundation of the bridge was no mean feat. This mammoth project has been implemented with money raised by ourselves. It did face challenges: Deadlines had to be extended, project cost was revised several times, a pandemic almost brought the construction work to a halt. But all these challenges fell flat before the sheer determination of our prime minister to see the project through.\nWe congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u00a0on this auspicious occasion for her vision and determination. There is no doubt that without her steely resolve this project would not have seen the light of day. We also note the invaluable contribution of the experts who turned dreams into concrete realities, the workers who toiled day in and day out, even during the pandemic, to breathe life into the steel and concrete, and the local industries who supplied quality materials for the project. Most of all, we congratulate the people of the country, whose dreams and funds have truly made it possible.\nMoving forward, we hope that the Padma Bridge is only the beginning of a new future for the people of southern Bangladesh, and that steps are taken to ensure that judicious support is provided to the southern districts and those most vulnerable to truly benefit from the mega investment. It is a proud moment for Bangladesh, a moment that can launch us into a future where the needs and aspirations of the people finally take centre stage of policymaking.\n",

        "full_article": "With the waterlogging problem of Chattogram city going from bad to worse, we are shocked to learn that the Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) has actually played an active role in deteriorating the situation. Reportedly, a building constructed by the CCC on the city's Chaktai canal \u2013 without taking any clearance from the Chattogram Development Authority (CDA) \u2013 has been clogging the drainage system and causing waterlogging in the adjacent areas during monsoon for the last two decades. Although the CDA issued a notice to the CCC in 2016 to demolish the building, the latter did not comply. The structure is still there despite an order by the High Court in March this year to evict all the structures built on the canal.\nReportedly, over the last few decades, many such structures were erected on the land of the canal. According to a report submitted to the HC recently by the deputy commissioner of Chattogram, 48 illegal structures, including the city corporation establishment, residential flats, tin-shed buildings, business establishments and warehouses, have been built on around 20,000 square feet of the canal, obstructing its natural waterflow. While the Chaktai canal was once 61 feet in width (according to the RS survey), it has now been reduced to a narrow flow of 10 to 30 feet.\nAs the canal, which used to serve as one of the key drainage channels of the port city, has been choked by these structures, many parts of Chattogram city now go under knee- to waist-deep water even after a moderate rain. All these structures need to be demolished and the Chaktai canal needs to be excavated to reduce waterlogging in the city. Besides, all other canals and water bodies of the port city also need to be recovered.\nThe problem, however, is that there is a rivalry going on between the CCC and the CDA about their job responsibilities. While the CCC claims that it is the CDA's responsibility to solve the issue, the CDA says that they are just implementing a project to recover some of the canals and drains of the city. According to them, the CCC should take responsibility to recover the rest of the canals and water bodies that have been grabbed and filled up. And that is only justified. How can such a big-scale problem be solved by only implementing one project? We think the CCC and the CDA should work in coordination with each other to resolve the issue. The CCC can prove its willingness to work in this regard by first demolishing the building it has constructed on the Chaktai canal.\n",

At the level of US healthcare it will have a swift impact on the ground, with around half the states in the country expected to now ban all or most abortions. In political terms, it means a great setback for Biden\u2019s presidency and a proportionate affirmation of Trump\u2019s. The conservative movement will be very grateful for his judicial appointments that have enabled their wish-fulfilment. But above all what this is is a serious setback for the movement for women\u2019s bodily autonomy, and for the larger idea that she gets to make decisions about herself.\nIt is worth noting that half a century ago when American women won the right to abortion, only 20% of those aged between 25-34 were without a child as compared to 52% today, only 11% of those between 25-44 had a college degree as compared to 41% today, and only 17% of jobs in management for people aged 16-44 were held by women as compared to 45% today. Reproductive freedoms are deeply linked to economic freedoms.\nIn the US itself the months to come will see legislative fightback against yesterday\u2019s decision. But however dreadful the world feels about the US situation right now, the overall trend of liberalising abortion laws from developed to developing countries will not be impacted. In India neither is this a political issue nor is any conservative judicial revisiting of abortion rights on the table. It is nonetheless a cautionary tale on not taking any assaults on women\u2019s rights lightly, for they can really snowball into society-wide tragedies.\n\n",

IVC, a bronze age marvel, is perhaps still the acme of the 162-year-old Archaeological Survey of India\u2019s work. And its lessons remain relevant to ASI today.\nASI describes the maintenance of ancient monuments as its prime concern. There are 3,693 monuments under its ambit. Important as this task is, it\u2019s worth asking if the current prioritisation has an adverse impact on its excavation activity. This is where the IVC chapter gains salience. Historian Nayanjot Lahiri observed that when ASI connected the dots and publicised the antiquity of IVC in 1924, it had a positive spin-off on funding. For 2022-23, ASI\u2019s budgetary allocation is an underwhelming Rs 1,080 crore. Given the richness of many cultures that lie buried, a couple of exciting excavations could nudge GoI to set aside more.\nTwo changes will help the cause of excavations. GoI has tried different schemes to draw in more private funding into preserving monuments, without loosening ASI\u2019s control over the core areas. It\u2019s an approach that can free ASI resources. Advent of technology such as light detection and ranging change the economics of excavations. If deployed well, newer technology may well lead to another IVC-like moment.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Pakistan, which played an important role in containing the spread of communism, continues to be of help to the US\nUS State Department spokesperson Ned Price recently commented in favour of advancing the \u201cUS-Pakistan partnership\u201d in a manner that serves their \u201cmutual interests.\u201d Elsewhere, at the CNN News18 Town Hall, S. Jaishankar stated that a \"lot of India's problems with Pakistan are directly attributable to the support that the United States gave to Pakistan.\" The link between the US support to Pakistan and India\u2019s problems needs to be revisited.\nTheoretically, the power of the weak states to attract the great powers has been well established. Weak states cannot defend themselves. Consequently, they seek financial and military aid in exchange for their strategic autonomy and the geostrategic location. Pakistan is one such state.\nSoviet Union leader Stalin first extended an invitation to Pakistan PM Liaquat Ali Khan in 1949 to visit Moscow. The fundamental differences between an Islamist state and a communist Soviet prevented that entente; hence, Pakistan sided with the US and played an important role in containing the spread of communism.\nBy 1955, Pakistan had joined two regional defence pacts, the South East Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization (Baghdad Pact). A little before 1955, in 1953, when Ayub Khan visited Turkey, he reiterated Dulles's 'northern tier defence pact' in which the two countries would occupy a prominent position. Later in 1954, the Turko-Iraqi agreement (Baghdad Pact) superseded the Turko-Pak plan.\nConsequently, from 1953 to 1961, Islamabad received nearly $2 billion in US assistance, one-quarter of this in military aid. Apart from this data, information retrieved from the Stockholm Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that from 1955 to 1959, US arms exports amounted to $1.02 billion. When correlated with Pakistan's then financial situation, strong indications of a vicious cycle of US aid and US arms exports emerge. In the budding relationship between the two, the core security concerns of India, a democratic nonaligned country, were sidelined.\nUpon India's vehement protests, oral assurances were given by Eisenhower to Nehru that the US would take care of the situation in a case of Pakistan's aggression against India. Thus, while India was idealistically following a nonaligned policy, Pakistan was hard bargaining its geostrategic location in lieu of military aid. According to the strategic experts, nearly four-fifths of all the foreign aid Pakistan received during 1951-60 came from the US. From the 1960s to the late 1970s, there was a brief period when US aid to Pakistan decreased.\nThe 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan again allowed Pakistan to extract more aid from the US. In exchange for Pakistan's role in the Afghan war, a $400-million US aid was offered to Pakistan. It was rejected by the Zia-ul-Haq regime in 1980 and was labeled as 'peanuts.' Haq eyed the F-16, which Islamabad later got.\nThus, from 1983 to 1990, Pakistan received military aid of $3.73 billion along with 1,000 Stinger missiles, and the component of US arms sales was $2.2 billion. This was the same period when Pakistan's proxy war in Kashmir started, including the massacre of Kashmiri Hindus.\nAlso, at a regional level, many security experts attribute the birth of the Taliban to ISI and US agencies. Had the US assistance not been there, Pakistan would not have been so aggressive against India and its other neighbours, such as Afghanistan and Iran. Thus, the relationship between Pakistan and the US has always been based on a patron-client state wherein foreign or military aid is given to serve the US' geopolitical interests.\nIn the post-Cold War phase, Pakistan was reeling under sanctions due to its nuclear tests and was denied any military aid. However, the 9/11 attacks in the US again brought Pakistan to the forefront of Washington's South Asia policy. As per the SIPRI data, during 2002-14 Pakistan, as a major non-NATO ally, got military aid worth $5.81 billion and the arms sales component was $3.2 billion.\nThis was the same period when the Nandimarg massacre and Mumbai attacks took place. All these attacks were attributed to Pakistan. India collected the 'proof' and gave it to the US, hoping that the US might acknowledge it and help India. Little did India realise that the geopolitics of national interests, military aid, and arms trade are closely interrelated factors. Hence Pakistan was never labeled as a 'terrorist state' by the US.\nIt was only after Pakistan's backstabbing of the US in Afghanistan that former US president Donald Trump realised America's mistake and commented in 2018 that it had \"foolishly\" given aid and, in return, merely got \"lies and deceit.\"\nToday, despite Washington's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and the backstabbing by Pakistan in Afghanistan, the US is all set to re-engage Pakistan, which will harm India's interests.\nGiven the evolving situation, India too is changing. The coupling of strategic autonomy and Atmanirbhar Bharat in the defence sector is the answer to the geopolitics of the patron-client relationship.\n(The author is Assistant Professor, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda)",

He even elaborated the Union Government\u2019s purported plans to, at the local level, have North Karnataka as a separate State, and, at the national level, to split Maharashtra into three states and Uttar Pradesh into four. The six-term member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, who currently holds the portfolio in the Ministry of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, is a vocal proponent of separate statehood for north Karnataka. A video of him making the statement, which took place at a Belagavi Bar Association event, has since gone viral. Ostensibly, the blueprint primarily takes into account the population numbers of bigger States; such States would be suitably bifurcated for the ease of governance and altogether 50 States would come into existence after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, as per the so-claimed initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\u00a0 It actually is high time that IT companies, who have Bengaluru their home, looked out outside the metropolis, especially since north Karnataka has huge potential.\nThough Katti admitted that it\u2019s not his party\u2019s official stand, he exhorted the people of north Karnataka to \u201cmake it happen\u201d. He may have a point, though. Bengaluru is bursting at seams with its burgeoning population; it lacks water supply for citizens, who have to spend hours in traffic jams. The statements by Katti, who represents the Hukkeri Assembly constituency, have reignited the regional divide debate in Karnataka in which most of the population and leaders from the northern parts of the State have been demanding statehood to get better amenities and development for the region. But this scheme by the ruling dispensation is quite understandable provided it\u2019s aimed squarely at providing better governance to the grassroots, bring development to the remotest regions and benefit the last man standing at the end of the spectrum. However, if the end aim is to reap narrow dividends for a particular party, the planned move can\u2019t be condoned. However, as we all know, there\u2019s a lot more to be read between the lines in politics than in their actual content, so there\u2019s only hoping that there\u2019s no mala fide intention behind the purported move.",

        "full_article": "Today, the nation is going to witness a momentous event. It is the opening of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Doubtlessly, this is going to be a watershed moment marking a turning point in our national life. For building a bridge on the mighty river Padma has been a long-cherished dream of the people as it promises to bring the entire nation closer. But the challenges were enormous. There was the issue of finance to implement such a colossal engineering project. And there was also the question if an enterprise of this scale would deliver the intended goods once materialised.Reassuringly, the experience of the Bangabandhu Bridge built earlier across another mighty river, Jamuna, was before us. Unfortunately, unlike in the case of Jamuna bridge project, financial support for Padma Bridge from multilateral funders proved to be difficult to come by. So, the road to realisation of the dream project was not smooth. The World Bank, which was the lead donor agency that initially came forward to finance the Padma Multipurpose Bridge project, made a complete volte-face at the last moment on the grounds of what it termed 'intended corruption', an allegation that later proved to be of no substance by a Canadian court. However, such initial obstacles could not dampen the nation's spirit. Undaunted, the prime minister went ahead with her decision to build the bridge, come rain or shine, and mobilised the country's own resources to that end. And, finally, the Padma Bridge which cost around Tk. 301.93 billion has been constructed. The 3.82 miles long, close to 60 feet wide and 394 feet high concrete and steel structure is indeed a milestone in the history of the nation's various achievements. The two-tiered steel and concrete truss structure with a four-lane road on its top floor for motorised vehicles and a single rail at the bottom for train is going to set many new records in the field of modern-day infrastructure building. Laying piles 390 to 400 feet below the ground is obviously one such record. In fact, no other bridge in the world is known to have had its piling done from such a great depth. Padma Bridge has a load limit of 10,000 tonnes and can withstand the impact, according to experts, of an earthquake of 7.5 to 8 magnitude on the Richter scale.The Padma Bridge standing proudly straddling the two banks of mighty Padma is not merely an architectural wonder. It is also the pinnacle of the nation's pride and ambitions. How is this bridge going to benefit the country? Stretching from Mawa point in Munshiganj to Jazira in Shariatpur, the bridge will hopefully contribute 1.23 per cent to the country's GDP growth, while the GDP of south-western region will see a 2.3 per cent growth. So far, the river Padma has been a big barrier to the desired social and economic growth of the 21 districts lying on its other bank and beyond. The bridge has removed that barrier making it easier for investment to flow to those districts. Thus integrated, this part of the country will begin to make its due contribution to the national economy. The achievement of such a miracle has been possible, thanks to the visionary and bold leadership of the prime minister. For it is due to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's single-minded will to overcome all odds that the dream bridge could finally see the light of day.",

        "full_article": "Though it sounds rather trite to say that nothing happens in this world without a cause, it is still the case that people often forget this commonsense maxim. Consider the recent furore over the rising number of motorbikes on the country's highways. And the concern so raised by different well-meaning quarters is also not without substance. For one cannot deny the fact that even during the last Eid-ul-Fitr, these two-wheelers were seen in large numbers on the country's highways on their way to the different outlying districts. Evidently, the passengers of those motorbikes were Eid travellers bound for their country homes to celebrate the Eid. Sadly, many of them could not make it to their intended destinations as their chosen transports met with deadly road crashes leading to deaths and injuries. According to reports, some 106 people lost their lives died in so many accidents, during those fateful journeys. So, what should be the way of out of this mess and the deadly road crashes attributed to these two-wheelers? Ban them from the highways and even from the capital and other larger cities of the country where they are notorious for creating huge traffic gridlocks, as many would like to suggest? But tragic accidents on the highways are not something new in the country and they have been happening endlessly without a let-up even before the motorbikes came out in a big way on the country's highways. But we have never heard any one suggesting that the big vehicles like buses and trucks be prohibited from the highways! Even so, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), which looks after the issue of giving licence to vehicles plying the roads and highways, did indeed recently come up with a recommendation that the movement of the motorbikes be restricted, especially, n the country's highways. Obviously, such a suggestion coming from as important a government body as the BRTA is a serious matter. But before such a huge statement was made, did those concerned give serious consideration about why the number of motorbikes saw an exponential increase in recent times? Is it that the young people-in fact, the overwhelming majority of the motorbike riders belong to the age group defined by the UN as the youths-have taken a sudden fancy to these magnificent-looking two-wheelers as a passing fad? Definitely not. In fact, going by the BRTA records, out of more than 5.0 million vehicles given registration by this transports regulatory body since the country's independence till last year, around 3.5 million were motorbikes. However, as often alleged, there are many more unregistered motorised vehicles including, of course, motorbikes, that are using the country's roads and highways. Be that as it may. The fact still remains that a large number of these youths are riding motorbikes not for pure amusement. On the contrary, they are using their vehicle for more serious purposes such as commuting between their workplaces. Also, in a recent development, jobless youths are using these two-wheelers as a source of earning. And why it is so is quite plain. There are more unemployed youths in the country than there are jobs to absorb them. Is it not amazing that these innovative youths have found out a new means of self-employment rather than taking out large protest marches demanding jobs from the government! Should these youths not deserve due appreciation, rather than reproach, from all quarters concerned for such enviable talent at getting self-employed in this manner? And, lo, now we have a new revolutionary answer to such a hugely complicated issue of transporting people from one place to another by way of ridesharing using modern digital technology. While appreciating the development, one has also to face facts. Had the existing public transport facilities in the country proved adequate to match the ever-rising demand for the service, there would be no need for filling the void (of transport-related service) by these frail-looking, risky motorbikes. And let us also not forget the tyrannous as well as anarchic regime ruling supreme in the country's privately-run transport sector. Especially, before each big Muslim religious festival, the Eid-travellers are virtually held hostage to the whims and caprices of the private transport operators. And it is exactly against this background that homebound motorcyclists descended in droves on the country's highways. So, quarters annoyed with the so-called 'motorbike menace' need to have a rethink of the whole gamut of issues before coming to any quick conclusion.As with all other motorised transports, the problem of registration also lies with the motorbikes. The BRTA itself will have to take some responsibility on this score. The highway police will be required to mount stronger vigilance as well as patrolling to combat delinquency on the roads both by the motorbikes and other regular transports. At the same time, wearing of standard helmets certified by the Bangladesh Standard and Testing Institution (BSTI) has to be made mandatory for all motorbike riders. What is important here is to look at the issue in the light of the socio-economic reasons behind it. And there is hardly any point making a whipping boy out of these bikers. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

        "full_article": "There is a growing trend in many countries of the world to destroy or distort natural resources for development. Growth-hungry developing countries like China, India, Brazil and Bangladesh are said to be some of those. Damaging natural resources and polluting the environment is acceptable to some extent due to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of a vast section of the impoverished population. However, what is quite problematic is that there is little attention to the environment at the take-off stage of growth. The result is severe and irreparable damage to natural resources like heavy pollution of rivers and ponds and destruction of forests and hills.Nevertheless, an obsession with growth drives the policymakers to ignore long-term ecological imbalance and its severe consequence on humans. They adopt policies focusing on quick gains. These policies encourage taking various development projects without considering and adjusting with ecological characteristics of land or area. Take the example of Dhaka city, which has already turned into a jungle of concrete and cement blocks, which is evident from recent recurrent ratings. To accommodate around 20 million people, the city is growing with various buildings and roads. The construction spree ignores the necessity of natural water flows during the rainy season. That's why many canals and water reservoirs have filled up. It appears that city authorities forget the cyclic season of heavy rain, an essential natural feature of Bangladesh. So, roads and buildings need to be constructed and repaired accordingly. By not doing so, there is a clear tendency to ignore the rule of nature, only to bring terrible waterlogging. The devastating flood in Sylhet is another example of the wrong approach to nature. There is no way to control floods fully. What is possible is the skilful management of floods to reduce the damage to life and property and minimize the suffering of flood-affected people.Torrential rain or fierce water onrush from upstream from the Indian state of Meghalaya is nothing new for the Sylhet region, which is the lower basin. And it is a natural phenomenon that water flows down from the upstream. Now, there is a serious problem that the water cannot flow towards its destination properly. The result is inundating more than 80 per cent of the greater Sylhet.Deforestation, cutting of hills and illegal and excessive river-bed mining in Meghalaya and Sylhet have caused river erosion and landslide. The apparent outcome is the flooding of low-lying areas during the rainy season. Again, illegal encroachment coupled with pollution has narrowed the river Surma, and it cannot carry an excessive flow of upstream water. The authorities have ignored the necessary excavation and dredging of the river. Then there are some faulty dams and roads blocking and diverting the water flows. The 29.73-kilometre road constructed for accessible communications in three Upazilas in the haor region of Kishoreganj is another example of creating barriers to natural water flow. Though the road is necessary, due to reported flaws in the design, it is now causing excessive flooding and damaging crops.It is difficult to know whether the development policies overlooking the damaging impact on nature and the environment would be reviewed and revised. However, one thing is clear: the cost of continuing such policies and not taking lessons from the current flooding in Sylhet will be pretty high in the long run.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

By building this bridge with its own fund, Bangladesh has shown its capabilities. As a result of the construction of the bridge, the economic potential and image of the country have been established all over the world. And for this, we all must be thankful to our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her sturdy leadership. We must admire her for taking the revolutionary step of self-financing to build this challenging bridge. This bridge was made possible because of her. Initially, the construction of the bridge became uncertain when the World Bank withdrew its pledge of financiering on charges of corruption, and other donors followed it. That was the beginning picture of the construction of the Padma Bridge. Only a few people believed that Bangladesh could really build the bridge with its own money. When the construction began, a number of challenges started coming, and groundbreaking engineering skills were required in river governance and piling. The Padma Bridge, however, is ready to open to traffic now. It is a bridge of our pride. It has already brightened the country's image in the world and also accelerated the nation's confidence. We hope the bridge will play a unique role in taking Bangladesh to the line of developed countries. \nMd. Tajmul Hasan,Student of University of Dhaka, Dhaka, [email\u00a0protected]",
