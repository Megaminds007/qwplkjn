The export rebound, coming on the back of last fiscal\u2019s pandemic-induced slump in global demand, is particularly heartening as the key value-added sectors of engineering goods and apparel and garments have done well this year. Engineering goods, in particular, have registered almost 50% year-on-year growth, while ready-made garments logged a more than 30% increase, in the April-February period, as per provisional data from the Commerce Ministry. However, in terms of the sheer scale of increase, petroleum products were the standout performer as the global surge in oil prices lifted the dollar value of overseas shipments of goods produced at India\u2019s refineries by 150% over the first 11 months of the fiscal. The fact that the export growth has been achieved against the backdrop of persistent logistical challenges, including container shortages and port congestion that have pushed up freight rates, is laudable and reflects the concerted effort made by the government in coordination with industry and the country\u2019s overseas missions. Interestingly, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal made a pointed reference to the role played by India\u2019s embassies and envoys in exploring new opportunities for Indian products, and if the current momentum in exports is to be sustained in the coming years, the diplomatic corps will need to enlarge their role in trade promotion.Still, the cheer of attaining the milestone needs to be tempered by the acknowledgment that multiple challenges persist on the trade front. Imports have outpaced exports this year, almost doubling the trade deficit in the April-February period to more than $175 billion. The gap is wider than the pre-pandemic year of 2019-2020 as well and points to the pressing need to step up the pace of export growth if the deficit is to be shrunk meaningfully. While global inflation in commodity prices certainly contributed to enlarging the value of both exports and imports, the fact that project goods were the only item of import, among the 30 broad categories listed by the Ministry that contracted over the 11-month period, is also cause for disquiet. The lack of overseas purchases of capital goods for new projects is a clear indicator that private Indian businesses are still wary of making fresh investments given the lack of momentum in personal consumption. With the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia now posing fresh problems for exporters seeking to ship goods to not only these countries but other markets in Europe as well, policymakers must go beyond stopgap measures such as enabling rupee-rouble trade and expedite ongoing negotiations on the raft of free trade agreements so as to at least help lower some of the tariff walls.",

General elections in 2009, 2014 and 2019, and the pandemic lasting over two years, have never stymied the league. Irrespective of the external challenges, the tournament\u2019s organisers have always conducted the IPL. Even as India remains the base, at varying points South Africa and the United Arab Emirates have chipped in as hosts. Cut to the present, the 15th edition will commence at Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede Stadium on Saturday with defending champion, Chennai Super Kings, (CSK) taking on last year\u2019s runner-up, Kolkata Knight Riders. And over two months, the IPL will monopolise prime-time television while its caravan will shuttle between Mumbai and Pune due to COVID-19 bio-bubble protocols. Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede, Brabourne and DY Patil Stadiums and Pune\u2019s MCA Stadium will conduct the games while the venue for the play-offs, including the final on May 29, will be announced later. Ever since that summer night at Bengaluru\u2019s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in 2008, when the IPL made its debut, its commercial value has found incremental gains. The latest outing has Tata as the title sponsor while multiple brands will jostle for space through the tournament and its 10 teams. Meanwhile, the two new squads \u2014 Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants \u2014 will enhance the novelty factor.The IPL\u2019s current version will have transition as an underlying theme. Most units have had a change of personnel and in some cases, there are new captains too. CSK, until now led by the talismanic M.S. Dhoni, will have a fresh skipper in Ravindra Jadeja. At 40, Dhoni will continue as a player but with him having relinquished the reins of captaincy, an era has ended in the league\u2019s history. Having led CSK to four titles, the legend from Ranchi remains the IPL\u2019s biggest player. While CSK will look at replicating its triumphs, Mumbai Indians, the most successful franchise with five trophies, will hope to excel in its backyard. Led by Rohit Sharma, who is now India\u2019s all-format skipper, the outfit has Kieron Pollard in its ranks, reflective of the championship\u2019s international flavour. However, the event isn\u2019t just about youngsters grabbing attention, it is also about seniors reiterating their credentials. Virat Kohli is now seeking a fresh wind as a mere player. And this IPL will also help leading players such as Kane Williamson finesse their craft ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia, later this year.",

        "full_article": "When was the last time you looked at the face of the rickshaw-puller who gave you a ride? Or the guard who opened the door for you at a mall? Or the cleaner who was sweeping the streets you walked along? Did you exchange glances? A smile, let alone pleasantries? Chances are you did not even see them. Yet, these are the invisible people representing 80-90 percent of the labour force on whom the informal sector of our economy depends. They include wage labourers, self-employed individuals, unpaid family labourers, seasonal workers and other hired labourers. With too much focus on the leading faces, the initiators, and the ideation process, we often forget the \"ordinary\" implementers and their \"extraordinary\" contributions not only to our economic growth, but also to our very existence.\nToday, as we celebrate the nation's independence, it is important to recall the valour and sacrifice of the marginal groups and remind ourselves of our duties towards them for a sustainable growth.\nAfter the massacre on the night of March 25, 1971, these invisible men and women from the social sidelines were catapulted to the political centre. The Pakistan Army's Operation Searchlight clicked the images of the bullet-ridden body of a rickshaw-puller lying on his mode of livelihood, the body of a street vendor being dragged by stray dogs, the body of a student sleeping in his dorm, the body of a policeman who was killed even before he could react. These corpses highlighted the indiscriminate nature of the military mayhem. The social body was dispersed. The political body regrouped. They worked as one to form antibodies against the occupying force, and ultimately defeated it after a nine-month-long guerrilla warfare. The violence that erupted in the capital was dispatched to every part of the country. Ordinary men and women resisted. Their resilience expedited our freedom. Yet, after 51 years, the part of the body that suffered the most remains inflicted as ever.\nThe urban-based power base that has emerged as the centre of economy has little sympathy for the margin that has its roots in our villages. According to a report, 50 percent of Dhaka's population is invisible to the city's policy and planning frameworks. The city sees the inflow of about 300,000-400,000 internally displaced population each year. Many of them are seasonal migrants who look for jobs in the city during the lean seasons. Many others come seeking upward social mobility. And for many of these people, the slums become the landing ground. Some of them join institutions of higher education to gradually move up the social ladder. A 2007 UNDP report estimated about 3.4 million living in Dhaka's slums. Surely, the number has risen since then. The lack of record-keeping shows the systematic process of exclusion. Public surveys mostly focus on the residents of formal households. The slums remain a niche area of interest for development agencies or NGOs\u2014not so much for city planners. Their basic needs for water, sanitation or power are provided through an \"informal\" patronage system. These men and women residing outside the official frame rely on local syndicates or political nexus for their existence. They are fed into partisan politics for their basic sustenance, including jobs, with no civic rights or public entitlements. For them, freedom is a far cry.\nI was browsing through a trip advisory blog where visitors were commenting on Dhaka city. The suggestions there made me think of the invisible side of our visible city. For instance, one commentator mentioned that finding a female companion in Dhaka was relatively easy as many college-going students were engaged in escort services. There was another blog mentioning that one could buy intimacy with a woman for as little as Tk 100. A video interview of a woman, who had to sleep with 20-25 men a day for her livelihood, brought tears to my eyes. The trip advisors suggested not going to these floating sex workers in fear of STDs, just like they suggested not giving alms to any street beggars. \"They'd gang up for more and tear you into pieces like in Hitchcock's movie The Bird,\" one comment said.\nI felt ashamed to be introduced to the underbelly of the city in which I travel from one place to another with my upper-middle-class privileges. The man who ferries me throughout the city would get two annual leaves. There are so many like him with biological needs, who allow the informal system of prostitution, for instance, to grow. The house rents would force many of these working men and women to live in a city where their needs are not catered to. The same goes for many migrant workers who work abroad to contribute to our wage earners' scheme. The money they send often gives rise to social problems that we are not ready to acknowledge. Adultery is often reported as a cause for murder or kidnapping. We benefit from the informal economy without doing anything significant for the invisible men and women. Fifty percent of the city dwellers take care of the other 50 percent in a symbiotic, if not a parasitic, relationship. The existence is far from healthy.\nWhen the clarion call for freedom was made, we wanted independence from all forms of oppression. We wanted to be free in our thoughts and in our actions. It is about time our policymakers bridged up the formal-informal divide and outlined a healthier alternative. Freedom is not only about getting rid of the chains of the oppressors, but also about providing the rights to live with dignity and mutual respect.\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).\n",

        "full_article": "Bangladesh celebrated its golden jubilee of independence in 2021. The celebration reminded the newer generations of our nation of the patriotism of their ancestors, who fought a heroic war against the marauding Pakistan Army that killed an estimated three million people, raped over 300,000 women, and caused enormous destruction. The celebrations also reminded us of the mass exodus of nearly 10 million people to the bordering states of India to escape military atrocities, which was one of the largest refugee crises in the 20th century.\nAll these human tragedies, well documented in the pages of history, will never be forgotten by the Bangladeshis as most families at that time either lost their loved ones or suffered the brunt of the military madness. In memory of the tragedy, Bangladesh observes March 25 as \"Genocide Day\" as the Pakistan military launched a brutal campaign of manslaughter on that day in 1971, code-named \"Operation Searchlight\"\u2014a campaign that went on for nine months. The irony is that the United Nations (UN) has not yet recognised the genocide nor the use of rape as a weapon of war to this day, even though they were carried out in a calculative and cruellest fashion, as many researchers have concluded.\nOn December 31, 2021, the very last day of Bangladesh's golden jubilee celebration, the US-based Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention issued a statement detailing the genocide of Bengalis. The recognition came following research carried out by the institute after Tawheed Reza Noor, son of one of Bangladesh's martyred intellectuals Serajuddin Hossain, approached the institute, named after Raphael Lemkin, a great scholar best known for coining the term \"genocide\" and who initiated the historic UN Genocide Convention.\nThere have been consistent efforts by various Bangladesh governments, families of the victims and human rights groups for the UN recognition of the 1971 genocide. But the world body remains consistently silent over it, even though it has, in recent years, accorded recognition to the Armenian genocide, and also acted decisively on the Bosnian, Cambodian and Rwandan genocides.\nThe genocide of 1971 is well documented in various forms. The first detailed report of the atrocities was published by a well-known Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas in the UK's The Sunday Times, on June 13, 1971. Mascarenhas, who was among a group of journalists from West Pakistan invited by the government to write in support of the military actions in East Pakistan, fled to London to report what he had actually seen. In his famous report, titled \"Genocide,\" he wrote, \"I saw Hindus hunted from village to village and door to door, shot off-hand after a cursory 'short arm inspection' showed they were uncircumcised. I have heard the screams of men bludgeoned to death in the compound of the Circuit House in Comilla. I have seen truckloads of other human targets and those who had the humanity to try to help them hauled off for disposal under the cover of darkness and curfew.\"\nOn August 2, 1971, the Time magazine provided the details of the massacre. It quoted a senior US official as saying, \"It is the most incredible, calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland.\" Genocide researcher Prof RJ Rummel said, \"These 'willing executioners' were fuelled by an abiding anti-Bengali racism, especially against the Hindu minority. Bengalis were often compared with monkeys and chicken\u2026 and the soldiers were free to kill at will.\"\nArcher K Blood, the US consul general in Dhaka in 1971 who disagreed with his country's handling of the Bangladesh struggle, reported that naked female bodies in Dhaka University's Rokeya Hall were found \"hanging from ceiling fans with bits of rope,\" after apparently being \"raped, shot, and hung by heels\" from the fans.\nRemarkably, the UN could not act decisively to stop the bloodbath as the massacre happened during the Cold War era, although the then UN Secretary-General U Thant, on June 3, 1971, had remarked, \"The happenings in East Pakistan constitute one of the most tragic episodes in human history. Of course, it is for future historians to gather facts and make their own evaluations, but it has been a very terrible blot on a page of human history.\"\nApart from committing heinous crimes, the Pakistan Army and their fanatic cohorts raped hundreds of thousands of women, shaking the very foundation of conscience and human rights. In some cases, according to the studies, young Bengali women were taken from one camp to another to be used as \"comfort girls.\" The brutalities inflicted on them included severing of breasts and mutilation of their private parts by inserting bayonet or gun barrels. Many were kept hanging upside down till death. Tens of thousands of bodies, both male and female, with their hands and legs tied in the back, floating on ponds and rivers were a common sight across the country.\nBelated, yet welcome, since it was the first such public statement by a global genocide research institute, the Lemkin Institute's statement narrated the historical backgrounds of the genocide and remarked that the Bengalis, who constituted the majority of Pakistani population at that time, were perceived by the Pakistani ruling coterie as \"inferior\" or not \"true Muslims.\" The statement stated, \"The genocidal policies of the postcolonial era became expressed in extreme and mass physical violence throughout the entire process of the Liberation War (of Bangladesh), from its very beginning, when West Pakistan implemented 'Operation Searchlight,' to the end of the war, when West Pakistan, facing defeat, proceeded to kill thousands of Bengali intellectuals.\"\nIt further echoed the documented history, \"The atrocities committed by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators\u2014Razakars, al-Badr and al-Shams\u2014included a systematic policy of sexual violence against Bengalis, the majority of them Bengali Hindu women and girls, involving vicious gang rapes, sexual slavery, sexual torture, and forced maternity.\" British physician Dr Geoffrey Davis, who worked in Bangladesh on request of Word Health Organization (WHO), estimated that the commonly cited figures of killing and rape were \"very conservative\" compared to the real numbers.\nTruly, the rape was carried out in a systematic manner with the aim to change the race of Bengalis!\nNoted researcher Robert Payne, in his book \"Massacre: The Tragedy of Bangla Desh,\" quoted a senior Pakistan Army general as saying, \"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\" The UN's declaration of Universal Human Rights 1981 said, \"Among the genocides of human history, the highest number of people killed in (a) lower span of time is in Bangladesh in 1971. An average of 6,000 to 12,000 people were (sic) killed every single day... This is the highest daily average in the history of genocides.\"\nThe Lemkin institute further stated, \"Given the lack of a broad international recognition of the crime, the Lemkin Institute calls upon (the) international community, including the United Nations, to urgently recognise the Bengali genocide as a way to pay tribute to the victims and to hold (the) perpetrators accountable.\" It has also called upon the international community to pressure Pakistan to work with Bangladesh in its search for truth and justice.\nHopefully, the significant statement by a well-known genocide prevention institute will pave the way for many more similar international bodies to come forward with similar recognition, and help remove the UN's inertia that it has preserved for long. The crimes committed against humanity, anywhere in the world, must not go unpunished\u2014otherwise, justice turns futile.\nPakistan, even after 51 years, has not apologised to Bangladesh for the crimes committed by its army, nor has it put on trial those 195 war criminals identified by Bangladesh in 1972 as the principal perpetrators. Pakistan's own Hamoodur Rahman Commission recommended taking effective action to punish those POWs who were responsible for committing the atrocities in the former East Pakistan. However, the listed war criminals were subsequently repatriated to Pakistan along with other POWs following the Tripartite Agreement signed among Bangladesh, Pakistan and India in 1974. But they were not freed from criminal charges. Bangladesh contends that the clemency mentioned in the Trilateral Agreement never implied that the masterminds and principal perpetrators of crimes against humanity and genocide would continue to enjoy impunity. The customary international laws also provide ample opportunity to try the Pakistani POWs.\nTrue, the UN recognition is important for the victims' families as well as for the aggrieved nation that is now 51 years old and also an important member of the United Nations. However, it is also no less important for the world body itself to protect its mandate and image. It must not be forgotten that such recognition is not merely a formal signing of a document, but also a new pledge and fresh commitment against the recurrence of such crimes in the future.\n\u00a0\nHaroon Habib\u00a0is a freedom fighter, writer and researcher.\u00a0\n",

        "full_article": "At the height of the Cold War, half a century ago, Bangladesh triumphed over Pakistan in a nine-month war for independence in 1971. The war is marked by a violent series of atrocities and massacres that met with mass resistance from ordinary Bangladeshis, which drew considerable global attention. As of today, Pakistan has not officially apologised to Bangladesh for the genocide committed during the war. Last year, Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani diplomat, said, \"The people of Pakistan should urge their government to offer a formal apology to the people of Bangladesh for the genocide committed against the Bengalis by its military in 1971.\" This raises an enduring question, like old wine in a new bottle: Should Pakistan formally issue an apology to Bangladesh?\nWhat happened in the nine months of the Liberation War speaks of a horror tale of gruesome killing and mayhem. The war ended with the surrender of the Pakistani occupational forces on December 16 1971, with a death toll of three million people, hundreds of thousands of girls and women raped, and almost 10 million displaced, fleeing to India as refugees. It is to be noted that the number of people killed by the Pakistani military is the highest in such a short span of time. Though Pakistan recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign nation-state in 1974 under tremendous world pressure, Bangladesh is yet to overcome its traumatic past.\nPakistan has indirectly apologised to Bangladesh several times. The first acknowledgement of the crimes committed came during a tripartite accord signed among Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, when the Pakistan side said, \"(The) Pakistani government condemned and deeply regretted any crimes that may have been committed.\" The second indirect apology came in 2002 when then Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf visited Bangladesh and wrote in the official visitors' book, \"Your brothers and sisters in Pakistan share the pains of the events of 1971. The excesses committed during the unfortunate period are regrettable.\" Though these statements are close to offering an apology, they are obviously neither formal nor enough to overcome the troubling past.\nThere are at least three concrete reasons why Pakistan should formally apologise to Bangladesh. First, a formal apology will relieve the Pakistanis' burden by creating space for compunction and fostering the healing process for the Bangladeshis. After all, ordinary citizens are the key drivers of a fruitful bilateral relation. Offering an apology will not belittle Pakistan; rather, it will brighten its image in the world at a time when the country is encountering an increasing isolation on the global stage. Also, a dignified remorse would help Pakistan to avoid permanent embarrassment, and would open an avenue for a new partnership with a rising regional player. That Germany officially apologised to Namibia for the genocide committed by the German colonisers between 1904 and 1908 should serve as an example for Pakistan.\nSecond, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the two South Asian Muslim majority countries, have common membership in almost all regional and global platforms\u2014e.g. Saarc, D8, OIC, Commonwealth, etc\u2014which resonate with common interests. There is a huge market and untapped trade potential between these countries. Neither can reap the fullest economic and strategic benefits until Pakistan decides to remove the thorn stuck in its throat. Most critically, the convergence in mutual geostrategic outlook should incentivise Pakistan to mend the fence by offering a formal apology to Bangladesh.\nThird, apart from an outstanding unconditional apology, there are some long-pending issues acting as major stumbling blocks to a healthy bilateral relation. According to Bangladesh, Pakistan holds at least USD 4.5 billion of its assets, including money in Pakistani banks, frozen after the war. Besides, the repatriation of the stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh remains a distant reality, mainly because of Islamabad's reluctance to take them back. A formal apology from Pakistan will not only normalise the relations, but could also act as a catalyst to redress the aforementioned complexities.\nThe war crimes committed by the Pakistani occupation forces against Bangladeshis are as clear as daylight, which Pakistan should not even dare to ignore or simply dub as a mistake. Pakistan should remember that no nation can move forward without confronting its dark past. The genocide of 1971 is one of the worst that the world witnessed in the 20th century, which Pakistan can't recall, but Bangladesh can't forget. The genocide of Bangladesh reminds us of William Gladstone's quote, \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\"\nUndoubtedly, unconditional public apology is the most courteous thing that could have been done with minimal efforts from Pakistan. But we are actually stuck with the wrong question. Rather, the question should be: Should Bangladesh forgive Pakistan if they seek unconditional apology? Recent efforts\u2014lifting visa restrictions for Bangladeshis, telephone dialogue with Bangladesh, etc\u2014demonstrate that Pakistan is interested in turning the page of this strained relationship. If Islamabad genuinely wants to defrost its ties with Dhaka, it should take credible action on the Hamoodur Rahman Commission report and apologise officially to Dhaka. Only then could Dhaka consider forgiving Islamabad for its bitter past. Not to mention, a country with minimal respect for established international laws and norms would not find it difficult to offer a heartfelt apology for the genocide it perpetrated.\n\u00a0\nHussain Shazzad\u00a0is a strategic affairs and foreign policy analyst.\n",

        "full_article": "It's like a scene from a Stephen King movie: a small passenger vessel being \"devoured\" by a cargo ship about 20 times its size. But perhaps even the master of horror couldn't have produced a moment so short\u00a0yet so fateful. Video clips capturing this tragic encounter on the Shitalakkhya River on March 20 show how panicked passengers of the Munshiganj-bound ML Afsar Uddin vessel screamed as the much larger MV Rupshi 9 cargo ship crept up on the former and, without warning, ploughed into it. The ship continued to push forward until some passengers jumped into the river. Seconds later, the smaller vessel sank, with many passengers still on it, while the ship went along like nothing had happened.\nYou normally use words like \"plough\" when describing some highway crashes. \"The truck ploughed into a van,\" you say, or \"The train crashed into a stranded car.\" The \"killer truck\" epithet owes its origin mostly to this type of impact. It's a standard trope for crime thrillers as well. One may also recall the 2016 terrorist attack in France, in which the world was shocked by the audacity of a cargo truck being driven into crowds celebrating the Bastille Day, killing 86 people.\nSo it takes some imagination to think of a similar occurrence on the waterway, where you least expect such collisions. Yet, here we are.\nReports published after the March 20 ferry disaster, which recorded at least 10 deaths so far, describe emotional scenes of people searching for their missing relatives or mourning the dead. Some of the headings aptly captured their mood: \"I need no compensation, just find my husband's body,\" said Momela Begum about her husband who returned from Kuwait only a month ago. \"My child, I can't bear losing you,\" cried Jayaram Rajbangshi, holding the lifeless body of his three-year-old daughter. \"Are we doomed to die like this? Die again and again?\" said Minu Begum, who lost her nephew's wife and daughter before losing her daughter-in-law and granddaughter in another launch tragedy on the Shitalakkhya last year. \"Will there be no punishment for the murderers?\" asked another grieving relative.\nThese expressions of pain and sorrow remind us that there's no tragedy like the loss of a loved one, especially in such pointless deaths.\nWhen the relatives talk about murderers, they don't just mean the crew members of those vessels who failed to prevent the collision. They also mean the vessel owners and the state regulators, who together are responsible for creating an environment in which ordinary passengers are basically sitting ducks waiting for something bad to happen when out in the waterways. The relatives have a fair point: if a person killing another person is called murder, why can't we call an institutional murder for what it is? After all, when institutional failures, incompetence and negligence are encouraged rather than punished, such catastrophes\u2014either in the form of collision, or fire or capsize caused by internal malfunctions\u2014become inevitable and thereby man-made. To call this outcome an \"accident\" will be sugarcoating it. And if a person is held responsible for murder, why can't we hold a complicit\u00a0institution (the official-owner complex) responsible for the same?\nUnfortunately, the officials or owners of vessels are rarely held to account for their actions or lack thereof. We see low-level operators rounded up after each incident, which makes for good optics but cannot prevent the recurrence of such tragedies. The same can be said about land transport owners. Or, the regulators and top officials in both sectors.\u00a0In fact, most tragic accidents in Bangladesh\u2014gas explosion, road crash, fire incident, factory collapse, or launch capsize\u2014can be traced to the failures and negligence of those at the top of the ladder.\nTheir culpability becomes clear when you consider how water vessels, for example, are caught in a tragic loop of circumstances that makes accidents, small or big, almost predestined. First, you have a system that allows faulty vessels and ill-trained crew members to operate. (Part of the reason why ML Afsar Uddin capsized so quickly was its being a \"sunken-deck\" vessel, known for having fewer safety measures and no watertight deck which could help it remain afloat for a longer time.) Then, there is the lax enforcement of safety rules and regulations. And then, when something bad happens, you have the usual blame game, knee-jerk damage control, and bountiful lip services without any meaningful reform or accountability measure whatsoever. There is no indication whether this loop or cycle will be broken anytime soon.\nExperts generally blame poor regulatory oversight, lack of trained crew members, rise in river traffic (including unregistered vessels), shortage of manpower for safety checks, overcrowding, and an overall culture of impunity for the waterway tragedies, which have been on the rise in recent years. According to Buet's Accident Research Institute (ARI), 110 people were killed in waterway tragedies in 2019, while 264 people were killed in 2020. Last year, some 199 people lost their lives.\nThe frequency of these incidents should be a wake-up call for those in charge of the Department of Shipping and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA). They should be honest and acknowledge their failures to prevent such incidents (as all independent probe reports inevitably conclude), and help institute a system of accountability that actually works, regardless of how well-connected or high up the hierarchy one is. They can no longer hide behind excuses or blame games, especially with the monsoon/storm season coming.\u00a0\nThere is no dearth of research on why waterway tragedies keep happening in Bangladesh, nor on what should be done to prevent them and modernise the river management system. All this is more or less known already. What we really need now is a push to change how the system works, and ensure accountability for everyone involved in it.\n\u00a0\nBadiuzzaman Bay\u00a0is an Assistant Editor, The Daily Star.\n",

        "full_article": "It is quite worrying that Bangladesh faces the risk of losing its European market for vegetables because the Explosive Detective System (EDS) machine\u2014used for scanning agricultural exports\u2014at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) in Dhaka has been inoperative for over two weeks. As a result, local traders have been unable to export vegetables, thereby incurring huge financial losses. Since vegetables scanned by any device other than EDS scanners are not allowed to enter the UK and European markets, some have been forced to get them scanned in a third country, which is not only very expensive, but also time-consuming, harming the business prospect of such perishable items.\nWe can't help but wonder why the airport authorities would allow the situation to deteriorate to a stage where agricultural exports would come to a complete halt. The EDS machine shouldn't have been difficult to fix. If new parts are all that the machine requires to work, as the airport authorities claimed, why weren't they brought in sooner? We're told that there was another machine at the cargo village of the airport, but that has been out of order for two years. The current situation is hard to accept as the lone scanner reportedly broke down thrice over the last six months, which should have been enough for the authorities to initiate a contingency plan for quick repairs and even purchasing new machines (using part of the fees they charge for scanning outgoing vegetables).\nThe danger of this situation dragging on indefinitely shouldn't be lost on the airport authorities. Bangladeshi exporters of vegetables and other perishable items will lose their position and competitive edge in the European market, while exporters from countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia will take advantage of the situation. According to the Bangladesh Fruits, Vegetables and Allied Products Exporters Association, about 120 tonnes of agricultural products and perishable items are exported to different countries daily, of which 80 percent goes to the UK. About 82,510 tonnes of fruits and vegetables worth Tk 1,419 crore were exported from Bangladesh in FY2019-20, and Tk 1,029 crores' worth in the following year. Europe is a big market for us; we can't be deemed as unprepared or, worse, unfit for the opportunity that it provides.\u00a0\nWe urge the Dhaka airport authorities to realise the cost of their inaction or inability to deliver a quick solution to the vegetable export problem. They must fix the EDS scanner urgently and bring in new machines so that such vital exports are never disrupted.\n",

        "full_article": "We are deeply disturbed that the\u00a0Information and Communication Technology Division\u00a0has finalised\u00a0the draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill,\u00a0while retaining some key features that have been criticised by human rights advocates as they would infringe upon people's right to privacy\u2014which goes against the very spirit of the law.\u00a0\nThe bill gives all citizens the right to know when their\u00a0personal information is being collected, how it will be used or processed, for how long, and where it will be stored\u2014a move which is, no doubt, forward-thinking in an increasingly digitised era. However, what is concerning is that it\u00a0gives sweeping authority to the government to authorise any national security, intelligence or law enforcement agency to \"intercept, record or collect information\" of any person on national security or public order grounds. What constitutes \"national security\" or \"public order grounds\" is open to interpretation. Moreover, there are no requirements to actually notify citizens before their data is accessed or processed for any purpose.\nThe bill also exempts the director general of the Digital Security Agency\u2014who will be investigating violations, levying fines and ensuring overall compliance\u2014as well as the employees of the data protection office for potential violations. It also has a provision that will enable the government to officially exempt certain data controllers from having to follow any provision of the law.\u00a0\nEqually troubling is the requirement\u00a0to store user data locally\u2014even\u00a0data about citizens collected by major global tech companies such as Google and Facebook\u2014which, coupled with the exceptions outlined above, means that a broad range of actors can legally snoop through our most private emails, chats, photos or videos. Given the likelihood of the concentration of large amounts of data with poor security, it won't just be government agencies which can access our data\u2014hackers and other malicious actors can easily gain unauthorised access.\nGiven these deeply problematic \"exemptions\" to data protection, one cannot help but wonder if the law will actually protect citizens' right to privacy. In a context where the controversial Digital Security Act is used indiscriminately to target, harass and jail writers, dissenters and activists, such sweeping authority to security agencies may erode whatever little remains of our constitutionally guaranteed rights to freedom of expression and privacy.\u00a0\nA law that poses such incredible dangers to citizen's privacy cannot purport to claim to be one about data protection. We urge the government to take into cognisance the concerns of citizen groups and human rights bodies, and to amend the unconstitutional provisions in the draft. Any law that goes against the constitution so brazenly cannot be passed in a country that claims to be democratic.\u00a0\n",
