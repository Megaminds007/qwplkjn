The L&D fund is a corpus of money and technologies that will be replenished by developed countries and used by the rest to respond to the more unavoidable effects of climate change. On the first day of the COP28 climate talks under way in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), representatives of the member-states agreed to operationalise the L&D fund. The announcement was dearly won: at the end of the COP27 talks in Egypt last year, member-states agreed to launch such a fund, thanks largely to the steadfast efforts of the G-77 bloc of countries plus China, led by Pakistan. Four meetings of the Transitional Committee (TC) were to follow to determine how its money would be disbursed. But the issues in the TC-4 meeting, which spilled over into an ad hoc TC-5 meeting as well, highlight how the newly operationalised fund, while signalling optimism at COP28 and a diplomatic victory for its Emirati president, has crucial issues.First, it will be hosted by the World Bank for an interim period of four years and will be overseen by an independent secretariat. The Bank is expected to charge a significant overhead fee. Developing countries resisted this proposition at first before yielding at the TC-5 meeting, in exchange for some concessions. Second, while some countries have committed amounts to the fund \u2014 from $10 million by Japan to $100 million each by Germany and the UAE \u2014 whether they will be periodically replenished is not clear. The committed amounts are also insufficient, totalling $450 million (for now) against an actual demand of several billion dollars. This shortfall, though it is premature to deem it so, comes against the backdrop of developed countries missing their 2020 deadline to mobilise a promised $100 billion in climate finance and managing to deliver only $89.6 billion in 2021. Next, the contributions are voluntary even as every country has been invited to contribute. Finally, the World Bank will have to meet some conditions on managing the fund, including a degree of transparency it has not brooked so far, and submit a report to the Parties to the Paris Agreement. If its stewardship is determined to be unsuitable, the fund can \u2018exit\u2019 the World Bank. The L&D fund\u2019s contents need to be easily accessible to those who need it most, in timely fashion, sans pedantic bureaucratic hurdles, and in sufficient quantities. As things stand, there is little guarantee that any of these requirements will be met. While the L&D fund is finally online, a lot more needs to be done. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nclimate change\n\n/\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n/\n\nsummit\n\n/\n\nChina\n\n/\n\nPakistan\n\n/\n\nJapan\n\n/\n\nUnited Nations (climate change)",

Gross Value Added (GVA) across the eight broad sectors of the economy also reflected a marginal slowing, with second-quarter GVA registering a 7.4% expansion, 40 basis points slower than the April-June period\u2019s 7.8%. Robust double-digit expansions in manufacturing, mining, utilities and construction offset the loss of momentum across the other four sectors and helped ensure that the year-on-year growth in GVA comfortably exceeded the 7% pace for a second straight quarter. Manufacturing, buoyed by a favourable base effect due to the contraction in the year-earlier period, was the strongest performer by registering growth of 13.9%, a nine-quarter high. And construction witnessed its best showing in five quarters, expanding 13.3%. Of the four other sectors, the crucial ones of agriculture and the two services sectors of trade, hotels, transport and communication, and financial, real estate and professional services saw the pace of growth almost halving from the fiscal first quarter. While year-on-year growth in the agriculture, livestock and fishing sector slowed sharply to an 18-quarter low of 1.2%, the sector also experienced a sequential contraction for the third straight quarter, underscoring the precarity plaguing large portions of those earning from farming and allied activities in the rural hinterland.The slowdown in two key components of the services economy \u2014 trade, hotels, transport and communication saw growth slide to 4.3%, from 9.2% in the June quarter, and the expansion in financial and realty services more than halved from the preceding period to 6% \u2014 also merits a closer watch as the post-pandemic rebound in services appears to have lost steam. Adding to the need to view the headline growth number with circumspection is the fact that the lynchpin private final consumption expenditure, the single-largest component of demand in the economy, is struggling for traction. Growth in private consumption spending slowed appreciably to 3.1% in the September quarter, from 6% in the preceding three-month period, as rural demand remained affected by the vagaries of a below-average monsoon. The NSO data also reveal that the recent economic momentum owes its fillip in large measure to front-loaded government spending, both in terms of consumption demand and asset-creating capital investments. The challenge for policymakers will be to help broaden the growth base so as to ensure that all boats are lifted equally, both to sustain the momentum and reduce inequality. \nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\neconomy (general)\n\n/\n\nmanufacturing and engineering\n\n/\n\nmining\n\n/\n\nconstruction and property\n\n/\n\nagriculture\n\n/\n\nhotel and accommodation\n\n/\n\ntransport\n\n/\n\ncommunication infrastructure\n\n/\n\nfishing industry\n\n/\n\neconomy, business and finance\n\n/\n\nrains",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s GDP growth rate of 7.6% for the July-September quarter surprised majorly on the upside, significantly overshooting RBI\u2019s estimate of 6.5%. The highlights of the data are a growth of 13.9% in manufacturing to Rs 7.15 lakh crore, construction increasing by 13% to Rs 3.04 lakh crore and investment rising 11% to Rs 14.71 lakh crore. However, there\u2019s a trouble spot in the distribution of income as private consumption grew just 3.1% to Rs 23.7 lakh crore.\n\nSeparately, the value of shares listed on the stock market touched $4 trillion on Wednesday, making India only the fourth country to record this level of valuation. As a percentage of GDP, it exceeded 100%. Market capitalisation to GDP ratio is a widely tracked measure of valuation. Of greater relevance here is recent research that identifies the primary reason for the increase in market capitalisation after 1980s. The structural shift in the ratio was influenced mainly by a shift in profit in major economies to companies listed on stock exchanges. Market capitalisation GDP ratio, therefore, reflects deep economic transformation.\n\u00a0\nThe US, which has the most dynamic technology sector in the world, has since 1996 generally recorded a market capitalisation GDP ratio exceeding 100. That India\u2019s current market capitalisation-GDP ratio is above 100 is partly a reflection of macroeconomic indicators favourably aligned to support profit growth of listed firms. For example, corporate tax growth between April and September 2023 was 20%, significantly higher than the 8.6% nominal GDP growth for the same period.\n\n\u00a0\nRobust tax collections are complemented by two other factors. First, the composition of India\u2019s fiscal allocations is supportive of economic growth at all levels of government. GOI for the last three years has reduced the share of revenue deficit in fiscal deficit. It means a greater share of borrowing is going towards investment. Separately, capital expenditure of major states has grown 47% in the first half of 2023-24. Second, favourable macroeconomic factors are being complemented by a change in the composition of household saving. Over the last three years, there\u2019s been a surge in investment in mutual funds, with 2021-22 marking a structural break. Flows into MFs that year increased 2.5 times to Rs 1.6 lakh crore and grew 12% the subsequent year. The $4 trillion market capitalisation and 7.6% growth rate, therefore, have a solid basis.\nHigh Q2 GDP growth, $4 trillion m-cap & shift in household saving to MFs point to far-reaching changes\n\n",

Naturally, weeks since polls were announced on October 9 saw intense and oftentimes down-and-dirty campaigns. Increasingly, parties are pushing the boundaries on fair conduct. New ways and means are found to dodge the Election Commission\u2019s model code of conduct (MCC), the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for parties, candidates and government officials. If MCC\u2019s spirit lies in its \u2018appeal\u2019 for a minimum standard of conduct and behaviour, its flesh and blood are the rules for the \u2018party in power\u2019 \u2013 for governments, ministers and civil servants regarding state schemes, mixing political and official visits, use of state transport etc.\n\nYet, with every election, MCC is under more strain. For one, the 48-hour silence period is obsolete in the age of internet and social media. Politicians grounded for toxic remarks in physical rallies use their online presence to press the same message. Given MCC kicks in once the poll schedule is announced, there was little for EC to do when a party announced some candidates on August 17, sidestepping fair practice. There are hardly any enforceable ways to ensure incumbent MLAs re-contesting polls did not mix the official with the political.\n\nEC rightly suspended a direct money transfer scheme to Telangana\u2019s farmers. But the Telangana minister will not be the only one, as general election campaigning gets underway, who will violate MCC. Using an existing welfare scheme as campaign tool is wrong. He was pulled up for \u201cdisturbing the level-playing field\u201d. This approach should be applied fairly \u2013 everyone who disturbs the playing field in the future should be pulled up. MCC must be seen to be fairly ensuring fair practice. EC has a tough job, and over all, it does a great job. 2024 will be a big challenge for it.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Though stubbornly rising prices have long been the hallmark of the country's essentials market, of late, it looks like things are changing for the better. There is about a dramatic decline in the prices of red meat, egg, chicken and fish. In the past months, price of beef, for instance, went so high that even comparatively better off segment of society started to skimp on it, let alone the low-income group. As reported in the last Wednesday's issue of this paper, though the price of beef earlier skyrocketed to its all-time high at Tk 850 per kilogramme (kg), it registered a dramatic fall by Tk 200 per kg or by nearly 24 per cent just over the past few weeks. Obviously, such a big fall in the prices of this otherwise costly meat has come as a relief to some consumers. Meanwhile, the sources of cheaper protein including egg, broiler chicken and fish have also been demonstrating a similar trend of declining prices, the report further goes. Notably, in recent months these same items, especially egg, defied every government effort to hold their surging prices in check. Many blamed such a behaviour of the market on the so-called manipulative syndicates. In a bid to control particularly egg price, which in September shot up to Tk13 to Tk14 apiece, the highest in a decade, at the retail level, the government had to go for importing the item. Whether it was the threat of import or for reasons yet to be uncovered, the price of this item has gone down remarkably by 21 per cent over the last one month. To the further relief of the public, broiler chicken and farm-grown fishes too were found to be selling at a drastically reduced price over the recent weeks. Since it is a clear departure from the long-prevailing market trend of soaring prices, question arises if this seemingly cheering turn of events is going to sustain in the long run. Leaving it to serious researchers to dig deeper into the matter, to the average person, it is attributable to the public's ever-eroding real income due to runaway inflation that compelled them to remove the costly meat from their menu of daily diets. Some point to the month-long blockades or shutdowns as part of the opposition-enforced political programmes that lie behind the sudden fall in some essentials prices. Whatever the case, the lines are getting longer by the day at the mobile OMS-shops and at the TCB's selling spots. To note, Open Market Sale (OMS) is a programme of the food ministry to supply rice and flour at subsidised prices to low-income people, while the TCB (Trading Corporation of Bangladesh), a wing of the commerce ministry, sells potatoes, onions, soybean oil and lentils at a fair price. Longer queues and wait for hours together for the supplies from the TCB or OMS trucks pose the question, if even the cheaper meats carry any meaning to such people. According to the TCB, prices of fine rice, coarse lentils, potatoes and onions have seen a persistent rise over the past one year, while sugar price has made a big jump. Evidently, it has offset the gains from reduced meat prices. In fact, with their purchasing power plummeting, occasional fall in some of the essentials prices may not bring great relief in the lives of the public. In truth, what the common people need most is an ensured income that can effectively counteract the punishing impact of runaway inflation on their lives.",

        "full_article": "The worse fear of inconsistent and uncertain gas supplies is now a reality. This is something that experts had been warning of for more than a decade but to no avail. Bangladesh's policy shift from its self-reliance in energy in favour of import has put the nation on a path where supply of natural gas is no longer assured, either for manufacturing or for household consumption.The latest figures that are emerging point to a situation where gas output has suffered a drastic reduction - by about one-third. Now had the economic situation been better, this could have been offset by imports of necessary coal, furnace oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), but the economic realities of today can hardly be termed good for Bangladesh. Gas-centric industries are suffering massive loss of output and these include manufacturing plants, ferliser factories and at the tail end of the spectrum - the millions of people who depend on piped gas for household consumption. A report published in this newspaper recently stated: \"According to state-owned Petrobangla, the overall natural gas output on November 24 was around 2,613 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), which is around 30.50 per cent lower than Bangladesh's overall production capacity of 3,716mmcfd. The country's overall natural gas output is, however, nearly half of the overall demand, which is projected by Petrobangla above 4,000mmcfd.\" Looking at the broader picture, this significant supply crunch is adversely affecting a broad spectrum of consumers. Industrial output in many sectors is now down 50 per cent. Readymade garments (RMG) owners have had to resort to round the clock shift adjustment for maintaining output depending on availability of natural gas, the hundreds of thousands of passenger vehicles and a lot of the light transport vehicles that converted to compressed natural gas (CNG) now can only avail CNG from pumps 18 hours a day because there isn't enough gas to offer.What was predicted but not heeded to is happening now. Official sources have stated that national gas supply took a sharp downturn this month when US multinational Excelerate Energy stopped LNG re-gasification to overhaul and expand its plant. This is routine maintenance that authorities had been postponing for a long time since there was no alternate FSRU (floating storage and re-gasification unit) available. This situation cut LNG supply by 43 per cent and since the country's own existing natural gas supply has been plummeting alarmingly, the situation came to such as pass. This sort of situation will continue to happen because not much imported fossil fuel the country can now afford from the international market. Sources point out to the fact that the country owes billions of dollars in back payment to international suppliers of energy and the situation keeps getting worse every month. That the country is no longer able to clinch soft loans to pay for energy imports is also becoming amply clear. In this situation, the Petrobangla has apparently asked the largest producer of natural gas Chevron to increase production by at least 50 mmcfd from three on-shore gas fields. Currently that company is producing approximately \"1,246 mmcfd of natural gas from three operating onshore fields - Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulvibazar -- located in blocks 12, 13 and 14 respectively.\"It is also known that Chevron's gas production constitutes 60 per cent of the total supply from domestic gas fields. Total gas production (including the LNG re-gasification) is about 2,600 mmcfd. Unfortunately, what has been made clear is that Chevron will probably not be able to enhance gas production from its existing fields. Rather, the extra gas may come from the new well in the Bibiyana field if the result from the drilling proves positive. This shortfall is having a serious detrimental effect on RMG that constitutes 85 per cent of export earnings. Naturally the sector is crucial to the national effort but it is impossible for the authorities to divert all gas to sustain just one sector, but unless the situation improves reality may dictate just that. Gas rationing is hardly conducive to economic growth. The fuel fiasco has led to serious reduction in industrial output and it will also have a serious dampening effect on both domestic and foreign investment. The country is starving for fuel and yet the projects that should be undertaken to expedite discovery and exploration of new natural gas fields are relegated to the backburner. Now the realisation should dawn on the policymakers that dependence on imported fuel is a situation the economy can't afford. There has been zero movement on proven deposits of coal and probable natural gas reserves in the country. The authorities have no answer to this quandary except to do everything possible not to go for serious exploration. The idea of affordable energy is apparently not on the priority list. Hopefully, priorities will change after the national election.\n[email\u00a0protected]",

Feast is the obvious, apparently the most important part of all these celebrations to entertain guests. The feast's preparation depends on the event's size, generally determined by the number of participants or guests, and of course by the hosts' purses. Hosts or event organisers select food items according to their socio-economic conditions. As the selection of foods also becomes a status symbol, there is a growing tendency to provide an array of food items on the table. Be it a small party or a grand reception, guests usually expect lavish gastronomic treat. Serving nicely cooked mutton biryani with kabab and borhani is not enough in many wedding feasts. Chicken tikka should also be there and must be served with nan roti as an appetiser! An icing on the cake would be if the host adds chicken roast beside all these. As these types of wedding foods are now common, serving feasts in a buffet of star hotels is another step ahead where the choice for pleasing the taste bud is multiple. The result of such kingly feasts is special praise reserved for hosts by guests and waste of food in most cases.Many guests do not think before taking food in their plates as their hunger is mostly in their eyes, not their stomachs. They sometimes also need to remember that their stomach has a limited capacity, and it is impossible to put in as much food as their taste buds want. So they cannot eat all the foods served on their plates. It becomes a typical scene in which many people demand more quantity than required, prompting them to throw away some portions of food uneaten or half-eaten. Lack of etiquette on taking food served in buffets also causes waste of food that can be avoided. Some guests fill their plates to the brim, forgetting that they can retake them after finishing a round of eating. Almost one-third of the heaped foods on their plates ultimately go to waste. Again, many lavish buffets offer too many items, and some guests can't resist the temptation of tasting as many items as possible, leading to waste. Regular waste of food is also visible in many hotels, restaurants and roadside eateries.Though a portion of unused, half-used and wasted foods are later given or sold to poor people, it is risky to take those leftovers due to toxicity in many cases. Again, food waste is also a waste of fuel and energy used to cook the cuisine. So, there is a chain effect of waste, which harms the environment. Most people do not want to think about the multiple costs of food waste.There is no doubt that food waste is a global problem. Some approximate estimates show that around one-third of the food produced worldwide is thrown away uneaten or half-eaten. It does not mean that the trend has to continue. Everyone has the responsibility to curb waste of food. Hosts and guests in every family, friend and social gathering need to act sensibly in order to avoid waste of food. \n[email\u00a0protected]",

The newest country in the world, which was born in April 2010, holds large chunks of open, arable land. This unused land is being seen as a source of future food supplies for the rising population of the world. Bangladeshi human resources can play a great role in this process. As I have visited this country several times, I have come to know a bunch of Bangladeshi entrepreneurs who have already started operating their businesses here in South Sudan. They seem to be low-budget entrepreneurs but have indomitable courage. Some big ones are here too. When I came to South Sudan first, with an investor group from Bangladesh, I found only one five-star hotel. Now there are plenty of five-star hotels, including Radisson Blu. Hotels and business are synonymous as far as I am concerned. Bangladeshi entrepreneurs should remember that Juba, the capital of South Sudan, looks just like Dhaka in 1970. If you buy a few plots here, you will be paid off for sure. Many ministers I know here in South Sudan are willing to give away their land for cultivation to any Bangladeshi entrepreneur. The most important thing that the people here love us, as Bangladeshis, for the contribution the soldiers made to develop their infrastructure. Sierra Leone had the same love for us in 2007. But we missed the opportunity and the new generations of Sierra Leone are unwilling to shower the same good will their parents had for us. You cannot really blame them. Solar home systems can be an excellent project in which young Bangladeshi entrepreneurs can invest in. The government, in my view, should also help the younger fresh blood develop the African country so that a good return comes back home. \nMajor (retd) Mahboob Sohel, [email\u00a0protected]",
