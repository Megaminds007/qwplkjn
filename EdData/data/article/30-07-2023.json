The order allowing Sanjay Kumar Mishra, head of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to continue till September 15 at the Centre\u2019s request is needlessly accommodative. It was only on July 11 that the Court declared illegal the extensions given to Mr. Mishra in 2021 and 2022. At the same time, he was permitted to continue till July 31 to ensure a smooth transition. Yet, without any submission that the process to select his successor has been set in motion, the Court has invoked an undefined \u201clarger national interest\u201d to allow him to go on up to September 15. It was a self-serving application in the first place. The ostensible reason that the government finds his services indispensable is that he is helming the country\u2019s efforts to demonstrate its framework to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism during a country review before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The multi-lateral body adopts a mutual evaluation system and India\u2019s ongoing review will go on until June 2024, when the final evaluation report may be considered at a likely plenary discussion on its compliance status. The government sought an extension of his services until October 15, presumably because the country\u2019s agencies and institutions may be ready by then for an on-site visit by an FATF delegation.As the agency that administers the law against money laundering, the ED may have a key role in preparing the country\u2019s presentation, but it is difficult to believe that the process depends on one individual. Even if it were so, nothing prevented the government from utilising Mr. Mishra\u2019s services for FATF purposes alone, while leaving the directorate\u2019s routine activities under his successor. In any case, various agencies and authorities are involved in framing the country\u2019s policies on money laundering and terrorism financing. It is unfortunate that the Court did not countenance arguments that highlighted these points. It did raise questions as to how one person could be indispensable, but ultimately chose to allow him to continue for some more time. One can understand the argument that the country\u2019s image depends on a positive FATF evaluation, but the claim that not giving Mr. Mishra an extension might result in a \u201cnegative image\u201d is quite incomprehensible. India\u2019s credentials will be evaluated on its laws, systems and compliance with global standards and not on who prepared the report. The Court\u2019s permissiveness detracts from its resolve to hold the government to account for actions that it had itself declared illegal.\r\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\njudiciary (system of justice)\n\n/\n\ninvestigation\n\n/\n\nterrorism (crime)\n\n/\n\ngovernment\n\n/\n\nmoney laundering",

        "full_article": "The United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, this week reiterated the consequences of the climate catastrophe that has enveloped the globe. The earth had passed from a warming phase into an \u201cera of global boiling\u201d, he said at the U.N.\u2019s headquarters in New York. His comments come even as scientific evidence converges on the conclusion that July is set to be the hottest month in the last 12,000 years. This was a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the whole planet, he said, noting that \u201cshort of a mini-Ice Age over the next few days, July 2023 will shatter records everywhere\u201d. Scientists from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the European Commission\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service described conditions this month as \u201crather remarkable and unprecedented\u201d, with July seeing the hottest three-week period on record. Average July temperature so far has been 16.95\u00b0 Celsius, 0.2\u00b0 C warmer than in July 2019 \u2014 a record in the 174-year observational data of the European Union.With ocean temperatures on the rise and the Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean transitioning from La Ni\u00f1a conditions \u2014 where average sea surface temperatures are below normal \u2014 to El Ni\u00f1o conditions, the opposite, it was widely expected that temperatures would be warmer than that in the last three years (when La Ni\u00f1a prevailed). However, it is the distribution and impact of the 16.95\u00b0 C, which includes temperature in northwest China touching 52\u00b0 C; wildfires in Greece and the baking heat in the United States\u2019 Southwest. The extraordinarily high rains in north and western India, while largely due to prevailing monsoon conditions, were also due to the warm air increasing atmospheric capacity to hold moisture resulting in short torrential bursts, causing floods and devastation. While climate prognostication induces pessimism, Mr. Guterres said that it was still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0 C and avoid the very worst of climate change but only with \u201cdramatic, immediate climate action\u201d. At a G-20 ministerial meet in Chennai the same day, the COP28 President-designate, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, also emphasised that the world\u2019s largest economies should be more ambitious with emission cuts. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to make India the \u201cthird largest economy\u201d if his party is re-elected in the general election, it will also mean greater pressure on India to take on a greater share of greenhouse gas mitigation responsibilities. This could mean advancing its net zero commitments from 2070 to 2050, as Mr. Guterres says, and generating fossil-free electricity by 2040. While these are the testy points on which climate negotiations hinge, the climate \u2014 it bears reminding \u2014 waits for nobody.\nCOMMents\n SHARE\n\nCopy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit\n\nRelated Topics\n\nUnited Nations\n\n/\n\nglobal warming\n\n/\n\noceans\n\n/\n\nG20\n\n/\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\n\n/\n\ncarbon emissions\n\n/\n\nChennai\n\n/\n\nclimate change",

        "full_article": "Competing newspaper op-eds by PM\u2019s Economic Advisory Council and two former chief statisticians have led to back and forth about the weakness of our statistical systems and political motivations behind impugning statistics. However, they offer a silver lining by highlighting the importance of statistics for evidence-informed policymaking. Several observations are noteworthy:\n\nIndian national statistical systems are in crisis.Either data needed for policymaking is not available or not deemed reliable. Examples of this crisis abound. The sitting chief statistician of India argued that data from the flagship consumption expenditure survey of the National Sample Survey from 2017-18 was unreliable and suppressed the results. This left us floundering without official data on poverty. India\u2019s unbroken record of conducting a decennial census since 1861 was broken during the pandemic. While this delay was understandable at the height of the pandemic, a continued delay is inexplicable.\n\n\nIndian statistical infrastructure has not kept pace with global advances. Past decades have seen tremendous advances in methods for data collection and collation. Computerised surveys, including in-person, telephone, web, and text-based interviews, require a different way of thinking in questionnaire design. They also allow better quality monitoring using audio recording, interviewer prompts, and keystroke analysis. Advances in sampling methodologies include responsive survey design, where the interviewers are asked to make a greater effort in interviewing individuals with rare characteristics (eg, college graduate tribal women) than those with more common attributes. We have not developed institutional mechanisms for keeping up with global advances or ensuring that unique Indian conditions (eg, linguistic diversity) are incorporated into these advances.\nWe tend to react to global discourse rather than lead it.Global index construction has become a minor industry, with international \u201cexperts\u201d often unable to incorporate regionally specific conditions. This can both inflate and deflate India\u2019s position in the world with little relevance for ground realities. The now discredited Ease of Doing Business index of the World Bank showed significant improvement for India because it used electricity connections as an indicator, not the reliability of electric supply. In contrast, India performed poorly on the World Economic Forum Gender Gap Index. It includes the gender gap in wealth but does not include the gender gap in poverty. India would fare better on gender gap in poverty than the US because while the overall standard of living is higher in the US, American women suffer from greater poverty than men due to high rates of divorce and single parenting, which is not a factor for India. Advocacy for adding contextual reflections to the applicability of global standards is not always politically motivated, although in some cases, it can be.\n\nSchool teachers busy marking house on Census at Shanthala Nagar in Bangaloreon Thursday.\nWhile acknowledging these mounting challenges, how can we rebuild India\u2019s once-vaunted Mahalanobis-designed statistical system? This cannot be done without a thoughtful redesign of our statistical infrastructure with a substantial government commitment.\nThe first principle of a new system should be that statistics are too important to be left to statisticians. In a modern world, we need an interdisciplinary approach that brings together diverse social science and public health domain experts, research methodologists, statisticians, data scientists, and computer scientists. Our investments in research methodology stopped when the research unit for National Sample Survey housed in Indian Statistical Institute was disbanded. We need a new interdisciplinary institute, possibly under the aegis of the NITI Aayog, where innovations in research methodology can be explored, allowing us to keep up with global advances while responding to uniquely Indian conditions. Holistic training programs in research methodologies should be developed in diverse universities.\nSecond, as Pramit Bhattacharya notes in a paper, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation barely receives 0.2% of central government expenditure, and 3/4 of that is for the MPLAD scheme, unrelated to statistics. We need greater monetary investment in the data collection systems combined with greater demands for data quality and oversight. The dissolution of the NSS governing council has left a hole that must be plugged. The National Statistical Commission should be fully staffed and empowered.\nThird, we must be realistic about what we expect from statistical systems. The demand that the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) provide district-level estimates of health indicators led to a seven-fold increase in sample size between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4, which has affected its data quality, as recorded by several academic articles. Moreover, even with this explosion, sample sizes are insufficient to provide district-level estimates of indicators such as infant mortality.\nTrust in statistical systems is much easier to lose than to gain. Without a consistent commitment to systemic reforms, this war of words will diminish our confidence in statistics and not help in policymaking that relies on evidence rather than ideology.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The National Education Policy released in 2020 opened doors for India\u2019s public funded higher educational institutions to open campuses abroad. IIT Delhi was the first public funded institution in the country to approach the government in 2020 for permission to open a campus abroad. Now, IIT Delhi and IIT Madras have been granted permission to start their international campuses in Abu Dhabi and Tanzania, respectively. Other IITs may follow suit. This is indeed a historical moment for India with our public funded institutions venturing into foreign shores. Let\u2019s examine the benefits IITs can gain from these international campuses, and what needs to be done to leverage this opportunity?\n1. Increased diversity: Operating campuses in different countries helps attract a diverse pool of students from various cultural and educational backgrounds. This enriches the learning experience, fosters cross-cultural understanding, and prepares students for a globalised world. It\u2019s important, therefore, to not rely on just the Indian diaspora to study in these campuses but rather to attract students of diverse nationalities.\n2. International rankings: In this year\u2019s QS World University Rankings, our older five IITs received an average of 1.3 points out of 100 for international students and 2.9 points out of 100 for international faculty. This pulls down their international rankings considerably. Given the challenges with infrastructure, admission policies and cultural differences, it\u2019s difficult to expect international students to come and study in IITs in India. By having international campuses and offering Bachelor of Science (BS) programs (so as not to dilute the brand value of BTech degrees offered in Indian campuses), there is an opportunity to expand the IIT brand globally and attract more foreign students to its Indian campuses as well. This cross-pollination of talent and ideas can elevate the institution\u2019s status and rankings. Another way to improve cultural diversity is to have students in these international campuses spend time on the main campus in India for a minimum period of one semester to a year as part of their curriculum requirements. The enhanced fee charged from these students can help support the infrastructure requirements to host these students. This will also significantly enhance our international rankings.\n\u00a0\nGlobal footprint: An overseas campus like IIT Zanzibar can boost both reputation and rankings\n3. Global reputation enhancement: One of the reasons for the poor showing in international rankings is also because of low perception scores. In the last QS global university rankings, the five older IITs scored an average of 21.9 points out of 100 in the total weighted reputation score. Having an international footprint will help improve perception of our institutions which, in turn, can help our standing in international rankings.\n4. Revenue generation: International campuses can add an additional revenue source for IITs. They can charge higher fees, and if properly managed and with rules permitting, surplus funds can be reinvested in the main campus back in India, improving infrastructure and academic facilities here.\n5. Collaboration opportunities: They can also serve as hubs for collaboration with foreign universities, research institutions, and industries. This facilitates knowledge exchange, joint research projects, and technology transfer, leading to innovations and advancements in various fields.\n6. International faculty recruitments: Freed of rigid salary slabs that exist on Indian campuses, these foreign campuses may be able to attract more international scholars as faculty. Main campuses need to utilise this global talent pool. For example, it\u2019s well-known that research papers co-authored with international scholars receive twice the number of citations as compared to purely national collaborations.\n7. Alumni engagement: Having overseas campuses can strengthen ties with IIT alumni spread across the world. This support can be crucial for funding research, scholarships, and infrastructure development.\n8. Addressing brain drain: By offering quality education and research opportunities abroad, Indian institutions can potentially retain some of the top Indian talent that might otherwise have gone elsewhere.\n9. Policy influence: Global presence of our institutions can also provide India with greater leverage in shaping policies, both in India and the host countries of their international campuses. This soft power can help improve India\u2019s prestige abroad.\nHowever, establishing and maintaining international campuses also comes with challenges such as meeting regulatory requirements, availability of resources, ensuring quality control, and maintaining the institution\u2019s core values and standards across all campuses. It\u2019s also important not to overdo this. We need to see how the two extension campuses perform before expanding on this model further with other IITs. With careful planning and execution, the benefits can outweigh the challenges, contributing to the overall growth, reputation and global rankings of our institutions.\n\n",

However, as Europe scorches under record-breaking summer temperatures, with selfie-taking tourist hotspot like Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps and Athens\u2019 Acropolis registering 44\u00b0C temperatures, crazed canines who venture out in the blaze of noonday, might have to do so without the companionship of John Bull, Jane Bull, and a brood of little Bulls.\nHoliday-makers in Britain are reportedly cancelling planned European sojourns in droves, fearful of becoming human barbecue by the sizzling heat, which is turning the beach-bathing skin of their compatriots unfortunate enough to already be there, to the painful pink of char-grilled lobsters.\nInternational media is abuzz like a swarm of angry bees with reports of European road sign-painters fainting from their exertions in the furnace of afternoon. Many schools have declared closure to protect their wards from the unprecedented solar ferocity and more and more offices are changing their operation hours so as to begin work in the relative coolth of the early morning at 6 am and shut shop before 3 pm, deemed to be the hottest part of the day.\nWill Britain\u2019s Summer Holiday as rhapsodised by the 1963 Cliff Richard starrer of that name be as much a thing of the past as the octogenarian pop icon himself? Will sunseeking Britannia no longer rule the waves that separate her from the Continent, where the wogs begin at Calais, and where they\u2019ll jolly well understand what you\u2019re saying if you say it loud enough in English, ek bloody dum?\nEven as parts of Europe are literally ablaze, with heat-generated wildfires reported from the Greek island of Rhodes, Cool Britannia is literally playing it cool in Summer 2023, with temperatures for the most part averaging a pleasant maximum of 24\u00b0C or below.\nThis has made what in the tourism trade are known as \u2018staycations\u2019 a growth industry. A staycation is a vacation in which you take your holiday break within the borders of your own country, or even within the comfort-zone of your own home, making occasional forays to local attractions.\nWhat might be called the Staycation Syndrome could well buttress Britain\u2019s reputation for insularity, as the natives discover the hitherto undetected charms of hidden gems in the back of the boonies of their very own sceptred isle, with names of arch quaintness such as Nether Wallop, and shibbolethic tongue-twisters like Happisburgh (pronounced Haze-burra)-on-Sea.\nEurope itself could welcome such a development, as it would ease the swarming hordes of tourists whose overwhelming incursions have required municipal authorities in Italy and elsewhere to impose prohibitive fines on visitors loitering without intent on Venice\u2019s Rialto Bridge, taking an unskinny dip in Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain, or strolling sans shirts through the streets of Florence.\nThe winds of extreme climate change may well be set to blow not only through the travel business but also through the realm of politics.\nWith UK\u2019s 2025 general elections looming on the poll-bound horizon, and the Tories\u2019 precarious perch in office auguring a possible anti-Brexit Labour victory, thus raising the likelihood of another referendum on Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, the heated debate between the so-called \u2018remainers\u2019 and \u2018leavers\u2019 will become even more impassioned, with Europe\u2019s summer of sweltering discontent adding fuel to the fire.\nThe Brexiteers might convincingly argue that they\u2019re well shot of the EU which, with its Brussels-based babucracy, could have insisted that it offloads some of its excessive heat to tantalisingly temperate Britain, on the grounds that the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which laid the foundation stone for the conjoining of the member states, mandates a share-and-share-alike spirit of cooperation and fair give-and-take.\nThe anti-Brexiteers, or \u2018remainers\u2019, would be hard pressed to rebut such a contention, except perhaps to sound a warning that global climate change could well ensure Britain\u2019s enforced import of Europe\u2019s steamy weather, Maastricht Treaty or no Maastricht Treaty, like it or lump it.\nIn which case, shouldn\u2019t Britain prepare itself for such torrid onslaughts, by redesigning homes and workplaces so as to not become summer hothouses, perhaps even incorporating the effete American affectation called air-conditioning, by Gad?\nBritain might start rolling the ball in that direction by learning to sing the blues and join in Europe\u2019s chorus: Summertime, and the living is awful,/Our sweat is dripping,/And the mercury\u2019s high,/The sunburn\u2019s a bitch,/And the rash is bad-looking,/So bawl, EU baby, as we fry\u2026\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is truly distressing that despite the grandiloquent promises of women's empowerment in Bangladesh, we are still a long way from ensuring their safety, much less their full potential. A woman's fight for survival in this patriarchal world is so ruthless that it starts from the womb, with an overwhelming majority of families still preferring sons over daughters \u2013 and some going to extreme lengths to terminate the pregnancy when they find out they are going to have a girl child. As new technologies that can identify the sex of a foetus at early stages of pregrancy become more easily available, the risk of gender-biased sex selection also increases, according to experts.\nGiven the depressing reality, we welcome the formulation of a national guideline for the prevention of gender-biased sex selection, which aims to create awareness about preventing the misuse of prenatal diagnosis procedures and tests for determining the sex of the foetus at any time of the pregnancy, as well as the abuse of infertility treatment for sex selection. The guideline was adopted as per a High Court directive in 2020, which also prohibited medical professionals from divulging the sex of a foetus during prenatal procedures.\nUnfortunately, despite the court order, families can still easily access the information in many medical establishments across the country. Thus, it is imperative that key stakeholders, such as medical staff, are engaged and sensitised about the ethical, social and demographic implications of sex selection, which the guideline proposes to do.\nA study conducted by the University of Dhaka with support from UNFPA found that both men and women preferred sons over daughters, but that women were more likely to want sons than men. This may be because in many families, particularly in rural areas, women are still blamed when they give birth to daughters and are valued less for their failure to provide a male heir. Experts suggest that even the knowledge that they are carrying girls can at times lead mothers to suffer from depression and fail to provide adequate care and nutrition to their foetuses during pregnancy.\nAll these suggest that a lot more needs to be done to establish gender equality in the country. There must be renewed focus on challenging entrenched patriarchal norms that still undervalue women to such an enormous extent that their very birth is considered a curse.\n",

        "full_article": "The state of Bangladesh's construction projects is once again under the spotlight after news has emerged of the deplorable condition of the Khulna-Satkhira regional highway. According to a report by this daily, this 64km road, after being renovated in 2020, has all but crumbled within a mere three years, leaving us with yet another example of poor planning and lax quality control in the government's infrastructure endeavours.\nReportedly, the renovation project \u2013 taken up by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in 2018 \u2013 involved a budget of Tk 160 crore as well as a plan to widen the road from 18 to 36 feet, with the inclusion of culverts, drainage systems, and strategically placed bus stops. All this was meant to boost connectivity and economic progress in the region. The project, completed in June 2020, was among the 100 roads and highways inaugurated by the prime minister the following year. However, three years on, it now lies dilapidated, riddled with potholes, and with patches of rutted bitumen strewn particularly in the 33km stretch of the road in Khulna. This, according to local residents and drivers, has led to a surge in accidents, putting innocent lives at risk.\nThe question is: how can a road, reopened with so much fanfare and promise, fall into disrepair within just three years? The obvious suspect \u2013 as locals were quick to point out \u2013 is the use of substandard materials during its construction. We have seen this happen in case of so many other projects \u2013 roads, bridges, culverts \u2013 as well. In fact, it was only yesterday that we commented on the woeful state of two newly constructed bridges in Lalmonirhat that had also suffered from poor planning and workmanship. In case of the Khulna-Satkhira highway, the RHD tried to shift the blame to heavy vehicles, especially overloaded stone-laden trucks coming from the Bhomra Land Port. This is nothing but an attempt to deflect responsibility. While excessive traffic and overloading can undoubtedly contribute to road wear and tear, it cannot be the sole reason for its rapid deterioration. The construction of any road should be robust enough to withstand expected traffic for a considerable time.\nThis points to a serious lack of oversight and quality control measures, which is why we are not much convinced by the Khulna RHD executive engineer's assurance about the planned upgradation of the regional highway into a national one. We cannot be trapped into an endless cycle of costly upgradation/renovation projects that promise so much but deliver so little. Evidently, what we are dealing with is a systemic problem. And it needs to be dealt with systemically. We urge the government to conduct a thorough review of all ongoing and completed construction projects to ensure that they meet the highest quality standards, and to protect them from premature damage. There must be accountability in all such projects.\n",

In February 2006, a professor of Rajshahi University was killed after he detected plagiarism and piracy in 10 of the 11 research papers submitted by his junior colleague as part of his promotion application. Prof Syed Taher Ahmed would have \"turned-him-in.\" The applicant realised that his career would end if he allowed his senior colleague to reveal the academic forgery. Mia Muhammad Mohiuddin, an associate professor in Taher's department, reacted the only way he could \u2013 resorting to violence. Emboldened by his political connections, thanks to his minister brother-in-law, he hired men to end Taher's life. The body was dumped into the septic tank in the victim's house. Two days later, the putrid smell of the missing professor's decaying body filled the air and brought the crime to the public's attention.\nIn a rare show of dexterity and courage, in less than two months, police charged six people, including Mohiuddin, his brother, the Rajshahi University unit president of Islami Chhatra Shibir at the time, and a university staff member. A judgment announced on May 22, 2008 acquitted two charge-sheeted accused. But the trial dragged on, and bail was given to one main accused. Prof Ahmed's daughter, Shegufta Tabassum Ahmed, who had just started studying law as an undergraduate student when her father was murdered, resolved to seek justice. Ironically, it was her father who had convinced her to become a lawyer. He assured her that she wouldn't need to practise law in a courtroom. She could use her expertise in teaching or consulting. But as fate would have it, this young lawyer would have to move mountains to guarantee justice for her wronged father. The powerful lobby behind the murderers kept delaying the trial process to deny justice for Shegufta's family.\nBut Shegufta's persistence paid off. A six-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by Chief Justice Hasan Foez Siddique, delivered the last verdict in the case on September 15 last year. The death sentences against two convicts were upheld, while the other two received life sentences. Two prisoners on death row were hanged on Thursday, 17 years after the murder. The soul of a dead father can now rest in peace. Rajshahi University can feel slightly relieved at the execution of the perpetrators of a heinous crime.\n\nAs an academic, what worries me is the exponential unfolding of a simple instance of academic dishonesty. The seed of violence was hiding the kernel of a criminal mind that felt it was his right to pursue wrong. The murder took place before this hullabaloo that we have over artificial intelligence acting as both perpetrator and police of a crime.\nThe saga, if I may use the genre to describe the event, has many layers. At a family level, a daughter rose to the occasion to pursue justice. A dead father, quite ominously, initiated her in an academic discipline that would secure justice for him in this earthly world. At an academic level, it goes on to show how an act of academic dishonesty keeps on snowballing. They say that lies breed lies. Here, crimes breed crimes.\nA university teacher used pirated and plagiarised materials to claim authorship and climb up to the level of an associate professor. For the last rung of his academic ladder, he had to face Prof Taher Ahmed. In a Ludo game, Taher would have appeared like the big snake before you reached your goal. Mohiuddin's animal instinct came out. In the words of the judge who wrote the verdict, he \"annihilated Dr Taher from this world presuming that if Professor Taher lived, the chance of his getting promotion would be zero.\" At a political level, the case showed much muscle-flexing as it both charged and acquitted a high-profile student leader. For justice to be delivered, the powerful bodies needed to be in cosmic alignment. Even the convicts knew that. According to jail witnesses, the prisoners on death row asked to say their prayers one last time after solace was offered to them by an Imam.\nAs an academic, what worries me is the exponential unfolding of a simple instance of academic dishonesty. The seed of violence was hiding the kernel of a criminal mind that felt it was his right to pursue wrong. The murder took place before this hullabaloo that we have over artificial intelligence acting as both perpetrator and police of a crime. The open-access ChatGPT is the e-genie that can write stuff for you at your command. Then again, there are other e-genies that can catch the theft. Whether we like it or not, machines will make our lives easier. And civilisation will always be comforted by the ease offered by technology. Nobody remembers number tables anymore, because our phones have an in-built calculator. You don't need to memorise your mother's phone number, because you can always speed-dial or give a voice command. How will this overreliance on someone else's efforts or memory affect us? The lure of presenting someone else's work as your own is as strong as ever. We are all being sucked into a logic of ease. They will soon dump anyone who gets in their way into the hole that man has dug.\nThe challenge is how to use this forgery in an ethical manner. Yes, you heard it right: how do you become creative in hiding the traces of your stealing and validate AI-driven research as your own? That is where the new focus of pedagogy is being shifted. Earlier this month, the University of Kentucky formed a new committee to look at the impact of artificial intelligence and tools like ChatGPT on higher education and to recommend effective uses of AI.\nPerhaps, both Taher and Mohiuddin would have been alive if technology had been there to protect them from academic sacrilege. Seriously, though, we can blame the machine as much as we like, but it has become an integral part of our existence. Surely, without technology, the crime would not have been unearthed with such speed. It was humans who committed the crime. It was humans who felt wronged that a promotion would not happen because of a man, and therefore he deserved to die. His life was wasted and disposed of like filth. But from the dirty filth, the truth appeared. The victim's flesh and blood appeared in court and demanded justice in the name of the law. The convicts, convinced of their cold calculation, cold-bloodedly killed a man who would not deviate from telling the truth. The murder case of Prof Taher Ahmed reminds us of the human conundrum that often loses its way in the name of truth and falsehood. Technology is just a conduit through which this truth and falsity must pass!\n\u00a0\nDr Shamsad Mortuza\u00a0is a professor of English at Dhaka University.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is truly distressing that despite the grandiloquent promises of women's empowerment in Bangladesh, we are still a long way from ensuring their safety, much less their full potential. A woman's fight for survival in this patriarchal world is so ruthless that it starts from the womb, with an overwhelming majority of families still preferring sons over daughters \u2013 and some going to extreme lengths to terminate the pregnancy when they find out they are going to have a girl child. As new technologies that can identify the sex of a foetus at early stages of pregrancy become more easily available, the risk of gender-biased sex selection also increases, according to experts.\nGiven the depressing reality, we welcome the formulation of a national guideline for the prevention of gender-biased sex selection, which aims to create awareness about preventing the misuse of prenatal diagnosis procedures and tests for determining the sex of the foetus at any time of the pregnancy, as well as the abuse of infertility treatment for sex selection. The guideline was adopted as per a High Court directive in 2020, which also prohibited medical professionals from divulging the sex of a foetus during prenatal procedures.\nUnfortunately, despite the court order, families can still easily access the information in many medical establishments across the country. Thus, it is imperative that key stakeholders, such as medical staff, are engaged and sensitised about the ethical, social and demographic implications of sex selection, which the guideline proposes to do.\nA study conducted by the University of Dhaka with support from UNFPA found that both men and women preferred sons over daughters, but that women were more likely to want sons than men. This may be because in many families, particularly in rural areas, women are still blamed when they give birth to daughters and are valued less for their failure to provide a male heir. Experts suggest that even the knowledge that they are carrying girls can at times lead mothers to suffer from depression and fail to provide adequate care and nutrition to their foetuses during pregnancy.\nAll these suggest that a lot more needs to be done to establish gender equality in the country. There must be renewed focus on challenging entrenched patriarchal norms that still undervalue women to such an enormous extent that their very birth is considered a curse.\n",

        "full_article": "The state of Bangladesh's construction projects is once again under the spotlight after news has emerged of the deplorable condition of the Khulna-Satkhira regional highway. According to a report by this daily, this 64km road, after being renovated in 2020, has all but crumbled within a mere three years, leaving us with yet another example of poor planning and lax quality control in the government's infrastructure endeavours.\nReportedly, the renovation project \u2013 taken up by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in 2018 \u2013 involved a budget of Tk 160 crore as well as a plan to widen the road from 18 to 36 feet, with the inclusion of culverts, drainage systems, and strategically placed bus stops. All this was meant to boost connectivity and economic progress in the region. The project, completed in June 2020, was among the 100 roads and highways inaugurated by the prime minister the following year. However, three years on, it now lies dilapidated, riddled with potholes, and with patches of rutted bitumen strewn particularly in the 33km stretch of the road in Khulna. This, according to local residents and drivers, has led to a surge in accidents, putting innocent lives at risk.\nThe question is: how can a road, reopened with so much fanfare and promise, fall into disrepair within just three years? The obvious suspect \u2013 as locals were quick to point out \u2013 is the use of substandard materials during its construction. We have seen this happen in case of so many other projects \u2013 roads, bridges, culverts \u2013 as well. In fact, it was only yesterday that we commented on the woeful state of two newly constructed bridges in Lalmonirhat that had also suffered from poor planning and workmanship. In case of the Khulna-Satkhira highway, the RHD tried to shift the blame to heavy vehicles, especially overloaded stone-laden trucks coming from the Bhomra Land Port. This is nothing but an attempt to deflect responsibility. While excessive traffic and overloading can undoubtedly contribute to road wear and tear, it cannot be the sole reason for its rapid deterioration. The construction of any road should be robust enough to withstand expected traffic for a considerable time.\nThis points to a serious lack of oversight and quality control measures, which is why we are not much convinced by the Khulna RHD executive engineer's assurance about the planned upgradation of the regional highway into a national one. We cannot be trapped into an endless cycle of costly upgradation/renovation projects that promise so much but deliver so little. Evidently, what we are dealing with is a systemic problem. And it needs to be dealt with systemically. We urge the government to conduct a thorough review of all ongoing and completed construction projects to ensure that they meet the highest quality standards, and to protect them from premature damage. There must be accountability in all such projects.\n",
