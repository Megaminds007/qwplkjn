Addressing the media on Friday after announcing the MPC\u2019s first monetary policy review of the new fiscal year, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das was emphatic in stating that \u201cin the sequence of priorities, we have now put inflation before growth\u201d. More than three years after it prioritised growth over price stability \u2014 in February 2019, and well before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the RBI has pivoted back to putting the horse before the cart, best reflected in the central bank\u2019s own words on monetary policy goals: \u201cPrice stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable growth\u201d. That it has taken the outbreak of war in Europe, with its accompanying commodity price shocks to remind the RBI of the imperative centrality of price stability is a salutary reminder that monetary policymakers can ill afford to be complacent when it comes to inflation. Less than two months after it rather sanguinely projected inflation to average 4.5% in the fiscal year to March 2023, the MPC has raised the forecast by a substantial 120 basis points to 5.7%. And this even as it cut its earlier projection for real GDP growth in the current fiscal by 60 basis points to 7.2%. The RBI also made it clear that while it had left benchmark interest rates and its accommodative policy stance unchanged for now, the time had come to commence the \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d.To be sure, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was still two weeks in the future the last time the RBI\u2019s rate-setting panel finalised its policy review. And yet, the price of crude oil, which Mr. Das cited as the key factor that had necessitated the revision of the inflation projection and the pivot, had already been on the boil since December. The price of the Indian basket of crude had surged by about 25% over the two months to February 1, with Brent crude climbing by a steeper 30% in the same period. In fact, the lone dissenter on the MPC on the issue of the policy stance in February, Jayanth Varma, had stressed the need to look ahead at the likely state of the economy at least three to four quarters later and shift to a \u2018neutral\u2019 stance given that monetary policy acts with a lag. The RBI\u2019s Deputy Governor overseeing monetary policy, Michael Patra, had on the other hand at the last MPC meeting starkly warned that, \u201ccentral banks have a choice: either accept higher inflation for some time or be prepared to be accountable for destroying demand\u201d. With the RBI\u2019s own quarterly projections for inflation now presaging the possibility of a policy failure by way of three consecutive quarters of inflation above the 6% upper bound, policymakers have clearly realised any further delay in changing tack would risk leaving the economy with neither growth nor price stability.",

        "full_article": "Union Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s statement on making Hindi the language of communication for people of non-Hindi speaking areas or States was absolutely unnecessary. As the chairman of the Parliamentary Official Language Committee, he is duty bound to promote the spread of the Hindi language. But, the impression his speech generated at the 37th meeting of the panel in New Delhi last week is that he wanted to impose the language. Calling for the use of an Indian language among people who spoke languages other than Hindi, Mr. Shah said Hindi should be accepted as an alternative to English and not to local languages. It is up to the people of any two non-Hindi speaking areas or States to decide what their language of communication should be. If they are comfortable with English, which is also a global language, the Centre has no business in advising them to abandon English and take to any other language or Hindi, as done in this case. Mr. Shah\u2019s observations presuppose the position that English is not an Indian language. What he seems to have overlooked is that English has been recognised as an Indian language as much as Tamil or Telugu or Hindi have. This recognition is also due to the Sahitya Akademi, a central institution working for literary dialogue in the country. The Akademi, under the control of the Ministry of Culture, has, among others, been giving away annual awards for the best works of English, of course authored by Indians. Besides, the advantage that English gives to India has to be kept in mind. As pointed out by the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, D.K. Shivakumar, Bengaluru became India\u2019s IT capital because of English. It would be befitting for a person holding the office of Union Home Minister to shed any aversion to English, which has been a unifying force in a vast and diverse society such as India.Expectedly, Mr. Shah\u2019s statement has been condemned politically, especially by the non-BJP Opposition parties. Even the AIADMK, a party that has been friendly to the BJP, has issued a statement through its coordinator and former Chief Minister, O. Panneerselvam, who expressed his disapproval of any move to \u201cimpose Hindi.\u201d But, most significantly, it is Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin who rightly lashed out at Mr. Shah for seeking to create a \u201csingle identity,\u201d which, Mr. Stalin has pointed out, will not create unity. It is nobody\u2019s case that Indian languages, let alone Hindi, should not be nurtured and promoted. They all deserve the support of the state. Those in power should also follow up their words with substantive measures towards this direction. But, at the same time, no room should be given for any perception that the promotion drive will be at the cost of English. Respect for multiculturalism and a pluralistic identity is a quality that the political class, particularly those in power, should imbibe. Mr. Shah would do very well if he demonstrates, through words and actions, that he has that quality in abundance.",

        "full_article": "Right now, Sri Lanka is going through its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Mounting debt, negligible foreign exchange reserves and runaway inflation have brought the country's economy to the brink of collapse. Such a situation has led the Sri Lankan people to unbearable sufferings, with power cuts for about 13 hours and acute shortage of food, fuel, medicine, and other essentials. The economic crisis has been in the making for several years. The impact of Covid-19 on Sri Lanka has been prominent; the pandemic severely affected its tourism industry, which has been an important source of income for the island country. The signs of economic challenges were apparent for quite some time, but became more visible in the last one year.\nWhat prompted the economic crisis?\nThe first is the mounting foreign debt, which stands at 119 percent of Sri Lanka's GDP. The government has taken foreign loans to implement projects and finance public services in an imprudent manner. As a result, public debt has reached an unsustainable level\u2014much higher than the recommended 55 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And the country's foreign exchange reserve is insufficient to repay the debt. The debt payment has reached about USD 7 billion so far. Some of the loans have been taken at high interest rates, for projects that have not been economically profitable. Mismanagement and corruption have worsened the situation.\nSome of the populist moves made by the Sri Lankan government backfired. For example, in March 2020, it announced it would fully adopt organic agriculture. So, it imposed an import ban on pesticides and chemical fertilisers. As a result, agricultural output declined by about 30 percent. So, it had to import more by using its foreign currency, putting further pressure on the reserve.\nThen the government slashed the VAT rate from 15 percent to 8 percent to stimulate the economy. Also, the income tax bracket was raised from 500,000 Sri Lankan rupees to three million rupees annually, which cut down the number of taxpayers by 33.5 percent. Economists have estimated that the total tax income loss because of these measures is equivalent to two percent of Sri Lanka's GDP. Without adequate domestic resource mobilisation, the country had to use its forex reserves to repay its foreign debt. In 2018, Sri Lanka had a reserve of USD 6.9 billion, which fell to only USD 2.2 billion in 2022.\nThe exchange rate of the Sri Lankan rupee against USD saw a dramatic devaluation as the government floated the rupee in March 2022, aiming to boost exports and remittances. As a result, the exchange rate between the rupee and USD has reached 315 as of April 9, 2022, as opposed to 199 in 2021. With shrinking forex reserves, the country lost its capacity to import essential goods and services, resulting in an unprecedentedly high inflation. For example, in 2021, inflation was 6.9 percent, which spiked to 18.7 percent in March 2022. Food inflation shot to about 30 percent in March 2022.\nHow has the Sri Lankan government been tackling the crisis?\nSri Lanka has been seeking funds from various sources to tackle the crisis. In June 2021, Bangladesh gave a credit facility of USD 200 million under a currency swap deal with Sri Lanka, which was renewed in December 2021. In January 2022, Sri Lanka requested China to ease its debt. In February 2022, Sri Lanka also borrowed USD 500 million from India. Then in March 2022, India provided a line of credit of USD 1 billion to purchase food, medicine, and essentials. The central bank increased interest rates by 700 basis points to control inflation. For a long time, the Sri Lankan government has been reluctant to take loans from the IMF. Now it has turned to the IMF for a bailout.\nHowever, such measures without redressing the governance and institutional issues will not see any success given the nature and depth of the economic downturn.\nShould Bangladesh be worried?\nBangladesh is doing well compared to its South Asian neighbours. However, some of the key economic indicators are showing worrying signs. Its trade deficit is growing as imports have become costlier due to rising international prices. Export growth during July-March of FY2021-22 was 33.4 percent, while import grew by 46.7 percent during July-February. Remittance growth during July-March of FY2021-22 was negative (-) 17.8 percent, resulting in a current account deficit.\nThe debt-GDP ratio is 38 percent, which is still comfortable. But foreign loan is increasing at a fast pace. Some large projects are being implemented using huge loans at high commercial rates. Cost escalation due to delay in implementation as well as corruption also reduces the profitability and delays the economic returns from these infrastructures. Once the repayment starts, there will be pressure on our foreign exchange reserve.\nIs there any message for South Asian countries? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSri Lanka's economic catastrophe is rooted in the very nature of its politics. Once much better placed compared to its South Asian neighbours, the country has been brought down by dictatorial power, extreme populism, and a total lack of understanding of reality. As it grapples with its unprecedented economic downturn, other South Asian countries are also facing economic vulnerabilities, especially in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Though the extent of their challenges varies, there is a need to be cautious. Some are also dealing with political crises.\nLack of competence, economic mismanagement, poor governance, lack of accountability, intolerance towards difference in opinion, and lack of inclusiveness in the democratic process are common in the region. The region is also characterised by a unique culture of being ruled by political dynasties\u2014sometimes in feudal style. This destroys the institutions that are the pillars of democracy. In the end, it leads to disasters\u2014like the one Sri Lanka is experiencing now.\n\u00a0\nDr Fahmida Khatun is executive director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD).

        "full_article": "Cults\u2014political and religious\u2014can be long-lived and deadly dangerous. Building on his cricketing success and cancer hospital, Imran Khan worked relentlessly for decades at self-promotion. His growing cult swallowed story after story: corruption would end in 90 days; the national treasury would overflow once\u00a0 \"looted dollars\" stashed by political rivals in secret overseas accounts were brought back.\nNaya Pakistan would overflow with milk and honey\u2014Khan would \"commit suicide but never return to the IMF\"; foreign policy would be based upon principle rather than expediency; the world's most sought-after passport would become the green one; and Pakistan would turn into a tourist haven. Jobs would be aplenty, the justice system would be overhauled, civil service officers appointed purely on merit, and the police system revamped. But the reality turned out starkly different.\nJust months after winning a bitterly disputed election, Khan's government requested the IMF for a loan. Critical dependency on the United States was traded for equal dependency upon China. Today, the Pakistani passport is no more desirable than before and the only foreign tourists are intrepid mountain climbers. In January 2022, Transparency International announced that perceptions of corruption had taken a quantum leap.\nHorse-trading politics got a boost once Khan decided that \"electable\" candidates would be preferred over principled candidates. Although he now admits \"mistakes\", the future may be no different. In a desperate move, the Punjab chief minister\u2014apparently chosen by his first lady and praised sky-high by Khan until two weeks ago\u2014has just been thrown under the bus. His replacement, handpicked by Khan himself, was once derided by Khan as a scumbag.\nTo save his sinking ship, Captain Khan has invented the cock-and-bull story of an American conspiracy to oust him. This, he said, owes to his independent stand on Ukraine. So why hasn't Narendra Modi\u2014also ambivalent on Russia's aggression\u2014alleged the same?\nWhat makes cults so attractive and cultists so impervious to factual evidence and reason? Why do so many people set aside good sense and worship leaders?\nAnthropologists have related the degree of cultic affiliation to the perceived uncertainty within an environment. For example, they find that rougher seas make fishermen engage in more elaborate magic rituals. Correspondingly, Pakistan's lack of a shared national purpose creates space for putschists and captains who promise to steer the ship of state out of stormy waters.\nMilitary interventions that debilitated democracy paved the way for fix-all miracle magic men like Imran Khan. The broken idols of other wannabe messiahs with fanatical followings litter the political landscape. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, Altaf Husain, and Maulana Fazlullah also had sophisticated urbanites among their followers. This happened even before the invention of social media, but technology has created virtually impenetrable silos of political groupthink.\nToday, one particular belief sits securely in a nuclear-protected bunker and may survive even the no-confidence vote. Common wisdom is that all opposition leaders are money-hungry cheats and Khan, even with his shortcomings, is clean as a whistle. Correct? After all, it is commonly held that all opposition politicians are venal, even if there is disagreement on which is the more corrupt one.\nImran Khan wins out on this. Chasing money is not his first priority. Of course, opponents do point to his magnificent Banigala palace, high-style living, minimal payment of personal taxes, and the doubts raised by the ECP regarding PTI's foreign funding. These are minor sins. But it is Khan's insatiable lust for power that makes him truly dangerous for this country. While money fattens individuals, absolute power brings catastrophe. Donald Trump wanted both money and power but Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot craved only the latter.\nHow will Khan rally his followers again? He has already revealed his strategy for the forthcoming elections: whip up xenophobic nationalism; mobilise the religious sentiment that he helped generate through encouraging TLP's anti-France anti-blasphemy agitations. Pro-Khan people are patriots, those against him are traitors, and fence sitters are, in his words, mere animals.\nWith Imran Khan voted out, Pakistan has won a temporary victory. However, its larger interest demands that all political parties obey rules and the Constitution. They must embrace democracy and pluralism, and cease pursuing narrow interests. Aggression and hate propagation, use of foul language, and denigration of women and religious minorities should have no role to play in politics.\n\u00a0\nThe article was first published in Dawn, an ANN partner of\u00a0 The Daily Star.\nPervez Hoodbhoy\u00a0is an Islamabad-based physicist and writer.\n",

        "full_article": "Life in Dhaka provides a thousand reasons to feel hopeless and frustrated. The air is getting increasingly unbreathable, the traffic jams are interminable, and if the rising numbers of cholera and diarrhoea patients are any indication, the water is also undrinkable. All of that and more make it so easy to forget that there are things that are getting better. Case in point: this is the first Ramadan since the start of the pandemic, that we won't be spending under a Covid-induced lockdown. And that's not nothing.\nOf course, things are getting hairy. The aforementioned traffic tailbacks are already the stuff of nightmares without bringing the pre-iftar rush into the equation. The inevitable price hikes that come with this season are walloping the wallets of anyone in and below the\u00a0middle-income bracket. The brief respite that parents of school-going children got, from easing their kids back into in-person classes, has once again turned into turmoil.\nEven so, we are now witness to the return of mass taraweeh gatherings, families can once again unite over iftar, and businesses that had taken a hit the past two years can think of rebuilding again. Even though the days have been hot and muggy, the evenings come with a temperate breeze to cool us down. Is that not a shining example of Rahmah?\nI don't consider myself very religious. I am what Almas Apa, a respected family friend, would call an \"out-of-practice Muslim.\" Even so, Ramadan holds a special place in my life. I was staring down the barrel of a dark depression back in 2016, when a spark of inspiration during the eve of the first day of Ramadan eventually led to an artistic breakthrough that would become the \"Sehri Tales,\" an annual creativity challenge participated in by thousands over the years, from around the world.\nThere is something to be said for the spiritual cleansing that comes from a month of prayers and fasting. The deeper you go into it, whether through namaz, or meditation and self-reflection, it forces you to still your mind. When you combine this with writing therapy, a tool used by mental health professionals to help their patients track their moods, boost productivity and articulate their feelings, you tap into hidden wells of inspiration, and might end up surprising yourself. I know I did, and if their testimonials are anything to go by, so have the participants of the annual \"Sehri Tales\" challenge.\nRamadan means a lot of different things to different people. The devout celebrate the deeper spiritual connection. Those on a journey of self-growth find it a good opportunity to develop some positive habits (prayers, charity, self-restraint) and to do away with some less desirable ones (substance abuse of varying degrees, for example). There will be roadblocks around the way. It isn't easy; it wasn't ever supposed to be, but every Ramadan is an opportunity to take stock of one's life and remember the blessings we are given.\nThe Ramadan of 2016 started with so much hope, but ended with the Holey Artisan attack. For the next few months, there was a shadow of fear over the city, which even crept up during Ramadan the following year, but eventually, we pulled through. The Ramadan of 2020 was unsettling and harrowing, with rising infection rates and the news full of frightening numbers. We have hopefully put that behind us, too.\u00a0\nAs we enter a brand new holy month, here's hoping we can take the opportunities that come with it, to make good choices\u2014whatever they may be.\n\u00a0\nSabrina Fatma Ahmad is a journalist, writer, and founder of Sehri Tales.\n",

        "full_article": "The draft Mass Media Employees (Services Conditions) Bill, placed in parliament on April 1, 2022, is a long-overdue initiative. Its stated objective and scope include relations between media employers and employees as well as dispute resolution, terms of employment including minimum salary, and legal protection of employees including work environment.\nThe draft contains a series of provisions intended to address some longstanding concerns of media professionals and stakeholders. For instance, the provisions for mandatory issuance of appointment letter, photo ID, and service book, fixation of minimum salary, benefits for in-service death, retirement, retrenchment, termination and dismissal, paid maternity leave, contributory provident fund (CPF), sick leave, rest and recreation leave, medical allowance, employees welfare association (EWA), etc.\u2014all are steps in the right direction. In many cases, however, there is scope for modifications so it can serve the objective better.\nOn the other hand, there are numerous seemingly discriminatory provisions that need closer scrutiny. The draft provides a minimum of 48 hours of work a week, whereas in other comparable countries, like India, it is no more than 144 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks. The provision for overtime has been made without specifying any limit or the basis of calculation of overtime payment. A Trustee Board of CPF will be formed with an equal number of representatives from employers and employees, whereas governance and management of such funds should be exclusively within the jurisdiction of employees.\nThe bill provides that a woman-friendly work environment shall be created, but it is left for the rules to be framed to determine how it will be ensured. It does not make any provision to ensure that work conditions, including salaries and benefits, are not discriminatory depending on gender, social, religious, ethnic, disability or any other marker of identity.\nThe retrenchment provision on the ground of excess staff can be arbitrarily used in the absence of specific criteria determining the credibility of said ground. The provision for dismissal on the ground of physical or mental infirmity based on a registered doctor's certificate can also be misused in the absence of a provision for veracity check. In case of termination of contract, no scope has been made for due process including right of self-defence.\nOwners and employees\u2014\"we\" vs \"they\"\nA blanket provision has been made that 10 or more employees can be wholesale terminated to maintain \"overall security and peace and order\", which can be widely and variedly interpreted. This may have a demoralising and intimidating effect on employees and may render the EWA practically dysfunctional.\nA key stated objective of the bill is to manage the relationship between \"mass media owners\" (malik) and employees and redress conflict between the two sides. The term malik represents an outdated and counterproductive \"we versus they\" approach to the relationship between employers and employees which breeds a mutual threat perception\u2014whereas, corporate good practice features a \"spirit of ownership\" mainstreamed across an organisation including employees of all levels and employers/investors. The bill can play a catalytic role in this mindset shift, and change the narrative accordingly.\nRisk of further government control\nThe draft represents an underlying agenda for legalising unwarranted governmental and administrative control of the mass media. The government has near-exclusive jurisdiction over the formation and composition of the Wage Board. International good practice shows wage boards composed of an equal number of representatives from employers and employees as well as a few independent individuals, whereas the draft bill provides only one employers' representative, three from employees, and two government officials. Moreover, all appointments including representatives of employers and employees and the unspecified number of additional members are left to the government's discretion.\nThe question is why the wage board of a private-sector industry like the media should be so much under government control, unless the underlying purpose is to ensure stricter and more targeted control of the media. While the draft obliges employers to pay at wage board rates, it does not make any provision for actions to be taken for non-compliance. This is important against a track record that only about a dozen out of the 150-plus media houses comply, and no action is taken for non-compliance. Unless rigorously enforced, the vast majority of the employees will continue to be deprived, while the non-compliant entities will carry on enjoying undue benefits of non-compliance protected by the inaction of the authorities, and the compliant ones will be further disadvantaged.\u00a0\nFor dispute resolution, an unwarranted idea of government-appointed Mass Media Court and Appeal Court has been invented, which appears to represent a design to further strangulate the media. Even for dispute resolution through bilateral negotiations, an unwarranted provision has been made to \"report to the government\". These are incompatible with international standards. The most relevant good practice is to repose this responsibility in the wage board like the usual industrial dispute investigation and settlement\u2014provided, of course, that the wage board is truly independent. In exceptional situations, if appeal becomes unavoidable, a Tribunal consisting of a judge of the High Court or above may be provided for.\nWork environment and legal protection\nAnother crucial objective of the bill\u2014to ensure a conducive work environment and legal protection of media professionals\u2014has been left totally untouched. Given that the media is expected to play a watchdog role for democracy and people's right to information, the employers and the government should consider any threat to the working conditions, security and safety of the employees as a threat to themselves. Accordingly, there should be specific provisions for a safe and enabling environment for the employees' professional work, including protection mechanisms and protocols to prevent and address risks such as surveillance, intimidation, attacks, arbitrary arrests, etc.\nThe bill should provide that media employees, particularly journalists, will have unrestricted access to all sources of information and the right to investigate as needed, and without impediment, as part of their professional duties.\nThe draft bill needs to be thoroughly overhauled so that it fits its stated purposes. It should be done through a participatory process involving media employees of various categories, employers, editors, media specialists and other stakeholders. The parliamentary committee has the jurisdiction and responsibility to take the lead. The media employers and employees should take their own initiatives proactively. Any failure to do so will be self-defeating.\n\u00a0\nDr Iftekharuzzaman\u00a0is Executive Director, Transparency International Bangladesh.\n",

        "full_article": "Another elected government in Pakistan has failed to finish its term. Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) was shown the door after he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament, having lost the support of its coalition partners earlier. It was predictable after the Supreme Court of Pakistan's landmark verdict that declared Khan's move to dissolve the parliament unconstitutional and compelled him to face the vote. His acceptance of the Supreme Court verdict as well as the result of the vote has put to rest any possibility of confrontation between the various state constituents that many in Pakistan feared.\nWe shall deliberately refrain from commenting on the whys and wherefores of the no-confidence motion and all the foreplay that preceded it, but suffice it to say that Khan's nearly four-year tenure delivered mixed results for the Pakistani people. What we would like, though, is to focus on the important features of the ouster of the Tehreek-e-Insaf that merit reflection on.\nThere are two very creditable aspects of note in the entire saga. Firstly, it is noteworthy that the country's constitution has been upheld. The credit for that goes to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which did its duty without fear or favour and played its part as the sole guardian of the constitution. It demonstrated the independence of the highest judiciary in the country. The second feature is the role the parliament played in stamping the supremacy of the legislature as the house of the people. Imran Khan lost the support of his party members, and they chose to vote against him. This is something that is not possible in most South Asian countries\u2014at least not in Bangladesh, where Article 70 of our constitution punishes floor-crossing with expulsion from the party.\nNow that an interim prime minister will take over and a fresh election is due to be held in August 2023, there are two paths forward for the erstwhile prime minister of Pakistan. One is to take the peaceful path to the next elections. The other is to take to the streets, which he has already hinted to, behooving the political culture of South Asian politics. We believe the latter will be a very ill-advised path to adopt. Given the economic crisis that Pakistan is in at the moment, the last thing it needs is a period of political unrest. It's time the political parties across the board sank their differences to retrieve the country from an economic turmoil.\n",

        "full_article": "The government's decision to have a special one-stop service (OSS) desk for women, children, disabled persons and the elderly at all police stations is, no doubt, praiseworthy. There are many circumstances where it's difficult for women and children\u2014for social, political or other reasons\u2014to talk about their problems with male police officers. In cases related to sexual violence, in particular, they often don't feel comfortable talking to male officers, and frequent incidents of our policemen mistreating and further harassing survivors of such crimes in the past have only made the situation worse. Fortunately, the special service desk, formally inaugurated by the prime minister on April 10, will be led by a female sub-inspector, who will have a handful of other policewomen working under her.\nSo far, the results from the special desk, which was launched on a pilot basis in January 2020, seems to be quite positive\u2014181,000 women, 32,286 children, 138,000 elderly people and 11,081 people with disabilities have received the service so far, according to data from the Police Headquarters (PHQ). In Narayanganj sadar model police station, 218 complaints were recorded at the desk. Encouragingly, 198 of those grievances were settled by holding meetings. That 90 percent of the cases were resolved in such a short time is a good sign, particularly given that many cases in our country involving women and children often progress extremely slowly. However, given the ground reality that, in many cases, police take the side of powerful parties and pressurise the victims to \"settle,\" we can only hope that the OSS desk will set a different example and truly resolve the cases with the best interests of the victims at heart.\nThe desk will also inform visitors about other government services and provide legal aid to victims who are not financially well-off. This, we believe, is very important. When it comes to many delicate cases involving women, children, disabled persons and the elderly, awareness of what facilities they are entitled to can provide them with the courage and essential support that reassure them to pursue justice. Police stations in our country are hardly ever welcoming towards victims\u2014especially of gender-based violence\u2014which discourages them from pursuing legal recourse. We hope this special desk will change that. It is imperative for those working at these desks to have a good understanding of how to handle sensitive cases; as such, there should be capacity-building and gender sensitivity training for all officers. Now that the OSS desks have proven to be somewhat successful, we hope that this initiative will be followed through and provided with the necessary support from the government, so that it doesn't fall by the wayside\u2014like so many good government initiatives regularly do.\n",
